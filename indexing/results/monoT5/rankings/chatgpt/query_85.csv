chatgpt_85,"Relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) is the most common type of multiple sclerosis (MS). It is characterized by unpredictable episodes of relapse (also known as exacerbations or attacks) followed by periods of remission or recovery. During a relapse, symptoms may worsen or new symptoms may develop, while during a remission period, the symptoms may improve or disappear completely.

Some of the common symptoms of RRMS include fatigue, numbness or tingling in the limbs, muscle weakness or spasticity, blurred vision, difficulty with coordination and balance, and cognitive problems such as memory loss and difficulty with decision-making.

Treatment for RRMS typically includes disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) that can slow down the progression of the disease and reduce the frequency and severity of relapses. Symptomatic treatments may also be used to manage specific symptoms. In addition, lifestyle changes such as regular exercise, healthy diet, and stress management techniques may also be helpful in managing RRMS.

It is important for people with RRMS to work closely with their healthcare providers to develop a personalized treatment plan that takes into account their unique symptoms and needs.",85,Relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis,-0.010848826728761196,0

This characteristics of this type of MS is discussed. MS: Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS) Menu In 1999, an international panel published a classification of multiple sclerosis (MS) that defined different forms of MS. One of these, the most common form, was relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). Relapsing-remitting MS is defined as MS in which patients have relapses of MS and periods of stability in between relapses. Relapses are episodes of new or worsening symptoms not caused by or infection and that last more than 48 hours. In other words, a stable course is punctuated by episodes of new or worse symptoms. Relapsing-remitting MS is the most common initial form of MS. Younger patients are more likely to have this form of MS than older patients. What are the symptoms of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis? The symptoms of RRMS vary widely. Frequent early symptoms include: No two patients have the same symptoms. Some people are sensitive to heat. Some people get a tingling feeling when they bend their neck forward (Lhermitte's symptom). Some patients will have problems with weakness or unsteadiness of walking. Some combination of symptoms is common, and symptoms may vary over time in an individual.

The illness is an example of a demyelinating disease, where the protective coating called myelin that surrounds nerve fibres becomes damaged. Integrin b3 and ACE2 linked by short linear motifs enabling endocytosis and autophagy of SARS-CoV-2 Study finds higher suicide rate among people with neurological disorders Drug prices beat inflation all the way even with discounts Multiple sclerosis follows a different course in every individual but there are three main ways in which the disease can progress depending on which form of the illness a patient has. Around 80% of all individuals with multiple sclerosis have the relapsing remitting form of the disease. These individuals have periods where their symptoms are mild or absent (remission), followed by periods of symptom relapse. Symptoms may occur suddenly and in acute bouts or exacerbations. During these periods of relapse, symptoms may become worse each time and the relapsing remitting form of this condition may eventually progress to secondary progressive multiple sclerosis, where there are few or no periods of remission. Relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis may be diagnosed when two episodes of relapse are separated by more than 30 days or there has only been one relapse but there is MRI evidence of newly scarred or damaged myelin three months later. Patients with this form of multiple sclerosis often experience phases of relapse followed by remission at first, but this later gives way to progressive disease, characterized by worsening symptoms and few or no periods of remission. The least common form of multiple sclerosis is the primary progressive form which occurs in about 10% to 15% of all cases and usually in people aged over 40 years. In this form of the condition, symptoms get worse over time rather than occurring in bouts or as sudden attacks. Primary progressive multiple sclerosis may be diagnosed if there have been no previous symptoms of relapse but the patient has become increasingly disabled over a period of at least one year. http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Multiple-sclerosis/Pages/Causes.aspx www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/tutorials/multiplesclerosis/nr229105.pdf http://www.who.int/mental_health/neurology/Atlas_MS_WEB.pdf http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/live/10930/29202/29202.pdf Last Updated: Aug 23, 2018 Dr. Ananya Mandal is a doctor by profession, lecturer by vocation and a medical writer by passion.

8b8a978b-e069-49e5-b5ac-70f51cf6fa42,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a potentially disabling disease of the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system). In , the immune system attacks the protective sheath (myelin) that covers nerve fibers and causes communication problems between your brain and the rest of your body. Eventually, the disease can cause permanent damage or deterioration of the nerves. Signs and symptoms of vary widely and depend on the amount of nerve damage and which nerves are affected. Some people with severe may lose the ability to walk independently or at all, while others may experience long periods of remission without any new symptoms. There's no cure for multiple sclerosis. However, treatments can help speed recovery from attacks, modify the course of the disease and manage symptoms. Multiple sclerosis signs and symptoms may differ greatly from person to person and over the course of the disease depending on the location of affected nerve fibers. Symptoms often affect movement, such as: Numbness or weakness in one or more limbs that typically occurs on one side of your body at a time, or your legs and trunk Electric-shock sensations that occur with certain neck movements, especially bending the neck forward (Lhermitte sign) Partial or complete loss of vision, usually in one eye at a time, often with pain during eye movement See a doctor if you experience any of the above symptoms for unknown reasons. Most people with have a relapsing-remitting disease course. They experience periods of new symptoms or relapses that develop over days or weeks and usually improve partially or completely. These relapses are followed by quiet periods of disease remission that can last months or even years. Small increases in body temperature can temporarily worsen signs and symptoms of , but these aren't considered true disease relapses. At least 50% of those with relapsing-remitting eventually develop a steady progression of symptoms, with or without periods of remission, within 10 to 20 years from disease onset. This is known as secondary-progressive . The worsening of symptoms usually includes problems with mobility and gait. The rate of disease progression varies greatly among people with secondary-progressive . Some people with experience a gradual onset and steady progression of signs and symptoms without any relapses, known as primary-progressive . The cause of multiple sclerosis is unknown. It's considered an autoimmune disease in which the body's immune system attacks its own tissues. In the case of , this immune system malfunction destroys the fatty substance that coats and protects nerve fibers in the brain and spinal cord (myelin). Myelin can be compared to the insulation coating on electrical wires. When the protective myelin is damaged and the nerve fiber is exposed, the messages that travel along that nerve fiber may be slowed or blocked. It isn't clear why develops in some people and not others. A combination of genetics and environmental factors appears to be responsible. These factors may increase your risk of developing multiple sclerosis: can occur at any age, but onset usually occurs around 20 and 40 years of age. However, younger and older people can be affected.

bd20bf11-33b2-4bb1-89c0-958003dffffd,"— The activity of the Epstein-Barr virus in the body syncs up to relapses in patients with RRMS. In a new published on April 11, investigators in Italy found that, in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), the immune response to the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) appeared to cycle simultaneously with their disease activity, meaning that when the virus was active, so was their MS. The study, conducted by investigators at the Santa Lucia Foundation in Rome, Italy examined cytotoxic (CD8+) T-cells, which are cells that kill infected or abnormal cells in the body. They found an increased response to the antigens produced by active EBV in the blood of MS patients during relapses, as compared with samples taken during periods of remission. Antigens are substances that the body sees as foreign or harmful—including toxins from viruses like Epstein-Barr—and deploys an immune response to find and kill. EBV is a member of the herpesvirus family and, according to the (NIH), nearly 95 percent of all people between the ages of 35 and 40 have been infected by it. EBV is responsible for the viral infection known as mononucleosis (or “mono”). EBV only results in mono in 35 to 50 percent of patients, while others never show any outward signs that they’ve been infected. Although the symptoms of mono, which include a fever, sore throat, and swollen lymph glands, eventually go away, EBV takes up a permanent residence in certain cells in the immune system where it lies dormant for years. For people who suffer from RRMS, the cycles of disease activity can be as varied and irregular as the symptoms they produce. Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system, including the brain and spinal cord. The immune system attacks the myelin, or protective covering, of nerve cells in the brain, causing electrical “shorts” in the signaling pathways. This can result in symptoms ranging from mild numbness to blindness or complete paralysis. In the relapsing-remitting form of MS, these attacks can last from a few days to several months. The flare-ups are followed by periods of remission where there is a lessening of disease activity. More than 400,000 people have been diagnosed with MS in the United States, and more than 1.2 million worldwide. According to the , about 80 to 85 percent of MS patients are initially diagnosed with relapsing-remitting MS. In the study, investigators followed 113 patients with RRMS and 49 healthy control subjects over the course of four years, analyzing their blood in order to track their levels of CD8+ T-cell activity and map it to their MS disease cycles. Of the RRMS patients, 79 were on no disease modifying therapy, 20 were on Interferon Beta 1a, and 14 were on natalizumab, which is sold as Tysabri. Patients experiencing a relapse of their MS, verified by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the brain, also showed elevated EBV activity as measured by the presence of the CD8+ T-cells. The researchers also studied the brain tissue of five MS patients who had donated their bodies to science. They found an interaction between an active EBV-specific protein and CD8+ T-cells in MS lesions in the brains of those patients at the time of their deaths. The role of EBV as a potential trigger for multiple sclerosis has long been debated. Whether it—or any virus—directly causes the disease or creates a “perfect storm” situation whereby the immune system, in trying to eradicate the virus, goes haywire and mistakes myelin proteins as the enemy, is unclear. According to Dr. Steven Jacobson, Chief of the Viral Immunology Section at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, it’s important to note that “While EBV may be one of the triggers in MS…what triggers reactivation in one person may not in another.” He told Healthline that MS is not a disease with a single, defined, viral trigger like AIDS, for example, which is triggered by the HIV virus.“The results [of this study] do not answer the question of whether EBV dysregulation is a consequence or cause of MS,” said Dr. Tom Ech, Program Officer of the Autoimmunity and Mucosal Immunology branch of the NIH in an interview with Healthline, “but suggest a link between EBV reactivation, antiviral immune response and disease activity during the relapsing-remitting stage of MS.”The results of this study suggest that the ebb and flow of EBV as it cycles between dormant and active phases could set the stage for the reactivation of MS. This has led to the hypothesis that RRMS could be controlled with antiviral drugs that keep EBV in check. However, many more studies will be required to prove or disprove this theory. “What this group [of researchers] has shown is that further studies need to be done with antiviral drugs,” said Jacobson, who has been studying viruses and MS for more than 30 years at the NIH. “In fact, the ‘interfere’ part of the name ‘interferon’ [used to treat RRMS] stands for the drug’s ability to interfere with viral replication within cells. This also raises the question of whether this classic therapy for MS could be used as an antiviral drug.” Although there is currently no vaccine for the Epstein-Barr virus, researchers are working diligently to develop one. Australian scientists at the Queensland Institute of Medical Research have conducted the first human trial of an . The study was small, but it demonstrated human tolerance for the vaccine and the study subjects did not develop mono.Although this newest study does provide a tantalizing glimpse into possible interactions between the immune system and viruses, it doesn’t prove that EBV is a viral trigger for MS. It’s not a “smoking gun,” but rather another piece of the overall puzzle in what is a complex disease process. Jacobson said that the US government, through the NIH, has been devoting more funding to MS research than ever before, including partially funding this study, as well as others involving therapies now on the market. There are medication on the market now to help control MS symptoms, but the ultimate goal is to stop it in its tracks. “While we are able to suppress the disease activity [with the current therapies],” said Jacobson, “the key is to stop degeneration.” — Promising Treatments and Clinical Trials for Relapsing-Remitting MS Could an Undiagnosed Sleep Disorder be Causing Your MS Fatigue?

146e4df7-ec0d-4b9e-9b4b-b034db97890e,"Think of Multiple Sclerosis as a Leaking Swimming Pool [Video] A new way of looking at the neurodegenerative disorder could lead to more and better treatments For 20 years neurologists have divided the neurological disorder multiple sclerosis (MS) into four distinct categories—subtypes that are supposed, in part, to help patients get the right treatments. But a new theory erases the distinctions between these groups and suggests that MS is a single disease after all. The idea was developed by Stephen Krieger, a neurologist at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City, and presented in late April at the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) annual meeting in Washington, D.C. If the theory holds up, it could lead to more effective management for a wider range of patients. In MS the body produces antibodies that attack the central nervous system, i.e. the brain and spinal cord. Specifically these antibodies ravage myelin, a fatty substance that insulates neurons, allowing them to conduct electricity. The nerves develop scars or sclerotic lesions (sclerosis is Greek for hard) in the aftermath of such attacks. As a result, patients can suffer from weakness, pain and walking difficulties—not to mention vision loss and a host of undesirable bowel, bladder and psychiatric ills. The current classification system arose as a way to describe the various ways MS symptoms tend to unfold. The most common type of MS is called relapsing-remitting disease; patients experience flare-ups—in which, for example, they suddenly lose vision in one eye—followed by periods of neurologic normalcy. Presumably their immune system has gone into overdrive when the flare-ups occur and then the activity subsides for months or even years. Less common are primary and secondary progressive MS. In the former, symptoms progress from the get-go and never remit; in the latter, patients first experience relapses and remissions but then progress to continuously worsening symptoms. Finally there’s progressive-relapsing MS in which patients experience continuously progressive disease on top of which more severe exacerbations occur. Krieger’s hypothesis is a metaphoric reunion of these four otherwise separate divisions of disease—one that can perhaps best be explained by analogy with a swimming pool in need of repair. Imagine a pool with mountains rising up from the bottom. The mountains represent scars in the central nervous system; the water surface is the threshold at which symptoms appear. Lesions below the water line do not cause symptoms whereas those jutting out of the water do. The water surface can also be seen as the body's neurologic reserve capacity. Our brains are astoundingly resilient: If one part of the brain is injured, neighboring neurons can step in and take over. But according to Krieger, as we age and as MS progresses, not only does the scarring worsen (that is, the mountains grow higher), the brain also loses its ability to compensate for injured tissue—meaning water starts draining out of the pool and more lesions and resulting symptoms become apparent. Krieger calls his view of MS the topographical model (referring to the mountains jutting out of the water). He believes his concept unites the MS categories and demonstrates the relationship between relapsing and progressive disease. Relapsing-remitting patients have mountains that temporarily rise above the waterline but then sink again. In those with the other three forms of MS—the more consistently progressive forms—the mountains emerge above the surface but never recede and the symptoms never go away. If Krieger’s hypothesis is correct, the four MS divisions could be reenvisioned as different stages or different expressions of the same disease. It’s not that the disease completely goes away during ‘remission,’ Krieger explains. ""We can see old lesions there on MRI the whole time."" But the brain’s ability to compensate for the effects of the lesions declines. In other words, after the immune system’s assault has waned and a patient with relapsing-remitting disease is symptom-free, some of the neurons are nonetheless still scarred. The nervous system, however, is somehow able to compensate—until one day it cannot and the disease is considered progressive. This could explain why many patients look and feel better than their brain scans would suggest; and also why some patients, in Krieger’s words, catch up to their MRI."" Krieger acknowledges that the existing categories—incidentally developed by his mentor, Fred Lublin, director of the Center for Multiple Sclerosis at Mount Sinai Medical Center—have been incredibly helpful in MS care. He just feels they need to be appreciated collectively. ""Neurologists find that it’s very hard to apply the current categories to individual patients,"" he says. ""We’ve shown that diagnostically we don’t really know when someone goes from relapsing-remitting MS to progressive MS. And often times when we think someone has a progressive form of MS, they stay stable for years and don’t actually progress."" Although this new model is in its infancy, it is quickly turning heads among MS experts. In an e-mail, Lawrence Steinman, professor of neurology, pediatrics and genetics at Stanford University, wrote, ""at first glance, it looks quite exciting in the way it integrates visually the ‘topographical’ distribution of lesions and the relapses they cause; relapse frequency, severity and recovery; and progression rate."" It looks quite ""promising,"" Lublin wrote. ""The model provides an individual dynamic to the MS disease courses that we’ve described. It has potential usefulness for practitioners and for enhancing patient understanding of the illness."" The idea that MS is caused not only by worsening immune activity but also by declining general brain health opens new therapeutic possibilities. ""We can think of our medicines as working on the floor of the pool, Krieger says. ""They prevent lesions But I don’t think they affect the decline of reserve. People with MS can stay neurologically well for a long time with their disease below the surface."" A two-pronged attack that aims to boost brain health as well as prevent lesions would be ideal. Data from some studies suggest that approach may already possible. Exercise has been shown to prevent the degeneration of brain tissue in patients with MS whereas smoking and diets low in antioxidants are associated with a worsening of the disease. Also beyond just targeting aberrant immune activity, drug companies could pursue compounds that increase the brain’s ability to compensate. In fact, a separate study of 154 people presented at the AAN meeting showed that large doses of the vitamin biotin (found in a range of foods from grains to meats to vegetables) reduced disability in patients with MS, possibly by helping to preserve myelin. A drug that helps regenerate myelin might also be on the way. Early data on an antibody called BIIB033, which was also presented at the conference, suggest it improves electrical conduction in the optic nerves of MS patients, possibly by improving the function of oligodendrocytes, the cells that produce myelin. According to developer Biogen, this is the first evidence of remyelination occurring with a drug therapy. A means to repair myelin would go far to increase brain and nervous system resiliency in MS patients. In the meantime, if Krieger’s idea catches on, it could have more immediate influence on diagnosis and patient care. Most research into MS treatments has focused on the relapsing-remitting subtype; treatment options for those with progressive MS are few and far between and primarily off-label, meaning they’re not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. If MS comes to be thought of as a single disorder, it could encourage clinicians to consider using treatments that they had previously reserved just for relapsing-remitting disease to the other subtypes as well. It could also help distinguish between a true relapse and a temporary decline in neurologic function that briefly renders lesions symptomatic, like, say, when a patient has the flu. When the brain is fatigued for whatever reason—infection, fever, stress—its resiliency can wane and cause MS symptoms to emerge. But according to Krieger’s new model, this might not represent a true relapse but rather a temporary leak in the pool.

In multiple sclerosis (MS), the central nervous system, which includes the brain and spinal cord, becomes damaged. MS causes the immune system to attack the myelin, which is the insulation protecting the nerves. The nerves themselves can also be damaged. When myelin or the nerves become damaged, nerves cannot properly pass along their signals. The damaging process forms scar tissue called sclerosis, which gives the disease its name of multiple sclerosis.  Different types of MS affect people in different ways. One type is called relapsing-remitting MS. With this type, you have flare-ups of the disease, or relapses. Between these flare-ups, you have periods of recovery, or remissions. Most people diagnosed with MS start off with the relapsing-remitting type. In most cases, the course of the disease changes after a few decades and is then likely to become steadily worse. MS most often develops in people in their 20s and 30s. Women are twice as likely to have MS as men. Multiple sclerosis occurs when your body’s immune system attacks the central nervous system, damaging the myelin that protects nerve fibers. Experts believe that environmental factors trigger the disease in people whose genetics make them susceptible to MS. Scientists think MS may be caused by an infection that lays dormant in the body such as Epstein-Barr Virus (the virus that causes infectious mononucleosis) Scientists also think there may be a genetic susceptibility for some people Relapsing-remitting MS is marked by relapses that last at least 24 hours. During a relapse, symptoms get worse. A relapse will be followed by a remission. During a remission, symptoms partly or completely go away. Healthcare providers use many tests to help diagnose MS. Your healthcare provider will ask you questions about your symptoms. It's important to rule out other diseases that can cause similar symptoms. Your healthcare provider will also check to see how well your vision, your sense of balance, and other functions are working. You will need an MRI scan of your brain and spine. This may find areas of damage in your brain or spinal cord that suggest you may have MS. Another possible test measures what’s called visual evoked potentials. Painless electrodes placed on your scalp measure how your brain responds to things you see. Your healthcare provider may want to check your blood for other signs of disease. He or she may also order a test called a spinal tap (also called a lumbar puncture) to look at a sample of your spinal fluid. MS is not considered curable, but different types of medicine are available to decrease inflammation and slow down the progression of the disease. These medicines include:  Other medicines can be prescribed to treat: Your healthcare provider may also suggest steroids to reduce symptoms during flare-ups. If steroids are not effective your healthcare provider may recommend plasmapheresis, a blood cleansing procedure. What are the complications of relapsing-remitting MS? In most cases, relapsing-remitting MS is mild, although you may need to use a cane or other mobility device. In some cases, the disease is severe and causes the inability to care for yourself. Seldom does it cause death. If you have relapsing-remitting MS, you can take steps to manage your condition. Eat a diet low in saturated fat and trans-fat. Eat more foods with healthy omega-3 fatty acids because these nutrients are believed to fight inflammation. Avoid situations that cause you to become overheated. Get a moderate amount of exercise and enough sleep. Multiple sclerosis affects young people in their 20’s and 30’s. Although there is no cure, medicines can help you manage your symptoms. Adopting a healthy life-style can also help you manage your disease. Avoiding overheating or other triggers can prevent flares of MS. Tips to help you get the most from a visit to your healthcare provider: Know the reason for your visit and what you want to happen. Before your visit, write down questions you want answered. Bring someone with you to help you ask questions and remember what your provider tells you. At the visit, write down the name of a new diagnosis, and any new medicines, treatments, or tests. Also write down any new instructions your provider gives you. Know why a new medicine or treatment is prescribed, and how it will help you. Also know what the side effects are. Ask if your condition can be treated in other ways. Know why a test or procedure is recommended and what the results could mean. Know what to expect if you do not take the medicine or have the test or procedure. If you have a follow-up appointment, write down the date, time, and purpose for that visit. Know how you can contact your provider if you have questions.",85,Relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis,-0.040723301470279694,6

Approximately 250,000 to 350,000 people have been diagnosed with M.S. in the United States (Schoenstadt, 2006). Every week, 200 new people are diagnosed with M.S. in our country (National MS Society, n.d.). M.S. can affect each person differently. Damage to the myelin in the Central Nervous System and nerve fibers disturb the signals sent between the brain and spinal cord to other parts of the body causing the primary symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis (National MS Society, n.d.)Symptoms can come and go without any warning. An idea on how to help people suffering from M.S. is to have a dietitian either come to an M.S. housing building or support group, and introduce a healthy, nutritious diet that will help decrease the symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis. There are many diets out there that can help reduce symptoms and weight. Using a dietitian to introduce a healthy diet to those with M.S. can be very beneficial because it can decrease their pain and exacerbations, and improve the quality of their lives. There are four different types of M.S. that people can have. They are relapsing- remitting (RRMS), secondary progressive (SPMS), primary progressive (PPMS) and progressive-relapsing Multiple Sclerosis (PRMS) (National MS Society, n.d.). RRMS is when patients have relapses followed by periods of recovery (Mayo Clinic, 2012). SPMS occurs when there are relapses and partial recoveries, but the disability progressively gets worse until a steady progression of disability replaces cycles of exacerbations (Mayo Clinic, 2012). PPMS is when the disease progresses slowly and steadily from start with no periods of remissions (Mayo Clinic, 2012). Finally, PRMS is a rare type of M.S. where people experience both steadily worsening symptoms and attacks during times of remission (Mayo Clinic, 2012). To people who have Multiple Sclerosis, being diagnosed with any one of these types can be depressing. People with Multiple Sclerosis often suffer with extreme pain. My Mom has been living with M.S. for over 15 years now and she struggles with severe back pain every day. She is currently seeing a pain management doctor to help relieve some of her pain. M.S. patients can have pain in two different areas, which are neuropathic and musculoskeletal. Neuropathic pain is caused by the disruption in how the nerves carry messages within the brain and spinal cord (Multiple Sclerosis Trust, 2012).Musculoskeletal pain is from damage to muscles, tendons, ligaments, and soft tissue (Multiple Sclerosis Trust, 2012).Even with the use of pain medication, the pain associated with M.S. can be very hard to deal with. There are certain foods that can reduce inflammation and pain in people who have M.S. Anything that can lessen or stop the use of pain medication would be valuable to patients. Multiple Sclerosis affects a person’s brain and spinal cord causing a variety of troubling symptoms. The most common symptoms of M.S. are pain, fatigue, numbness, poor motor skills and vision problems. There are also many other symptoms that can trouble those who suffer from M.S. Other common symptoms are trouble walking, bladder, bowel dysfunction, dizziness, depression, and spasticity. Through diet and exercise, people with M.S. can improve some of those problems and lead a healthier, more productive life. A dietitian can help them focus on the foods and exercises that will eliminate or reduce the symptoms that bother them the most. M.S. patients struggle their whole lives dealing with exacerbations. They never know when one will come and how long it will last for. During an exacerbation, a lot of different problems can occur. An exacerbation is a relapse or flare up of Multiple Sclerosis symptoms. It can bring on new symptoms or... References: Gandy, J. Journal of Human Nutrition and Dietetics. (Feb 2007). 20 (1), 1.

This disease starts as an auto-immune disease in which CD4 T cells cross the blood brain barrier and attack myelin sheaths of olygodendrocytes resulting in demyelination (Gandhi et al., 2010; Lund et al., 2013). Initially this is a transient process and re-myelination occurs, so initial stage of the disease is characterized by neurological dysfunctions that eventually recover. However this re-myelination is not permanent (Compston and Coles, 2008; Wakerley et al., 2012). The continuous immune attacks cause serious pathological changes of myelin sheaths hence disease progression and development of serious disabilities . (Makris et al., 2013; Wakerley et al., 2012; Hafler, 2004; Nylander and Hafler, 2012; Eshaghi et al., 2013). Peak age of the initial diagnosis of MS is 30 and the disease progress overtime causing a in decline in health and even mortality (Makris et al., 2013). Though it is subjective the average decrease in life expectancy of a patient with MS is 5 to 10 years after the disease is being diagnosed (Keegan and Noseworthy, 2002). Disabilities caused by the disease vary between patients and depend on the abnormalities of the neuronal track that is affected (Leray et al., 2010). Some disabilities include numbness, muscle...

MS affects approximately 400,000 people in the United States alone. The onset of MS is usually between 20 and 40 years of age and is more common in women; men may have a more severe progressive course (Luzzio, 2013). Life expectancy is shortened in persons with MS, and the survival rate is linked to disability. Death usually results from secondary complications but can also be due to primary complications unrelated to MS. The occurrence rate of MS is affected by gene-environment interactions in susceptible individuals (Huether & McCance, 2012). Definition of Disorder is a progressive, inflammatory, demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system (CNS), which can affect the peripheral nervous system (PNS) as well. This disorder affects movements, sensation, and bodily functions (National Society [NMSS], 2012). There are several types of MS, these include: mixed (general), spinal, and cerebellar. General MS affects both the CNS and PNS, while spinal and cerebellar affect the CNS.

It is known as an autoimmune disease, Where the body’s immune system turns against the body and destroys the protective covering that surrounds nerve cells. This damage to the nerve cells causes many problems for the patient including weakness, muscle stiffness, poor coordination and balance, tingling, numbness, tremors, blurred vision, slurred speech, and memory and concentration problems (Bren) There are three different versions of (“What is MS?”). The least severe being relapsing-remitting; this occurs when a person has an attack and then there are no further symptoms until there is a relapse or another flare up of the disease (Bren). The next kind is called primary progressive; this is where the disease and the symptoms just worsen with time, each attack building on the previous (Bren). The final type is secondary progressive and this is a combination of relapsing-remitting first which eventually will become progressive (Bren).

The study is recruiting at 24 centers in the United States and United Kingdom. One strategy is an “escalation” approach, in which individuals start taking a less-powerful therapy with the option of switching to a more potent one if disease activity continues. The other strategy involves starting with a strong therapy that is potentially more effective, but also carries greater risk for significant adverse effects. The “Determining the Effectiveness of Early Intensive versus Escalation Approaches for the Treatment of Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis” (DELIVER-MS) Trial is funded by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI).   DETAILS :  People with relapsing-remitting MS and neurologists are currently faced with the dilemma of adopting one of two treatment approaches: an escalation approach, starting a disease-modifying therapy that is considered safe but with a modest likelihood to control the disease activity, and escalating to more potent therapies in the face of continued disease activity; or an approach, which, in contrast, involves giving a high-efficacy therapy, with the rare potential for significant adverse effects, as the first-line treatment. Despite significant interest from both patients and care providers on this topic, there is currently no evidence comparing these two approaches in a head-to-head trial.   The DELIVER-MS Trial is one of two studies funded by PCORI that will help inform treatment decisions around whether, and which, people with MS would most benefit from early, possibly more risky aggressive therapy. The other study is “TRaditional versus Early Aggressive Therapy for Multiple Sclerosis” (). Both studies are recruiting participants.   : Investigators are seeking participants diagnosed with relapsing-remitting MS who are between the ages of 18 and 60 years. Participants are eligible if they have had MS for five years or less, and have never been treated with an MS disease-modifying therapy. Further enrollment criteria are available from the contact below.   Eligible participants will be randomly assigned into one of two groups, and will choose along with their neurology provider among options in either a first-line or higher-efficacy therapy group. Participants and their neurology specialist will choose the therapy within the category that is most appropriate for them. During the three years that they are enrolled in the study, participants will have regular check-ups and MRI scans with their MS team, to look at the effects of treatment. They will be free to change treatment, in discussion with their neurologist, for any reason at any time.   The primary outcome being measured is the effect of treatment on brain tissue loss. Investigators will also monitor treatment effects on disability progression as measured by the EDSS scale, quality of life, other imaging measures, and safety.   : To learn more about the enrollment criteria for this study, and to find out if you are eligible to participate, please visit the study website, , and you will be connected with a participating site in your area.   The following sites are enrolling in the United States: Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH Cleveland Clinic-Las Vegas, NV Ohio Health, Columbus, OH Anschutz Medical Campus, University of Colorado, Aurora, CO University of Rochester, Rochester, NY University of Texas, Houston, TX University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI   Download a brochure that discusses issues to think about when considering enrolling in an MS clinical trial (PDF).   Without participants in research studies, MS research would come to a standstill. .

52ee53a3-8594-49af-87b7-a97ca037cdde,"ANMAT approves Genzyme’s Lemtrada for treatment of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis Genzyme, a Sanofi company (EURONEXT:SAN and NYSE:SNY), announced today that Argentina's National Administration of Drugs, Food and Medical Technology (ANMAT) has approved Lemtrada (alemtuzumab) for adult patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) with active disease defined by clinical or imaging features. ""The Lemtrada clinical trial data demonstrating the treatment's positive impact on relapse rates and disability progression support its potential as a transformational new treatment for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis,"" said Norma Deri, M.D., Hosptial Fernandez, Buenos Aires, Argentina. ""The approval of Lemtrada is good news for people living with active MS, who are in need of additional treatment options that may offer greater ."" Lemtrada is supported by a comprehensive and extensive clinical development program that involved nearly 1,500 patients and 5,400 patient-years of follow-up. In addition to Argentina, Lemtrada is approved in the European Union, Australia, Canada, Mexico, Brazil and Guatemala. Lemtrada is currently not approved in the United States. Genzyme recently announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted for review the company's resubmission of its application seeking approval of Lemtrada. Genzyme expects FDA action on the application in the fourth quarter. More than 2.3 million people worldwide have been diagnosed with MS, including approximately 8,000 people in Argentina. Lemtrada 12 mg has a novel dosing and administration schedule of two annual treatment courses. The first treatment course of Lemtrada is administered via intravenous infusion on five consecutive days, and the second course is administered on three consecutive days, 12 months later. New therapy may help treat or prevent multiple sclerosis Gene therapy can effectively treat mice with tuberous sclerosis complex, shows study Novel compound appears to protect myelin and nerve fibers ""We are pleased by the continued global support for Lemtrada,"" said Genzyme President and CEO, David Meeker. ""We are launching the treatment in more than 30 countries this year, and look forward to additional approvals where Lemtrada is still under review."" The Lemtrada clinical development program included two randomized Phase III studies comparing treatment with Lemtrada to high-dose subcutaneous interferon beta-1a (Rebif) in patients with RRMS who had active disease and were either new to treatment (CARE-MS I) or who had relapsed while on prior therapy (CARE-MS II), as well as an ongoing extension study. In CARE-MS I, Lemtrada was significantly more effective than interferon beta-1a at reducing annualized relapse rates; the difference observed in slowing disability progression did not reach statistical significance. In CARE-MS II, Lemtrada was significantly more effective than interferon beta-1a at reducing annualized relapse rates, and accumulation of disability was significantly slowed in patients given Lemtrada vs. interferon beta-1a. The most common side effects of Lemtrada are infusion associated reactions (headache, rash, pyrexia, nausea, fatigue, urticaria, insomnia, pruritus, diarrhea, chills, dizziness, and flushing), infections (upper respiratory tract and urinary tract), and lymphopenia. Autoimmune conditions (including immune thrombocytopenia, other cytopenias, glomerulonephritis and thyroid disease) and serious infections can occur in patients receiving Lemtrada. A comprehensive risk management program incorporating education and monitoring will support early detection and management of these identified risks.

2ff79889-eab0-4b19-97b8-7216d3066379,"— Three new drug approvals, vaccination guidelines, and more by Multiple sclerosis (MS) news in 2019 focused largely on drugs -- new drugs, old drugs, drug costs, and treatment strategies -- but new vaccination guidelines and biomarker research also earned headlines. The FDA approved three new MS drugs in 2019, most recently (Vumerity), a new oral fumarate drug to treat relapsing forms of MS. Like dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera), which was approved in 2013 for relapsing MS, diroximel fumarate is designed to convert to monomethyl fumarate in the body, but appears to produce fewer gastrointestinal side effects than the older drug. Diroximel fumarate relied in part on dimethyl fumarate's safety and efficacy data and findings from the ongoing, open-label phase III study to win FDA approval. Two other MS drugs earned OKs this year, the first being (Mayzent) for adult patients with relapsing forms of MS, including clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting disease, and active secondary progressive disease. The drug was the first oral agent for secondary progressive MS (SPMS) with active disease and the first treatment specifically approved for patients with active SPMS in over 15 years. The FDA based its decision on the phase III trial results, which demonstrated that patients with SPMS had 21% lower risk in time to 3-month confirmed disability progression with siponimod than with placebo. The other FDA nod went to (Mavenclad), also for active secondary progressive disease and relapsing MS, based on results of the phase III clinical trial. In that study, cladribine (also a chemotherapy drug) significantly decreased the number of MS relapses and reduced the progression of disability versus placebo. The drug had a to its ultimate approval. The anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (Arzerra) -- approved for chronic lymphocytic leukemia but investigational for MS -- outperformed teriflunomide (Aubagio) in reducing annualized relapse rate (ARR), according to two phase III studies presented at the 2019 European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS) congress in September. In the ASCLEPIOS I trial, monthly injections of ofatumumab led to a 50.5% relative reduction in ARR compared with oral teriflunomide; in ASCLEPIOS II, the ARR with ofatumumab bested that of teriflunomide by 58.5%. Like ocrelizumab (Ocrevus), which was approved in 2017 for relapsing and primary progressive MS, and rituximab (Rituxan), which is used off-label in MS, ofatumumab depletes B cells; but unlike those drugs, ofatumumab can be self-injected. Also reported at ECTRIMS were new findings about , an investigational selective sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1P1) modulator, which outperformed teriflunomide in a head-to-head trial of adult relapsing MS patients. In the OPTIMUM phase III trial, oral ponesimod reduced ARR by 30.5% versus teriflunomide over about two years. The trial aimed to place ponesimod within the spectrum of the oral MS drugs, ""which are getting to be, more and more, the standard treatment,"" OPTIMUM researcher Ludwig Kappos, MD, of University Hospital of Basel in Switzerland, told Ocrelizumab showed real-world safety and effectiveness in data presented at the Americas Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ACTRIMS) forum in March. In a prospective study of patients who started treatment in 2017, ocrelizumab showed fewer adverse events than expected in six months of clinical practice. Also at ACTRIMS, an extension study of patients from the CARE-MS II trial showed that over eight years, alemtuzumab (Lemtrada) continued to show benefits in clinical outcomes, lesion load, and brain volume loss in relapsing-remitting MS. Interim data from the real-world ESTEEM study presented at the Consortium of Multiple Sclerosis Centers (CMSC) annual meeting in June showed that dimethyl fumarate was effective and safe for black patients with relapsing-remitting MS. And in the phase IIIb ASSESS trial, also presented at CMSC, fingolimod (Gilenya) bested glatiramer acetate (Copaxone) at lowering relapses and disease activity in relapsing-remitting MS patients. A trial published in January showed that, in patients with highly active relapsing-remitting MS, than disease-modifying therapies (DMTs), though ocrelizumab and alemtuzumab were not included in the study. Also in January were the results of a three-cohort study that showed that patients treated initially with fingolimod, natalizumab (Tysabri), or alemtuzumab had a lower risk of converting to secondary progressive MS than patients who started with glatiramer acetate or interferon beta (Rebif). ""The ditherers must take note,"" wrote editorialist Ari Green, MD, of the University of California San Francisco: ""The signs are strongly pointing to the to forestall damage. Waiting on the sidelines does not appear justified."" In real-life settings, an observational study in Wales found that starting produced better long-term outcomes. And higher-efficacy infusible therapies had a disproportionately larger effect in patients, a chart review of 1,000 patients at University of Colorado in Aurora presented at ECTRIMS suggested. At ACTRIMS, a small study looked at patients with and found they had similar times to relapses, inflammatory events, and disability progression as stable patients who remained on treatment. ""This data suggest that younger age goes along with more inflammatory disease activity and that is the critical group that needs to be treated with DMTs,"" said author Tanuja Chitnis, MD, of Brigham and Women's Hospital, in an interview with ""And potentially after the age of 45 or 50, in stable patients, there may be opportunities to stop or step down DMTs."" Biomarkers that predicted long-term MS outcomes also racked up headlines. At ECTRIMS, researchers showed that levels of serum neurofilament light (NfL) increased six years before the clinical onset of MS. Research presented at ACTRIMS indicated that early levels of serum NfL may pinpoint which MS patients are at . And in a longitudinal study published this year, 15 years after a clinically isolated syndrome event, showing that spinal cord and gadolinium-enhancing lesions had consistent links with secondary progression development and physical disability. Two studies published this year assessed rising MS drug costs. One found that MS patients with private insurance paid 20 times more in 2016 compared with 2004; the other showed that prices of self-administered MS drugs more than quadrupled in 11 years and Medicare spending for Medicare Part D beneficiaries soared more than 10-fold during the same period. The American Academy of Neurology issued new indicating that most MS patients should receive recommended vaccinations, including yearly flu shots. A case-control study presented at ECTRIMS demonstrated that . ""In the general population, vaccinations are seen as a problem; there are lobbies in many countries against vaccinations,"" Mar Tintore, MD, PhD, of University Hospital Vall d'Hebron in Barcelona, Spain, told ""In MS patients, vaccinations are especially important.

Our general interest e-newsletter keeps you up to date on a wide variety of health topics. Find out about available and emerging therapies for multiple sclerosis (MS). Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory central nervous system disease that causes often disabling physical symptoms, including problems with mobility, vision, coordination and cognitive function, as well as fatigue and pain. If you've been diagnosed with relapsing-remitting , your doctor is likely to recommend immediate treatment with medications known as disease-modifying therapy (DMT). have been shown to reduce the number of relapses and delay progression of disability to some degree. These drugs differ in how they're taken and how often, whether they can be taken during pregnancy, and what side effects they can cause. They also differ in how people respond to them, and a person's response to a drug can change over time. Also, aren't a cure, and you might still need treatment for symptoms of . An understanding of can help you and your doctor form the best treatment strategy for your relapsing-remitting . These medications are among the first approved for relapsing and are still used as first line therapy. They include: The interferon beta medications are given by self-injection, either under the skin or in a muscle. The frequency of injections varies from once every two days to once every two weeks. These drugs have moderate to strong evidence of effectiveness, reducing the relapse rate and slowing the development of new -related brain lesions for relapsing . These drugs are considered generally safe and require minimal monitoring. Flu-like symptoms and injection site reactions, such as redness and discomfort, are commonly reported side effects of interferon beta drugs. This also is considered an initial therapy option for relapsing . This drug is thought to act through immune system cells known as T cells. It might also have nerve-protecting effects. Glatiramer acetate is given by self-injection under the skin, either three times weekly or every day. It's generally well tolerated, but injection site reactions, such as redness and discomfort, are common. This is the first drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat both relapsing and primary-progressive . Not only has it been shown to reduce relapses, but it can slow disease progression. Ocrelizumab is given as an IV infusion initially twice in two weeks. After that, the infusion is given every six months. Infusion reactions, such as a headache, rash, nausea and fever, are common. Your doctor might recommend that you be given a corticosteroid and an antihistamine before infusion to help prevent reactions. People with hepatitis B shouldn't take ocrelizamab. is a humanized monoclonal antibody that reduces the migration of immune cells across the blood-brain barrier into the central nervous system. This medication is given intravenously every four weeks. Natalizumab is effective against relapsing , reducing the relapse rate by about two-thirds. However, it's associated with a small but important risk of a serious brain infection known as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). People who take natalizumab must be closely monitored for symptoms of , which include progressive weakness and visual or cognitive changes that might not be reversible. A person's ongoing risk is assessed using factors such as: The presence of antibodies to a virus known as John Cunningham virus on blood testing Previous treatment of immunosuppressive drugs, such as mitoxantrone This drug helps reduce relapses of by targeting a protein on the surface of immune cells and depleting white blood cells. This effect can limit potential nerve damage caused by the white blood cells, but it also increases the risk of infections and autoimmune disorders. Treatment with alemtuzumab involves five consecutive days of drug infusions followed by three days of infusions a year later. Infusion reactions, such as a headache, rash, nausea and fever, are common with alemtuzumab. Due to the risks associated with alemtuzamab, the recommends extensive screening before using the drug. It's only available from registered providers, and people treated with alemtuzumab must be registered in a special drug safety monitoring program. These oral are approved for treating relapsing . This once-daily oral medication reduces the relapse rate of . Fingolimod is a unique medication that binds to many different types of body cells. It traps white blood cells in lymph nodes so that they can't enter the brain and cause new lesions. People with heart disorders or related conditions can't use fingolimod. It can temporarily slow the heart rate, so the first dose must be taken under medical supervision. It also requires monitoring of vision because of a risk of buildup of fluid in the macula, an area in the center of the retina. For that reason, people with diabetes generally shouldn't use fingolimod. Teriflunomide has been approved in two doses, 7 milligrams (mg) and 14 mg, taken once daily. It's generally well tolerated at both doses. Possible side effects include headache, diarrhea, nausea, elevation in liver enzymes and hair thinning. Pregnant women and people with liver conditions shouldn't use teriflunomide. Also known as BG-12, dimethyl fumarate is taken twice daily. Common side effects include flushing and gastrointestinal problems, such as diarrhea and nausea. Its coating is designed to reduce gastrointestinal problems, and taking it with food also can help relieve them. This twice-daily capsule is similar to dimethyl fumarate but typically causes fewer side effects. It's approved for the treatment of relapsing forms of . This drug has been shown to be effective in reducing relapses and new brain lesions. It was also approved for secondary-progressive . Possible side effects include increased risk of developing infections. This once-daily oral medication can reduce relapse rate and help slow the progression of . It's also approved for secondary-progressive . Possible side effects include viral infections, liver problems and low white blood cell count. Other possible side effects include changes in heart rate, headaches and vision problems. There's no way to know which treatments will work best for you or how your disease will progress. Recommendations are based on several factors, including: Recent activity, including recent attack frequency, severity and recovery The severity of lesion damage to the brain and spinal cord based on an MRI Other illnesses you have or medications you take that might interact with therapy Your own preferences regarding type of therapy (oral or injectable, for example) Shared decision-making between you and your doctor is the best approach to your treatment plan. Once you start a , it's important that you continue taking your medication as prescribed. Be sure to report new symptoms to your doctor, who will monitor your response and possibly switch your medication if needed.

c4ceab04-e5d6-4767-8954-3f86e2d6d50a,"— Research suggests that cigarette smoking speeds the progression from relapsing-remitting MS to secondary progressive MS, greatly reducing the quality of patients’ lives. From the day the Surgeon General’s on the hazards of cigarette smoking was released in 1964, the public has been aware of its negative health effects, but few know that for patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) smoking may have a direct impact on the progression of their disease. In a conducted in the Department of Neurology at the Guilan University of Medical Sciences in Rasht, Iran, researchers found that patients suffering from relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) who also smoked more than ten cigarettes per day had a greater risk than non-smokers of progressing to secondary progressive MS, or SPMS. While relapsing-remitting MS is characterized by periods of disease activity followed by periods of remission, those with secondary progressive MS no longer experience remission, but rather their disease remains on a “low simmer” and, as the damage to their brain and spinal cord progresses, they experience ever greater disability. The study participants were all patients registered with the MS Society in Guilan, Iran. The authors concluded that, “smokers have an increased risk for progression of RRMS to SPMS compared with non-smokers. We also showed that the disease progression may be influenced by [an] increase in cigarette smoking.” on the effects of smoking on MS progression conducted by researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health in 2005 suggested that “the risk of developing secondary progressive multiple sclerosis was more than three times higher in smokers than in non-smokers who had a relapsing–remitting clinical onset of multiple sclerosis.” However, smoking may be part of an overall unhealthy lifestyle, which can contribute to the worsening of disease. “Information on other habits was not available and thus we could not adjust for them,” said Dr. Miguel A. Hernán of the Harvard School of Public Health in an interview with Healthline. “This is certainly a limitation of the study.” While the findings suggest a correlation between cigarette smoking and disease progression in MS, it’s unclear just what mechanism is at work. MS is a chronic, inflammatory autoimmune disease in which the immune system attacks the protective myelin sheath covering nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. In order to launch an attack on this myelin sheath, T-cells from the immune system must first traverse the blood-brain barrier (BBB) which, according to is “a dynamic interface that separates the brain from the circulatory system and protects the central nervous system from potentially harmful chemicals.” In on the effects of cigarette smoking on the BBB, researchers at the Cleveland Clinic Learner College of Medicine found that “compounds contained in TS [tobacco smoke] may affect the viability of cells comprising the BBB and trigger an inflammatory response that, in turn, may further lead to loss of BBB integrity.” While studies have yet to be conducted on the effects of a BBB compromised by cigarette smoking on the escalation of disease progression in MS patients who smoke, these conclusions suggest that further research needs to be done. In the meantime, MS patients should read the smoke signals and take charge of one of the few aspects of their health they can control.“MS patients may know that smoking is associated with an increased risk of developing MS, and smoking appears to speed up the progression of MS,” said David Antonuccio, Ph.D., Professor Emeritus of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at the University of Nevada School of Medicine, in an interview with Healthline. “The hope is that quitting smoking will slow the progression. Nevertheless, some patients may fear a flare-up if they quit, though I have not seen any convincing evidence that quitting smoking can increase the risk of a flare-up. “Most patients will feel uncomfortable (increased anxiety, insomnia, increased craving, gastrointestinal problems, headaches) when they quit smoking for a few days to a couple of weeks initially after quitting, whether they have MS or not, but after withdrawal is completed, they usually feel better,” he added. Antonuccio, who ran the stop smoking clinic at the Reno Veteran’s Administration Medical Center for 24 years and authored the self-help ebook , advises MS patients to take advantage of the tools provided by doctors and clinics to help them quit, including “setting a target quit day, tracking smoking prior to quit day, learning relaxation skills, using nicotine replacement like a nicotine patch on quit day and for several weeks thereafter, cleaning out the house and car of all smoking remnants, seeking social support, [and] developing healthy substitute behaviors like exercise or healthy snacking. “Nicotine replacement as an adjunct to behavioral skills can be very helpful,” he added. “From my perspective though, it doesn’t make sense to add other medications (like bupropion or varenicline) out of concern for complicating the MS patient’s already complicated medical condition with such medications that can increase the risk of side effects and adverse events. “ By eating right, getting plenty of rest, and avoiding things we know to be unhealthy—including cigarettes—an MS sufferer may be able to positively affect the course of the disease.

With the proper tools and support you can quit smoking, which could give you a greater sense of control and have a positive effect on your quality of life.

bf8eed9b-2548-46ba-9838-d06b4bfde7ae,"Complementary & Alternative Medicines Find Programs & Services in Your Area COVID-19 Vaccine Guidance for People Living with MS     SPMS follows an initial relapsing-remitting course. Some people who are diagnosed with RRMS will eventually transition to a secondary progressive course in which there is a progressive worsening of neurologic function (accumulation of disability) over time. SPMS can be further characterized as either (with relapses and/or evidence of new MRI activity during a specified period of time) or, as well as  (evidence of disability accrual over time, with or without relapses or new MRI activity) or . This graphic shows the kinds of disease activity that can occur in SPMS; however each person's experience with SPMS will be unique. Following a period of relapsing-remitting disease, disability gradually increases over time, with or without evidence of disease activity (relapses or changes on MRI). In SPMS, occasional relapses may occur, as well as periods of stability. Disease activity and progression should be evaluated at least yearly by neurologic examination and MRI. Being able to characterize the course of your disease at different points in time helps you and your MS care provider discuss your treatment options and expected outcomes.  For example:   If you have SPMS that is active, you and your MS care provider will want to talk about treatment with a disease-modifying therapy to reduce the risk of a relapse. If you have SPMS that is active and progressing despite the medication you are taking, the conversation with your MS care provider might be about the potential benefits and risks associated with switching to a more aggressive treatment strategy. If your SPMS is not active but there is evidence of progression and accumulation of disability, you and your MS care provider will want to focus on rehabilitation strategies to help improve your function and mobility, and promote safety and independence. If your SPMS is stable without activity or progression, the conversation with your MS care provider could focus on rehabilitation and other symptom management strategies to help you maintain function. How does SPMS differ from the other disease courses? SPMS occurs in people who initially had a relapsing-remitting disease course. In other words, SPMS occurs as a second phase of the disease for many individuals. In SPMS, people may or may not continue to experience relapses caused by inflammation; the disease gradually changes from the inflammatory process seen in RRMS to a more steadily progressive phase characterized by nerve damage or loss. Read more about strategies to help you lead a full life with secondary progressive MS. Prior to the availability of the approved disease-modifying therapies, studies indicated that 50 percent of those diagnosed with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) would transition to secondary-progressive MS (SPMS) within 10 years, and 90 percent would transition within 25 years. While MS experts agree that the medications have an impact on disease progression, it is too soon to tell the extent to which the disease-modifying treatments alter or delay the transition to SPMS. The National MS Society is pursuing all promising research paths and collaborating worldwide to drive progress in research in progressive MS, for which few therapies exist.

The study is recruiting at approximately 45 centers nationwide. One option is an escalation approach, in which patients start taking a less-powerful therapy with the option of switching to a more potent therapy if disease activity continues. The other approach involves starting with a stronger therapy that is potentially more effective, but also carries the potential for greater risk for significant adverse effects. The “TRaditional versus Early Aggressive Therapy for Multiple Sclerosis” (TREAT-MS) Trial is funded by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI).   DETAILS :  There is an unmet need to identify if specific treatment strategies during the relapsing-remitting phase of MS can prevent, delay, or reduce longer-term disability. Particularly, it is unclear whether people who experience disease activity while on a traditional, first-line disease-modifying therapy (these include injectable or oral medications for the TREAT-MS trial) should switch to a different first-line therapy or if they should escalate immediately to a higher-efficacy therapy (therapies with greater effectiveness but possibly more side effects, delivered via infusion).   The TREAT-MS Trial is one of two studies funded by PCORI that will help inform treatment decisions around whether, and which, people with MS would most benefit from early, possibly more risky aggressive therapy. The other study is Determining the Effectiveness of Early Intensive versus Escalation Approaches for the Treatment of Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (DELIVER-MS).   : Investigators are seeking participants diagnosed with relapsing-remitting MS who are between the ages of 18 and 60 years. Participants are not eligible if they have had more than 6 months of exposure to one or more MS disease-modifying therapies or had any prior treatment with rituximab, ocrelizumab, alemtuzumab, mitoxantrone, cladribine, or an experimental aggressive therapy. Further enrollment criteria are available from the contact below.   Eligible participants will be divided into two groups based on whether they show characteristics that may make them at higher risk for long-term disability. Within each group, participants will be randomly assigned to either a traditional or early aggressive therapy. Participants and their neurology specialist will choose the therapy within the category that is most appropriate for them. Those deemed at low risk for disability who are initially randomly assigned to a traditional therapy and who then experience ongoing disease activity and are interested in switching therapies will be randomly assigned to a different traditional therapy or early aggressive therapy.   Study participation will range from 42 – 54 months, depending on enrollment date. Study related activities will occur around a participant’s standard visits to their local health care providers.   The primary outcome being measured is the time to sustained disability progression, as determined by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)-plus, a combined outcome that includes change in either the EDSS or timed 25-foot walk (testing mobility and leg function) or nine-hole peg test (measuring upper extremity function). Investigators will also monitor symptoms such as fatigue, mobility, and cognition, and will track brain MRI scans. Also, patient reported outcomes – in which participants report their own perceptions about their condition -- will be obtained to gain a better understanding of the full impact of treatment.   : To learn more about the enrollment criteria for this study, and to find out if you are eligible to participate, please email the team at Johns Hopkins at and you will be connected with a participating site in your area.   Sites will be enrolling in the following cities – for currently active sites, please see : Birmingham, AL Phoenix, AZ Los Angeles, CA Sacramento, CA San Diego, CA San Francisco, CA Washington, DC Newark, DE Gainesville, FL Miami, FL Tampa, FL Chicago, IL Kansas City, KS Louisville, KY Boston, MA Worcester, MA Baltimore, MD  Ann Arbor, MI Detroit, MI Rochester, MN Billings, MT Great Falls, MT Hackensack, NJ Livingston, NJ New York, NY Rochester, NY Stony Brook, NY Cincinnati, OH Columbus, OH Oklahoma City, OK Portland, OR Danville, PA Pittsburgh, PA Nashville, TN Dallas, TX Round Rock, TX Salt Lake City, UT Norfolk, VA Burlington, VT Seattle, WA Download a brochure that discusses issues to think about when considering enrolling in an MS clinical trial (PDF).   Without participants in research studies, MS research would come to a standstill. .

When MRI scans showed that disease activity and inflammation had resolved, so did these mood changes. Participants who experienced a relapse within six months had higher levels of anxiety at the start of the study. Further studies are necessary to clarify the association between mood and inflammation – for example, if these symptoms may be predictive of relapses.

Silvia Rossi, Valeria Studer, Jacopo Perugini and colleagues (Isitituto Neurologico Carlo Besta, Milan, and other institutions) report their findings in ().   DETAILS Depression and anxiety are increasingly recognized as common symptoms associated with MS. Research on psychiatric disorders in general indicates that inflammation may play a role in their development, so the current study investigates links between mood and the inflammatory disease activity that occurs in MS.   The investigators administered psychological tests measuring depression and anxiety to 405 people with relapsing-remitting MS. Inflammatory disease activity was assessed using MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) brain scans. In a subset of participants who had not yet received disease-modifying therapies, the team also measured levels of immune messenger proteins in the spinal fluid. Participants were reexamined three and six months later.   Participants with signs of active inflammation observed on their MRI scans (78 people) had significantly higher levels of anxiety and depression, whether or not they were experiencing an actual relapse. After three months, inflammation had resolved in 74 people, and this reduction of disease activity was linked to a significant reduction in anxiety and depression. Of 29 participants who were experiencing an MS relapse at the start of the study, 20 underwent anti-inflammatory steroid treatment and depression and anxiety decreased for them as well. Participants who experienced a relapse within six months had higher levels of anxiety at the start of the study.   Upon examining immune messenger proteins in the spinal fluid, the team found that IL-2 and IL-8 were significantly higher in participants who showed increased levels of anxiety, and NF-alpha and IL-1beta were higher in those who showed increased depression.   The team (Drs. Silvia Rossi, Valeria Studer, Jacopo Perugini and colleagues (Isitituto Neurologico Carlo Besta, Milan, and other institutions) report their findings in ().   This study shows important connections between emotional changes and inflammatory disease activity in MS. Further studies are necessary to clarify the association between emotional symptoms and inflammation – for example, whether these symptoms may be able to predict relapses.

Approximately 85 percent of individuals initially present with a  relapsing-remitting course of the disease (). Most people with relapsing remitting MS transition to a more progressive course called secondary-progressive MS (SPMS) that is characterized by accumulation of disability with fewer relapses. About 10 to 15 percent of people with MS begin the disease with a progressive course, without relapses, known as primary progressive MS (PPMS). In 2013, the International Advisory Committee on Clinical Trials of MS identified four MS  (. In 2020 this group further clarified the concepts underlying these disease courses, highlighting the need for time framing the disease course modifiers “activity” and “progression” (). The Committee also clarified the terms “worsening” and “progression” and provided guidance for their use. Although not considered a course of MS, radiologically isolated syndrome (RIS) has been used to describe asymptomatic individuals who have MRI clinical features that are suggestive of MS and are therefore at an increased risk of developing MS (). In a global study of 451 people with RIS, 51.2% went on to develop MS within ten years and several predictive factors of future clinical events were described (). Research to further define these predictive factors could inform clinical management of RIS. Trials are now underway in people with RIS to determine if disease-modifying therapies will prevent or delay the development of MS, including: Randomized, Double-Blinded Study of Treatment: Teriflunomide, in Radiologically Isolated Syndrome (TERIS) Assessment of Tecfidera® in Radiologically Isolated Syndrome (RIS) (ARISE) Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) Vaccine in Radiologically Isolated Syndrome (RIS) Diagnosis & Management Healthcare Professional App Download this FREE tool and resource that provides a concise compilation of current, easy-to-reference, evidence-based information.

dc235da3-fec1-4305-8ae1-7dc2d3c9ed75,"The Importance of Long-Term Treatment for Multiple Sclerosis The Importance of Long-Term Treatment for Multiple Sclerosis Treatment with a long-term, is crucial for most patients with MS, since disease activity and damage continues within the CNS even when no new symptoms are present. When a patient begins a treatment regimen early in his or her disease course, disease activity is slowed. This not only reduces the number and severity of symptom flare-ups, as well as delays the progression of the disease (and possibly delays any related disability), but also reduces the number of active lesions that appear on an MRI. A 21-year prospective study of individuals (with relapsing-remitting MS) who began therapy early in the disease found that they experienced a longer lifespan than those who did not begin treatment as early. Of those who didn’t start treatment early, MS-related pulmonary infection was the most common cause of mortality over the 21-year period. Previously, all but one* of the approved treatments were only available for individuals with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS) – largely for those with RRMS – and some are also approved for clinically isolated syndrome, prior to the diagnosis of MS. In 2017, Ocrevus™ (ocrelizumab) was approved for two types of MS: relapsing forms of MS (RMS) and primary-progressive MS (PPMS). This is the first time that a medication for MS had been approved for these two types of the disease, and the first time that any medication had been approved to treat PPMS. Ocrevus is given via intravenous (IV) infusion every six months. Additionally, in 2019, Mayzent® (siponimod) oral tablets, Mavenclad® (cladribine) oral tablets, and Vumerity™ (diroximel fumarate) oral capsules were approved to treat RMS as well as active secondary-progressive MS (SPMS), which is a more steady form of MS that follows RRMS, but still has relapses. While these are the only DMTs to be approved in recent years for active SPMS, the FDA is allowing some of the previously approved DMTs to add active SPMS to their indications. Mayzent and Vumerity are also approved for clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). *In 2000, Novantrone® (mitoxantrone), given via IV infusion, was approved for RRMS, SPMS, and worsening RRMS. However, side effects may include cardiac disease and leukemia, and for this reason, is seldom prescribed for individuals with MS. Additionally, Gilenya® (fingolimod), is the only DMT that is also approved for the treatment of children and adolescents, ages 10 through 17, with relapsing forms of MS. Young people under the age of 18 who are diagnosed with MS are referred to having “pediatric MS”; the vast majority (98 percent) of individuals with pediatric MS are diagnosed with the relapsing form of the disease. Research (including many clinical trials) is ongoing at a rigorous pace to find additional treatments for all forms of MS. Mylan’s generic version of Copaxone® (glatiramer acetate injection) Three generic versions of Gilenya® (fingolimod) capsules; while approved, these are not yet available Tecfidera® (dimethyl fumarate or DMF, formerly known as BG-12) Getting early treatment and staying on one of the long-term DMTs for MS may also delay the rate of conversion from RRMS to . As noted earlier, this form of MS that follows RRMS exhibits a steady worsening, with or without relapses (or flare-ups). If flare-ups do occur, they usually do not remit fully. As mentioned in the previous section, without treatment, approximately half of individuals with RRMS convert to SPMS within 10 years. However, with the introduction of more than 20 brand-name and generic DMTs since the first treatment became available in 1993, those taking a DMT experience a reduced or delayed conversion rate. For more information on long-term treatments for MS and how to select the treatment that is right for you, please see MSAA’s . Individuals who experience a more steady progression of the disease from the onset, without periodic relapses and remissions, may be diagnosed with .

This procedure aims at “rebooting” the immune system to prevent MS immune attacks against the brain and spinal cord. At three years, 78.4% of participants experienced no new disease activity. When this trial has completed its five-year duration, it will be an important addition to research needed to determine whether this approach to stem cell transplantation is safe and effective in people with MS. Richard A. Nash, MD (Colorado Blood Center Institute) and colleagues report in JAMA Neurology (). This study was sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the National Institutes of Health. One type of procedure that has been explored for many years in MS is called “autologous hematopoietic (blood cell-producing) stem cell transplantation” – or HSCT. This procedure has been used in attempts to “reboot” the immune system, which launches attacks on the brain and spinal cord in people with MS. In HSCT, these stem cells (derived from a person’s own bone marrow or blood) are stored, and the rest of the individual’s immune cells are depleted usually by chemotherapy. Then the stored stem cells are reintroduced back to the individual’s bloodstream. The new stem cells migrate to the bone marrow and over time produce new cells. Eventually they repopulate the body with immune cells. The goal of this currently experimental procedure is that the new immune cells will no longer attack myelin or other brain tissue, providing the person, what is hoped to be, a completely new immune system. Investigators enrolled 25 people who had experienced an MS relapse involving loss of neurologic function while taking disease-modifying therapies during the previous 18 months. Participants received HSCT along with high-dose immunosuppressive therapy (a regimen of treatments that profoundly suppress the immune system), and followed for five years. The primary endpoint of this study is whether participants experience “event-free survival,” meaning that they did not die or have an increase in disease activity. Disease activity is defined as any one of the following outcomes occurring: confirmed loss of neurologic function, clinical relapse, or new lesions observed on MRI scans. The current publication presents a planned analysis after three years of follow up. One individual experienced a pulmonary embolism induced by heparin (administered as part of stem cell collection), and withdrew from the study. Event-free survival at three years was 78.4%, down from 95.8% after one year. Treatment failed in five individuals. Scores on clinical scales measuring disease activity and quality of life, including the EDSS, improved significantly at three years after HSCT. Immune system analysis showed prolonged depletion of the immune cells that drive the immune attack, indicating that the immune system was indeed “rebooted.” Two deaths occurred, one from complications due to MS progression and another due to asthma. One person experienced an MS attack, an individual who had not complied with a prednisone regimen designed to reduce this risk during collection of stem cells. There were 130 adverse events that were severe or life-threatening, mostly cytopenias (blood cell reductions) and infections. Rigorous clinical trials of stem cell therapies are crucial to determining their safety and effectiveness in people with MS. “We look forward to seeing the completed results of this important study,” says Bruce Bebo, PhD, Executive Vice President of Research at the National MS Society. “There are significant risks involved in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and it’s important to ensure that this will be a safe solution for people with MS, with significant clinical benefit.” With the urgent need for more effective treatments for MS, particularly for those with more progressive forms of the disease, the National MS Society believes that the potential of all types of cell therapies must be explored. The Society is currently supporting 15 research projects exploring various types of stem cells, including cells derived from bone marrow, fat and skin, and has supported 70 stem cell studies over the past 10 years. about stem cells and MS about available therapies for MS Multiple sclerosis is an unpredictable, often disabling . range from numbness and tingling to blindness and paralysis, and there is currently no cure for MS.

Filippi OBJECTIVE: To determine the functional and structural substrates of motor network dysfunction in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). METHODS: Using a 3-T scanner, in 12 right-handed RRMS patients and 14 matched controls, we acquired diffusion tensor (DT) MRI and functional MRI during the performance of a simple motor task with the right (R) hand. Using DT MRI tractography, we calculated DT-derived metrics from several motor and nonmotor white matter (WM) fiber bundles. Functional connectivity analysis was performed using SPM2. RESULTS: Compared with control, MS patients had abnormal DT MRI metrics of all the WM bundles studied. Compared with controls, MS patients had more significant activations of the left (L) supplementary motor area (SMA), the L primary sensorimotor cortex (SMC), and the R cerebellum.

670b51d8-75a7-4bf7-aa52-aaf118dc82c1,"Everything You Need to Know About Transitioning from RRMS to SPMS — Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a progressive disease of the central nervous system (CNS) that affects your brain and the spinal cord. According to the National MS Society, about people over the age of 18 live with this condition in the United States. MS is an autoimmune disease in which the immune system attacks the CNS. This triggers inflammation and damages myelin, an insulating material that surrounds nerve fibers. The exact mechanism of how someone gets the disease is unknown. However, we do know that there is likely a combination of triggers including genetic and environmental factors. Damage to these fibers can trigger multiple neurological symptoms. This includes fatigue, numbness, weakness, cognitive problems, and issues with walking. The severity of your symptoms varies from person-to-person, and depends on the type of MS you have. Many people are initially diagnosed with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). But over time, symptoms can progress to another type of MS, known as secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS). Here’s what you need to know about both types of MS. RRMS refers to a type of MS in which you experience periods of new MS symptoms or relapses followed by periods of remission. Remission is when symptoms improve or disappear. During relapses, you may have new typical MS symptoms like numbness, tingling, and blurred vision. These symptoms can lasts for days, weeks, or months, and then slowly improve over weeks to months. Some people experience complete disappearance of their symptoms during remission. On the other hand, if your symptoms continue, they may not be as severe. About with MS receive an RRMS diagnosis at first. Many people experience progression of their symptoms after living with RRMS for some time. This means that the disease becomes more active, and periods of remission become less and less frequent. This stage of MS is known as secondary progressive multiple sclerosis or SPMS. This condition is best described as MS without relapses. MS affects everyone differently, and not everyone with RRMS will transition to SPMS. But SPMS only develops after an initial diagnosis of RRMS. You’ll have typical MS symptoms during the transition from RRMS to SPMS, but you may experience a slow worsening of symptoms. You may even develop new symptoms. Before, maybe you had numbness or mild weakness, and these didn’t interfere much with your daily life. Once you transition to SPMS, though, you may notice cognitive changes, such as difficulty finding words. You may also have increased difficulty with walking or more noticeable numbness and tingling. The cause of this transition is unknown, but it may have to do with the disappearance of nerve fibers as the result of progressive nerve damage. Or it may be connected to the progressive loss of grey matter, which can be more subtle. Some people transition soon after an MS diagnosis, whereas others live with RRMS for decades before transitioning to SPMS. Since MS symptoms are unpredictable, it can be difficult to distinguish an RRMS relapse from the onset of SPMS. Speak with your doctor if you feel that you’re experiencing new or worsening symptoms. Your doctor can use an imaging test like an MRI to examine inflammation in your brain. Based on the level of inflammation in your brain as well as your relapse history, your doctor can determine whether your symptoms are a new relapse or SPMS. Even though some people with RRMS eventually transition to SPMS, it’s possible to delay disease progression. Treating MS is key to improving your symptoms and quality of life, and ultimately, slowing down the disease. Your doctor can prescribe disease-modifying therapies to help decrease inflammation, which can also improve the severity and frequency of your attacks. These include injectable, oral, and infusion medications such as: These treatments and others can help with the relapsing forms of MS. Talk to your doctor to find out which one is best for you. You may also receive intravenous corticosteroids to reduce acute inflammation in your CNS. This helps speed up recovery from an MS relapse. MS is a progressive condition that can lead to disability. You may eventually require some type of rehabilitation to help with daily living. Programs vary based on your needs. If you’re having difficulty with speech or swallowing, you may receive assistance from a speech or language pathologist. Or you may need appointments with an occupational therapist if you’re having difficulty with personal care, housework, or employment. Lifestyle changes can help improve your symptoms, too. Regular exercise may reduce spasticity and joint stiffness. It can improve both your flexibility and your overall health. Plus, exercise increases the brain’s production of endorphins, which are hormones that help regulate your emotions and mood. To avoid injury, start slow with gentle activities like water aerobics or walking. It’s also important to stretch both before and after activity to reduce muscle spasms, which are common in MS. Learn how to pace yourself and set limits. Additionally, you’ll want to avoid foods that can increase inflammation. These include highly processed foods such as hamburgers and hot dogs and foods high in salt. Examples of foods that can reduce inflammation are whole foods such as green leafy vegetables, fish high in omega-3s, and fruits such as blackberries and raspberries. If you smoke, talk to your doctor about ways to quit. Some people feel better after confiding in a close friend or family member, or after joining a support group for MS. MS is a serious condition, but early treatment can help you achieve remission and slow the progression of the disease. Worsening of symptoms can also interfere with the quality of your life. Talk with your doctor if you develop any new symptoms or signs of advancing MS. — More in Finding Balance with Progressing Multiple Sclerosis Lifestyle Modifications That Make a Difference for Secondary Progressive MS Understanding Secondary-Progressive Multiple Sclerosis Mobility Support Devices for Secondary Progressive MS: Braces, Walking Devices, and More FDA Approves 2 New Multiple Sclerosis Drugs: What You Need to Know New Medication and Treatment Options for Secondary Progressive MS Understanding Secondary-Progressive Multiple Sclerosis Secondary-progressive MS (SPMS) is a form of multiple sclerosis.

Having more refined definitions of different types of MS would greatly facilitate research studies, communications between people with MS and their healthcare providers, and treatment decisions. For these reasons, a recent effort to fine-tune descriptions of MS was undertaken by the International Advisory Committee on Clinical Trials in MS. This committee is comprised of international leaders in MS research and clinical care and is jointly supported by the National MS Society and the European Committee for Treatment and Research in MS (ECTRIMS). A summary of the deliberations, including recommendations for more research, has just been published and can be read or downloaded without fees (). In 1996 the Committee had developed consensus around descriptions, or “phenotypes,” of the to facilitate research in MS and so that researchers and clinicians around the world would have a common understanding of the types of MS discussed in publications and in the clinic. This consensus highlighted four courses of MS -- relapsing-remitting, secondary progressive, primary progressive, and progressive relapsing. While these descriptions of MS have become well-established, our understanding of MS and the course of the disease has advanced since that time, prompting a re-evaluation of the course of MS and any biological signposts (such as blood markers or imaging) that might help refine these definitions. After a thorough search of the medical literature and convening an international workshop,* the Committee has now reviewed advances in what we know and don’t yet know in terms of identifying different types of MS in individuals, and has made recommendations that modify prior clinical course descriptions. In the resulting , the Committee recommended retaining much of what we consider the courses of MS – relapsing-remitting, secondary-progressive and primary progressive, but has recommended categorizing progressive relapsing as an active form of primary progressive MS. Importantly, they recommended that clinicians not just determine a person’s course of MS, but further sub-categorize that course as “active” or “not active” (depending on the presence of clinical relapses or activity on MRI scans) or as progressing (worsening) or not progressing, based on clinical evidence of changes in disability. This, the Committee believes, provides a truer picture of what an individual experiences, can better inform treatment decisions, and refine clinical trial design and recruitment. Ultimately these recommendations will advance better care for people with MS by: • raising awareness that people with all forms of MS should be monitored for signs of disease activity and progression, which may open up additional treatment options; • improving outcomes of clinical trials, which could bring new therapies faster. The Committee pointed out areas for further needed research to help find additional solutions to the unpredictable nature of MS, including: • Long-term studies that track people affected by MS over time; • Assessing whether the degree of recovery from relapses has an impact on long-term outcomes; • Imaging studies of tissue damage and its relation to disease course; • Advanced imaging techniques such as those that measure brain atrophy or optic nerve thinning; • Studying large datasets for fluid-borne biomarkers to better asses their ability to help define clinical phenotypes; • Incorporating information reported by people who have the disease (“patient-reported outcomes”) in refining the courses of MS. Researchers funded by the National MS Society and others worldwide are already working toward these goals, in efforts to help people with MS live their best lives. In addition, this information will be considered by the Society’s leadership as it develops future research strategies. *Workshop supported by the National MS Society, ECTRIMS, the Americas Committee for Treatment and Research in MS, the MS International Federation, and the MS Society of Canada.

f436cc63-84c8-4573-952e-f3fe48f44ffa,"New MS Disease Categories: How Will They Affect You? — MS disease categories get a makeover with few tweaks here and some descriptive modifiers there, painting a better picture of each individual’s MS. For the first time since 1996, the definitions used to describe the different types of multiple sclerosis (MS) have been fine-tuned. Science has made huge advancements in diagnostic imaging and identifying biomarkers for MS since the original subtypes, or “phenotypes,” were first defined. A committee made up of members of the National MS Society (the Society), the European Committee for Treatment and Research in MS, better known as ECTRIMS, and the MS Phenotype Group collaborated in the effort to and take into account the great strides made in the field over the past two decades. Take a Closer Look at Multiple Sclerosis MRI Images of the Brain » The 1996 definitions categorized a person’s MS course as either relapsing-remitting, secondary-progressive, primary-progressive, or progressive-relapsing. Under the new definitions, however, the “progressive-relapsing” phenotype has been dropped. Instead, it is described as an “active” form of primary-progressive MS. Progressive-relapsing may be out, but clinically isolated syndrome, or CIS, is now in. This means that patients with a single MS event can be diagnosed more quickly, based on the better brain imaging techniques now available. With a definite MS diagnosis, patients may be able to start taking a disease modifying therapy (DMT) sooner—a step that the Society recommends to help lower the odds of becoming disabled. The team also opted to add “modifiers,” like adjectives added to a sentence, to more accurately describe a patient’s phenotype. Until now, someone with relapsing-remitting MS might have attacks three or four times per year, yet share the same phenotype as someone who may not recall the last time they had a flare-up. The new revisions address this disparity. “Active” or “not active” will denote relapses, while “progressing” and “not progressing” will indicate the accumulation of disability. So someone with relapsing-remitting MS who has been having flare-ups but recovers fully will be described as having “relapsing-remitting MS that is active, not progressing”. Using these modifiers will paint a clearer picture of the patient’s current disease state for everyone, from neurologists to physical therapists, and convey it in an understandable way. Modifiers will also help researchers identify patients whose disease is “active” or “progressing.” Study subjects can then be chosen more selectively for clinical trials of DMTs, which are increasingly becoming more targeted and more sophisticated. How do patients feel about these new disease definitions? “Being moved from one [phenotype] to another is still so subjective, even with these new definitions,” Anne Pappas, who lives with relapsing-remitting MS in Atlanta, GA, told Healthline. “Almost any neurologist, I believe, will continue to maintain a diagnosis level which will allow their patient access to any necessary [DMTs].” Jessica Petroff agrees with the modifications, “to a point,” she told Healthline. Petroff, a certified medical assistant at a family practice in Indianapolis, IN, is living with a diagnosis of relapsing-remitting MS. For those hovering between relapsing-remitting and transitioning into secondary-progressive, Petroff points out, it could be better to have relapsing-remitting MS tagged with a modifier of “progressing” rather than to be given a diagnosis of secondary-progressive MS. “I don’t like the idea of, once a person falls into a certain category of [secondary-progressive] or [primary-progressive] ‘not active,’ that it is possible they will not be offered any more treatment,” Petroff said. The subtleties in disease definitions could have huge implications for insurance coverage. Drugs deemed effective for relapsing-remitting MS are often not covered by insurance if you are diagnosed with any other MS phenotype. “At the end of the day, patients are just scared to death of anything occurring that will impede their ability to get [DMTs],” said Pappas. “When all is said and done, I don’t care what you call me, just don’t call me anything that will take away my ability to try any medical therapy or clinical trial out there.” — Promising Treatments and Clinical Trials for Relapsing-Remitting MS Could an Undiagnosed Sleep Disorder be Causing Your MS Fatigue?

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disorder of the central nervous system (CNS) characterized by inflammation, demyelination and degenerative changes that can lead to functional loss and disability. Most people with MS experience relapses and remissions of neurological symptoms, particularly early in the disease, and relapses are usually associated with new inflammation in the CNS. Over time, there are fewer relapses and less new inflammatory activity with the disease process becoming more progressive.  There is a large that supports with an approved disease modifying therapy as an evidence-based approach to reducing new relapses, delaying progression of disability and limiting new inflammation in the CNS. The FDA has approved several for the treatment of relapsing forms of MS, which include clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting disease (RRMS) and active secondary progressive disease (SPMS with relapses). One DMT has also been approved for primary progressive MS and one other for non-active secondary progressive MS (no inflammatory demyelination or clinical relapses). Read more about each of the disease modifying therapies .

Stadtler OBJECTIVE: To assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of interferon beta-1a (IFNβ-1a) combined with methotrexate (MTX), IV methylprednisolone (IVMP), or both in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) with continued disease activity on IFNβ-1a monotherapy. METHODS: Eligibility criteria included RRMS, Expanded Disability Status Scale score 0-5.5, and ≥1 relapse or gadolinium-enhancing MRI lesion in the prior year on IFNβ-1a monotherapy. Participants continued weekly IFNβ-1a 30 μg IM and were randomized in a 2 × 2 factorial design to adjunctive weekly placebo or MTX 20 mg PO, with or without bimonthly IVMP 1,000 mg/day for 3 days. The primary endpoint was new or enlarged T2 lesion number at month 12 vs baseline. The study was industry-supported, collaboratively designed, and governed by an investigator Steering Committee with independent Advisory and Data Safety Monitoring committees. Study operations, MRI analyses, and aggregated data were managed by an academic coordinating center. RESULTS: The 313 participants had clinical and MRI characteristics typical of RRMS. Combinations of IFNβ-1a with MTX or IVMP were generally safe and well tolerated. Although trends suggesting modest benefit were seen for some outcomes for IVMP, the results did not demonstrate significant benefit for either adjunctive therapy. The data suggested IVMP reduced anti-IFNβ neutralizing antibody titers. CONCLUSIONS: This trial did not demonstrate benefit of adding low-dose oral methotrexate or every other month IV methylprednisolone to interferon beta-1a in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. https://doi.org/10.1212/01.wnl.0000341934.12142.74 Dive into the research topics of 'Results of the Avonex Combination Trial (ACT) in relapsing-remitting MS'.

Even though there are few or no relapses at this point in the disease, a gradual worsening of symptoms over time is common; this worsening is known as disease progression. The term “secondary-progressive” comes from the fact that (SPMS) can only be diagnosed in a person who has previously experienced RRMS.   Because the transition from a relapsing-remitting course to a more progressive one is a gradual process, the healthcare provider will not be able to tell exactly when it is happening. If a person’s are worsening, the challenge for the provider is to determine whether: The worsening is left over from the last (in other words, permanent but stable damage that remains after the inflammatory attack has ended) — which would mean that the person is experiencing an RRMS disease course; or The disease is continuing to worsen even though the person is no longer experiencing inflammatory relapses — which would mean that the person has transitioned to a SPMS disease course. A variety of strategies, including a careful history of the changes in a person’s symptoms, the , and repeat  scans, help determine whether the transition to SPMS has occurred. Read about the .

Mealy, Anna Whetstone, Gunes Orman, Izlem Izbudak, , Michael Levy Objective To differentiate MRI characteristics of optic neuritis associated with neuromyelitis optica (NMO) and relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). Background Optic neuritis is a common presenting feature of both neuromyelitis optica and multiple sclerosis. Distinguishing between NMO and RRMS is important in guiding treatment, but biomarkers of NMO and MS can be absent early in the disease process. We looked for differences in MRI characteristics of optic neuritis associated with NMO and MS that provide an early clue in the diagnostic workup. Design/Methods We conducted a retrospective analysis of 26 NMO and 26 RRMS patients presenting to the Johns Hopkins Hospital with MRI-confirmed acute optic neuritis. MRIs were assessed to identify the location and longitudinal extent of each contrast enhancing lesion. For the purposes of this study, the optic nerve was divided into intraorbital, canalicular, pre-chiasmal, chiasmal, and optic tract. Results There are distinct differences in MRI characteristics between NMO- and RRMS-associated optic neuritis. The majority of NMO lesions were longitudinally extensive measuring at least 17.6 mm in length and involving at least three optic nerve segments. At a cutoff of 17.6 mm lesion length, the specificity for NMO is 76.9% with a sensitivity of 80.8% and positive likelihood ratio of 3.50. Conversely, MS lesions were more commonly focal in one optic nerve segment localized anteriorly.

It’s never too soon or too late to think about how to access high quality care. Knowing what to look for, where to find it, and how to work effectively with your doctor and other health professionals is essential to your health and quality of life.  While there is no way to predict with any certainty how an individual’s disease will progress, four basic MS disease courses (also called types or phenotypes) have been defined by the International Advisory Committee on Clinical Trials of MS in 2013: clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing remitting, secondary progressive and primary progressive. In 2020, the same committee published a , highlighting the need for time framing the modifiers “activity” and “progression” and guidance for using the terms “worsening” or “progression” to describe the disease. Although not considered a course of MS,  has been used to classify those with abnormalities on MRI of the brain and/or spinal cord consistent with lesions of MS - not explained by another diagnosis - and who also have no past or current neurological symptoms or abnormalities found on neurological exam. Often these individuals have had an MRI because of other symptoms, such as headache, and were found to have lesions that appear similar to those seen in MS. A found a little over half of people with RIS go on to develop MS within ten years. There are no specific treatment guidelines for RIS and additional research is needed to further define what factors increase the likelihood that someone with RIS will develop MS. Monitoring of MRI and neurological symptoms, and neurological examination are generally recommended to quickly identify changes. If the diagnosis is MS, treatment can be started early. Research interest in RIS is high and , which could provide more guidance for monitoring and treatment. CIS is a first episode of neurologic symptoms caused by inflammation and in the central nervous system. The episode, which by definition must last for at least 24 hours, is characteristic of multiple sclerosis but does not yet meet the criteria for a because people who experience a CIS may or may not go on to develop MS. When CIS is accompanied by lesions on a brain MRI () that are similar to those seen in MS, the person has a high likelihood of a second episode of neurologic symptoms and diagnosis of relapsing-remitting MS. When CIS is not accompanied by MS-like lesions on a brain MRI, the person has a much lower likelihood of developing MS. The make it possible to diagnose MS in a person with CIS who also has specific findings on brain MRI that provide evidence of an earlier episode of damage in a different location and indicate active inflammation in a region other than the one causing the current symptoms. As MRI technology improves, the diagnosis of MS will be made more quickly and easily. In the meantime, individuals with CIS who are considered at high risk for developing MS may now be treated with a that has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for that purpose. Early treatment of CIS has been shown to delay onset of MS. RRMS – the most common disease course – is characterized by clearly defined attacks of new or increasing neurologic symptoms. These attacks – also called relapses or exacerbations – are followed by periods of partial or complete recovery (remissions). During remissions, all symptoms may disappear, or some symptoms may continue and become permanent. However, there is no apparent progression of the disease during the periods of remission. RRMS can be further characterized as either (with relapses and/or evidence of new MRI activity over a specified period of time) or , as well as (a confirmed increase in disability following a relapse) or . Approximately 85 percent of people with MS are initially diagnosed with RRMS. This graphic shows the kinds of disease activity that can occur in RRMS over time; however each person's experience with RRMS will be unique. Following a relapse, the new symptoms may disappear without causing any increase in level of disability, or the new symptoms may partially disappear, resulting in an increase in disability. New lesions on MRI, as shown by the arrows, often occur as part of a relapse. However, new MRI lesions indicating MS activity may also occur without symptoms of which the person is aware.  SPMS follows an initial relapsing-remitting course. Some people who are diagnosed with RRMS will eventually transition to a secondary progressive course in which there is a progressive worsening of neurologic function (accumulation of disability) over time. SPMS can be further characterized as either (with relapses and/or evidence of new MRI activity during a specified period of time) or, as well as  (evidence of disability accumulation over time, with or without relapses or new MRI activity) or . This graphic shows the kinds of disease activity that can occur in SPMS over time; however each person's experience with SPMS will be unique. SPMS follows after relapsing-remitting MS. Disability gradually increases over time, with or without evidence of disease activity (relapses or changes on MRI). In SPMS, occasional relapses may occur, as well as periods of stability. PPMS is characterized by worsening neurologic function (accumulation of disability) from the onset of symptoms, without early relapses or remissions. PPMS can be further characterized as either (with an occasional relapse and/or evidence of new MRI activity over a specified period of time) or , as well as  (evidence of disability accumulation over time, with or without relapse or new MRI activity) or . Approximately 15 percent of people with MS are diagnosed with PPMS. This graphic shows the kinds of disease activity that can occur in PPMS over time; however each person's experience with PPMS will be unique. PPMS can have brief periods when the disease is stable, with or without a relapse or new MRI activity, as well as periods when increasing disability occurs with or without new relapses or lesions on MRI. There are more than a dozen approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat all types of MS. Each drug has an indication from the FDA for the type of MS it can be used to treat. There are currently more treatments available for relapsing forms of MS than progressive forms.

1c2d0640-4b50-4c58-b72e-fccedbe71d22,"FDA Approves 2 New Multiple Sclerosis Drugs: What You Need to Know There are two pieces of encouraging news for people with progressive and relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. The news comes in the form of two new drugs recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). On March 26, FDA officials the Novartis drug, Mayzent (siponimod), for various forms of multiple sclerosis, including clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), and active secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS). Novartis officials said the pill will be available sometime in early April. They noted that Mayzent, a tablet taken once a day, is the first treatment specifically for people with active SPMS in more than 15 years. The annual price tag is expected to be for the treatment. On March 29, the FDA also EMD Serono’s (cladribrine), also for RRMS and active SPMS but not for clinically isolated syndrome. Company officials told Healthline the annual price tag is expected to be $99,500 for the two-year treatment. There are nearly living with multiple sclerosis (MS) in the United States and about worldwide. The National Multiple Sclerosis Society states that people with RRMS have a 50 percent chance of progressing to SPMS within the first 10 years. Another 90 percent have a chance of transitioning after 25 years. People with relapsing remitting forms of MS currently have 15 FDA-approved disease modifying treatments (DMTs). People living with SPMS now have three choices. The last MS treatment by the FDA was ocrelizumab in 2017. It entered the market with a $65,000 annual . Here’s a look at the two drugs approved by the FDA last week. In 2010, the FDA Gilenya, the company’s widely used drug for MS treatment. Novartis last year, seeking to block the sales of generic versions of Gilenya after the drug’s main patent expires in August. “Mayzent works to sequester certain white blood cells in lymph nodes. These are considered important in inflammatory response in MS. If they can’t get out into system then they can’t cause over inflammation in MS.” , a nurse practitioner at the Johns Hopkins Multiple Sclerosis Center in Maryland and the associate vice president of healthcare access for National Multiple Sclerosis Society. In the phase III trial of Mayzent with 1,651 patients, the fraction of patients with confirmed progression of disability was statistically significantly lower in the Mayzent group than in the placebo group. Patients treated with Mayzent had a 55 percent relative reduction in annualized relapse rate. “This drug crosses the blood brain barrier,” explained , a neurologist at the University of California San Francisco. “We’re not exactly sure what it does, but the results show it slows progression in those with later stage of disease.” “The immune system is activated in the periphery and dives into brain and causes havoc,” he added. “We believe that in progressive MS cells get into the brain and destroy from the inside out. This medication works in the brain. Others work in the periphery.” Side effects common during the trials included headaches, elevations in blood pressures, increase in liver enzyme, and a reduction in white blood cell counts that might cause infection. Novartis shared with Healthline that it has developed a comprehensive patient support program for Mayzent, to help patients navigate insurance coverage and identify resources for those who are uninsured or underinsured. “Mayzent has been demonstrated to have a modest but statistically significant effect on slowing progression in persons with SPMS who are still ambulatory with or without a device,” , professor of clinical neurology at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California Los Angeles and clinical director of the UCLA MS program, told Healthline. Officials at Merck KGaA, the parent company of EMD Serono, said in a that Mavenclad is the “the first ever oral treatment to provide two years of proven efficacy with a maximum of 20 days of treatment.” Mavenclad is taken for 8 to 10 days in each of the two years of treatment. There are no other treatments needed. In the phase III study of Mavenclad with 1,976 participants, patients experienced a in annual relapse rate and a 33 percent reduction in rate of disability progression measured by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). They also experienced a lower number of lesions compared to the placebo group. Mavenclad works by targeting certain white blood cells (lymphocytes) that lead the immune attack in MS. The drug temporarily reduces the number of certain lymphocytes without continuous suppression of the immune system. Risks include upper respiratory tract infection, headache, herpes, alopecia, and lymphopenia. Serious adverse reactions reported in the clinical program included malignancies. The company states that due to its safety profile this drug is generally recommended for patients who have had an inadequate response to, or are unable to tolerate, an alternate drug indicated for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. “Price to an individual who has MS will depend on the provisions of his/her insurance coverage and the degree to which that individual will be eligible for programs designed to assist with out of pocket cost,” EMD Serono officials told Healthline. “Coverage will depend on individual insurance plans.” “We are committed to helping support patients who are prescribed Mavenclad. offers personalized patient support, including assistance with navigating insurance coverage questions and additional resources that may be able to help eligible patients who are uninsured or underinsured,” company officials added. The availability of the new drugs is being tempered by their high costs. “While we are grateful to have another treatment available for people with MS, one with a more convenient delivery option, this benefit is overshadowed by the high list price,” said , executive vice president of advocacy for the National MS Society. “To have a new MS treatment priced just shy of six figures a year is disheartening,” Talente told Healthline. “This also illustrates the distorting effect of drug prices in the United States.” Talente said price and a company’s commitment to its patients go hand in hand. Choosing which medication is right is a basic risk benefit equation,” added West. “It is a different equation for everybody. More options mean a better chance to find a great solution for each patient. It’s about matching the right medicine to the right patient at the right time.” West was a paid consultant for Mavenclad and has been compensated by Novartis on other projects in an advisory manner.

Get the latest public health information from CDC » Stem cell transplants may halt progression of multiple sclerosis NIH-funded study yields encouraging early results. Three-year outcomes from an ongoing clinical trial suggest that high-dose immunosuppressive therapy followed by transplantation of a person's own blood-forming stem cells may induce sustained remission in some people with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). RRMS is the most common form of MS, a progressive autoimmune disease in which the immune system attacks the brain and spinal cord. The trial is funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health, and conducted by the NIAID-funded . Three years after the treatment, called high-dose immunosuppressive therapy and autologous hematopoietic cell transplant or HDIT/HCT, nearly 80 percent of trial participants had survived without experiencing an increase in disability, a relapse of MS symptoms or new brain lesions. Investigators observed few serious early complications or unexpected side effects, although many participants experienced expected side effects of high-dose immunosuppression, including infections and gastrointestinal problems. The three-year findings are published in the Dec. 29, 2014, online issue of JAMA Neurology. “These promising results support the need for future studies to further evaluate the benefits and risks of HDIT/HCT and directly compare this treatment strategy to current MS therapies,” said NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, M.D. “If the findings from this study are confirmed, HDIT/HCT may become a potential therapeutic option for people with this often-debilitating disease, particularly those who have not been helped by standard treatments.” Scientists estimate that MS affects more than 2.3 million people worldwide. Symptoms can vary widely and may include disturbances in speech, vision and movement. Most people with MS are diagnosed with RRMS, which is characterized by periods of relapse or flare up of symptoms followed by periods of recovery or remission. Over years, the disease can worsen and shift to a more progressive form. In the study, researchers tested the effectiveness of HDIT/HCT in 25 volunteers with RRMS who had relapsed and experienced worsened neurological disability while taking standard medications. Doctors collected blood-forming stem cells from participants and then gave them high-dose chemotherapy to destroy their immune systems. The doctors returned the stem cells to the participants to rebuild and reset their immune systems. “Notably, participants did not receive any MS drugs after transplant, yet most remained in remission after three years,” said Daniel Rotrosen, M.D., director of NIAID’s Division of Allergy, Immunology and Transplantation. “In contrast, other studies have shown that the best alternative MS treatments induce much shorter remissions and require long-term use of immunosuppressive drugs that can cause serious side effects.” The study researchers plan to follow participants for a total of five years, recording all side effects associated with the treatment. Final results from this and similar studies promise to help inform the design of larger trials to further evaluate HDIT/HCT in people with MS. The work was sponsored by NIAID, NIH, and conducted by the ITN (contract number N01 AI015416) and NIAID-funded statistical and clinical coordinating centers (contract numbers HHSN272200800029C and HHSN272200900057C).

There are several different types of MS, including relapsing-remitting, progressive and fulminant. The severity of your condition depends on the type of MS you have. Symptoms of MS can include numbness, difficulty walking, fatigue and weakness in one or more body part. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a central nervous system disorder — that is, it affects the brain and spinal cord and spares the nerves and muscles that leave the spinal cord. MS is an inflammatory disorder in which infection-fighting white blood cells enter the nervous system and cause injury. It is a demyelinating disorder because the myelin sheath that protects nerves is stripped off during inflammation. When this happens, the nerves cannot conduct electricity as well as they should, causing various symptoms. Symptoms may be the type that come and go over time (relapsing-remitting MS) or progress over time (progressive MS). MS can happen to just about anyone and is long-term. Are there different types of multiple sclerosis (MS)? MS varies from patient to patient so that each individual has their own set of symptoms, problems, and their own course. There are people who have MS so mildly that they never even know that they have it. Of course, there are also others that have it severely. It is really a spectrum that ranges from mild to severe. An international panel of experts developed a classification of MS in 1999 that most neurologists use today: : Patients have attacks of symptoms/signs, with or without recovery, but between attacks have no interval worsening. : This is often after a few years of relapsing-remitting MS. The pattern changes from a relapsing pattern to progressive in between attacks, usually with fewer attacks. : This involves a gradual onset from the beginning and no attacks. : This is a rare form, and begins with a progressive course, while later developing attacks. : This is a rare form, and is very severe, rapidly progressive MS. Is there such a thing as benign multiple sclerosis (MS)? The term, ""benign MS,"" is not part of the international classification. It is used when people have had MS for many years without developing significant measurable disability. Recent studies have shown that it cannot be predicted early in the disease and so the term can only really be used retrospectively, after people have done very well with MS for many years. What are the risk factors of multiple sclerosis (MS)? There has been extensive research about MS over the past 50 years. While we still do not know the cause of MS, we know that it is an inflammatory disorder of the central nervous system that occurs in people with a tendency to such a problem. We know that about 350,000 people in the United States have MS, about one in a 1,000 people. We know that it is more common further north and south of the equator, though we are still unsure why this is. Females tend to get MS about three times as often as males, a rate which is similar to other immune diseases. It is more common in Caucasians, but can occur in other populations. It is not contagious nor is it infectious. There may be a link with reduced vitamin D levels and perhaps with decreased sun exposure. We know that there is a genetic component to MS. Having a mother or father with MS increases the risk of having MS to about 3 to 5% lifetime, and having an identical twin with MS increases the risk to about 30%. However, many people with MS have no close family members with the disease. There is nothing that an individual with MS either did to cause the disease to happen, or can avoid to stop the disease from following its natural course. We know that emotional stress may increase the symptoms of MS. We also know that attacks of MS are more likely after infections. There does not seem to be any association with physical trauma or surgical procedures and MS, nor do these seem to make MS worse. There has been widespread research about MS over the past 50 years. We do not know the cause of MS, but do know that it is an inflammatory disorder of the central nervous system that occurs in people with a tendency to such a problem. We know that about 350,000 people in the United States have MS, about 1 in 1,000 people. We know that it is more common further north and south of the equator. Although we are still unsure exactly why this is. Females tend to get MS about three times as often as males, a rate similar to other immune diseases. MS is more common in Caucasians, but can occur in other populations. It is not contagious, nor is it infectious. Did I do anything to bring on the multiple sclerosis (MS) or make it worse? As far as we know there are no activities that specifically cause MS or make it worse. People with MS may not tolerate heat as well as they used to and may need to avoid particularly hot or humid situations. There is evidence that having infections makes having an exacerbation of MS more likely. There does not appear to be a link to trauma. However, emotional stress has been linked to a worsening of MS symptoms. Having MS is not the fault of people who have it; it can happen to anyone. Is there anything new that we know about multiple sclerosis (MS)? Multiple sclerosis is being studied actively in many research institutions around the world, and new knowledge is being added constantly. For example, we now know that even with early MS, the nerve fibers themselves (the axons) are affected more than we knew before. We know from MRI studies that new lesions (abnormal areas in the brain or spinal cord) occur about 5 to10 times as often as people with MS have new symptoms; that is, much of the disease occurs 'under the radar scope'. We know that myelin repair occurs in the central nervous system all the time. Some groups feel there are different types of immune or pathological processes going on that we call MS, and perhaps MS may be many different disorders that we have lumped together. Do any other diseases look like multiple sclerosis (MS)? When neurologists evaluate MS they are also considering other diagnoses. While MS is the most likely cause of typical white matter changes and symptoms in an otherwise healthy young person, there are some other diseases that we consider and occasionally diagnose. These include a vitamin B12 deficiency that can cause an MS-like illness, and rarely, , which may have symptoms that suggest MS. The MRI is very useful in ruling out many other disorders that could be confused with MS, and the blood tests and spinal fluid may also be helpful in diagnosing other diseases. What are some early symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS)? MS varies from person to person so there is no 'standard' set of symptoms for MS. However, we know that common symptoms of MS include: Numbness or tingling in various parts of the body. Lhermitte's phenomenon, a symptom in which people feel electrical tingling or shocks down their back, arms or legs when they bend their neck forwards. Urinary symptoms, such as hesitancy when trying to urinate, or a feeling of urgency (when you have to go, you have to go). There is no way to predict which symptoms one person might develop. MS varies from person to person so there is no ‘standard’ set of symptoms for MS. However we know that common symptoms of MS include numbness or tingling in various parts of the body, weakness of one or more parts of the body, walking difficulties, dizziness, fatigue, visual blurring and occasionally double vision. Patients may also have a symptom called Lhermitte’s phenomenon, in which they feel electrical tingling or shocks down their back, arms or legs when they bend their neck forwards. Sometimes people notice hesitancy when they try to urinate or may find that 'when they have to go, they have to go’. There is no way to predict which symptoms one person might develop. The usual course of MS is to have periods of time where things are relatively stable, followed by times when, over a few days or weeks, new symptoms occur or old symptoms worsen. This relatively rapid worsening is known as an exacerbation (also known as an attack, or a relapse). In others with MS, there may be a tendency to progress in that symptoms gradually worsen over time (months to years). MS varies from patient to patient so that each individual has their own set of symptoms, problems, and their own course. There are people who have MS so mildly that they never even know that they have it. Of course, there are also others that have it severely. It is really a spectrum that ranges from mild to severe. An international panel of experts developed a classification of MS in 1999 that most neurologists use today. : Patients have attacks of symptoms/signs, with or without recovery, but between attacks have no interval worsening. : This is often after a few years of relapsing-remitting MS. The pattern changes from a relapsing pattern to progressive in between attacks, usually with fewer attacks. : Gradual onset from the beginning, no attacks. : This is a rare form, and begins with a progressive course, while later developing attacks. : Very severe, rapidly progressive MS. This is a rare form of MS. Why do I have symptoms with multiple sclerosis (MS)? MS damages the myelin sheath surrounding the nerve cells of the brain and spinal cord. Scarring from this damage can block or slow nerve impulses in areas of the brain (neurological damage). As a direct result of MS, you may lack coordination and feel tired, and have weakness, involuntary movements, muscle stiffness (spasticity), or pain. Symptoms such as these are called ""primary symptoms."" Primary symptoms of MS can make you move less. As a result, you may feel tightness, pain and weakness, especially in the muscles and joints. These symptoms, which are not a direct result of MS, are called ""secondary symptoms."" Why do people with multiple sclerosis (MS) have depression? is very common in people with multiple sclerosis (MS). In fact, symptoms of depression severe enough to require medical intervention affect up to half of all people with MS at some point during their illness. Depression may be the result of a difficult situation or stress. It is easy to understand how having MS, with its potential for progressing to permanent disability, can bring on depression. Depression might be actually caused by MS. MS may affect the insulating myelin that surrounds nerves which transmit signals affecting mood. Depression is also a side effect of some drugs used to treat MS, such as steroids or interferon. How does heat or humidity impact people with multiple sclerosis (MS)? Heat or high humidity can cause many people with to experience a temporary worsening of their symptoms. Doctors believe that this occurs because heat causes nerves (whose myelin covering has been removed by MS) to conduct electrical signals even less efficiently. For reasons that are not well understood, extremely cold temperatures and changes in temperature can also cause MS symptoms, usually , to flare. Reviewed by a Cleveland Clinic medical professional.

Although we are still unsure exactly why this is. Females tend to get MS about three times as often as males, a rate similar to other immune diseases. MS is more common in Caucasians, but can occur in other populations. It is not contagious, nor is it infectious. Did I do anything to bring on the multiple sclerosis (MS) or make it worse? As far as we know there are no activities that specifically cause MS or make it worse. People with MS may not tolerate heat as well as they used to and may need to avoid particularly hot or humid situations. There is evidence that having infections makes having an exacerbation of MS more likely. There does not appear to be a link to trauma. However, emotional stress has been linked to a worsening of MS symptoms. Having MS is not the fault of people who have it; it can happen to anyone. Is there anything new that we know about multiple sclerosis (MS)? Multiple sclerosis is being studied actively in many research institutions around the world, and new knowledge is being added constantly. For example, we now know that even with early MS, the nerve fibers themselves (the axons) are affected more than we knew before. We know from MRI studies that new lesions (abnormal areas in the brain or spinal cord) occur about 5 to10 times as often as people with MS have new symptoms; that is, much of the disease occurs 'under the radar scope'. We know that myelin repair occurs in the central nervous system all the time. Some groups feel there are different types of immune or pathological processes going on that we call MS, and perhaps MS may be many different disorders that we have lumped together. Do any other diseases look like multiple sclerosis (MS)? When neurologists evaluate MS they are also considering other diagnoses. While MS is the most likely cause of typical white matter changes and symptoms in an otherwise healthy young person, there are some other diseases that we consider and occasionally diagnose. These include a vitamin B12 deficiency that can cause an MS-like illness, and rarely, , which may have symptoms that suggest MS. The MRI is very useful in ruling out many other disorders that could be confused with MS, and the blood tests and spinal fluid may also be helpful in diagnosing other diseases. What are some early symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS)? MS varies from person to person so there is no 'standard' set of symptoms for MS. However, we know that common symptoms of MS include: Numbness or tingling in various parts of the body. Lhermitte's phenomenon, a symptom in which people feel electrical tingling or shocks down their back, arms or legs when they bend their neck forwards. Urinary symptoms, such as hesitancy when trying to urinate, or a feeling of urgency (when you have to go, you have to go). There is no way to predict which symptoms one person might develop. MS varies from person to person so there is no ‘standard’ set of symptoms for MS. However we know that common symptoms of MS include numbness or tingling in various parts of the body, weakness of one or more parts of the body, walking difficulties, dizziness, fatigue, visual blurring and occasionally double vision. Patients may also have a symptom called Lhermitte’s phenomenon, in which they feel electrical tingling or shocks down their back, arms or legs when they bend their neck forwards. Sometimes people notice hesitancy when they try to urinate or may find that 'when they have to go, they have to go’. There is no way to predict which symptoms one person might develop. The usual course of MS is to have periods of time where things are relatively stable, followed by times when, over a few days or weeks, new symptoms occur or old symptoms worsen. This relatively rapid worsening is known as an exacerbation (also known as an attack, or a relapse). In others with MS, there may be a tendency to progress in that symptoms gradually worsen over time (months to years). MS varies from patient to patient so that each individual has their own set of symptoms, problems, and their own course. There are people who have MS so mildly that they never even know that they have it. Of course, there are also others that have it severely. It is really a spectrum that ranges from mild to severe. An international panel of experts developed a classification of MS in 1999 that most neurologists use today. : Patients have attacks of symptoms/signs, with or without recovery, but between attacks have no interval worsening. : This is often after a few years of relapsing-remitting MS. The pattern changes from a relapsing pattern to progressive in between attacks, usually with fewer attacks. : Gradual onset from the beginning, no attacks. : This is a rare form, and begins with a progressive course, while later developing attacks. : Very severe, rapidly progressive MS. This is a rare form of MS. Why do I have symptoms with multiple sclerosis (MS)? MS damages the myelin sheath surrounding the nerve cells of the brain and spinal cord. Scarring from this damage can block or slow nerve impulses in areas of the brain (neurological damage). As a direct result of MS, you may lack coordination and feel tired, and have weakness, involuntary movements, muscle stiffness (spasticity), or pain. Symptoms such as these are called ""primary symptoms."" Primary symptoms of MS can make you move less. As a result, you may feel tightness, pain and weakness, especially in the muscles and joints. These symptoms, which are not a direct result of MS, are called ""secondary symptoms."" Why do people with multiple sclerosis (MS) have depression? is very common in people with multiple sclerosis (MS). In fact, symptoms of depression severe enough to require medical intervention affect up to half of all people with MS at some point during their illness. Depression may be the result of a difficult situation or stress. It is easy to understand how having MS, with its potential for progressing to permanent disability, can bring on depression. Depression might be actually caused by MS. MS may affect the insulating myelin that surrounds nerves which transmit signals affecting mood. Depression is also a side effect of some drugs used to treat MS, such as steroids or interferon. How does heat or humidity impact people with multiple sclerosis (MS)? Heat or high humidity can cause many people with to experience a temporary worsening of their symptoms. Doctors believe that this occurs because heat causes nerves (whose myelin covering has been removed by MS) to conduct electrical signals even less efficiently. For reasons that are not well understood, extremely cold temperatures and changes in temperature can also cause MS symptoms, usually , to flare. Reviewed by a Cleveland Clinic medical professional.

There are several different types of MS, including relapsing-remitting, progressive and fulminant. The severity of your condition depends on the type of MS you have. Symptoms of MS can include numbness, difficulty walking, fatigue and weakness in one or more body part. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a central nervous system disorder — that is, it affects the brain and spinal cord and spares the nerves and muscles that leave the spinal cord. MS is an inflammatory disorder in which infection-fighting white blood cells enter the nervous system and cause injury. It is a demyelinating disorder because the myelin sheath that protects nerves is stripped off during inflammation. When this happens, the nerves cannot conduct electricity as well as they should, causing various symptoms. Symptoms may be the type that come and go over time (relapsing-remitting MS) or progress over time (progressive MS). MS can happen to just about anyone and is long-term. Are there different types of multiple sclerosis (MS)? MS varies from patient to patient so that each individual has their own set of symptoms, problems, and their own course. There are people who have MS so mildly that they never even know that they have it. Of course, there are also others that have it severely. It is really a spectrum that ranges from mild to severe.

The pattern changes from a relapsing pattern to progressive in between attacks, usually with fewer attacks. : This involves a gradual onset from the beginning and no attacks. : This is a rare form, and begins with a progressive course, while later developing attacks. : This is a rare form, and is very severe, rapidly progressive MS. Is there such a thing as benign multiple sclerosis (MS)? The term, ""benign MS,"" is not part of the international classification. It is used when people have had MS for many years without developing significant measurable disability. Recent studies have shown that it cannot be predicted early in the disease and so the term can only really be used retrospectively, after people have done very well with MS for many years. What are the risk factors of multiple sclerosis (MS)? There has been extensive research about MS over the past 50 years. While we still do not know the cause of MS, we know that it is an inflammatory disorder of the central nervous system that occurs in people with a tendency to such a problem. We know that about 350,000 people in the United States have MS, about one in a 1,000 people.

Females tend to get MS about three times as often as males, a rate which is similar to other immune diseases. It is more common in Caucasians, but can occur in other populations. It is not contagious nor is it infectious. There may be a link with reduced vitamin D levels and perhaps with decreased sun exposure. We know that there is a genetic component to MS. Having a mother or father with MS increases the risk of having MS to about 3 to 5% lifetime, and having an identical twin with MS increases the risk to about 30%. However, many people with MS have no close family members with the disease. There is nothing that an individual with MS either did to cause the disease to happen, or can avoid to stop the disease from following its natural course. We know that emotional stress may increase the symptoms of MS. We also know that attacks of MS are more likely after infections. There does not seem to be any association with physical trauma or surgical procedures and MS, nor do these seem to make MS worse. There has been widespread research about MS over the past 50 years.

0b67a1c5-7dd6-41c5-a9c6-3fcfa0b9932c,"Primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) is an uncommon form of MS that affects approximately 10-15% of MS patients. In PPMS, symptoms steadily get worse over time without frequent relapses or remission. Unlike relapse-remitting MS (RRMS), which affects women more than men, PPMS affects an equal number of both genders. PPMS is usually diagnosed in older individuals between the ages of 40 to 60, yet it is sometimes diagnosed beyond this range. Early symptoms in PPMS develop slowly over a period of time and usually involve issues with walking and general mobility. The pace and progress of PPMS can vary from patient to patient. In some people with PPMS, relapses can occur along with steady disease progression. This is referred to as progressive-relapsing MS (PRMS). The diagnosis of PPMS is particularly difficult as it is diagnosed in the 40s and 50s when other health issues related to mobility tend to develop. Since PPMS is characterized by a gradual and steady accumulation of disability over time, the criteria for diagnosis of PPMS are different from that of other forms of MS. Worsening of neurological function for one year without remission Indications of immune activity in the CNS (such as elevated IgG index) These criteria often take a long time to develop, hence PPMS diagnosis usually taking two to three years more than diagnosis of RRMS. Treatment for PPMS mainly aims at managing neurological symptoms. Ongoing drug trials focus on reducing relapses and slowing down the disease progression rate as well as the build-up of disability. Currently, no FDA-approved medications are available for the treatment of PPMS. This is mainly because most approved therapies work towards reducing inflammation, which is not a characteristic of PPMS. Many clinical trials are underway to find an effective drug for this disease. Drug prices beat inflation all the way even with discounts Integrin b3 and ACE2 linked by short linear motifs enabling endocytosis and autophagy of SARS-CoV-2 Study sheds light on myelin's role in 'chemobrain' and multiple sclerosis Wellbeing and rehabilitation of people affected with PPMS is important and can be achieved by following a healthy diet and exercise regimen. Unsteadiness in walking and muscle weakness can be tackled with the help of an occupational therapist and a physiotherapist, while a dietician can help develop an appropriate meal plan based on the patient’s individual mobility levels. Neurologic examination and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) must be performed at least once a year to evaluate disease progression and activity. Characterizing the disease course at regular intervals is important as it helps in updating treatment methods. If PPMS is active with relapses or fresh MRI activity, a disease-modifying therapy (DMT) should be started so as to mitigate the risk of an attack. If PPMS is stable with no progression or activity, treatment should focus on rehabilitation so as to maintain function and symptom management. If PPMS is inactive with no relapses or activity, but with disease progression and build-up of disability, treatment should aim at maintaining function and promoting independence of the patient. PPMS does not involve relapses due to inflammation; hence, patients with this type of MS have fewer lesions or plaques in the brain with fewer inflammatory cells. Relapsing forms such as RRMS and secondary progressive MS (SPMS) are characterized by frequent inflammatory attacks. The age of onset for relapsing forms of MS is about 10 years earlier than that for PPMS. PPMS tends to affect walking and mobility more than other functions, while relapsing MS types cause numbness, spasticity, vision problems, and cognitive decline. http://www.nationalmssociety.org/What-is-MS/Types-of-MS/Primary-progressive-MS/Treating-Primary-Progressive-MS http://www.nationalmssociety.org/What-is-MS/Types-of-MS/Primary-progressive-MS https://www.mssociety.org.uk/what-is-ms/types-of-ms/primary-progressive-ppms Last Updated: Feb 27, 2019 Susha has a Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) degree in Chemistry and Master of Science (M.Sc) degree in Biochemistry from the University of Calicut, India.

If the other approved disease-modifying medications are helpful in relapsing MS, why don’t they work in PPMS? My MS just keeps getting worse. Does everyone with PPMS become severely disabled? I’ve read about all the different symptoms that MS can cause, but since my diagnosis with PPMS my biggest problem has been with my walking. Will I develop all the other symptoms as well? What medications are available to treat primary progressive MS (PPMS)? One medication – ® has been approved by U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) to treat primary progressive MS as well as relapsing forms of MS, which include clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting disease (RRMS) and active secondary progressive disease (SPMS with relapses).  In addition to this disease-modifying therapy, a wide range of symptomatic medications and rehabilitation strategies are used to manage PPMS. If the other approved disease-modifying medications are helpful in relapsing MS, why don’t they work in PPMS? The other we currently have available primarily target inflammation in the central nervous system (CNS). They have all been shown to reduce the number of acute relapses (also called attacks or exacerbations) and number of new lesions (also called plaques) on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. PPMS involves much less inflammation and more gradual destruction and loss of nerve fibers. As a result, people with PPMS tend to have fewer brain lesions than people with relapsing MS, and the lesions tend to contain fewer inflammatory cells. The available disease-modifying medications are not effective in slowing the nerve damage that occurs in PPMS.   My MS just keeps getting worse. Does everyone with PPMS become severely disabled? MS is a variable and unpredictable disease. Although PPMS is characterized by fairly steady progression, one person’s symptoms may progress differently or more rapidly than someone else’s symptoms. Because spinal cord lesions (also called plaques) are more common than brain lesions in PPMS, problems with walking are very common, but other symptoms may occur as well. The medication, ®, has been approved to treat PPMS as well as relapsing forms of MS. This medication may slow the progression you are experiencing. At the same time, ongoing and can help you stay active, maintain your safety and independence, and enhance your quality of life.  I’ve read about all the different symptoms that MS can cause, but since my diagnosis with PPMS my biggest problem has been with my walking. Will I develop all the other symptoms as well? Because people with PPMS tend to have more spinal cord lesions than brain lesions, problems with walking are very common. In fact, the onset of PPMS is usually characterized by gradually increasing walking problems and fatigue. Lesions in the brain could cause other symptoms to develop, including visual disturbance, cognitive changes, mood changes, balance problems, and tremor, among others. However, there is no way to predict this ahead of time, and your primary challenge may continue to be with walking.

To be considered a true relapse, symptoms must be present for at least 24 to 48 hours, and not be associated with other factors that might mimic an acute attack, such as a urinary tract infection, anxiety, depression, hot weather, and extreme exercise. Relapses occur with relapsing-remitting, progressive-relapsing, and sometimes secondary-progressive forms of MS. Written instructions that provide specific directions to doctors and family regarding a person’s end-of-life choices in advance, should this person become unable to make these decisions on his or her own when needed. Typically include appointing a healthcare representative or proxy as well as creating a “living will.” A brace that holds and angles the foot and ankle in the best position for maximum comfort and mobility. This device can also relieve stress on the knee. A protein produced by the body’s immune system when it detects foreign substances, called antigens. Examples of antigens include microorganisms (such as bacteria, fungi, parasites, and viruses) and chemicals. Antibodies may be produced when the immune system mistakenly targets healthy tissue, which happens with an autoimmune disorder. Each type of antibody is unique and defends the body against one specific type of antigen. A foreign molecule or substance that stimulates the immune system to activate a series of events to eliminate the antigen. In MS, the immune system misdirects the reactivity to antigens to damage the CNS, which is referred to as autoimmunity. Tools, products, or types of equipment that help someone perform tasks and activities. They may help individuals to move around, see, communicate, eat, or get dressed. Some are high-tech tools, such as computers (which can be adapted to meet various disabilities such as reduced vision or dexterity/mobility problems). Others are much simpler, like a “reacher” – a tool that helps someone to grasp an object that is difficult to reach. Any service or tool that can help a person with a disability perform activities that might otherwise be difficult or not be possible. Inability to coordinate walking movements. The decrease in the volume of brain or muscle tissue often associated with MS. When the body’s own immune system attacks its own tissue, it is known as an autoimmune disease. MS is believed to be an autoimmune disease. The ANS helps control blood flow to and from the extremities; it also controls: heart rate; blood pressure; bowel, bladder, and sexual activity; and other automatic bodily functions. The wire-like nerve fibers that conduct signals between neurons (nerves of the brain and spinal cord). Axons have a protective myelin covering and are found in the white matter of the brain. Damaged nerves that are unable to efficiently conduct impulse flow. Immune-system cells that produce antibodies to fight against “foreign invaders” (such as bacteria or viruses) within the body and help to regulate other immune cells. These cells have been shown to be an element of the autoimmune destruction seen in MS. The Babinski reflex occurs after the sole of the foot has been firmly stroked. The big toe then moves upward or toward the top surface of the foot. The other toes fan out. This reflex is normal in children up to 2-years old. It disappears as the child gets older. When the Babinski reflex is present in a child older than 2 years or in an adult, it is often a sign of a brain or nervous-system disorder. Multiple sclerosis is among the disorders that could be indicated by this reflex in people older than 2 years. Bell’s palsy is the most common cause of facial paralysis. It usually affects just one side of the face. Symptoms appear suddenly and are at their worst about 48 hours after they start. They can range from mild to severe and include twitching, weakness, paralysis, drooping eyelid or corner of mouth, drooling, dry eye or mouth, excessive tearing in the eye, and impaired ability to taste. Scientists think that a viral infection makes the facial nerve swell or become inflamed. Individuals are most likely to get Bell’s palsy if pregnant, diabetic, or sick with a cold or flu. It can also occur with multiple sclerosis. Three out of four patients improve without treatment. With or without treatment, most people begin to get better within two weeks and recover completely within three to six months. A protective barrier that lines the blood vessels, this layer of cells is designed to prevent damaging cells and other substances in the blood (including those that could cause disease) from entering the brain, optic nerves, and spinal cord of the CNS. Consists of the brain, optic nerves, and spinal cord and functions to send and receive nerve impulses throughout the body. The liquid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. Prior to a diagnosis of MS, CIS is a single attack (or the appearance of one or more symptoms characteristic of MS), with a very high risk of developing MS, when no other diseases or causes for symptoms are apparent. A group of mental processes that include functions such as memory, decision making, and concentration, which is the ability to focus on specific tasks and planning. Some of the cognitive functions typically affected in people with MS include: information processing; perceiving; attending/responding to incoming information; information-processing speed; cognitive flexibility, such as attending to multiple stimuli at the same time (“multi-tasking”); problems with storage, manipulation, and retrieval of information; and executive function, which includes planning, working memory, attention, and problem-solving. A type of steroid that works by reducing inflammation in the CNS. A steroid first used to treat MS relapses in 1951. Small proteins that may stimulate or inhibit the function of other cells. They connect to specific receptors found on the surface of cells and send messages from one cell to another. They can stimulate or inhibit the inflammation process. Damage to the protective (insulating) covering of the nerves (myelin) of the CNS, causing interruptions in the flow of nerve impulses in the CNS. This can ultimately affect a wide range of function. Double vision resulting from lesions in the brain stem, a part of the nervous system between the brain and cervical spinal cord. Neither the participants nor the medical staff administering or evaluating the new treatment are told who is receiving the drug and who is receiving the placebo or other drug being compared to the test drug. Speech that is slurred or poorly articulated; it can involve a loss of volume control, unnatural emphasis on words or sentences, and a slower rate of speaking. Type of pain that is experienced as a burning, aching, or “pins and needles” type of sensation under the skin. For some, this can be painful; for others, it is more bothersome. Disorder causing changes in the quality of speech, such as a breathless quality to the voice, or speech that sounds harsh. An electrical test used to evaluate nerve and muscle problems. Evoked potentials measure the speed of the brain’s response to visual, auditory (sound), or sensory (feeling) stimuli to the central nervous system, using electrodes (taped to the patient’s head) and a computer. This system measures the time for an impulse to travel from the eye, ear, arm, or leg to the brain. This 10-point scale (from 1 to 10 with half points) measures degrees of disability, largely in terms of mobility. Points 1 to 3 on the scale are primarily used to measure function; points 4 to 9 measure mobility. Half points are used for higher clarity. An MS-like disease in animals, induced through the injection of myelin plus adjuvant (a substance that enhances the body’s response), to enable investigators to see how experimental treatments affect this MS-like disorder (often in mice). A type of dye given via injection prior to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). It serves to enhance areas of active inflammation and blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown. A procedure to help bring urinary symptoms under control by inserting a catheter (a specially designed thin tube) into the urinary opening to drain urine from the bladder, for people who cannot empty their bladder normally (see neurogenic bladder). An electric shock-like sensation down the spine and legs when the neck is flexed forward; approximately 40 percent of individuals with MS experience this type of pain, although it usually does not require any treatment. It is often an indication of myelin damage in the spinal-cord area. Also known as a spinal tap, LP is a procedure where a very thin needle is inserted at the lower back and a small amount of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is collected to look for induced changes or other problems. A type of white blood cell that plays a strong role in the body’s immune system, which works to defend the body against foreign bodies and disease. In MS, the lymphocytes may be misdirected to cause damage to the central nervous system. Some lymphocytes help to control the MS damage (T-regulatory cells). Type of white blood cell that works to ingest and destroy foreign substances. Scan of the brain and/or spine. The MRI uses a computer, radiofrequency stimulator, and a large electromagnet to provide a picture of the brain. Monoclonal antibodies are produced to defend the body and are derived from cells that are identical (cloned from a single cell and then replicated). They are produced from animal tissue, most commonly laboratory mice. Humanized monoclonal antibodies are antibodies from non-human species whose protein sequences have been modified to increase their similarity to antibodies produced naturally in humans. Monoclonal antibodies are an important type of medication, as they can be specifically targeted to perform a particular action, which is desirable when trying to impact a complex structure like the immune system. The name of all monoclonal antibodies ends with “mab.” These antibodies attack and destroy specific inflammatory lymphocytes that may be damaging the CNS in MS. A scale that measures lower-limb function (walking), upper-limb function (arm movements), and cognition. Myelin is a fatty protein that serves as a protective covering and insulation to the nerves (called axons) that work like wires to carry messages to and from the CNS. Bladder problems resulting from demyelination in the nervous system pathways that control the muscles of the bladder and the sphincters of the urinary tract. The three categories of bladder problems are usually referred to as “failure to store” (small, spastic bladder), “failure to empty” (large, flaccid bladder), and “dyssynergia,” which is a disconnect between the muscles of the bladder wall and the urinary sphincter. Involuntary movements of the eyes that result from lesions in the brain stem, a part of the nervous system between the brain and cervical spinal cord. It typically is an uncontrolled side-to-side (horizontal) or up-and-down (vertical) movements of the eye. It can be asymptomatic (causing no visual problems) or severe enough to disturb vision. Objects may appear to jump or move unpredictably as the two eyes no longer coordinate well with each other. Nystagmus can be more of a nuisance than a major problem and is usually temporary. It may sometimes distort vision. Abnormal immune proteins called immunoglobulins. These are present in the CSF of roughly 90 percent of individuals with MS, however, they can occur with several other neurological disorders. Since the introduction of the MRI, CSF analysis is used less often, but it can be helpful in supporting an MS diagnosis if the MRI results are normal or inconclusive. Cells that produce and maintain myelin. Over time, oligodendrocytes may be damaged or lost and fail to repair the damaged myelin. A condition that causes decreased or blurred vision. This is an inflammation of the optic nerve, which – unlike the nerves that innervate most of the body that are part of the peripheral nervous system – is actually part of the central nervous system and is myelinated in the same way as axons in the brain and spinal cord. Tingling, burning, or numbing sensation. Sudden recurrence of a symptom, spasm, or seizure. Area around the cerebro-spinal fluid in the brain. Areas of inflammation and damage in the brain or spinal cord in MS. This form of MS presents a gradual but steady accumulation of neurological problems from the onset, without the presence of relapses and remissions. A progressive course of MS from the onset with acute relapses occurring later in the disease course. Characterized by uncontrolled, inappropriate, and/or exaggerated episodes of crying, laughing, or other emotional display. PBA occurs involuntarily with little or no stimulation to invoke such a response. A temporary worsening of symptoms without actual myelin inflammation or damage, brought on by other influences. These can include other illnesses or infection, over-exercise, a warm environment, depression, exhaustion, and stress. When symptoms flare, checking for a fever is important, since even a minor infection and slight increase in temperature can cause symptoms to appear. A temporary worsening or recurrence of existing symptoms and/or the appearance of new symptoms (also called an “acute attack;” definition shown above), caused by inflammation occurring along the nerves and the myelin. This can range from a few days in duration to a few months, followed by a complete or partial recovery (remission). Acute physical symptoms and neurological signs must be present for at least 24 to 48 hours, without any signs of infection or fever, before the treating physician may consider this type of flare-up to be a true relapse. Treatments may improve recovery time. A course of MS that includes temporary symptom flare-ups (also referred to as relapses, attacks, exacerbations, or bouts), which typically last for one to three months. These are followed by a complete or partial recovery. Reduction and stability in severity of one’s MS, or the disappearance of symptoms. The restoration or repair of myelin (protective covering to the nerves). Characterized by long pauses between syllables and words with loss of melody in speech production; it is a type of dysarthria. Blind spot in the center of the visual field. This phase of MS follows relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) and is reached when the patient experiences a progressive worsening of symptoms. SPMS may occur with or without superimposed relapses. Disease-modifying therapies for MS help to delay the conversion from RRMS to SPMS. A tightness or stiffness of the muscles – occurring typically in the legs (calf or thigh), groin, buttocks, arms, or hands. Immune-system cells that have the ability to increase an immune response within the body, causing inflammation and damage in MS. A spontaneous, sharp or shooting facial pain, often brought on by a light touch or movement. The sensation of “spinning or rotation,” which may occur as the result of lesions in the brainstem areas that coordinate balance.

9c9981ab-400d-4876-a705-fcbb3165e533,"Understanding Secondary-Progressive Multiple Sclerosis — — Secondary-progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) is a form of multiple sclerosis. It’s considered the next stage after relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). With SPMS, there are no longer any signs of remission. This means that the condition is worsening despite treatment. However, treatment is still recommended at times to help reduce attacks and hopefully slow the progression of disability. This stage is common. In fact, most people with MS will develop SPMS at some point if not on an effective disease-modifying therapy (DMT). Knowing the signs of SPMS can help you detect it early. The sooner your treatment starts, the better your doctor will be able to help you reduce new symptoms and worsening of your disease. MS is a chronic autoimmune disease that comes in different forms and affects people differently. According to , about 90 percent of those with MS are initially diagnosed with RRMS. In the RRMS stage, the first noticeable symptoms include: RRMS symptoms can come and go. Some people might not have any symptoms for several weeks or months, a phenomenon called remission. MS symptoms can come back, too, though this is called a flare-up. People can also develop new symptoms. This is called an attack, or relapse. A relapse typically lasts for several days to several weeks. The symptoms can gradually worsen initially and then improve gradually over time without treatment or sooner with IV steroids. RRMS is unpredictable. At some point, many people with RRMS no longer have periods of remission or sudden relapses. Instead, their MS symptoms continue and worsen without any break. Continued, worsening symptoms indicate that RRMS has progressed to SPMS. This usually occurs 10 to 15 years after the first MS symptoms. However, SPMS can be delayed or even possibly prevented if started on effective MS DMTs early on in the disease course. Similar symptoms exist within all forms of MS. But SPMS symptoms are progressive and don’t improve over time. During the early stages of RRMS, symptoms are noticeable, but they aren’t necessarily severe enough to interfere with everyday activities. Once MS progresses to the secondary-progressive stage, symptoms become more challenging. SPMS develops as a result of neuronal loss and atrophy. If you notice your symptoms becoming worse without any remission or noticeable relapse, an MRI scan may aid in the diagnosis. MRI scans can show the level of cell death and brain atrophy. An MRI will show increased contrast during an attack because leaking of the capillaries during an attack causes a greater uptake of the gadolinium dye used in MRI scans. SPMS is marked by the absence of relapses, but it’s still possible to have an attack of symptoms, also known as a flare-up. Flare-ups are usually worse in heat and during times of stress. Currently, there are 14 DMTs used for relapsing forms of MS, including SPMS that continues to have relapses. If you were taking one of these drugs to treat RRMS, your doctor may have you on it until it stops controlling disease activity. Other types of treatment can help improve symptoms and quality of life. These include: Clinical trials test new types of medicine and therapies on volunteers in order to improve treatment for SPMS. This process gives researchers a clearer sense of what’s effective and safe. Volunteers in clinical trials may be among the first to get new treatments, but some risk is involved. The treatments may not help with SPMS, and in some cases, they may come with serious side effects. Importantly, precautions should be in place to keep volunteers safe, as well as protect their personal information. Participants in clinical trials generally need to meet certain guidelines. When deciding whether to take part, it’s important to ask like how long the trial will last, what the potential side effects might include, and why researchers think it’ll help. The lists clinical trials in the United States, though the COVID-19 pandemic may have delayed planned studies. Clinical trials currently listed as recruiting include one for , which may slow the progression of SPMS, as well as research into whether different types of therapy can help people with MS . Another trial aims to test whether can help people with progressive MS stay mobile and protect the brain. And a clinical trial is set to finish later this year of cells. Its goal is to test the safety and efficacy of stem cell treatment in people with progressive MS. Progression refers to symptoms becoming measurably worse over time. At some points, SPMS may be described as “without progression,” meaning it doesn’t seem to be measurably worsening. Progression varies considerably among people with SPMS. In time, some may need to use a wheelchair, but remain able to walk, possibly using a cane or walker. Modifiers are that indicate whether your SPMS is active or inactive. This helps inform conversations with your doctor about possible treatments and what you can expect going forward. For example, in the case of SPMS that’s active, you might discuss new treatment options. In contrast, with absent activity, you and your doctor may discuss using rehabilitation and ways to manage your symptoms with possibly a DMT that has less risk. The average life expectancy for people with MS tends to be about shorter than the general population. It’s not entirely clear why. Apart from severe cases of MS, which are rare, the main causes seem to be other medical conditions that also affect people generally, like cancer and heart and lung disease. Importantly, life expectancy for people with MS has increased in recent decades. It’s important to treat MS in order to manage symptoms and decrease disability worsening. Detecting and treating RRMS early can help prevent the onset of SPMS, but there’s still no cure. Though the disease will progress, it’s important to treat SPMS as early as possible. There’s no cure, but MS isn’t fatal, and medical treatments can significantly improve quality of life. If you have RRMS and are noticing worsening symptoms, it’s time to talk to your doctor. — — More in Finding Balance with Progressing Multiple Sclerosis Lifestyle Modifications That Make a Difference for Secondary Progressive MS Mobility Support Devices for Secondary Progressive MS: Braces, Walking Devices, and More FDA Approves 2 New Multiple Sclerosis Drugs: What You Need to Know New Medication and Treatment Options for Secondary Progressive MS Support for Life with Secondary Progressive MS: Social, Financial, and More Secondary progressive MS (SPMS) is a chronic condition that causes new and more severe symptoms to develop over time.

Comi, Massimo Filippi Objective: We used voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to assess the pattern of regional gray matter (GM) loss in patients with pediatric multiple sclerosis (MS) and its relation with the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score, disease duration, and the extent of T2 lesion load (LL). Methods: From 28 patients with pediatric relapsing-remitting MS (16 girls; mean age = 14.4 years, range = 7 to 16 years) and 21 matched controls, dual-echo and three-dimensional T1-weighted magnetization prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo sequences were acquired. T2 LL was measured using a local thresholding segmentation technique. Data were analyzed using an optimized VBM analysis and statistical parametric mapping. Results: In pediatric patients with MS, mean brain T2 LL was 7.8 mL = 11.3. Intracranial volume did not differ between patients and controls. Compared to controls, patients with pediatric MS had significant GM loss in the thalamus, bilaterally, which was significantly correlated with T2 LL (r=-0.80 for the right thalamus, r=-0.74 for the left thalamus, p < 0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons). No correlation was found between thalamic GM loss, disease duration, and disability. Conclusions: In patients with pediatric multiple sclerosis (MS), differently from what happens in adult-onset MS, gray matter (GM) atrophy seems to involve the thalamus only, with sparing of the cortex and other deep GM nuclei. The correlation found between atrophy and T2 lesion load suggests transsynaptic and Wallerian degenerations as the most likely substrate of tissue loss in the thalamus of these patients. https://doi.org/10.1212/01.wnl.0000291010.54692.85 Dive into the research topics of 'Evidence of thalamic gray matter loss in pediatric multiple sclerosis'.

cd2862c3-2efd-423d-965b-6be71c728046,"Medically reviewed by — — A diagnosis of can be overwhelming at first. The condition itself is complex, and there are so many unknown factors because of the way multiple sclerosis (MS) manifests differently among individuals. That said, you can take actions now that may help you manage PPMS while preventing complications that can get in the way of your quality of life. Your first step is to have an honest conversation with your doctor. Consider bringing this list of 11 questions with you to your appointment as a PPMS discussion guide. The exact cause of PPMS, and all other forms of MS, is unknown. Researchers believe environmental factors and genetics might play a role in the development of MS. Also, according to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), about 15 percent of people with MS have at least one family member with the condition. People who smoke are also more likely to get MS. Your doctor may not be able to tell you how exactly you developed PPMS. However, they might ask questions about your personal and family health histories to gain a better overall picture. PPMS may be if you have at least one brain lesion, at least two spinal cord lesions, or an elevated immunoglobulin G (IgG) index in your spinal fluid. Also, unlike other forms of MS, PPMS may be evident if you’ve had symptoms that continuously worsen for at least a year without remission. In the relapsing-remitting form of MS, during exacerbations (flare-ups), the degree of disability (symptoms) get worse, and then they either go away or partially resolve during remission. PPMS may have periods when the symptoms don’t get worse, but those symptoms don’t lessen to earlier levels. Lesions, or plaques, are found in all forms of MS. These primarily occur on your brain, though they develop more so in your spine in PPMS. Lesions develop as an inflammatory response when your immune system destroys its own myelin. Myelin is the protective sheath that surrounds nerve fibers. These lesions develop over time and are detected through MRI scans. Sometimes diagnosing PPMS can take up to two or three years longer than diagnosing relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), according to the . This is due to the complexity of the condition. If you’ve just received a PPMS diagnosis, it likely stemmed from months or even years of testing and follow-up. If you haven’t received a diagnosis for a form of MS yet, know that it can take a long time to diagnose. This is because your doctor will need to look through multiple MRIs to identify patterns on your brain and spine. The recommends an annual MRI as well as a neurological exam at least once a year. This will help determine whether your condition is relapsing or progressing. Additionally, MRIs can help your doctor chart the course of your PPMS so that they can recommend . Knowing the progression of the disease might help thwart the onset of disability. Your doctor will offer specific follow-up recommendations. You may also need to visit them more often if you start experiencing worsening symptoms. The onset and progression of symptoms in PPMS tend to occur more quickly than in other forms of MS. Therefore, your symptoms may not fluctuate as they would in relapsing forms of the disease but continue to steadily worsen. As PPMS progresses, there’s a risk of disability. Due to more lesions on your spine, PPMS can cause more walking difficulties. You may also experience worsening depression, fatigue, and decision-making skills. In 2017, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved ocrelizumab (Ocrevus), the first medication available for use in treating PPMS. This disease-modifying therapy is also approved to treat RRMS. Research is ongoing to find medications that will reduce the neurological effects of PPMS. Alternative and complementary therapies that have been used for MS include: Safety with alternative therapies is a concern. If you take any medications, herbal supplements might cause interactions. You should only try yoga and tai chi with a certified instructor that’s familiar with MS — this way, they can help you safely modify any poses as needed. Talk to your doctor before trying out any alternative remedies for PPMS. In addition to offering recommendations in these areas, your doctor may also refer you to other types of specialists. These include physical or occupational therapists, dietitians, and support group therapists. Currently, there’s no cure for any form of MS — this includes PPMS. The goal then is to manage your condition to prevent worsening symptoms and disability. Your doctor will help you determine the best course for PPMS management. Don’t be afraid to make follow-up appointments if you feel like you need more management tips.

b798f00f-ab82-425d-bced-df86bc66cfec,"Can Radiology Be Used to Diagnose Multiple Sclerosis? Medically reviewed by — — is a chronic disease of your central nervous system (CNS). It’s thought to be the result of an immune system attack. MS causes demyelination, or the damage of myelin. This is the protective layer that surrounds your nerve fibers. As scar tissue (lesions) forms, it interferes with nerve signals within the CNS. People with relapsing-remitting MS experience periods of increased disease activity followed by remissions. Progressive forms of MS cause symptoms that steadily worsen. There are many symptoms associated with MS, depending on the location of the lesions. Severity of symptoms varies significantly from person to person. Some common symptoms include: balance and coordination problems or unsteady gait Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has made it easier to diagnose MS and monitor disease progression. An MRI can provide different information, depending on how it’s done. Types of MRI and radiology tests that may be used for MS include: Using contrast dye to detect active inflammation, this scan highlights new lesions or lesions that are growing. It can also show dark areas that indicate possible permanent damage. This scan detects all old and new lesions and helps gauge total disease progression. As a more sensitive scan, this test can help identify brain lesions. This test can detect lesions within your spinal cord. This scan, involving radiation, can also detect areas of demyelination, but with less detail than MRI. There’s not much preparation for an MRI, but there are some important considerations. Due to the strong magnetic field, some conditions may make it unsafe or require special preparation. Let your doctor and MRI technician know if you: have an implanted medical device, such as a , drug infusion device, cochlear implant, or aneurysm clips If you’re claustrophobic or anxious about the procedure, tell your doctor in advance. A mild prescription sedative may help. For an MRI of your spine, wear clothing that’s easy to change. Even if you’re only having images taken of your brain, you’ll still need to choose clothes with no metal, such as zippers or snaps. You may be required to wear a hospital gown. You’ll be asked to remove jewelry and other metal objects. You may need to leave your valuables in another room. Most hospitals provide a locker for safekeeping. Your doctor or facility should provide you with instructions before the day of your scheduled test. Preparation for a CT scan is similar to that of an MRI. If your test will be done with contrast dye, you may be asked not to eat solid foods for a few hours before the test. Your MRI may be performed with or without contrast. Contrast dye is given to you through an IV in your arm. You’ll lie on a table that slides into the tube-shaped MRI machine. Earphones help you communicate with the technician, who will monitor from another room. MRI is noisy. You’ll hear loud banging sounds. Some facilities offer music via the earphones to help drown out the noise. You’ll also have a call button in case you feel claustrophobic or anxious. You must remain perfectly still during scanning. Any movement could ruin the scans. The procedure is painless and you won’t feel anything. Length of the procedure depends on how many scans are being done and if they’re done both with and without contrast. It generally takes at least one hour but could take much longer. Like MRI, the CT scanner doesn’t touch you and you won’t feel anything. You’ll be required to remain still. The scanner makes some noise as it moves and captures images. You’ll be able to dress and go home as soon as scanning is complete. If you were given an IV it will be removed. If you took a sedative, you’ll need someone to drive you home. MS was a lot more difficult to diagnose before MRI was available. The detailed images are an excellent way to detect MS lesions, which appear as white spots in the brain or spinal column. However, other things can cause white spots, so they don’t necessarily mean you have MS. A single lesion accompanied by symptoms of MS is usually diagnosed as clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). CIS can sometimes develop into MS. Multiple lesions may indicate MS. The diagnosis usually requires at least two lesions within your CNS that occurred at separate points in time. A radiologist will study the MRI or CT scans and prepare a report for your doctor to share with you. There’s no single test for MS. To make a proper diagnosis, your doctor will consider your clinical evaluation, symptom history, and other test results. Other diagnostic tests may include: This will check for antibodies sometimes found in people with MS and can also help rule out similar conditions. These study how well electrical signals in your CNS work. No blood test can diagnose MS, but they can help rule out quite a few other conditions with similar symptoms. There are a variety of medications used in the treatment of MS: are designed to slow progression and lower the relapse rate. Most are self-injectable, but a few are given intravenously. Some newer drugs are available in pill form. are generally used to reduce inflammation during relapses. Individual symptoms can also be treated. Options may include: medication to treat fatigue, muscle spasms, or other symptoms Your individual outlook depends on the type and severity of the disease, as well other health factors. While there’s no cure for MS, there are a variety of treatments and ways of managing your MS. is close to normal, averaging about seven years less than the general population. This is mainly due to complications or other health problems. It’s rare, but MS can be fatal. Good lifestyle habits not only help you feel better, but they help prevent additional health problems. That’s why you should strive for a well-balanced diet, regular exercise, and maintaining a healthy weight. If you use a disease-modifying drug, it must be taken exactly as directed. Follow up with your doctor regularly. Most people with MS continue to lead active, fulfilling lives. Having some symptoms isn’t enough to conclude you have MS. These symptoms can be caused by a variety of conditions. That’s why it’s important to investigate the cause. Start with your family physician. If necessary, you’ll be referred to a neurologist. Symptoms of MS can come and go, so diagnosis can take time. Radiology tests can be a key in your diagnosis and maintenance. It’s also a good idea to keep a symptom diary. Keep track of your symptoms, when they started, and when they stopped. That information will help your doctor decide on the next steps.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease that affects the central nervous system. It affects more than 25,000 people in Australia and is 3 times more common in women than in men. MS means there is damage to the protective sheath (known as myelin) that surrounds the nerve fibres in . This damage causes scars, or lesions, in the nervous system, meaning that the nerves can’t send signals round the body properly. A person's risk of developing MS is increased if they have a close relative with the condition. The cause of MS is not known, but theories include that it is an ; that it is caused by genetic or environmental factors (it is more common the further away from the equator you live); and that it is caused by a virus. There is currently no known cure for MS although there are treatment options. MS affects different people in different ways, and treatment often involves managing symptoms. What are the different types of multiple sclerosis? — This is the most common form of MS and about 3 in every 4 people with MS begin with a relapsing-remitting stage. With RRMS, new symptoms appear or existing symptoms worsen over a period of days, weeks or even months, followed by a partial or complete recovery, which is then followed by another relapse. For some people, these relapses get worse and the disability stays. Their health gradually declines. This is known as secondary progressive MS (see below). — 1 or 2 people in every 10 with MS are diagnosed with PPMS. These people usually find that their symptoms become gradually worse, with no separate attacks. — Most people with RRMS will eventually experience SPMS. In this form, disability generally worsens slowly, independent of any relapses. MS usually starts with mild symptoms that may or may not get worse over time. Symptoms depend on which part of the central nervous system is affected and how much damage has occurred. problems with controlling the body — like muscle spasms, weakness, loss of coordination and balance tiredness and sensitivity to heat (a hot day or a hot bath, or even a hot cup of tea, can make symptoms worse) other nervous symptom problems — including vertigo, pins and needles, dizziness, neuralgia and problems with eyesight continence problems — including bladder incontinence and constipation changes in memory, in concentration, in reasoning, in emotions, or in mood (such as depression) The symptoms of MS vary widely from person to person. They can also come and go in any one person. MS is unpredictable. A range of tests can be used to diagnose MS, including to detect lesions in the central nervous system, a physical examination to check reflexes and responses, blood tests, and other types of tests to measure nerve activity. Sometimes it can take years to reach a diagnosis because there is no single test for MS. A person will be diagnosed with MS if there is evidence of lesions in different parts of the central nervous system, at different times, with no other explanation than MS. Medicines can delay the progression of MS and reduce the risk of relapses. These are called ‘disease modifying therapies’. Other medicines are used to control symptoms. The best medicine for you depends on the type of MS you have. Talk to your doctor or other health professionals who care for you about the right combination of treatments for your particular situation. Disease modifying therapies work by targeting the immune system. They slow the frequency and severity of attacks so the myelin sheaths are damaged less. These medicines are also called immunotherapies. However, these treatments do not reverse current symptoms and there can be significant side effects. These medicines are usually used for people with relapsing-remitting MS. Steroids can reduce the severity of an MS attack by reducing inflammation and suppressing the immune system. Medicines to suppress the immune system (called immune suppressants) are sometimes used, especially for people with progressive MS. There are medicines available that can ease muscle spasms, pain, continence problems, tiredness, depression and other symptoms. Regular exercise, physiotherapy and occupational therapy can also help reduce symptoms and help you be as active as possible. A well-balanced diet low in fat and high in fibre can help. Regular exercise can strengthen muscles, improve heart health and improve mood. A lot of research, including stem cell research, is focused on prevention, treatment and a cure for MS. There is also help and support available for people with MS, and their carers.

a30ebd0c-fbf2-465c-882d-ef91c9bd57cb,"Innovative approaches in the treatment of multiple sclerosis Blue Latitude Health Senior Associate Consultant Will Frostick delves into the MS treatment landscape and explores some of the cutting-edge treatments on the horizon. Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system (CNS), leading to progressive and permanent disability. It is estimated that  people across the world suffer from MS. The disease impacts everyone differently, with the symptoms ranging from fatigue and vision problems to mental health issues and mobility problems, along with issues with speech and swallowing, and loss of bladder function (to name a few). Sadly, the age of onset is typically 20-40 years and MS is the leading cause of nontraumatic neurologic disability in young people. The pathogenesis of MS consists of two key components: focal inflammatory demyelination, and neurodegeneration. Nerve function is dependent on the ability of electrical signals to flow through the wire-like axons of neurons, which are wrapped in and insulated by myelin sheaths. In the central nervous system (CNS, which includes the brain, optic nerves and spinal cord), myelin extends from octopus-like arms of oligodendrocytes. This myelination supports neuronal signal conductance and the survival of the neurons themselves. However, in MS, lymphocytes mount an auto-immune attack on myelin, leading to damage of the myelin sheath. The demyelinated neurons can then no longer function properly and begin to atrophy and degenerate, causing the symptoms of MS.2 As damage can occur anywhere in the CNS, symptoms are highly varied. There are two main clinical presentations of MS – Relapsing Refractory MS (RRMS) and Progressive MS (PMS). In RRMS symptoms are intermittent but relapses gradually become more frequent, severe and longer-lasting as the disease progresses. However, PMS is characterised by a progressive worsening of symptoms between flareups, without remission. Pathophysiologically, the disease courses of both types overlap. As a result, patients can transition between the types of MS, making monitoring and treating the disease more challenging. For example, PMS is characterised by focal inflammatory lesions (an area of damage or scaring in the CNS, also referred to as plaques) in the early stages only, with more diffuse damage becoming common later on. Focal inflammatory lesions are also a feature throughout RRMS, and it is also possible for RRMS patients to show progressive symptoms in the later stages of the disease.

Clinical assessment identifies mild weakness and sensory changes on the left side of her body, along with mild truncal ataxia and exaggerated deep tendon reflexes affecting both sides of her body. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows minimal new changes (Figure 1A, 1D, 1G), and her lymphocyte count is 400 cells/ mL. Figure. Serial magnetic resonance imaging of the brain at different times (2 months apart) during the course of the disease. (Aâ€“F) Fluid attenuation inversion recovery images; (Gâ€“I) T2-weighted spin-echo images; and (J,K) contrast-enhanced T1- weighted spin-echo images. Mass-like lesion developed in the right frontal periventricular white matter (B) and disappeared 2 months later (C), and showed only faint enhancement (J). On follow-up examination, 3 lesions had developed: 1 in the left basal ganglia (F) and 2 in the pons (I). The right pontine lesion showed only a peripheral enhancement, while the smaller left pontine lesion showed solid faint enhancement (K). Her treatment history began at the time of her MS diagnosis with interferon-beta-1b. She was switched to natalizumab less than a year later in response to numerous relapses and an increasing lesion load on MRI. About one and a half years later, her serum tested positive for John Cunningham polyoma virus (JCV) antibodies, with an index of 0.57. Because of this, in addition to her plan to relocate to an area where natalizumab is unavailable, the patient was switched to fingolimod. Her disease remained stable for the following several years. She explains that about 6 months before her current symptoms developed, she began having sensory changes, including mild tingling in her extremities. At that time, she says she also started to experience increased urinary frequency, especially at night, and urinary urgency with occasional incontinence. Her medical records show an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 1.5, no new lesions on MRI, and a lymphocyte count of 700 cells/mL. Q1: Her symptoms suggest a probable relapse, and the patient is treated with 5 sessions of 1 g intravenous (IV) methylprednisolone (MP). When she returns for follow-up one month later, her mobility has worsened and she is found to have had a generalized tonic clonic seizure. She is started on carbamazepine. At her next appointment, her husband reports that she is experiencing disrupted sleep. She is also uncharacteristically irritable, even with their young daughter. He is also concerned because her speech is becoming difficult to understand, and her memory seems to be deteriorating. Marked cognitive impairment, with short attention span and significant working memory deficit MRC scale score 4/5; worse in the left side with truncal ataxia This evidence of subacute progressive focal neurological deficits, in addition to her previous seizure and current behavioral and cognitive changes, suggests a diagnosis of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). Although her MRI findings are not characteristic of PML, the patient's fingolimod is discontinued in January 2016. One month later, despite some debate with the attending neuroradiologists, clinicians order analysis of the patient's CSF. PCR for JCV is positive with 11 copies/mL. Q2: On confirmation of PML, the patient begins treatment with mirtazepine 30 mg twice daily and mefloquine 250 mg once weekly. This fails to generate any improvement in symptoms. Almost 5 weeks after fingolimod treatment has been stopped, the patient develops acute left-sided paralysis and she is no longer able to walk without assistance. She is readmitted to the hospital. Her EDSS on admission is 6.5. Brain MRI reveals several, even mass-like new enhancing lesions. These findings suggest that she has had a severe MS rebound (Figure 1B, 1E, 1H, 1J). Mefloquine is stopped and mirtazepine dose is reduced to 30 mg at night. She receives 2 consecutive courses of 5 sessions of 1 g IV MP followed 2 weeks later by a course of 30 g daily for 5 days of IV immunoglobulins (IVIG). Further deterioration is noted. In April 2016, MRI reveals even more new enhancing lesions sparing cortical areas (Figure 1C, 1F, 1I, 1K), and her lymphocyte count is 1,200 cells/mL. These developments lead clinicians to suspect she has immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). She receives a further 5 sessions of IV methylprednisone, followed by another course of IVIG. At this point, she begins to stabilize clinically and slowly show some improvement in symptoms. By August 2016, she demonstrates significant improvements and she is started on rituximab. Her mobility improves and her EDSS improves to 5. She continues to improve and show no signs of relapse. In August 2018, she is given her fifth dose of rituximab; her EDSS is 4. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a serious opportunistic infectious disease, has increased in incidence in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients since disease modifying drugs were introduced. Clinicians reporting write that MRI plays an important role in differentiating MS from PML. They caution that PML can present with a variety of atypical changes on MRI, such as small, non-confluent and enhancing lesions or minimal brain changes that can easily be mistakenly attributed to MS. Such misinterpretations can result in delayed diagnosis and inappropriate and potentially harmful treatment with high dose steroids. They add that in PML, small and enhancing lesions may occur early in the disease and have been associated with a better outcome. In this case, clinicians note that MRI evidence of new involvement of periventricular white matter (also more characteristic of new MS lesions), basal ganglia, and pons caused their initial suspicion of PML to be strongly questioned. While MRI is a key diagnostic criterion for PML, it is not required for diagnosis. The American Academy of Neurology for PML include typical clinical presentation and characteristic MRI findings along with a positive JCV PCR in the CSF. In the absence of either of these latter features, the diagnosis is labeled probable PML, which is managed in the same way as definite PML at the discretion of the attending neurologist. The patient reported here had subacute progressive cognitive dysfunction associated with dysarthria and hemiparesis, marked by non-remitting symptoms progressing over many weeks, and seizures which, while rare in MS, affect up to 18% of patients with PML. PML associated with fingolimod is rare, with an estimated risk of 0.069 per 1,000. In suspected PML, diagnosis should be confirmed by CSF analysis for JCV, authors noted. JCV PCR is a rapid, reproducible, and highly specific test (95%-100% specificity; 70% sensitivity. As in this patient's case, copy count may be low early stages of the disease, and may predict a better prognosis. Natalizumab-associated PML is associated with significant morbidity and a mortality rate of 20% or more. Because there are no specific treatments for PML, outcome is largely dependent on early diagnosis based on awareness and – that is, more frequent serum JCV antibody assessment, brain MRI, and earlier CSF analysis for JCV PCR for high-risk patients. Case authors reference numerous papers suggesting that the effectiveness of treatments for PML such as mirtazepine and mefloquine, among others, is unclear, while maraviroc and interleukin-7 have shown promising but inclusive results. They add that they suspect that this patient had PML-IRIS, given her significant clinical deterioration accompanied by excessive new MRI enhancing lesions after 5 weeks of withdrawal from fingolimod. This is typically linked with prior use of natalizumab. The case authors cite clinicians reporting the one of PML-IRIS related to fingolimod alone, who suggested its rarity may be due to the relatively slow immune reconstitution that follows fingolimod withdrawal compared with the rapid immune system recovery after the urgent removal of natalizumab. Clinicians concluded that in patients presenting with typical clinical symptoms of PML without characteristic MRI findings, JCV PCR should be performed to avoid a potential delay in diagnosis, with probable detrimental effect to the patient. 1.

2ab8e4cc-cf30-4db1-953d-c8ac582f829e,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease of the central nervous system (CNS). The CNS consists of the brain, optic nerves, and spinal cord. With MS, areas of the CNS become inflamed, damaging the protective covering (myelin) that surrounds and insulates the nerves (axons). In addition to the myelin, over time, the axons and nerve cells (neurons) within the CNS may also become damaged. This damage is referred to as neurodegeneration. The damage to the protective covering and also to the nerves disrupts the smooth flow of nerve impulses. As a result, messages from the brain and spinal cord going to other parts of the body may be delayed and have trouble reaching their destination – causing the symptoms of MS. Described later in this booklet, these symptoms can include a wide variety of physical, emotional, and cognitive changes. Areas of inflammation and damage are known as lesions, which are viewed on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The changes in size, number, and location of these lesions may determine the type and severity of symptoms. While individuals with relapsing forms of MS are believed to experience more inflammation than those with progressive forms of MS, lesions still occur for individuals with all forms of MS. However, the lesions in progressive forms of MS may be less active and expand more slowly. Shown above is an illustration of two nerve cells. The normal one on the left has a healthy nerve fiber, or axon, protected by myelin (insulation covering the nerve), and is able to transmit signals at a very fast speed – similar to electricity traveling along an electrical cord. The MS nerve cell on the right shows damage to the myelin, and as a result, signals do not travel well along the nerve. MS affects each person differently. For many years, the most common types of MS had been classified as: However, these classifications are changing, and some experts are now grouping relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) and secondary-progressive MS (SPMS) together, as a continuum of the same disease. These are now frequently referred to as “” Additionally, progressive-relapsing MS (PRMS) and primary-progressive MS (PPMS) have also been grouped together. These are now frequently referred to as “” Initially, most people with MS experience symptom flare-ups, which are also known as relapses, exacerbations, or attacks. When someone experiences a relapse, he or she may be having new symptoms or an increase in existing symptoms. These usually persist for a short period of time, from a few days to a few months. Afterward, the symptoms greatly improve or remit completely, and these individuals may remain symptom-free for periods of months or years. This type of MS is known as relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). Approximately 80 to 85 percent of MS patients are initially diagnosed with this form of the disease. Over time, RRMS may advance to secondary-progressive MS (SPMS). This form of MS does not have the dramatic variations in symptoms that RRMS does, but rather has a slow, steady progression – with or without relapses. If relapses do occur, they usually do not fully remit. Without treatment, approximately half of individuals with RRMS convert to SPMS within 10 years. However, with the introduction of long-term disease-modifying therapies (DMTs), fewer individuals advance to this latter form of the disease. Since 1993, and as of mid-2017, a total of 15 DMTs have been approved by the FDA and are available through prescription. All of these approved medications are aimed at slowing disease activity and delaying progression in MS. Individuals who are not initially diagnosed with RRMS may be experiencing a more steady progression of the disease from the onset. Approximately 10 percent of the MS population is diagnosed with primary-progressive MS (PPMS), where individuals experience a steady worsening of symptoms from the start, and do not have periodic relapses and remissions. Approximately 5 percent of patients are initially diagnosed with progressive-relapsing MS (PRMS). This type of MS steadily worsens from the onset, but symptom flare-ups – with or without remissions – are also present. All forms of MS share an underlying pathogenesis, which refers to the origin of a disease and its development. The pathogenesis of MS includes: – this is an autoimmune attack where an individual’s own white blood cells cause damage to his or her own neurons within the brain and spinal cord – this is damage to the myelin covering around nerves, caused by inflammation – this is the shrinking, atrophy, and death of neurons – this is the body’s own attempt to repair damaged myelin, although this repair is often incomplete – this results in multiple scars within the brain and spinal cord at sites of damage from MS Research has shown that individuals with progressive forms of MS have predominantly neurodegeneration and less inflammation. This is in comparison to relapsing-remitting MS, where inflammation is the predominant driver of the disease with less neurodegeneration occurring early in the disease process. Particularly with relapsing forms of MS, inflammation is greatly involved with the initial disease process. This causes damage to the myelin – the protective covering of the nerves in the central nervous system – and eventually damage to the nerves as well. As time progresses and fewer relapses are experienced, the disease involves increasingly less inflammation and more neurodegeneration, which is the breakdown or cell death of nerve cells. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has revolutionized the ability to efficiently diagnose MS, track new inflammatory-disease activity – through the discovery of new T2 bright spots and/or new gadolinium-enhancing lesions (these are areas of disease activity with inflammation) – as well as monitor an individual’s response to MS disease-modifying therapies. Currently, an MRI scan provides the best biomarker for evidence of MS progression. MRI measures that most closely correlate to progression include: accelerated brain atrophy, which refers to faster brain shrinkage development of T1 hypointensities, also referred to as “black holes,” which indicate more neurodegeneration versus inflammation Readers should note that many of the current MS therapies have been shown to decrease the accumulation of bright spots and black holes as viewed on an MRI, along with slowing atrophy rates. MS specialists encourage people with MS to review their MRI scans with their providers and to ask about these two types of disease measures. MSAA may be able to help cover MRI costs through its MRI Access Fund program (certain income limits apply). To learn more, please visit or call . Kurtzke’s Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) is the oldest and most widely accepted measure of MS disability. The EDSS ranges from 0 to 10 in half-point increments, where 0 is a normal examination, 3.0 is moderate disability, 6.0 is where the person needs assistance to walk, and higher numbers refer to greater disability, largely in terms of mobility. Shown above are features from Kurtzke’s Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). Frequently used for clinical evaluation and research study assessments, it mainly focuses on mobility when determining a score. A trained MS clinician assigns a functional score to a patient in eight neurologic systems: pyramidal (referring to the motor system, with weakness and spasticity), cerebellar, brainstem, sensory, bladder and bowel, vision, cerebral, and “other.” These are all based on a standard neurologic examination. The EDSS is frequently criticized for being insensitive to small changes, being heavily dependent on mobility, not capturing cognitive impairment, being subjective in some assessments (rating scores can vary), and for not capturing the full range of disabilities. The Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC) is another clinical tool that assesses MS disability. Unlike the EDSS that is based on a standard neurological examination, the MSFC assesses disability using three “functional” tests. It summarizes the scores of the following: the paced auditory serial addition test evaluating cognition The goal of this system is to capture information on key functional measures affected by MS, specifically leg, arm, and cognitive function. The MSFC is often used in connection with the EDSS in MS clinical trials. Many aspects of the MSFC, such as the timed 25-foot walk, are routinely monitored in MS clinics as well. Approximately one in every 750 individuals in the United States has MS. The natural progression of MS has changed over time. Early studies showed that the median time from onset of PPMS to needing a device (such as a cane) to assist with walking was 10 years, while more contemporary studies show that this has increased to 15 years. Another study showed that 25 percent of people with PPMS still did not require a cane after more than 25 years. Although difficult, individuals with MS should not compare their disease course with those of others, as every individual is different. Risk factors for disease progression have been identified, but their interplay is complex. Early onset of disease and female gender are favorable factors associated with a better prognosis in terms of one’s long-term course of MS. For instance, individuals who were young at the onset of their MS have been shown to take a longer amount of time before their MS progresses to the point of needing a device to assist with walking, which is a score of 6.0 on the EDSS. Relapses can still occur in people with progressive MS. Individuals with secondaryprogressive MS can have an occasional relapse, which is a new neurologic symptom that lasts more than 24 hours, in the absence of fever or infection. This occasional relapse is superimposed on progressive disease, characterized by a gradual decline. For example, an individual with SPMS may notice worsening balance and walking issues over several years, and then notice over the course of hours to days, they have developed blurry vision in one eye and pain with eye movements. He or she may then be diagnosed with an MS relapse of optic neuritis, in addition to having a gradual decline in neurologic function over the course of years. This is different from RRMS, as individuals with RRMS only experience neurologic worsening in the setting of a relapse. The word “progressive” has historically carried a negative connotation among members of the MS community. However, when this term was first coined, the understanding of the pathophysiology of MS – which is how the disease progresses and its effects – was very limited. Neuro-diagnostics, which use advanced technology to diagnose, evaluate, and sometimes treat certain neurological conditions, were in their infancy, and the therapies that could slow progression were lacking. Fortunately, the MS world is changing. Currently, no criteria have been defined to determine definitively when a person with MS has progressed from RRMS to SPMS. However, criteria are in place for a diagnosis of SPMS, which requires the onset of the disease with at least one clinical relapse (differentiating it from PPMS), followed by a gradual decline in neurologic function over the course of at least six to 12 months. This decline must be separate from the worsening that occurs during relapses. The diagnosis of PPMS has distinct criteria based on 2010 McDonald criteria for the diagnosis of MS. To receive a diagnosis of PPMS, a person with MS must have one year or more of gradual decline in neurologic function, in addition to two or more of the following: two or more lesions consistent with MS in the spinal cord cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis consistent with the diagnosis Individuals with RRMS are usually diagnosed between the ages of 15 and 40. The average age of onset of SPMS and PPMS is in the fifth and sixth decades of life, when people are in their 40s or 50s. While RRMS often affects women two-to-three times more often than men, the gender ratio in PPMS is equal between males and females. In both SPMS and PPMS, the rate of decline in neurologic function occurs at a similar rate. Individuals with PPMS generally have more spinal-cord lesions than those with SPMS. It is important to note that the diagnosis of the type of MS is based on clinical history, which is determined through doctor visits and evaluations. Progressive forms of MS cannot be diagnosed with an MRI or spinal-fluid analysis alone. As part of the 2013 International MS Phenotype Group revised MS classification criteria, three important modifiers were added to the description of MS: activity, worsening, and progression. These modifiers help to more accurately reflect the current disease process in a specific individual with MS. refers to a new clinical MS attack (relapse) or a new bright spot (showing inflammation) on the MRI. simply reflects that a specific person’s neurological examination has gotten worse compared to prior examinations, possibly related to an MS attack (relapse). indicates worsening on an exam, independent from an attack (relapse). In summary, people with progressive MS can and do have attacks (relapses), albeit infrequently, and develop new spots (or lesions) on MRI. Both relapses and new lesions are types of disease activity. Additionally, MS may be “clinically silent,” showing no increase in symptoms, yet continuing to show signs of disease activity within the CNS, as seen on MRI. Conversely, these same people can experience long periods of time without progression and without worsening. These variations in disease activity show how dynamic MS is, while affecting each individual differently. Clinical worsening in MS, or the gradual decline in function, should not immediately be attributed to MS as the only cause. Individuals with MS can also acquire other medical problems that can mimic MS progression. These include: cervical stenosis – a narrowing of the spinal canal in the neck, which can put pressure on the spinal cord and cause a worsening of gait, sensation, strength, as well as a worsening of bowel and bladder control As a result, a thorough evaluation by a neurologist as well as a regular follow up with a primary-care physician are important. If alternative causes are ruled out, then a neurologist may confirm that progression is directly related to one’s MS. | | Improving Lives Today! – A Guide to MSAA’s Programs and Services How to S.E.A.R.C.H.™ for the Right MS Therapy for You!

40a971ab-3e17-402f-a544-52d2b1174e88,"World Congress on Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis Featuring highlights from the 2008 World Congress on Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis. More than 5,000 medical professionals attended this year’s first World Congress on Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis, held in Montreal, Canada this past September. MSAA’s Chief Medical Officer Jack Burks, MD, not only attended the meeting, but also reviewed approximately 1,000 poster presentations – specifically about the latest in MS news and research. From this vast amount of information, cutting-edge studies, and exciting drugs in development, Dr. Burks selected those posters which he found to be of greatest interest, and summarized them in a presentation to MSAA staff. To follow are some highlights from Dr. Burks’ presentation. An estimated two and a half million people worldwide are now thought to have MS. Most individuals with MS are diagnosed between the ages of 15 and 45. Four times as many women are diagnosed than men, and 85 percent of those diagnosed begin with the relapsing-remitting form of MS (RRMS). Without treatment, half of these patients will advance to secondary-progressive MS (SPMS) within 10 years, where symptoms usually do not remit, and patients are more likely to develop greater disability. Years ago, was considered to be extremely rare. Presently, up to five percent of the MS population is under the age of 18 (pediatric MS), and pediatric MS centers have been setup to address the special needs of this age group. While adult MS has a much greater female population, pediatric MS is more evenly divided between the genders. Among experienced, approximately 70 percent have mental health issues – such as depression and attention deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD). Fatigue is another symptom seen frequently in pediatric MS, which can greatly impact daily activities. Approximately 25 percent of children with MS have . For adults and children, cognitive dysfunction can also impact many aspects of one’s life, affecting memory, concentration, and mental quickness. Cognitive rehabilitation and cognitive functioning are getting more attention from researchers. While much is not known about the evaluation and treatment of this symptom, the development of cognitive retraining at some MS centers has had some exciting results. Although fewer develop MS, this subset of the MS community tends to have a more aggressive disease course. The B cells in the immune system may be a factor, versus the immune system’s T cells. These T cells have traditionally been believed to be the primary source of inflammation. These findings may lead to new research into different types of treatment for specific groups of individuals. , also known as Devic’s disease, is a disorder that can appear to be very similar to MS, affecting the spinal cord and optic nerve. Although this is not a progressive disease, it can be recurrent with severe symptoms. A new test has been developed to help doctors differentiate some NMO patients from MS patients. New treatments for NMO are being studied. Rituxan ® (rituximab) is one example. Research into the of MS is focusing on four areas: Immunologic/autoimmune (problems with the immune system) Microbial (pointing to infection, possibly viral; popular suspects include Epstein-Barr Virus [EBV] and Chlamydia) Genetic (another area of investigation; genes possibly linked to EBV with MS) Environmental (industrial waste and pollution may play a role; or vitamin D and sunshine, for example) Damage from MS occurs in two different ways: . Early in the disease, inflammation occurs as the body’s immune system attacks the brain. Anti-inflammatory drugs, such as the current disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) for MS, minimize the damage from inflammation and reduce the attacks. Cells can be damaged and then recover, but may be destined to not live as long – because they have been previously damaged. This could be a link to the second component in the disease process: cell degeneration. The degeneration is more pronounced later in the disease, and is characterized by loss of axons and nerve cells, as well as myelin. This damage occurs without the intense inflammation to the axons (nerve fibers) and the neurons (the grey matter in the brain). This grey matter in the brain can also be damaged, which may affect cognition. If later degeneration is related to earlier inflammation, early treatment might stop or at least slow this damage. With this in mind, how can MS be diagnosed and treated sooner? MRI findings can lead to treating patients after their first attack. Researchers are searching for the causes of the degeneration. A number of theories exist; some say that this latter degenerative phase is independent of inflammation, but others believe that the two phases are linked. Does (shrinkage) occur only late in the disease? Researchers have shown that brain atrophy starts early in the disorder. One study found reductions in brain volume to be similar in early and late stages of the disease. The good news is that the body’s natural process of making – while not as efficient in the white matter of the brain – is much more efficient in the grey matter of the brain. As mentioned earlier, damage to the grey matter can affect cognition, and this is because it is the “thinking” area of the brain. One possibility for the lack of new myelin production in the white matter is interference from the inflammatory cells. A study in Tokyo found that a molecule called “” may inhibit the cells that normally repair nerves. With MS, a protein called “” has been found to be increased in the spinal fluid and the brain, especially around lesions. These and other new biomarkers for MS could possibly be measured to help researchers discover more about the disease, in terms of diagnosis and disease course. changes dramatically with different disorders. Researchers can now map changes when a patient is sick and prescribe drugs that change specific gene expression. These are referred to as “boutique therapies.” Using the Human Genome Map, this type of treatment may one day be developed for individuals with MS. Risk factors for MS continue to be investigated. These include: Vitamin D (naturally derived from sunshine) could play a role; 65 percent of children with MS in Canada have a vitamin D deficiency Smoking increases the risk of autoimmune disease; smoking also increases the risk of MS in association with EBV infection Human Herpesvirus 6 (HHV6) virus, which first appears as a rash in childhood, has a molecular structure that is similar to myelin basic protein (MBP); this could implicate “molecular mimicry,” where the immune system believes it is attacking a foreign protein, but is actually attacking its own myelin is another concern for individuals with MS. Patients are at a higher risk, partly from steroid treatment, which reduces calcium in the body. In addition, while pulse steroids may seem like a good idea, they can destroy joints, a process known as “osteonecrosis.” One group of MS scientists reported that approximately seven percent of individuals treated with pulse steroids develop this disorder. A growing number of patients (with no MS-type of symptoms) are being diagnosed with “.” This is where a patient undergoes an MRI for some unrelated reason, and MS-type lesions are found. Researchers are seeing more of asymptomatic patients. Of those patients followed, 80 percent later developed new lesions, and 21 percent went on to have a neurological attack. The approved disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) for MS can help to reduce the number of relapses, decrease the number of active lesions on MRI, and slow the progression of disability. Several also delay the onset of clinically definite MS (CDMS) following the first neurologic event, which is called a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). In long-term follow-up studies of 15 years or more, patients taking DMTs frequently report a high quality of life and reduced disability. Many continue to remain ambulatory. With the interferons, 15 years of data show that patients who stay on Avonex® (interferon beta-1a) continue to do well. Most individuals taking Avonex long-term state that their health is excellent, and a significant percentage of these long-term users are able to walk unassisted. When treating CIS with ® (interferon beta-1b), immediate treatment decreased disability by 40 percent at three years and by 24 percent at five years versus those whose treatment was delayed until the second attack or at two years. Betaseron users also report a high quality of life. ® (interferon beta-1a) has tested a reformulated product, which improved tolerability and reduced neutralizing antibodies. Also, a 16-week study showed fewer MRI lesions in treated patients versus patients on placebo. The new formulation is undergoing Food and Drug Administration (FDA) review for possible approval in the United States. Also, of DMTs are becoming available in foreign countries (Mexico, Argentina, Korea, and Iran). The similarity of these to brand-name drugs is being challenged. Some experts believe these biogenerics lack adequate safety and efficacy data. Looking at (glatiramer acetate), those with a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) were 45 percent less likely to be diagnosed with clinically definite MS (CDMS) within two years if taking Copaxone versus placebo. This drug may also offer protection of the axons (nerve fibers). A study showed that a higher dose did not offer any benefits over the regular dose, although every-other-day dosing may be of equal benefit – but more studies are needed. Copaxone’s long-term follow-up of 15 years shows an improvement in relapses and disability. More than 80 percent of patients were walking unaided. ® (mitoxantrone) is used as a rescue therapy. A “rescue therapy” is used for patients with a suboptimal response to a DMT given as a first-line of treatment. Patients need to be monitored carefully as it may cause heart failure, loss of menstruation, and even leukemia. Treatment is limited to a maximum of two to three years and regular heart testing is recommended. A small study in Italy administered gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH)-analogue treatment in conjunction with Novantrone, in an effort to avoid the premature loss of menstruation. At the time of this report, half of the women had completed their treatment with both medications, and these six women now have normal menstrual cycles. Tysabri® (natalizumab) continues to be an effective DMT, but risks still exist. Two new cases of Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) occurred in July 2008, with two men in Europe. At last report, due to early diagnosis, both continue to be stable (PML is an often fatal viral infection of the brain). Other potential adverse events include low platelet count, as well as herpes virus encephalitis and meningitis. Tysabri has also been shown to be very effective in treating pediatric MS patients, whose MS is highly active. which are not FDA approved for MS include: pulse steroids; Rituxan; Cellcept ® (mycophenolate mofetil); and high-dose Cytoxan® (cyclophosphamide). ® (alemtuzumab) shows much potential in the treatment of MS, with a significant reduction in annual relapse rates, disability, and MRI lesions. Toxicity with this drug is still an issue, with an increased risk of low platelets and Graves’ disease. One successful study used Campath as a rescue therapy in RRMS. is a monoclonal antibody that reduces specific antibodies. Positive data in RRMS has been demonstrated. In primary-progressive MS (PPMS), overall results were negative, but patients under 55 with active MRI lesions showed a benefit in an analysis that was completed after the study. For other diseases treated with Rituxan, PML has been reported. As noted earlier, this drug is also showing positive effects in preliminary studies in NMO. will be the first oral therapy to report phase III trial data to the FDA, with results available in 2009. It reduces certain T-lymphocytes, which may help in the treatment of MS. In a Phase II RRMS trial, (FTY720) demonstrated reductions in relative relapse rate and the development of new MRI lesions versus placebo. A phase III RRMS study with more than 3,000 participants is underway. Two patients in this study died from viral infections. While fingolomod has not been proven to have caused these deaths, the association cannot be ruled out at this time. A study with PPMS patients is also underway (outside of the United States), with plans to begin United States’ enrollment in January 2009. are another interesting area of research in the treatment of MS. In general, countries with a high prevalence of parasite infections have low prevalence of MS. Parasites may help to regulate immune activity. One study involving parasites and MS is underway. has been granted fast-track designation from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for SPMS. Fast-track designation can help in the development of drugs for serious or life-threatening conditions, as well as speed-up the review process. This treatment is being studied in RRMS and SPMS; it appears to be well tolerated. Other similar drugs are also being tested in MS. Their aim is to “tolerize” the immune system from attacking the myelin. , an oral drug with action similar to , is being studied. It has a shorter half-life than Tysabri, which means that it does not stay in the body as long. This may have a lower risk of PML, and is currently in phase II studies. studies are ongoing. Stem cells taken from bone marrow have shown some evidence of revitalizing brain tissue in RRMS. An eight-week study with was found to increase quality of life. Specifically, mental health was improved, but physical measures were not affected. In animal studies, higher doses caused damaging effects in an MS-like disease. Flavinoids, green tea, and red wine are showing some positive effects. These may possibly help to protect nerve fibers. Researchers are also looking at the potential value of a diet rich in fish, as well as the benefits of olive oil. Whether vitamin D supplements can help protect people from developing MS, or help reduce the effects of MS, is not yet known. More research is needed to determine the potential for treating with vitamin D. The appropriate doses also need to be identified. Other emerging therapies for MS include: Zenapax® (dacilzumab); teriflunomide; BHT-3009; NM-166; intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg); estriol, menocycline; doxycycline; Prozac (fluoxetine); laquinimod; BG 12 (fumarate); antisense oligonucleotide (ATL1102); bone-marrow transplant (BMT); oral IFN-Tau; Atacicept (ATAMS); PEGylation of IFN-B in EAE; Rilutek ® (riluzole); ATX-MS1467 (4 MBP Peptides); RTL1000 (recombinant T-cell receptor ligand); glucosamine sulfate; semaphorins (guidance molecules for remyelination); Tovaxin ™ (T-cell vaccination); and statins, among many others. In summary, researchers now have a better understanding of MS, its causes, and its pathology. Researchers are learning more about pediatric MS as well. The presently approved DMTs are working well, and many emerging therapies – including oral medications – are showing much potential. However, toxicity is always a concern, and members of the MS community and medical fields must continue to exercise caution until the potential side effects of a treatment are known. New symptom management strategies continue to be developed – from exercise rehabilitation (found to improve fatigue) to cooling (to reduce symptoms in heat-sensitive individuals). Other treatments such as Fampridine-SR for walking speed and leg strength, and Duloxetine for depression, pain, bladder problems, fatigue, and quality of life, may prove to be of great benefit to the MS community. Other drugs are being developed such as Zenvia ™, to treat pseudo-bulbar affect (PBA), which is a condition where individuals experience emotional instability.

A new, thinner needle and new autoinjector will soon be available for individuals taking Betaseron for the long-term treatment of MS. The thinner needle is being offered as a way to potentially help reduce the pain and anxiety often associated with injections. For more information on Betaseron readers may visit or call BETAPLUS ™ at (800) 788-1467. Two changes have recently been made to the labeling and prescribing information for Tysabri ® (natalizumab). The first change may help individuals to be approved sooner by their health insurance company for Tysabri, after failing to respond adequately to (or not able to tolerate) another single disease-modifying therapy for MS. The second change is in response to the two newly discovered cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), in patients taking Tysabri as a monotherapy (in conjunction with no other disease-modifying therapy) for the long-term treatment of MS. PML is an often-fatal viral infection of the brain.

This study was inspired by the observation that MS relapses are less frequent during later pregnancy, a time when estriol is at high levels. The trial, led by Rhonda Voskuhl, MD (University of California, Los Angeles), compared disease activity in those given oral estriol (Trimesta,TM Synthetic Biologics), in combination with glatiramer acetate (Copaxone,® Teva Neuroscience) with those taking glatiramer acetate and placebo. The combination of estriol and glatiramer acetate appeared to be safe over the two-year study period, but further studies will be necessary to confirm long-term safety of estriol for use in relapsing MS. The trial demonstrated a 32% reduction in the relapse rate at two years in the group receiving the combination of glatiramer acetate and estriol compared to the glatiramer only group. However, additional trials with larger numbers of patients are needed to confirm this result. Trends in some of the secondary outcomes measures including cognition and fatigue look promising, but need to be followed up in future studies. The trial, in Lancet Neurology online on November 24, 2015, was funded by the National MS Society, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, and private donors.  : MS affects women two to three times as often as men and pregnancy has been shown to provide some protection from MS relapses in women. These findings along with a series of others prompted the National MS Society to launch a special five-year, $10 million research initiative in the late 1990’s to explore the importance of the meaning behind these observations. Among the results from the 50 projects supported through this initiative was the possibility that the female hormone estriol may help protect women from MS relapses. Understanding gender differences and the protection provided by pregnancy is still an active area of research investment and interest in the MS community.   Estriol levels naturally rise during later pregnancy, a time when many women’s MS disease activity declines. This led some to suspect that estriol may be responsible for this easing of symptoms during pregnancy. Rhonda Voskuhl, MD (University of California, Los Angeles) and others explored this lead in mice with an MS-like disease. Later, with National MS Society support, Dr. Voskuhl conducted a small, early-phase trial of estriol in 12 women with relapsing-remitting MS. Results suggested that estriol might decrease disease activity. Phase 2 trials such as the one reported in this published paper are designed to provide information about a therapy’s safety and potential effectiveness, but longer, larger Phase 3 studies are needed to confirm potential benefits and risks and to gain approval from drug regulators such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.   : Estriol is one of several estrogen sex hormones in the body. Some forms of estrogen are available for prescription as methods of birth control and for the treatment of symptoms associated with menopause. Estriol has been used in Europe and Asia as a treatment for symptoms of menopause. The oral form of estriol used in this trial is not available in the United States.   :  Investigators recruited 164 women with relapsing-remitting MS between the ages of 18-50 at 16 sites across the U.S. All participants had recently begun standard glatiramer acetate therapy (injected daily under the skin) and were randomly assigned to also take estriol in pill form, or inactive placebo, for two years. The dosage of estriol used in this trial was four times that customarily used for treating menopausal symptoms.   The primary outcome measure for this trial was the effect of the treatment combination on confirmed relapse rates at the end of the second year. Secondary outcomes included several clinical and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), measures of disability progression, cognitive function and fatigue. There were also laboratory and gynecological tests built into the study to monitor for potential safety issues that have been associated with the use of estriol and other estrogen hormones, including breast and endometrial (uterine) cancers.   Detailed results of this phase 2 trial were in Lancet Neurology online on November 24, 2015 and were communicated by the study’s authors. The trial was funded by the National MS Society, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, and additional private donors. Synthetic Biologics, a Maryland pharmaceutical company, provided the estriol for the trial at no charge. Preliminary results were originally presented at the 2014 Annual Meeting of the American Academy of Neurology.   : The combination of glatiramer acetate and estriol appeared safe over the two-year trial period, and there were few severe adverse events experienced by those in either treatment group. Women taking estriol had significantly more irregularities in their menstrual cycles.   At the end of two years, there was a reduction in the annual relapse rate between the estriol group (0.25) and the placebo group (0.37) that achieved only a modest (p=0.077) level of “statistical significance,” a calculation used to determine whether differences relate to chance alone or to the impact of the therapy being tested. This means the study needs to be repeated with a larger number of participants before a definitive conclusion about the effectiveness of estriol can be made. There were no statistically significant differences in secondary outcomes related to the number or size of brain lesions measured by MRI, measures of disability, or quality of life.   There was a benefit suggested for the estriol group in cognitive testing compared to those on placebo after the first year, but this benefit was not seen during the second year of the study. In addition, there was a significant reduction in a measure of fatigue at two years that was not apparent after the first year.   : “While the outcomes of this trial are intriguing, important questions remain regarding the potential benefits and long-term safety of high dose estriol for MS,” said Bruce Bebo, PhD, Executive Vice President, Research at the Society. “These results contribute to our understanding that the pregnancy effects in MS are more complex than previously appreciated. We applaud Dr. Voskuhl’s diligence and persistence in completing this trial. The Society continues to support research in this important area of gender differences and pregnancy in MS, since it may provide clues to improving treatment for women and men with all forms of the disease.”   Copaxone is a registered trademark of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.

Abstract Symptom-Specific Treatment and Multidisciplinary Care Abstract Symptom-Specific Treatment and Multidisciplinary Care Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common permanently disabling disorder of the central nervous system in young adults. Relapsing remitting MS is the most common type, and typical symptoms include sensory disturbances, Lhermitte sign, motor weakness, optic neuritis, impaired coordination, and fatigue. The course of disease is highly variable. The diagnosis is clinical and involves two neurologic deficits or objective attacks separated in time and space. Magnetic resonance imaging is helpful in confirming the diagnosis and excluding mimics. Symptom exacerbations affect 85% of patients with MS. Corticosteroids are the treatment of choice for patients with acute, significant symptoms. Disease-modifying agents should be initiated early in the treatment of MS to forestall disease and preserve function. Two immunomodulatory agents (interferon beta and glatiramer) and five immunosuppressive agents (fingolimod, teriflunomide, dimethyl fumarate, natalizumab, and mitoxantrone) are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of MS, each with demonstrated effectiveness and unique adverse effect profiles. Symptom management constitutes a large part of care; neurogenic bladder and bowel, sexual dysfunction, pain, spasticity, and fatigue are best treated with a multidisciplinary approach to improve quality of life. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common permanently disabling disorder of the central nervous system (CNS) in young adults. The prevalence varies by geographic region, ranging from 110 cases per 100,000 persons in the northern United States to 47 per 100,000 in the southern United States. Women, smokers, and persons residing at higher latitudes or with a family history of MS are at increased risk of disease. Those with increased exposure to sunlight and higher 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels are at decreased risk. Total costs associated with MS may exceed $50,000 per person annually.  Enlarge     Print Multiple sclerosis is a clinical diagnosis requiring two neurologic deficits or objective attacks separated in time and space.

The disease-modifying agents interferon beta, glatiramer (Copaxone), fingolimod (Gilenya), teriflunomide (Aubagio), and dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera) have been shown to decrease the frequency of exacerbations and progression of disease in patients with multiple sclerosis.

For information about the SORT evidence rating system, go to Abstract Symptom-Specific Treatment and Multidisciplinary Care The most common type of MS is relapsing remitting MS . In the acute attack, T cells, B cells, and macrophages interact with adhesion molecules on blood vessel surfaces to traverse a blood-brain barrier weakened by matrix metalloproteinases. Once through, T cells and B cells release inflammatory mediators and immunoglobulins targeting the myelin sheath, while macrophages expose axonal surfaces and release harmful nitrous oxygen and oxygen free radicals. This cascade of events leads to demyelination and axonal injury.  Enlarge     Print Discrete attacks that evolve over days to weeks, followed by some degree of recovery over weeks to months; the patient has no worsening of neurologic function between attacks Initial relapsing remitting disease, followed by gradual neurologic deterioration not associated with acute attacks Primary progressive and progressive relapsing (10% of cases) Characterized by steady functional decline from disease onset; these types cannot be distinguished during early stages until attacks occur (progressive relapsing) or fail to occur (primary progressive); progressive relapsing is rarer than primary progressive *—Develops in about 50% of patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis.

CNS pathologies to consider include other inflammatory, demyelinating, or degenerative diseases; infections; neoplasms; and migraines. Genetic diseases, nutritional deficiencies, and psychiatric diseases may also present in a manner similar to MS. The diagnosis of MS should be questioned in the presence of abrupt/transient symptoms, prominent cortical features (seizures, aphasia), peripheral neuropathy, and other organ (cardiac, hematologic) involvement, because these are not typical of MS.  Enlarge     Print Conditions Potentially Confused with Multiple Sclerosis Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy Human immunodeficiency virus infection, Lyme disease, mycoplasma, syphilis Behçet syndrome, sarcoidosis, Sjögren syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus Arteriovenous malformation, herniated disk, neoplasm Cerebrovascular accident, diabetes mellitus, hypertensive disease, migraine, vasculitis Alcohol, cocaine, isoniazid, lithium, penicillin, phenytoin (Dilantin) Folate deficiency, vitamin B deficiency, vitamin E deficiency Conditions Potentially Confused with Multiple Sclerosis Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy Human immunodeficiency virus infection, Lyme disease, mycoplasma, syphilis Behçet syndrome, sarcoidosis, Sjögren syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus Arteriovenous malformation, herniated disk, neoplasm Cerebrovascular accident, diabetes mellitus, hypertensive disease, migraine, vasculitis Alcohol, cocaine, isoniazid, lithium, penicillin, phenytoin (Dilantin) Folate deficiency, vitamin B deficiency, vitamin E deficiency Abstract Symptom-Specific Treatment and Multidisciplinary Care MS is a clinical diagnosis.

If the Criteria are fulfilled and there is no better explanation for the clinical presentation, the diagnosis is “MS”; if suspicious, but the Criteria are not completely met, the diagnosis is “possible MS”; if another diagnosis arises during the evaluation that better explains the clinical presentation, then the diagnosis is “not MS.” *—An attack (relapse; exacerbation) is defined as patient-reported or objectively observed events typical of an acute inflammatory demyelinating event in the CNS, current or historical, with duration of at least 24 hours, in the absence of fever or infection. It should be documented by contemporaneous neurological examination, but some historical events with symptoms and evolution characteristic for MS, but for which no objective neurological findings are documented, can provide reasonable evidence of a prior demyelinating event. Reports of paroxysmal symptoms (historical or current) should, however, consist of multiple episodes occurring over not less than 24 hours. Before a definite diagnosis of MS can be made, at least 1 attack must be corroborated by findings on neurological examination, visual evoked potential response in patients reporting prior visual disturbance, or MRI consistent with demyelination in the area of the CNS implicated in the historical report of neurological symptoms. †—Clinical diagnosis based on objective clinical findings for 2 attacks is most secure. Reasonable historical evidence for 1 past attack, in the absence of documented objective neurological findings, can include historical events with symptoms and evolution characteristics for a prior inflammatory demyelinating event; at least 1 attack, however, must be supported by objective findings. ‡—No additional tests are required. However, it is desirable that any diagnosis of MS be made with access to imaging based on these Criteria. If imaging or other tests (for instance, CSF) are undertaken and are negative, extreme caution needs to be taken before making a diagnosis of MS, and alternative diagnoses must be considered. There must be no better explanation for the clinical presentation, and objective evidence must be present to support a diagnosis of MS. §—Gadolinium-enhancing lesions are not required; symptomatic lesions are excluded from consideration in subjects with brainstem or spinal cord syndromes.

If the Criteria are fulfilled and there is no better explanation for the clinical presentation, the diagnosis is “MS”; if suspicious, but the Criteria are not completely met, the diagnosis is “possible MS”; if another diagnosis arises during the evaluation that better explains the clinical presentation, then the diagnosis is “not MS.” *—An attack (relapse; exacerbation) is defined as patient-reported or objectively observed events typical of an acute inflammatory demyelinating event in the CNS, current or historical, with duration of at least 24 hours, in the absence of fever or infection. It should be documented by contemporaneous neurological examination, but some historical events with symptoms and evolution characteristic for MS, but for which no objective neurological findings are documented, can provide reasonable evidence of a prior demyelinating event. Reports of paroxysmal symptoms (historical or current) should, however, consist of multiple episodes occurring over not less than 24 hours. Before a definite diagnosis of MS can be made, at least 1 attack must be corroborated by findings on neurological examination, visual evoked potential response in patients reporting prior visual disturbance, or MRI consistent with demyelination in the area of the CNS implicated in the historical report of neurological symptoms. †—Clinical diagnosis based on objective clinical findings for 2 attacks is most secure. Reasonable historical evidence for 1 past attack, in the absence of documented objective neurological findings, can include historical events with symptoms and evolution characteristics for a prior inflammatory demyelinating event; at least 1 attack, however, must be supported by objective findings. ‡—No additional tests are required. However, it is desirable that any diagnosis of MS be made with access to imaging based on these Criteria. If imaging or other tests (for instance, CSF) are undertaken and are negative, extreme caution needs to be taken before making a diagnosis of MS, and alternative diagnoses must be considered. There must be no better explanation for the clinical presentation, and objective evidence must be present to support a diagnosis of MS. §—Gadolinium-enhancing lesions are not required; symptomatic lesions are excluded from consideration in subjects with brainstem or spinal cord syndromes.

In addition to MRI, evoked potentials (visual, auditory, and somatosensory) may provide objective evidence of deficits consistent with MS. Visual evoked potentials are especially helpful for persons with vision-related symptoms. Cerebrospinal fluid may be obtained, although this is not routinely recommended; analysis typically demonstrates oligoclonal bands and an increased immunoglobulin G concentration. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis is more useful in ruling out MS mimics and in diagnosing primary progressive MS than in diagnosing relapsing remitting MS.  Serologic testing is performed to exclude other diseases .  Enlarge     Print Serologic Tests to Rule Out Conditions That Mimic Multiple Sclerosis Rheumatologic disease, systemic lupus erythematosus Performed when appropriate to the clinical situation Autoantibody assays* (e.g., antineutrophil cytoplasmic, anticardiolipin, antiphospholipid, anti–SS-A, and anti–SS-B antibodies) Behçet syndrome, Sjögren syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, vasculitis *—These tests are commonly ordered by neurologists on initial consultation.

Abstract Symptom-Specific Treatment and Multidisciplinary Care Exacerbations affect 85% of patients with MS; infections and stress may play a role. For those with significant, acute symptoms, corticosteroids are the treatment of choice and have strong evidence of benefit. Although parenteral steroids build up to peak concentrations faster than oral preparations, a Cochrane review indicates no difference in effectiveness (as measured by clinical or radiologic markers) or safety between oral and parenteral preparations. If the disease is unresponsive to steroids, plasmapheresis may be performed. Plasma exchanges are relatively well tolerated and are usually performed every other day for 14 days. Abstract Symptom-Specific Treatment and Multidisciplinary Care The goal of disease-modifying therapy is to forestall disease, preserve function, and sustain healthy immune function while suppressing the T-cell autoimmune cascade thought to be responsible for demyelination and axonal damage. Early treatment at or before the diagnosis of clinically confirmed MS may delay damage to the CNS.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved seven agents for the treatment of MS: interferon beta, glatiramer (Copaxone), fingolimod (Gilenya), teriflunomide (Aubagio), dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera), natalizumab (Tysabri), and mitoxantrone . Because of the chronic nature and evolving treatment of MS, disease-modifying treatment is typically managed by a neurologist with expertise in prescribing these potentially toxic agents.  Enlarge     Print Disease-Modifying Agents for Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis Injection site reactions (e.g., edema, inflammation, pain); influenza-like symptoms; leukopenia; elevated liver enzyme levels; depression and suicidal thoughts (increased with preexisting depression, neutralizing antibodies) Decrease in progression: RR = 0.69; (0.55 to 0.87) Injection site reactions, facial flushing, chest tightness, palpitations Decrease in disability at two years: MD = 0.33; (0.08 to 0.58) Annualized relapse rate vs. placebo: 0.18 vs. 0.40 Bradycardia (contraindicated in recent heart disease or arrhythmia); elevated liver enzyme levels Decrease in progression at two years: HR = 0.70; (0.55 to 0.87) Melanoma, macular edema, herpes encephalitis (only occurs at higher doses) Annualized relapse rate vs. placebo: 0.37 vs. 0.54 Alopecia, diarrhea, nausea, decreased white blood cell count, elevated liver enzyme levels, peripheral neuropathy Decrease in progression: HR = 0.76; (0.51 to 0.97) Annualized relapse rate vs. placebo: 0.17 vs. 0.36 Flushing, abdominal pain, lymphocytopenia, elevated liver enzyme levels Decrease in progression: HR = 0.62; (0.44 to 0.87) Infusion reactions, headache, fatigue, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy Decrease in progression at two years: RR = 0.74; (0.62 to 0.89) Myelosuppression, elevated liver enzyme levels, decreased cardiac function, leukemia Decrease in progression: OR = 0.30; (0.09 to 0.99) HR = hazard ratio; MD = mean difference; OR = odds ratio; RR = relative risk. *—Estimated retail price of treatment for one year based on information obtained at .

Interferon beta, an immunomodulatory agent with more than 20 years of safety data, is effective in decreasing exacerbations and the progression of relapsing remitting MS. Interferon beta is available in three injectable formulations. Common adverse effects include local reactions and influenza-like symptoms. Interferon treatment may be associated with suicidal thoughts, so other agents should be considered in patients with depression. Glatiramer is an alternative immunomodulatory daily injection for relapsing remitting MS with a good safety record. Glatiramer decreases relapse and progression of disability at two years. Common adverse effects include local and systemic injection reactions (e.g., chest tightness, palpitations). Glatiramer should be avoided in persons with known hypersensitivity to this agent. Fingolimod is the first oral agent that is FDA approved for disease modification in relapsing remitting MS. A study of 1,272 patients between 18 and 55 years of age with relapsing remitting MS compared fingolimod with placebo, and demonstrated a decrease in annual exacerbations and progression of disease at two years. Bradycardia is a known adverse effect; patients should be observed for six hours after taking their first dose, and the medication is contraindicated in those with recent heart disease or arrhythmia. The FDA has approved two additional oral agents. Teriflunomide, approved in September 2012, has been shown to decrease relapse rates compared with placebo. Adverse effects include elevated transaminase levels, alopecia, and diarrhea. Teriflunomide carries an FDA warning for hepatic toxicity. Dimethyl fumarate, approved in March 2013, has been shown to decrease relapses and disease progression. Adverse effects include flushing, abdominal pain, decreased lymphocyte counts, and elevated transaminase levels. All of these oral agents suppress the immune system and put patients at risk of opportunistic infections. Because of this, these agents are typically used when the disease does not respond to, or the patient is unable to tolerate, an immunomodulatory agent. Natalizumab and mitoxantrone are immunosuppressive agents reserved for disease that does not respond to first-line agents. Although both are effective, natalizumab carries an FDA warning for progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, and mitoxantrone carries a warning for cardiotoxicity. Ongoing trials are evaluating the effectiveness and safety of additional agents in the treatment of MS to include the injectable daclizumab and oral cladribine and siponimod. Symptom-Specific Treatment and Multidisciplinary Care Abstract Symptom-Specific Treatment and Multidisciplinary Care Multidisciplinary treatment of primary and associated symptoms is essential in enhancing the quality of life in younger and older patients with MS. More than 70% of patients with MS have urinary tract dysfunction, with 10% demonstrating urinary symptoms at initial diagnosis. Urinary dysfunction can be classified as failure to store or empty, and can be differentiated with postvoid residual testing. Failure-to-store symptoms are typically treated with anticholinergic medications, although patients should be cautioned about adverse effects, such as dry mouth and confusion. Nocturia may respond to limited evening fluid intake or intranasal desmopressin; if desmopressin is prescribed, patients should be cautioned about the potential for hyponatremia. Injectable onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox) may be used if symptoms do not respond to these agents. Failure-to-empty symptoms are treated with clean intermittent catheterization, although some may respond to an alpha adrenergic blocker. Up to 75% of patients with MS experience constipation, incontinence, or both. Treatment should include dietary fiber, bulk-forming agents, and adequate hydration. Rectal stimulants, stool softeners, and enemas may be used if needed. Colostomy is an option for patients with intolerable symptoms. About 50% to 90% of men and 40% to 85% of women with MS have some type of sexual dysfunction. Although sexual dysfunction may have a considerable negative impact on quality of life, it is often unaddressed. Men are primarily treated with peripherally acting phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors. There is no established pharmacologic agent for women. Collaboration with a sex therapist or couples counselor may be beneficial. Approximately 85% of patients with MS report pain during the course of their illness. Those with pain report poorer health and poorer psychological functioning. Trigeminal neuralgia and dysesthetic (neuropathic) limb pain are common. Trigeminal neuralgia is initially treated with carbamazepine (Tegretol) and baclofen (Lioresal), as it is in persons without MS. Neuropathic pain in MS may be treated with tricyclic antidepressants, anticonvulsants, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Hydrotherapy has also been shown to be helpful in pain management, and is beneficial for the spasticity associated with MS. Cannabinoid therapy may be helpful for pain symptoms. It is estimated that 70% to 80% of patients with MS experience muscle spasticity. These symptoms are best treated with a multidisciplinary approach, incorporating modalities such as physical, occupational, and electromagnetic therapy. Baclofen is a first-line agent and works by decreasing alpha motor neuron activity. Oral baclofen has a short half-life and is associated with daytime sedation and muscle weakness. Intrathecal baclofen can be used to avoid daytime sedation, although muscle weakness may still occur. Diazepam (Valium) and gabapentin (Neurontin) may be used alone or in conjunction with baclofen. OnabotulinumtoxinA, with or without concomitant physical therapy, may also be helpful. Although cannabinoid therapy has been used for spasticity, the evidence for its effectiveness is mixed. The American Academy of Neurology states that patients should be counseled that these agents are probably ineffective for objective spasticity. More than 90% of patients with MS report fatigue; one-third report it to be their most troubling symptom, and many present with it. Although fatigue may occur as a result of comorbid depression, it also may appear independently. Fatigue has profound impacts on quality of life and is a leading cause of disability claims. Treatment for fatigue is multifocal. After evaluating for comorbid causes of fatigue (e.g., sleep disorders, thyroid disease, vitamin B deficiency, anemia), environmental manipulation, such as controlling heat and humidity levels, may help prevent flare-ups. Energy conservation measures such as napping and the use of assistive devices for mobility may be recommended based on the individual patient. Amantadine has been used off label in a limited number of trials and has been found to be beneficial for fatigue, although it is associated with insomnia and confusion. Other medications, such as modafinil (Provigil), have been tried with mixed results, and are not FDA approved for patients with MS. Abstract Symptom-Specific Treatment and Multidisciplinary Care The prevalence of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and other vascular comorbidities in patients with MS is similar to that in the general population. The presence of these conditions may worsen the course of MS. In addition to using targeted MS and symptom-modifying therapies, physicians should also manage these comorbidities. Surveys show that more than 50% of patients with MS seek treatments such as acupuncture, chiropractic manipulations, massage, yoga, and herbal therapies.  Physicians should ask patients if they are using integrative treatments, and should be prepared to help them find quality information on the risks and benefits of the treatments they choose. provides information and resources on traditional and integrative treatments for MS.  Enlarge     Print Multiple Sclerosis Resources for Patients and Physicians Cleveland Clinic: Mellen Center for Multiple Sclerosis General information: http://my.clevelandclinic.org/multiple_sclerosis_center/default.aspx Information on integrative therapies: http://my.clevelandclinic.org/Documents/Multiple_sclerosis_center/4%20Alternative%20and%20Complementary%20Therapies%20for%20MS.pdf http://my.clevelandclinic.org/Documents/Multiple_sclerosis_center/integrative-medicine.pdf Information on integrative therapies: Information on integrative therapies: General and integrative medicine information: http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/multiplesclerosis.html General information: Information on integrative therapies: http://www.nationalmssociety.org/Treating-MS/Complementary-Alternative-Medicines Multiple Sclerosis Resources for Patients and Physicians Cleveland Clinic: Mellen Center for Multiple Sclerosis General information: http://my.clevelandclinic.org/multiple_sclerosis_center/default.aspx Information on integrative therapies: http://my.clevelandclinic.org/Documents/Multiple_sclerosis_center/4%20Alternative%20and%20Complementary%20Therapies%20for%20MS.pdf http://my.clevelandclinic.org/Documents/Multiple_sclerosis_center/integrative-medicine.pdf Information on integrative therapies: Information on integrative therapies: General and integrative medicine information: http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/multiplesclerosis.html General information: Information on integrative therapies: http://www.nationalmssociety.org/Treating-MS/Complementary-Alternative-Medicines : A PubMed search was completed using the keyword and medical subject heading multiple sclerosis.

Because of its safety profile, Mavenclad is generally recommended in people with MS who have had an inadequate response to, or are unable to tolerate, another MS therapy. Mavenclad is a compound that targets certain types of white blood cells (lymphocytes) that drive the immune attack in MS. It temporarily reduces the number of both T and B lymphocytes without continuous suppression of the immune system. Mavenclad has a boxed warning due to an increased risk of cancers and risk of fetal (unborn baby) harm. Potential safety issues identified by the FDA include decrease in white blood cells, and increased risk of infections and liver injury. The most common adverse reactions reported during clinical trials included upper respiratory tract infections, headache, and low white blood counts. Mavenclad is taken by mouth in two treatment courses, twelve months apart.  “This is an important breakthrough for people who do not respond to alternatives that have been approved to treat relapsing-remitting or active secondary progressive MS,” said Kathy Costello, MS, ANP-BC, MSCN, Associate Vice President of Healthcare Access at the National MS Society. “We are grateful that there is an additional option for people affected by these forms of MS.”   Download the prescription information for professionals   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved oral cladribine (Mavenclad- EMD Serono) for use in the treatment of adults with relapsing forms of MS, including and active . Because of its safety profile, Mavenclad is generally recommended in people with MS who have had an inadequate response to, or are unable to tolerate, another MS therapy. Mavenclad is not recommended for use in people with (CIS) because of its safety profile.  Mavenclad is not recommended for people who: are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are a woman of childbearing age or a man able to father a child and not using birth control have active infections, including tuberculosis and hepatitis. Mavenclad is approved for the treatment of adults with relapsing forms of MS including and active . Relapsing-remitting MS – the most common disease course – is characterized by clearly defined attacks of new or increasing neurologic symptoms. These attacks – also called relapses or exacerbations – are followed by periods of partial or complete recovery (remissions). follows an initial relapsing-remitting course.   Many people who are initially diagnosed with relapsing-remitting MS eventually transition to a secondary progressive course in which there is a progressive worsening of neurologic function over time. Some people with secondary progressive MS can be characterized as either active or not active, as well as with progression or without progression. Those with active secondary progressive MS have had progression of disability but still experience acute relapses or new MRI activity.   Mavenclad is a compound that targets certain types of white blood cells that drive the immune attack in MS. It temporarily reduces the number of both T and B cells without continuous suppression of the immune system. Mavenclad is a tablet, taken by mouth in two treatment courses, twelve months apart.   A phase III clinical trial (CLARITY) tested the safety and effectiveness of oral Mavenclad in 1,326 people with relapsing-remitting MS. Investigators compared the effects of two doses of Mavenclad (3.5 mg/kg, and 5.25 mg/kg) against an inactive placebo and followed participants for up to 2 years. Those taking the lower dose of Mavenclad had a 58% reduction in annual relapse rate compared to people in the placebo group, and those taking the higher dose had a 55% reduction compared to placebo. People taking Mavenclad also had a lower risk of sustained disability progression at 3 months as measured by the EDSS scale and had less disease activity on MRI scans.   Prescribing information for includes several warnings and precautions, including or increased risk of cancers and birth defects/fetal harm. Women and men should use birth control before and at least 6 months after the last dose of Mavenclad. The most common adverse reactions reported during clinical trials included upper respiratory tract infections, headache, and low white blood counts.   Please see the prescribing information for the full list of warnings and precautions. Other potential risks include: Graft-Versus-Host Disease with blood transfusion (serious condition where cells in the transfused blood react to the body) The prescribing information contains advice to health care providers about tests people should undergo before beginning to take Mavenclad. These include: Blood tests including a complete blood count, liver function tests and screening for acute or latent infections including HIV, Tuberculosis, hepatitis. Blood counts (lymphocytes) should be monitored before, during and after treatment with Mavenclad. Lymphocytes must be within normal range before initiating the first treatment course, and at least 800 cells per microliter before initiating the second treatment. Blood test for antibodies to varicella zoster virus (Shingles virus). In those who are negative, Shingles vaccination is recommended. Administer other immunizations according to standard guidelines prior to starting Mavenclad. Live vaccines or live-attenuated vaccines should be administered at least 4-6 weeks prior to dosing.

What types of MS is Mavenclad approved to treat? A. The FDA has approved oral Mavenclad for the treatment of adults with relapsing forms of MS, including  and active secondary MS.  Because of its safety profile, Mavenclad is generally recommended in adults with MS who have had an inadequate response to, or are unable to tolerate, another MS therapy.   A. Mavenclad is a pill, taken by mouth. The dose is determined by body weight and is given in two treatment courses spread over 2 years. Each yearly treatment consists of 2 treatment weeks (4 or 5 days) that will occur about one month apart.   Q. Why should a person with MS consider taking a disease-modifying therapy? A. Taking a disease-modifying therapy is currently the best way to reduce MS disease activity and future deterioration. Studies comparing people in clinical trials who started therapy earlier than those on inactive placebo suggest that early treatment offered important benefits against the accumulation of disability, which were generally not experienced to the same degree by those who started treatment later.   Selecting an MS therapy should be determined by people with MS in collaboration with the healthcare provider who treats their MS, taking into account a variety of factors, including the effectiveness of any therapy they are currently using, and weighing potential risks and benefits, costs and lifestyle factors.   Q. Should I switch from my current therapy to Mavenclad? A. The decision about whether to take Mavenclad should be made in collaboration with the healthcare provider who treats your MS, taking into account a variety of factors including the effectiveness of any therapy you are currently using, the potential risks and benefits, as well as costs and lifestyle factors. Important questions to be considered and discussed with your provider in terms of Mavenclad include: What is my tolerance for the risk of known side effects? How will my medication choice affect my ability or plans to become pregnant or to father a child? What are the comparative costs of my current therapy versus Mavenclad? Q. How does the effectiveness of Mavenclad compare to other available therapies? A. We don’t have sufficient information to answer this question, based on the clinical trial conducted for the approval of Mavenclad. In that trial, Mavenclad was not compared to other MS therapies. Q. If I have been taking another disease-modifying therapy for MS, how long will I have to wait before starting Mavenclad? A. If you have taken one or more therapies that suppresses the immune system, (such as methotrexate, cyclosporin, cyclophosphamide and azathioprine), Mavenclad could further reduce your immune system’s ability to fight infection. Before taking Mavenclad, your blood cell counts will guide your healthcare provider’s decision on when or whether to start Mavenclad.   Q. What are the potential side effects of Mavenclad? A. Please see the prescribing information for the full list of warnings and precautions. Prescribing information for includes several warnings and precautions, including or increased risk of cancers and birth defects/fetal harm. Women and men should use birth control before and at least 6 months after the last dose of Mavenclad. The most common adverse reactions reported during clinical trials included upper respiratory tract infections, headache, and low white blood counts. In addition, other potential risks include: A. The total dose of Mavenclad is based on body weight, and this is reached after 2 years of treatment. After the second dose in year two of treatment, individuals are observed for an additional two years. People who took part in the clinical trials did not need further treatment with Mavenclad in years three and four. The safety and efficacy of taking Mavenclad more than 2 years after completing 2 treatment courses has not been studied.   Q. Are there any risk factors or medical conditions that would make it inappropriate for an individual to take Mavenclad? A. Mavenclad may not be appropriate if you have existing medical conditions including liver problems, active cancer, serious infections such as HIV or tuberculosis. Mavenclad should not be taken if you are pregnant or breastfeeding. Mavenclad can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Women of childbearing potential, as well as men, should use effective contraception during therapy and for 6 months after the last dose. A barrier contraceptive method should be used with hormone contraceptives until 4 weeks after the last dose of Mavenclad. Mavenclad may interact with some medications and you should tell your healthcare provider about all of the medications you are taking.   Q. Will people taking have to get any special medical tests or monitoring? A. Yes. Tests and evaluations include: Blood tests including a complete blood count, liver function tests and screening for acute or latent infections including HIV, TB, hepatitis. Blood counts (lymphocytes) should be monitored before, during and after treatment with Mavenclad. Lymphocytes must be within normal range before initiating the first treatment course, and at least 800 cells per microliter before initiating the second treatment. Blood test for antibodies to varicella zoster virus (Shingles virus). In those who are negative, VZV vaccination is recommended. Administer other immunizations according to standard guidelines prior to starting Mavenclad. Live vaccines or live-attenuated vaccines should be administered at least 4-6 weeks prior to dosing. For women with reproductive potential, administer pregnancy test. Screen for cancer following standard screening guidelines. Baseline (within 3 months) MRI imaging prior to the first treatment course because of the risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). A. The wholesale acquisition cost (WAC) of Mavenclad is $99,500 annually. The price to an individual who has MS will depend on the provisions of his or her insurance coverage and the degree to which that individual will be eligible for programs designed to assist with out-of-pocket costs. EMD Serono is offering patient support through MS LifeLines, including assistance with navigating insurance questions and additional resources that may assist those who are uninsured or underinsured. or call Q. Where can I get information about the support that EMD Serono will provide to help people gain access to Mavenclad? A. EMD Serono plans to offer support to healthcare providers and people with MS through MS LifeLines, including assistance with navigating insurance questions and additional resources that may assist those who are uninsured or underinsured. or call .   Q. What other disease-modifying therapies are available for MS? A. Other are available for people living with relapsing forms of MS, , and (an initial neurological episode). These include therapies that are taken by mouth, injection, and infusion.   A. Not at this time.   Q. Are there other therapies in development for progressive MS? A. Yes. The National MS Society is closely watching experimental treatments in development for people with progressive forms of MS. In addition, other studies include: Investigators at Oregon Health & Science University are conducting a Phase 2 clinical trial to determine if the oral supplement, lipoic acid, is an effective treatment for progressive forms of MS. The trial is co-funded by the Veteran’s Administration and the National MS Society. The SPRINT-MS trial of Ibudilast, an oral anti-inflammatory agent, demonstrated that it was well tolerated and significantly slowed the rate of brain atrophy compared to placebo in people with secondary progressive and primary progressive MS. This trial was a unique collaboration between NIH's NeuroNEXT Network, MediciNova, and the National MS Society. The MS-STAT2 study is underway at University College London, a multicenter trial testing whether a repurposed cholesterol-lowering therapy can slow the course of secondary progressive MS; the Society is providing funding. The Society is also very interested in wellness research to identify exercise, dietary and other approaches that will help people who have MS live their best lives. The Society supports several clinical trials that are investigating dietary interventions for symptom management and for their potential to modify the disease process.    Based on these trial results, is there still a need to invest in additional research on progressive MS? Yes. We need to continue our investment in research to find solutions for progressive MS. We welcome recent developments, but we must remain focused on finding more and better solutions for treating progressive MS. We will do this by our continued leadership in the International  and by funding research on progressive MS through our own research programs, and by encouraging other companies to commit to developing treatments for progressive forms of MS.     Multiple sclerosis is an unpredictable, often disabling . range from numbness and tingling to blindness and paralysis, and there is currently no cure for MS. The progress, severity and specific symptoms of MS in any one person cannot yet be predicted, but advances in and are leading to better understanding and moving us closer to . An estimated 1 million people live with MS in the United States. Most are diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 50, and it affects women three times more than men. © 2020 The National Multiple Sclerosis Society is a tax exempt 501(c)3 nonprofit organization.

eb2aa890-6a34-49fa-b145-2c2b89c3d668,"LEMTRADA 12 mg concentrate for solution for infusion Summary of Product Characteristics Updated 16-Sep-2020 | Sanofi Genzyme 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling 9. Date of first authorisation/renewal of the authorisation  This medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. See section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. LEMTRADA 12 mg concentrate for solution for infusion Each vial contains 12 mg alemtuzumab in 1.2 ml (10 mg/ml). Alemtuzumab is a monoclonal antibody produced in mammalian cell (Chinese Hamster Ovary) suspension culture in a nutrient medium by recombinant DNA technology. This medicine contains less than 1 mmol potassium (39 mg) per infusion, i.e. it is essentially 'potassium- free'. This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per infusion, i.e. it is essentially 'sodium- free'. Concentrate for solution for infusion (sterile concentrate). A clear, colourless to slightly yellow concentrate with pH 7.0 – 7.4. LEMTRADA is indicated as a single disease modifying therapy in adults with highly active relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) for the following patient groups: • Patients with highly active disease despite a full and adequate course of treatment with at least one disease modifying therapy (DMT) or • Patients with rapidly evolving severe relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis defined by 2 or more disabling relapses in one year, and with 1 or more Gadolinium enhancing lesions on brain MRI or a significant increase in T2 lesion load as compared to a previous recent MRI. LEMTRADA treatment should only be initiated and supervised by a neurologist experienced in the treatment of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) in a hospital with ready access to intensive care. Specialists and equipment required for the timely diagnosis and management of adverse reactions, especially myocardial ischaemia and myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular adverse reactions, autoimmune conditions, and infections, should be available. Resources for the management of cytokine release syndrome, hypersensitivity and/or anaphylactic reactions should be available. Patients treated with LEMTRADA must be given the Patient Alert Card and Patient Guide and be informed about the risks of LEMTRADA (see also package leaflet). The recommended dose of alemtuzumab is 12 mg/day administered by intravenous infusion for 2 initial treatment courses, with up to 2 additional treatment courses if needed. • First treatment course: 12 mg/day on 5 consecutive days (60 mg total dose) • Second treatment course: 12 mg/day on 3 consecutive days (36 mg total dose) administered 12 months after the first treatment course. Up to two additional treatment courses, as needed, may be considered (see section 5.1): • Third or fourth course: 12 mg/day on 3 consecutive days (36 mg total dose) administered at least 12 months after the prior treatment course (see section 4.1, 5.1). Missed doses should not be given on the same day as a scheduled dose. The therapy is recommended as an initial treatment of 2 courses with up to 2 additional treatment courses if needed (see posology) with safety follow-up of patients from initiation of the first treatment course and for at least 48 months after the last infusion of the second treatment course. If an additional third or fourth course is administered, continue safety follow-up for at least 48 months after the last infusion (see section 4.4). Patients should be pre-treated with corticosteroids immediately prior to LEMTRADA administration on each of the first 3 days of any treatment course. In clinical trials, patients were pre-treated with 1,000 mg methylprednisolone for the first 3 days of each LEMTRADA treatment course. Pretreatment with antihistamines and/or antipyretics prior to LEMTRADA administration may also be considered. Oral prophylaxis for herpes infection should be administered to all patients starting on the first day of each treatment course and continuing for a minimum of 1 month following treatment with LEMTRADA (see also under 'Infections' in section 4.4). In clinical trials, patients were administered aciclovir 200 mg twice a day or equivalent. Clinical studies did not include any patients aged over 61 years old. It has not been determined whether they respond differently than younger patients. LEMTRADA has not been studied in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. The safety and efficacy of LEMTRADA in children with MS aged 0 to 18 years have not yet been established. There is no relevant use of alemtuzumab in children aged from birth to less than 10 years for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. No data are available. LEMTRADA must be diluted before infusion. The diluted solution should be administered by intravenous infusion over a period of approximately 4 hours. For instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. Hypersensitivity to the active substance, or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. Patients with severe active infection until complete resolution. Patients with a history of arterial dissection of the cervicocephalic arteries. Patients with a history of angina pectoris or myocardial infarction. Patients with known coagulopathy, on anti-platelet or anti-coagulant therapy. Patients with other concomitant autoimmune diseases (besides MS). LEMTRADA is not recommended for patients with inactive disease or those stable on current therapy. Patients treated with LEMTRADA must be given the Package Leaflet, the Patient Alert Card and the Patient Guide. Before treatment, patients must be informed about the risks and benefits, and the need to commit to follow-up from treatment initiation until at least 48 months after the last infusion of the second LEMTRADA treatment course. If an additional course is administered, safety-follow up should be continued until at least 48 months after the last infusion. Treatment may result in the formation of autoantibodies and increase the risk of autoimmune mediated conditions which may be serious and life threatening. Reported autoimmune conditions, include thyroid disorders, immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), nephropathies (e.g. anti-glomerular basement membrane disease), autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), and acquired haemophilia A. In the post-marketing setting, patients developing multiple autoimmune disorders after LEMTRADA treatment have been observed. Patients who develop autoimmunity should be assessed for other autoimmune mediated conditions (see section 4.3). Patients and physicians should be made aware of the potential later onset of autoimmune disorders after the 48 months monitoring period. Cases of acquired haemophilia A (anti-factor VIII antibodies) have been reported in both clinical trial and post-marketing setting. Patients typically present with spontaneous subcutaneous haematomas and extensive bruising although haematuria, epistaxis, gastrointestinal or other types of bleeding may occur. A coagulopathy panel including aPTT must be obtained in all patients that present with such symptoms. In case of a prolonged aPTT patient should be referred to a haematologist. Educate patients on the signs and symptoms of acquired haemophilia A and to seek immediate medical attention, if any of these symptoms are observed. Serious events of ITP have been observed in 12 (1%) patients treated in controlled clinical trials in MS (corresponding to an annualised rate 4.7 events/1000 patient years). An additional 12 serious events of ITP has been observed through a median of 6.1 years (maximum 12 years) of follow-up (cumulative annualised rate of 2.8 events/1000 patient years). One patient developed ITP that went unrecognised prior to implementation of monthly blood monitoring requirements and died from intracerebral haemorrhage. In 79.5% of cases, ITP onset occurred within 4 years after first exposure. However, in some cases ITP developed years later. Symptoms of ITP could include (but are not limited to) easy bruising, petechiae, spontaneous mucocutaneous bleeding (e.g., epistaxis, haemoptysis), heavier than normal or irregular menstrual bleeding. Haemoptysis may also be indicative of anti-GBM disease (see below), and an appropriate differential diagnosis has to be undertaken. Remind the patient to remain vigilant for symptoms they may experience and to seek immediate medical help if they have any concerns. Complete blood counts with differential should be obtained prior to initiation of treatment and at monthly intervals thereafter until at least 48 months after the last infusion. After this period of time, testing should be performed based on clinical findings suggestive of ITP. If ITP is suspected a complete blood count should be obtained immediately. If ITP onset is confirmed, appropriate medical intervention should be promptly initiated, including immediate referral to a specialist. Data from clinical trials in MS has shown that adherence to the blood monitoring requirements and education relative to signs and symptoms of ITP has led to early detection and treatment of ITP with most cases responding to first-line medical therapy. Nephropathies, including anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) disease, have been observed in 6 (0.4%) patients in clinical trials in MS through a median of 6.1 years (maximum 12 years) of follow-up and generally occurred within 39 months following the last administration of LEMTRADA. In clinical trials, there were 2 cases of anti-GBM disease. Both cases were serious, were identified early through clinical and laboratory monitoring, and had a positive outcome after treatment. Clinical manifestations of nephropathy may include elevation in serum creatinine, haematuria, and/or proteinuria. While not observed in clinical trials, alveolar haemorrhage manifested as haemoptysis may occur with anti-GBM disease. Haemoptysis may also be indicative of ITP or acquired haemophilia A (see above), and an appropriate differential diagnosis has to be undertaken. The patient should be reminded to remain vigilant for symptoms they may experience and to seek immediate medical help if they have any concerns. Anti-GBM disease may lead to renal failure requiring dialysis and/or transplantation if not treated rapidly and can be life-threatening if left untreated. Serum creatinine levels should be obtained prior to initiation of treatment and at monthly intervals thereafter until at least 48 months after the last infusion. Urinalysis with microscopy should be obtained prior to initiation and at monthly intervals thereafter until at least 48 months after the last infusion. The observation of clinically significant changes from baseline in serum creatinine, unexplained haematuria, and/or proteinuria, should prompt further evaluation for nephropathies including immediate referral to a specialist. Early detection and treatment of nephropathies may decrease the risk of poor outcomes. After this period of time, testing should be performed based on clinical findings suggestive of nephropathies. Thyroid endocrine disorders including autoimmune thyroid disorders have been observed in 36.8% of patients treated with LEMTRADA 12 mg in clinical trials in MS with a median of 6.1 years (maximum 12 years) of follow- up from the first LEMTRADA exposure. The incidence of thyroid events was higher in patients with a medical history of thyroid disorders both in the LEMTRADA and interferon beta 1a (IFNB-1a) treatment groups. Observed autoimmune thyroid disorders included hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism. Most events were mild to moderate in severity. Serious endocrine events occurred in 4.4% of patients, with Basedow's disease (also known as Graves' disease), hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, autoimmune thyroiditis, and goitre occurring in more than 1 patient. Most thyroid events were managed with conventional medical therapy however some patients required surgical intervention. In the post-marketing setting several patients who developed biopsy proven AIH had previously developed autoimmune thyroid disorders. Thyroid function tests, such as thyroid stimulating hormone levels, should be obtained prior to initiation of treatment and every 3 months thereafter until 48 months following the last infusion. After this period of time testing should be performed based on clinical findings suggestive of thyroid dysfunction or in case of pregnancy. Thyroid disease poses special risks in women who are pregnant (see section 4.6). In clinical trials, 74% of patients with positive anti-thyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO) antibodies at baseline developed a thyroid event compared with 38% of patients with a baseline negative status. The vast majority (approximately 80%) of patients who presented with a thyroid event after treatment were anti-TPO antibody negative at baseline. Therefore, regardless of pretreatment anti-TPO antibody status patients may develop a thyroid adverse reaction and must have all tests periodically performed as described above. Suspected autoimmune cytopenias such as neutropenia, haemolytic anaemia and pancytopenia have been infrequently reported in clinical trials in MS. Complete blood count results (see above under ITP) should be used to monitor for cytopenias, including neutropenia. If a cytopenia is confirmed, appropriate medical intervention should be promptly initiated, including referral to a specialist. Cases of autoimmune hepatitis (including fatal cases and cases requiring liver transplantation) and hepatic injury related to infections have been reported in patients treated with LEMTRADA (see section 4.3). Liver function tests should beperformed before initial treatment and at monthly intervals until at least 48 months after the last infusion. Patients should be informed about the risk of autoimmune hepatitis, hepatic injury and related symptoms. During post-marketing use, HLH (including fatal cases) has been reported in patients treated with LEMTRADA. HLH is a life-threatening syndrome of pathologic immune activation characterized by clinical signs and symptoms of extreme systemic inflammation. HLH is characterized by fever, hepatomegaly and cytopenias. It is associated with high mortality rates if not recognized early and treated. Symptoms have been reported to occur within a few months to four years following the initiation of treatment. Patients should be informed about symptoms of HLH and time to onset. Patients who develop early manifestations of pathologic immune activation should be evaluated immediately, and a diagnosis of HLH should be considered. In clinical trials, infusion associated reactions (IARs) were defined as any adverse event occurring during or within 24 hours of LEMTRADA infusion. The majority of these may be due to cytokine release during infusion. Most patients treated with LEMTRADA in clinical trials in MS experienced mild to moderate IARs during and/or up to 24 hours after LEMTRADA 12 mg administration. The incidence of IARs was higher in course 1 than in subsequent courses. Through all available follow-up, including patients who received additional treatment courses, the most common IARs included headache, rash, pyrexia, nausea, urticaria, pruritus, insomnia, chills, flushing, fatigue, dyspnoea, dysgeusia, chest discomfort, generalised rash, tachycardia, bradycardia, dyspepsia, dizziness, and pain. Serious reactions occurred in 3% of patients and included cases of headache, pyrexia, urticaria, tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, nausea, chest discomfort, and hypotension. Clinical manifestations of anaphylaxis may appear similar to clinical manifestations of infusion associated reactions, but would tend to be more severe or potentially life-threatening. Reactions attributed to anaphylaxis have been reported rarely in contrast to infusion associated reactions. It is recommended that patients be premedicated to ameliorate the effects of infusion reactions (see section 4.2). Most patients in controlled clinical trials received antihistamines and/or antipyretics before at least one LEMTRADA infusion. IARs may occur in patients despite pretreatment. Observation for infusion reactions is recommended during and for at least 2 hours after LEMTRADA infusion. Extended observation time (hospitalization) should be considered, as appropriate. If severe infusion reactions occur, the intravenous infusion should be discontinued immediately. Resources for the management of anaphylaxis or serious reactions (see below) should be available. Other serious reactions temporally associated with LEMTRADA infusion During post-marketing use, rare, serious, sometimes fatal and unpredictable adverse events from various organ systems have been reported. In the majority of cases time to onset was within 1-3 days of the LEMTRADA infusion. Reactions have occurred following any of the doses and also after course number 2. Patients should be informed about the signs and symptoms and on the time to onset of the events. Patients should be advised to seek immediate medical attention if any of these symptoms occur and be informed on the potential for delayed onset. Several of the patient reported were below 50 years of age and had no history of hypertension, bleeding disorders or concomitant anticoagulants or platelet inhibitors. In some patients there was increased blood pressure from baseline before the haemorrhage. Several of the patients reported were below 40 years of age and had no risk factors for ischemic heart disease. It was noted that in some of the patients, blood pressure and /or heart rate was temporarily abnormal during the infusion. Cases of cervicocephalic arterial dissections, including multiple dissections, have been reported both within the first days after the LEMTRADA infusion or later on within the first month after the infusion. Reported cases of temporally associated events were not related to anti-GBM disease (Goodpasteurs syndrome). The reported thrombocytopenia occurred within the first days after the infusion (unlike ITP). It was often self-limiting and relatively mild, although severity and outcome was unknown in many cases. Rare cases of pericarditis, pericardial effusion and other pericardial events have been reported, both as part of acute infusion reaction and with later onset. Infusion instructions to reduce serious reactions temporally associated with LEMTRADA infusion o Obtain a baseline ECG and vital signs, including heart rate and blood pressure measurement. o Perform laboratory tests (complete blood count with differential, serum transaminases, serum creatinine, test of thyroid function and urinanalysis with microscopy). o Perform continuous/frequent (at least every hour) monitoring of heart rate, blood pressure and overall clinical status of the patients • If the patient shows clinical symptoms suggesting development of a serious adverse event associated with the infusion (myocardial ischemia, hemorrhagic stroke, cervico-cephalic arterial dissection or pulmonary alveolar haemorrhage o Observation for infusion reactions is recommended for a minimum of 2 hours after LEMTRADA infusion. Patients with clinical symptoms suggesting development of a serious adverse event temporarily associated with the infusion (myocardial ischemia, haemorrhagic stroke, cervico-cephalic arterial dissection or pulmonary alveolar haemorrhage) should be closely monitored until complete resolution of the symptoms. The observation time should be extended (hospitalisation) as appropriate. The patients should be educated on the potential for delayed onset of infusion associated reactions and instructed to report symptoms and seek appropriate medical care. o Platelet count should be obtained immediately after infusion on Days 3 and 5 of the first infusion course, as well as immediately after infusion on Day 3 of any subsequent course. Clinically significant thrombocytopenia needs to be followed until resolution. Referral to a haematologist for management should be considered. Infections occurred in 71% of patients treated with LEMTRADA 12 mg as compared to 53% of patients treated with subcutaneous interferon beta-1a [IFNB 1a](44mcg 3-times weekly) in controlled clinical trials in MS up to 2 years in duration and were predominantly mild to moderate in severity. Infections that occurred more often in LEMTRADA –treated patients than IFNB 1a patients included nasopharyngitis, urinary tract infection, upper respiratory tract infection, sinusitis, oral herpes, influenza, and bronchitis. Serious infections occurred in 2.7% of patients treated with LEMTRADA as compared to 1% of patients treated with IFNB-1a in controlled clinical trials in MS. Serious infections in the LEMTRADA group included: appendicitis, gastroenteritis, pneumonia, herpes zoster, and tooth infection. Infections were generally of typical duration and resolved following conventional medical treatment. The cumulative annualised rate of infections was 0.99 through a median of 6.1 years (maximum 12 years) of follow-up from the first LEMTRADA exposure, as compared to 1.27 in controlled clinical trials. Serious varicella zoster virus infections, including primary varicella and varicella zoster re-activation, have occurred more often in patients treated with LEMTRADA 12 mg (0.4%) in clinical trials as compared to IFNB-1a (0%). Cervical human papilloma virus (HPV) infection, including cervical dysplasia and anogenital warts, has also been reported in patients treated with LEMTRADA 12 mg (2%). It is recommended that HPV screening be completed annually for female patients. Cytomegalovirus infections (CMV) including cases of CMV reactivation have been reported in LEMTRADA-treated patients. Most cases occurred within 2 months of alemtuzumab dosing. Before initiation of therapy, evaluation of immune serostatus could be considered according to local guidelines. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, including reactivation and severe and sometimes fatal EBV hepatitis cases, has been reported in LEMTRADA-treated patients. Tuberculosis has been reported for patients treated with LEMTRADA and IFNB-1a in controlled clinical trials. Active and latent tuberculosis, including a few cases of disseminated tuberculosis, have been reported in 0.3% of the patients treated with LEMTRADA, most often in endemic regions. Before initiation of therapy, all patients must be evaluated for both active or inactive (“latent”) tuberculosis infection, according to local guidelines. Listeriosis/ has been reported in LEMTRADA treated patients, generally within one month of LEMTRADA infusion. To reduce the risk of infection, patients receiving LEMTRADA should avoid ingestion of uncooked or undercooked meats, soft cheeses and unpasteurized dairy products two weeks prior to, during, and for at least one month after LEMTRADA infusion. Superficial fungal infections, especially oral and vaginal candidiasis, occurred more commonly in LEMTRADA –treated patients (12%) than in patients treated with IFNB-1a (3%) in controlled clinical trials in MS. Pneumonitis has been reported in patients who received LEMTRADA infusions. Most cases occurred within the first month after treatment with LEMTRADA. Patients should be advised to report symptoms of pneumonitis, which may include shortness of breath, cough, wheezing, chest pain or tightness and hemoptysis. Initiation of treatment with LEMTRADA should be delayed in patients with severe active infection until resolution. Patients receiving LEMTRADA should be instructed to report symptoms of infections to a physician. Prophylaxis with an oral anti-herpes agent should be initiated starting on the first day of LEMTRADA treatment and continuing for a minimum of 1 month following each course of treatment. In clinical trials patients were administered cyclovir 200 mg twice a day or equivalent. LEMTRADA has not been administered for treatment of MS concomitantly with or following antineoplastic or immunosuppressive therapies. As with other immunomodulating therapies, potential combined effects on the patient's immune system should be taken into account when considering administration of LEMTRADA. Concomitant use of LEMTRADA with any of these therapies could increase the risk of immunosuppression. No data are available on the association of LEMTRADA with Hepatitis B virus (HBV) or Hepatitis C virus (HCV) reactivation as patients with evidence of active or chronic infections were excluded from clinical trials. Screening patients at high risk of HBV and/or HCV infection before initiation of LEMTRADA should be considered and caution should be exercised in prescribing LEMTRADA to patients identified as carriers of HBV and/or HCV as these patients may be at risk of irreversible liver damage relative to a potential virus reactivation as a consequence of their pre-existing status. Rare cases of PML (including fatal), have been reported in MS patients after treatment with alemtuzumab. Patients treated with alemtuzumab must be monitored for any signs that may be suggestive of PML. Risk factors of special importance include previous immunosuppressive treatment, in particular other MS treatments with known risk of causing PML. MRI findings may be apparent before clinical signs or symptoms. Prior to initiation and readministration of alemtuzumab treatment, MRI scan should be made and evaluated for signs that are consistent with PML. Further evaluation, including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing for JC Viral DNA and repeat neurological assessments should be performed as appropriate. The physician should be particularly alert to symptoms suggestive of PML that the patient may not notice (e.g. cognitive, neurological or psychiatric symptoms). Patients should also be advised to inform their relatives or caregivers about their treatment, since they may notice symptoms that the patient is not aware of. PML should be considered as a differential diagnosis in any MS patient taking alemtuzumab presenting with neurological symptoms and/or new brain lesions in MRI. If a diagnosis of PML has been made, treatment with alemtuzumab should not be started or restarted. LEMTRADA may increase the risk of acute acalculous cholecystitis. In controlled clinical studies, 0.2% of LEMTRADA-treated MS patients developed acute acalculous cholecystitis, compared to 0% of patients treated with INFB-1a. During post-marketing use, additional cases of acute acalculous cholecystitis have been reported in LEMTRADA-treated patients. Time to onset of symptoms ranged from less than 24 hours to 2 months after LEMTRADA infusion. Most patients were treated conservatively with antibiotics and recovered without surgical intervention, whereas others underwent cholecystectomy. Symptoms of acute acalculous cholecystitis include abdominal pain, abdominal tenderness, fever, nausea, and vomiting. Acute acalculous cholecystitis is a condition that may be associated with high morbidity and mortality rates if not diagnosed early and treated. If acute acalculous cholecystitis is suspected, evaluate and treat promptly. As with other immunomodulatory therapies, caution should be exercised in initiating LEMTRADA therapy in patients with pre-existing and/or an on-going malignancy. It is not currently known if LEMTRADA confers a higher risk for developing thyroid malignancies, since thyroid autoimmunity may itself be a risk factor for thyroid malignancies. Placental transfer and potential pharmacologic activity of LEMTRADA were observed in mice during gestation and following delivery. Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraceptive measures during treatment and for 4 months following a course of LEMTRADA treatment (see section 4.6). It is recommended that patients have completed local immunisation requirements at least 6 weeks prior to treatment with LEMTRADA. The ability to generate an immune response to any vaccine following LEMTRADA treatment has not been studied. The safety of immunisation with live viral vaccines following a course of LEMTRADA treatment has not been formally studied in controlled clinical trials in MS and should not be administered to MS patients who have recently received a course of LEMTRADA. Varicella zoster virus antibody testing/vaccination As for any immune modulating medicinal product, before initiating a course of LEMTRADA treatment, patients without a history of chickenpox or without vaccination against varicella zoster virus (VZV) should be tested for antibodies to VZV. VZV vaccination of antibody-negative patients should be considered prior to treatment initiation with LEMTRADA. To allow for the full effect of the VZV vaccination to occur, treatment with LEMTRADA should be postponed for 6 weeks following vaccination. Recommended laboratory tests for monitoring patients Clinical examination and laboratory tests should be conducted at periodic intervals until at least 48 months following the last treatment course of LEMTRADA in order to monitor for early signs of autoimmune diseases: • Complete blood count with differential, serum transaminases and serum creatinine levels (prior to treatment initiation and at monthly intervals thereafter). • Urinalysis with microscopy (prior to treatment initiation and at monthly intervals thereafter) • A test of thyroid function, such as thyroid stimulating hormone level (prior to treatment initiation and every 3 months thereafter). Information from use of alemtuzumab prior to the marketing authorisation of LEMTRADA outside of company-sponsored studies The following adverse reactions were identified prior to registration of LEMTRADA during use of alemtuzumab for the treatment of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (B-CLL), as well as for the treatment of other disorders, generally at higher and more frequent doses (e.g. 30 mg) than that recommended in the treatment of MS. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to alemtuzumab exposure. Autoimmune events reported in alemtuzumab-treated patients include neutropenia, haemolytic anaemia (including a fatal case), acquired haemophilia, anti-GBM disease, and thyroid disease. Serious and sometimes fatal autoimmune phenomena including autoimmune haemolytic anaemia, autoimmune thrombocytopenia, aplastic anaemia, Guillain-Barré syndrome, and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy have been reported in alemtuzumab-treated non-MS patients. A positive Coombs test has been reported in an alemtuzumab-treated oncology patient. A fatal event of transfusion associated graft versus host disease has been reported in an alemtuzumab-treated oncology patient. Serious and sometimes fatal IARs including bronchospasm, hypoxia, syncope, pulmonary infiltrates, acute respiratory distress syndrome , respiratory arrest, myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, acute cardiac insufficiency, and cardiac arrest have been observed in non-MS patients treated with alemtuzumab at higher and more frequent doses than used in MS. Severe anaphylaxis and other hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic shock and angioedema have also been reported. Serious and sometimes fatal viral, bacterial, protozoan, and fungal infections, including those due to reactivation of latent infections, have been reported in non-MS patients treated with alemtuzumab at higher and more frequent doses than used in MS. Severe bleeding reactions have been reported in non-MS patients. Congestive heart failure, cardiomyopathy, and decreased ejection fraction have been reported in alemtuzumab-treated non-MS patients previously treated with potentially cardiotoxic agents. Epstein-Barr Virus-associated lymphoproliferative disorders Epstein-Barr Virus-associated lymphoproliferative disorders have been observed outside company-sponsored studies. This medicine contains less than 1 mmol potassium (39 mg) per infusion, i.e. it is essentially 'potassium- free'. This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per infusion, i.e. it is essentially 'sodium- free'. 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction No formal drug interaction studies have been conducted with LEMTRADA using the recommended dose in patients with MS. In a controlled clinical trial in MS patients recently treated with beta interferon and glatiramer acetate were required to discontinue treatment 28 days before initiating treatment with LEMTRADA. Serum concentrations were low or undetectable within approximately 30 days following each treatment course. Therefore, women of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception when receiving a course of treatment with LEMTRADA and up to 4 months after each course of treatment. There is a limited amount of data from the use of alemtuzumab in pregnant women. LEMTRADA should be administered during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus. Human IgG is known to cross the placental barrier; alemtuzumab may cross the placental barrier as well and thus potentially pose a risk to the foetus. Animal studies have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). It is not known whether alemtuzumab can cause foetal harm when administered to pregnant women or whether it can affect reproductive capacity. Thyroid disease (see section 4.4 ) poses special risks in women who are pregnant. Without treatment of hypothyroidism during pregnancy, there is an increased risk for miscarriage and foetal effects such as mental retardation and dwarfism. In mothers with Graves' disease, maternal thyroid stimulating hormone receptor antibodies can be transferred to a developing foetus and can cause transient neonatal Graves' disease. Alemtuzumab was detected in the milk and offspring of lactating female mice. It is unknown whether alemtuzumab is excreted in human milk. A risk to the suckling newborn/infant cannot be excluded. Therefore, breast-feeding should be discontinued during each course of treatment with LEMTRADA and for 4 months following the last infusion of each treatment course. However, benefits of conferred immunity through breast-milk may outweigh the risks of potential exposure to alemtuzumab for the suckling newborn/infant. There are no adequate clinical safety data on the effect of LEMTRADA on fertility. In a sub-study in 13 male LEMTRADA-treated patients (treated with either 12 mg or 24 mg), there was no evidence of aspermia, azoospermia, consistently depressed sperm count, motility disorders or an increase in sperm morphological abnormalities. CD52 is known to be present in human and rodent reproductive tissues. Animal data have shown effects on fertility in humanised mice (see section 5.3), however a potential impact on human fertility during the period of exposure is unknown based on the available data. LEMTRADA has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Most patients experience IARs which occur during or within 24 hours after treatment with LEMTRADA. Some of the IARs (e.g. dizziness) could temporarily impact the patient's ability to drive or use machines and caution should be exercised until these are resolved. A total of 1,486 patients treated with LEMTRADA (12 mg or 24 mg) constituted the safety population in a pooled analysis of MS clinical studies with a median follow-up of 6.1 years (maximum 12 years), resulting in 8,635 patient-years of safety follow-up. The most important adverse reactions are autoimmunity (ITP, thyroid disorders, nephropathies, cytopenias), IARs, and infections. These are described in section 4.4 The most common adverse reactions with LEMTRADA (in ≥20% of patients) were rash, headache, pyrexia, and respiratory tract infections. The table below is based on the pooled safety data on all LEMTRADA 12 mg-treated patients during all available follow up in clinical trials. Adverse reactions are listed by Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) System Organ Class (SOC) and Preferred Term (PT). Frequencies are defined according to the following convention: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions have been presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

Terms marked with asterisk (*) in Table 1 include adverse reactions reported as Infusion Associated Reactions. Terms marked with two asterisks (**) in Table 1 include adverse reactions observed in the post marketing setting which have occurred in the majority of cases with time to onset within 1-3 days of LEMTRADA infusion, following any of the doses during the treatment course. Cases of severe (including fatal) neutropenia have been reported within 2 months of LEMTRADA infusion. The type of adverse reactions including seriousness and severity observed in LEMTRADA treatment groups through all available follow-up including patients who received additional treatment courses were similar to those in the active-controlled studies. The incidence of IARs was higher in course 1 than in subsequent courses. In patients continuing from controlled clinical studies and who did not receive any additional LEMTRADA after the initial 2 treatment courses, the rate (events per person-year) of most adverse reactions was comparable to or reduced in years 3-6 as compared to years 1 and 2. The rate of thyroid adverse reactions was highest in year three and declined thereafter. Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed below: or search for MHRA Yellow Card in the Google Play or Apple App Store In controlled clinical trials two MS patients accidentally received up to 60 mg LEMTRADA (i.e. total dose for initial treatment course) in a single infusion and experienced serious reactions (headache, rash, and either hypotension or sinus tachycardia). Doses of LEMTRADA greater than those tested in clinical studies may increase the intensity and/or duration of infusion-associated adverse reactions or its immune effects. There is no known antidote for alemtuzumab over dosage. Treatment consists of discontinuation of the medicinal product and supportive therapy. Pharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, Selective immunosuppressants, ATC code: L04AA34 Alemtuzumab, is a recombinant DNA-derived humanised monoclonal antibody directed against the 21-28 kD cell surface glycoprotein CD52. Alemtuzumab is an IgG1 kappa antibody with human variable framework and constant regions, and complementary-determining regions from a murine (rat) monoclonal antibody. The antibody has an approximate molecular weight of 150 kD. Alemtuzumab binds to CD52, a cell surface antigen present at high levels on T (CD3) and B (CD19) lymphocytes, and at lower levels on natural killer cells monocytes, and macrophages. There is little or no CD52 detected on neutrophils, plasma cells, or bone marrow stem cells. Alemtuzumab acts through antibody-dependent cellular cytolysis and complement-mediated lysis following cell surface binding to T and B lymphocytes. The mechanism by which LEMTRADA exerts its therapeutic effects in MS is not fully elucidated. However, research suggests immunomodulatory effects through the depletion and repopulation of lymphocytes, including: - Alterations in the number, proportions, and properties of some lymphocyte subsets post-treatment - Increased representation of regulatory T cell subsets - Increased representation of memory T- and B-lymphocytes - Transient effects on components of innate immunity (i.e., neutrophils, macrophages, NK cells) The reduction in the level of circulating B and T cells by LEMTRADA and subsequent repopulation, may reduce the potential for relapse, which ultimately delays disease progression. LEMTRADA depletes circulating T and B lymphocytes after each treatment course with the lowest observed values occurring 1 month after a course of treatment (the earliest post-treatment time point in phase 3 studies). Lymphocytes repopulate over time with B-cell recovery usually completed within 6 months. CD3 and CD4 lymphocyte counts rise more slowly towards normal, but generally do not return to baseline by 12-months post-treatment. Approximately 40% of patients had total lymphocyte counts reaching the lower limit of normal (LLN) by 6 months after each treatment course, and approximately 80% of patients had total lymphocyte counts reaching the LLN by 12 months after each course. Neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils, and natural killer cells are only transiently affected by LEMTRADA. The safety and efficacy of alemtuzumab in MS were evaluated in 3 randomised, rater-blinded, active-comparator clinical trials and 1 uncontrolled, rater-blinded extension study in patients with RRMS. Study design/demographics for Studies 1, 2, 3 and 4 are shown in Table 2 Table 2: Study Design and Baseline Characteristics for Studies 1,, Patients with active MS, defined as at least 2 relapses within the prior 2 years. Patients with active MS, defined as at least 2 relapses within the prior 2 years and 1 or more contrast-enhancing lesions Patients with inadequate response to prior therapy* Patients who participated in CAMMS223, CAMMS323, or CAMMS32400507 * Defined as patients having experienced at least 1 relapse during treatment with beta interferon or glatiramer acetate after having been on therapy with medicinal product for at least 6 months. Study primary endpoint was scored at 3 years. Additional follow-up provided data through a median of 4.8 years (maximum 6.7). Table 3: Key Clinical and MRI Endpoints from Studies 1 and 2 Relapse Rate Annualised Relapse rate (ARR) (95% CI) (Confirmed Disability Worsening [CDW] Patients with 6-month CDW (95% CI) Patients with new or enlarging T2 lesions through Year 2 Patients with Gadolinium enhancing lesions through Year 2 Patients with new T1 hypointense lesions through Year 2 1 Co-primary endpoints: ARR & CDW. The study was declared successful if at least one of the two co-primary endpoint was met. 2 CDW was defined as an increase of at least 1 point on the expanded disability status scale (EDSS) from a baseline EDSS score ≥1.0 (1.5 point increase for patients with baseline EDSS of 0) that was sustained for 6 months. 3 Estimated using a mixed model for repeated measures. In alignment with the effect on relapse rate, supportive analyses from Study 1 (CAMMS323) showed that LEMTRADA 12 mg/day led to significantly fewer LEMTRADA -treated patients experiencing severe relapses (61% reduction, p=0.0056) and signficantly fewer relapses that led to steroid treatment (58% reduction, p<0.0001) compared to IFNB-1a. Supportive analyses from Study 2 (CAMMS32400507) showed that LEMTRADA 12 mg/day led to significantly fewer LEMTRADA -treated patients experiencing severe relapses (48% reduction, p=0.0121), and significantly fewer relapses that led to steroid treatment (56% reduction, p<0.0001) or to hospitalization (55% reduction, p=0.0045) compared to IFNB-1a. Time to onset of CDI was defined as a decrease of at least one point on the EDSS from a baseline EDSS score ≥ 2 that was sustained for at least 6 months. CDI is a measure for sustained disability improvement. 29% of patients treated with LEMTRADA reached CDI in Study 2, while only 13% of subcutaneous IFNB-1a treated patiets reached this endpoint. The difference was statistically significant (p=0.0002). Study 3 (phase 2 study CAMMS223) evaluated the safety and efficacy of LEMTRADA in patients with RRMS over the course of 3 years. Patients had an EDSS from 0-3.0, at least 2 clinical episodes of MS in the prior 2 years, and ≥1 gadolinium-enhancing lesion at study entry. Patients had not received prior therapy for MS. Patients were treated with LEMTRADA 12 mg/day (N=108) or 24 mg/day (N=108) administered once per day for 5 days at month 0 and for 3 days at month 12 or subcutaneous IFNB-1a 44 µg (N=107) administered 3 times per week for 3 years. Forty-six patients received a third course of LEMTRADA treatment at 12 mg/day or 24 mg/day for 3 days at month 24. At 3 years, LEMTRADA reduced the risk of 6-month CDW by 76% (hazard ratio 0.24 [95% CI: 0.110, 0.545], p<0.0006) and reduced the ARR by 67% (rate ratio 0.33 [95% CI: 0.196, 0.552], p<0.0001) as compared to subcutaneous IFNB-1a. LEMTRADA 12 mg/day led to significantly lower EDSS scores (improved compared to baseline) through 2 years of follow up, compared with IFNB-1a (p<0.0001). In the subgroup of RRMS patients with 2 or more relapses in the prior year and at least 1 Gd-enhanced T1 lesion at baseline, the annualised relapse rate was 0.26 (95% CI: 0.20, 0.34) in the Lemtrada treated group (n = 205) and 0.51 (95% CI: 0.40, 0.64) in the IFNB-1a group (n = 102) (p<0.0001). This analysis includes data from Phase 3 studies only (CAMMS324 and CAMMS323) due to differences in the MRI acquisition algorithms between the Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies. These results were obtained from a post hoc analysis and should be interpreted cautiously. Study 4, was a Phase 3, multicenter, open-label, rater-blinded, efficacy and safety extension study for patients with RRMS who participated in Study 1, 2, or 3 (prior phase 3 and 2 studies) to assess long-term efficacy and safety of LEMTRADA. The study provides efficacy and safety through a median of 6 years from entry into Studies 1 and 2. Patients in the extension study (Study 4) were eligible to receive additional as-needed LEMTRADA treatment course(s) upon documentation of resumed disease activity, defined as the occurrence of ≥1 MS relapse and/or ≥2 new or enlarging brain or spinal lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Additional course(s) of LEMTRADA were administered at 12 mg/day for 3 consecutive days (36 mg total dose) at least 12 months after the prior treatment course. 91.8% of the patients treated with LEMTRADA 12 mg in Studies 1 and 2 entered Study 4. 82.7% of these patients completed the study. Approximately half (51.2%) of patients initially treated with LEMTRADA 12 mg/day in Study 1 or 2 who enrolled in Study 4, received only the initial 2 courses of LEMTRADA and no other disease modifying treatment throughout 6 years of follow-up. 46.6% of the patients initially treated with LEMTRADA 12 mg/day in Study 1 or 2 received additional courses upon documented evidence of MS disease activity (relapse and/or MRI) and the treating physician's decision to retreat. No characteristics at study entry identified patients who would later receive one or more additional courses. Through 6 years from initial LEMTRADA treatment, patients continuing in follow-up showed rates of MS relapse, brain lesion formation on MRI, and brain volume loss consistent with LEMTRADA's treatment effects during Studies 1 and 2 as well as predominantly stable or improved disability scores. Including follow-up in Study 4, patients originally treated with LEMTRADA in Studies 1 and 2, respectively, had ARRs 0.17 and 0.23, CDW was seen in 22.3% and 29.7%, while 32.7% and 42.5% achieved CDI. In each year of Study 4, patients from both studies continued to show a low risk of forming new T2 (27.4% to 33.2%) or gadolinium-enhancing lesions (9.4% to 13.5%), and the median annual percent change in brain parenchymal fraction ranged from 0.19% to -0.09%. Among patients who received one or two additional LEMTRADA treatment courses, improvements were seen in relapse rate, MRI activity and mean disability scores following a first or second LEMTRADA retreatment (Courses 3 and 4) when compared with outcomes in the preceding year. For these patients, the ARR declined from 0.79 in the year prior to Course 3 to 0.18 one year after, and the mean EDSS score from 2.89 to 2.69. The percentage of patients with new or enlarging T2 lesions declined from 50.8% the year prior to Course 3 to 35.9% one year after, and new gadolinium-enhancing lesions from 32.2% to 11.9%. Similar improvements in ARR, mean EDSS score, and T2 and gadolinium-enhancing lesions were seen after Course 4 when compared with the prior year. These improvements were subsequently maintained, but no firm conclusions can be made with regards to the longer-term efficacy (e.g. 3 and 4 years after additional treatment courses) because many patients completed the study before reaching these time points. The benefits and risks of 5 or more treatment courses have not been established. As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. Data reflect the percentage of patients whose test results were considered positive for antibodies to alemtuzumab using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and confirmed by a competitive binding assay. Positive samples were further evaluated for evidence of inhibition using a flow cytometry assay. Patients in clinical trials in MS had serum samples collected 1, 3, and 12 months after each treatment course for determination of anti-alemtuzumab antibodies.Approximately 85% of patients receiving LEMTRADA tested positive for anti-alemtuzumab antibodies during the study, with ≥90% of these patients testing positive also for antibodies that inhibited alemtuzumab binding . Patients who developed anti-alemtuzumab antibodies did so by 15 months from initial exposure. Through 2 treatment courses, there was no association of the presence of anti-alemtuzumab or inhibitory anti-alemtuzumab antibodies with a reduction in efficacy, change in pharmacodynamics, or the occurrence of adverse reactions, including infusion associated reactions. High titer anti-alemtuzumab antibodies observed in some patients were associated with incomplete lymphocyte depletion following a third or fourth treatment course, but there was no clear impact of anti-alemtuzumab antibodies on the clinical efficacy or safety profile of LEMTRADA. The incidence of antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including inhibitory antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medicines, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to LEMTRADA with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading. The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with alemtuzumab in children from birth to less than 10 years in treatment of multiple sclerosis (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with LEMTRADA in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in RRMS (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use) The pharmacokinetics of alemtuzumab were evaluated in a total of 216 patients with RRMS who received intravenous infusions of either 12 mg/day or 24 mg/day on 5 consecutive days, followed by 3 consecutive days 12 months following the initial treatment course. Serum concentrations increased with each consecutive dose within a treatment course, with the highest observed concentrations occurring following the last infusion of a treatment course. Administration of 12 mg/day resulted in a mean C of 3014 ng/ml on day 5 of the initial treatment course, and 2276 ng/ml on day 3 of the second treatment course. The alpha half-life approximated 4-5 days and was comparable between courses leading to low or undetectable serum concentrations within approximately 30 days following each treatment course. Alemtuzumab is a protein for which the expected metabolic pathway is degradation to small peptides and individual amino acids by widely distributed proteolytic enzymes. Classical biotransformation studies have not been conducted. Conclusions cannot be made with available data on the effect of race and gender on the pharmacokinetics of alemtuzumab. The pharmacokinetics of alemtuzumab in RRMS has not been studied in patients aged 55 years and older. There have been no studies to assess the carcinogenic or mutagenic potential of alemtuzumab. Treatment with intravenous alemtuzumab at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day, administered for 5 consecutive days (AUC of 7.1 times the human exposure at the recommended daily dose) had no effect on fertility and reproductive performance in male huCD52 transgenic mice. The number of normal sperm was significantly reduced (<10%) relative to controls and the percent abnormal sperm (detached heads or no heads) were significantly increased (up to 3%). However, these changes did not affect fertility and were therefore considered to be non-adverse. In female mice dosed with intravenous alemtuzumab up to 10 mg/kg/day (AUC of 4.7 times the human exposure at the recommended daily dose) for 5 consecutive days prior to cohabitation with wild-type male mice, the average number of corpora lutea and implantation sites per mouse were significantly reduced as compared to vehicle treated animals. Reduced gestational weight gain relative to the vehicle controls was observed in pregnant mice dosed with 10 mg/kg/day. A reproductive toxicity study in pregnant mice exposed to intravenous doses of alemtuzumab up to 10 mg/kg/day (AUC 2.4 times the human exposure at the recommended dose of 12 mg/day) for 5 consecutive days during gestation resulted in significant increases in the number of dams with all conceptuses dead or resorbed, along with a concomitant reduction in the number of dams with viable foetuses. There were no external, soft tissue, or skeletal malformations or variations observed at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day. Placental transfer and potential pharmacologic activity of alemtuzumab were observed during gestation and following delivery in mice. In studies in mice, alterations in lymphocyte counts were observed in pups exposed to alemtuzumab during gestation at doses of 3 mg/kg/day for 5 consecutive days (AUC 0.6 times the human exposure at the recommended dose of 12 mg/day). Cognitive, physical, and sexual development of pups exposed to alemtuzumab during lactation were not affected at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day alemtuzumab.

Due to this basic difference in the disease course, different criteria are used to make an accurate diagnosis of PPMS. The criteria for a diagnosis of PPMS are: One year of disease progression (worsening of neurological function without remission), A type of lesion in the brain that is recognized by experts in as being typical of MS Two or more lesions of a similar type in the spinal cord Evidence in the spinal fluid of oligoclonal band or an elevated IgG index, both of which are indicative of immune system activity in the central nervous system Meeting these criteria can sometimes take a fairly long time, particularly if the person has only recently begun to experience neurologic symptoms. Several studies have suggested that the PPMS may take two to three years longer to diagnose than relapsing-remitting MS.

beae909e-91b1-48ab-8f20-4d74b9035d68,"EMA's CHMP issues positive opinion for approval of Genzyme's LEMTRADA in Europe Genzyme, a Sanofi company (EURONEXT: SAN and NYSE: SNY), announced today that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has issued a positive opinion for approval of LEMTRADA™ (alemtuzumab) for the treatment of adult patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) with active disease defined by clinical or imaging features. “The superior Lemtrada vs. Rebif in the clinical trials, which was sustained despite infrequent administration, represents an approach to treatment that promises to reshape the future for many people with active relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.” In addition, the CHMP issued a positive opinion on new active substance designation (NAS) for AUBAGIO (teriflunomide). Earlier this year, the CHMP issued a positive opinion recommending the approval of AUBAGIO for the treatment of adult patients with relapsing remitting MS. The European Commission (EC) is expected to render a final decision to grant marketing authorizations for LEMTRADA and AUBAGIO in the EU in the coming months. ""Today's CHMP opinions set the stage for the approval of two important new treatment options for MS patients. Treatments to-date have addressed some of the unmet needs in MS, but still have limitations,"" said David Meeker, MD, Genzyme President and CEO. ""Upon approval, physicians will have the ability to prescribe LEMTRADA for appropriate relapsing remitting patients based on their impressions of clinical or imaging characteristics regardless of duration of disease or treatment history. Expectations among the MS community are high for LEMTRADA and with today's positive CHMP opinion we are a step closer to making this very innovative treatment available for MS patients in Europe."" The positive CHMP opinion for approval of LEMTRADA was based on data from the CARE-MS I and CARE-MS II trials, in which LEMTRADA was significantly more effective than Rebif(subcutaneous interferon beta-1a 44 mcg three times weekly) at reducing relapse rates. In CARE-MS II, accumulation of disability was significantly slowed in patients given LEMTRADA vs. Rebif, and importantly, patients treated with LEMTRADA were significantly more likely to experience improvement in pre-existing disability. ""Today's announcement from Genzyme represents a key milestone in the extensive program evaluating LEMTRADA in multiple sclerosis,"" said Professor Alastair Compston, Head of the Department of Clinical Neurosciences at the University of Cambridge, United Kingdom. ""The superior efficacy of Lemtrada vs. Rebif in the clinical trials, which was sustained despite infrequent administration, represents an approach to treatment that promises to reshape the future for many people with active relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis."" WHO highlights leading causes of mortality and morbidity worldwide from 2000 to 2019 Oxford University and AstraZeneca release their COVID-19 vaccine results Convalescent plasma in COVID-19 can be effective, especially early in disease LEMTRADA has a novel dosing and administration schedule of two annual treatment courses. The first treatment course of LEMTRADA is administered via intravenous infusion on five consecutive days, and the second course is administered on three consecutive days, 12 months later. The LEMTRADA clinical development program included two randomized Phase III studies comparing treatment with LEMTRADA to Rebifin patients with relapsing-remitting MS who had active disease and were either new to treatment (CARE-MS I) or who had relapsed while on prior therapy (CARE-MS II), as well as an ongoing extension study. A large randomized Phase II study provided the foundation for the Phase III program. Safety results were consistent across both the CARE-MS I and CARE-MS II studies. The most common adverse events associated with LEMTRADA were infusion-associated reactions, including headache, rash, fever, nausea and hives. Infections were common in both the LEMTRADA and Rebif groups. Infections more common on LEMTRADA treatment included upper respiratory and urinary tract infections, herpes viral infections, and influenza. Most infusion-associated reactions and infections were mild to moderate in severity and responded to standard treatments. In both CARE-MS I and CARE-MS II, the incidence of serious adverse events was similar between the two treatment arms. As previously reported, autoimmune disorders were more frequent in patients treated with LEMTRADA, primarily autoimmune thyroid disease which was observed in an estimated 36% of patients during extended follow-up. Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) developed in 1.4 percent of LEMTRADA-treated patients through extended follow-up and 0.3% developed glomerulonephritis. Autoimmune disorders were detected soon after onset through a monitoring program, and were generally managed using standard treatments. A comprehensive risk management program has been proposed to support early detection and management of adverse events. In the U.S. the FDA has accepted for review the company's supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) file seeking approval of LEMTRADA (alemtuzumab) for the treatment of relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS). FDA recently extended the review cycle for LEMTRADA by three months; no additional clinical studies have been requested, therefore FDA action on the application is expected in late 2013.

Can't wait till it is available in the US! Wonder if it is possible to go to the UK and get it? I agree that Lemtrada sounds like the most promising treatment for r-r MS yet. It would be worth going to the UK to get it.  If any one could give me some pointers on what would be involved and the approximate cost, I would appreciate it.  Thanks.

eeb7650e-58a9-4e35-8150-9866f8531407,"— Investigational drug may have different GI tolerability than dimethyl fumarate by SEATTLE -- The investigational drug diroximel fumarate (Vumerity) reduced disease activity in newly-diagnosed relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, and in patients previously treated with interferons or with glatiramer acetate (Copaxone), interim results of the phase III study showed. In addition, adverse gastrointestinal (GI) events with diroximel fumarate were mild or moderate and led to treatment discontinuation in <1% of patients, said Sibyl Wray, MD, of Hope Neurology Multiple Sclerosis Center, in Knoxville, Tennessee, in a poster presentation at the (CMSC) annual meeting. Diroximel fumarate is a novel oral fumarate drug designed to rapidly convert to monomethyl fumarate (MMF) in the body. This may give the drug a different GI tolerability profile than (Tecfidera), which was approved by the FDA in 2013 to treat relapsing-remitting forms of MS. ""If indeed the data shows efficacy in phase III studies, then this new fumarate should offer an additional alternative to treat MS,"" said John Corboy, MD, of the University of Colorado School of Medicine in Denver, who was not involved with the research. ""Presumably, it should be similar in efficacy to doses of dimethyl fumarate that produce similar quantities of MMF after in vivo metabolism,"" Corboy told . In a collaborative effort with Biogen, Alkermes has of diroximel fumarate under the pathway which includes drugs that are not entirely novel molecular entities, referencing Biogen's prior dimethyl fumarate research. EVOLVE-MS-1 is an ongoing, single-arm, open-label, 2-year safety study that plans to enroll approximately 1,000 patients. Data presented at the CMSC meeting were interim results from 696 patients treated for a median of about a year. Participants were ages 18 to 65 years, had a confirmed relapsing-remitting MS diagnosis, and were neurologically stable with no evidence of relapse in the 30 days before screening. They received diroximel fumarate 462 mg twice daily after a 1-week titration period. Overall, incidence of GI adverse events in patients treated with diroximel fumarate was 30.9%. The GI events were generally mild (68%) or moderate (28%) in severity. They resolved in 88.8% of cases and led to 0.7% of patients discontinuing the drug. Flushing or flushing-related events also were reported by 44.3% of EVOLVE-MS-1 patients. They mostly occurred in the first month of treatment, resolved in 74.4% of cases, and led to <1% of patients discontinuing the drug. A post hoc subgroup analysis looked at efficacy in two groups: 82 newly-diagnosed patients who were naive to disease-modifying therapies (DMTs), and 361 patients who previously had been treated with interferon or glatiramer acetate at any time since diagnosis. Overall, 17.1% of newly diagnosed and 19.4% of previously treated patients discontinued diroximel fumarate treatment. In newly-diagnosed patients, treatment with diroximel fumarate led to an adjusted annualized relapse rate of 0.19, representing an 83.3% risk reduction compared with the 12 months before the start of the study. By week 48, 87% of these patients were relapse-free. Mean disability scores remained stable over the first year. The mean gadolinium-enhancing (Gd+) lesion count was 2.2 at baseline and 0.1 at week 48. Among patients who previously had used interferon or glatiramer acetate, treatment with diroximel fumarate led to an adjusted annualized relapse rate of 0.18, a 71.9% decrease from the 12 months before the study start. By week 48, 89% of these patients were relapse-free (compared with 51% in the 12 months before the study started) and mean disability scores were stable. The mean Gd+ lesion count was 1.1 at baseline and 0.4 at week 48. An FDA decision about diroximel fumarate is expected in the fourth quarter of 2019. In the ongoing Alkermes and Biogen also are comparing the GI tolerability profile of diroximel fumarate against dimethyl fumarate, with results expected later this year. The research was sponsored by Biogen and Alkermes. Wray disclosed relevant relationships with Biogen, EMD Serono, Genentech-Roche, Sanofi-Genzyme, Alkermes, Celgene, Novartis, and TG Therapeutics.

LEMTRADA 12 mg concentrate for solution for infusion 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling 9. Date of first authorisation/renewal of the authorisation This information is intended for use by health professionals  This medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. See section 4.8 for how to report adverse reactions. LEMTRADA 12 mg concentrate for solution for infusion Each vial contains 12 mg alemtuzumab in 1.2 ml (10 mg/ml). Alemtuzumab is a monoclonal antibody produced in mammalian cell (Chinese Hamster Ovary) suspension culture in a nutrient medium by recombinant DNA technology. This medicine contains less than 1 mmol potassium (39 mg) per infusion, i.e. it is essentially 'potassium- free'. This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per infusion, i.e. it is essentially 'sodium- free'. Concentrate for solution for infusion (sterile concentrate). A clear, colourless to slightly yellow concentrate with pH 7.0 – 7.4. LEMTRADA is indicated as a single disease modifying therapy in adults with highly active relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) for the following patient groups: • Patients with highly active disease despite a full and adequate course of treatment with at least one disease modifying therapy (DMT) or • Patients with rapidly evolving severe relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis defined by 2 or more disabling relapses in one year, and with 1 or more Gadolinium enhancing lesions on brain MRI or a significant increase in T2 lesion load as compared to a previous recent MRI. LEMTRADA treatment should only be initiated and supervised by a neurologist experienced in the treatment of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) in a hospital with ready access to intensive care. Specialists and equipment required for the timely diagnosis and management of adverse reactions, especially myocardial ischaemia and myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular adverse reactions, autoimmune conditions, and infections, should be available. Resources for the management of cytokine release syndrome, hypersensitivity and/or anaphylactic reactions should be available. Patients treated with LEMTRADA must be given the Patient Alert Card and Patient Guide and be informed about the risks of LEMTRADA (see also package leaflet). The recommended dose of alemtuzumab is 12 mg/day administered by intravenous infusion for 2 initial treatment courses, with up to 2 additional treatment courses if needed. • First treatment course: 12 mg/day on 5 consecutive days (60 mg total dose) • Second treatment course: 12 mg/day on 3 consecutive days (36 mg total dose) administered 12 months after the first treatment course. Up to two additional treatment courses, as needed, may be considered (see section 5.1): • Third or fourth course: 12 mg/day on 3 consecutive days (36 mg total dose) administered at least 12 months after the prior treatment course (see section 4.1, 5.1). Missed doses should not be given on the same day as a scheduled dose. The therapy is recommended as an initial treatment of 2 courses with up to 2 additional treatment courses if needed (see posology) with safety follow-up of patients from initiation of the first treatment course and for at least 48 months after the last infusion of the second treatment course. If an additional third or fourth course is administered, continue safety follow-up for at least 48 months after the last infusion (see section 4.4). Patients should be pre-treated with corticosteroids immediately prior to LEMTRADA administration on each of the first 3 days of any treatment course. In clinical trials, patients were pre-treated with 1,000 mg methylprednisolone for the first 3 days of each LEMTRADA treatment course. Pretreatment with antihistamines and/or antipyretics prior to LEMTRADA administration may also be considered. Oral prophylaxis for herpes infection should be administered to all patients starting on the first day of each treatment course and continuing for a minimum of 1 month following treatment with LEMTRADA (see also under 'Infections' in section 4.4). In clinical trials, patients were administered aciclovir 200 mg twice a day or equivalent. Clinical studies did not include any patients aged over 61 years old. It has not been determined whether they respond differently than younger patients. LEMTRADA has not been studied in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. The safety and efficacy of LEMTRADA in children with MS aged 0 to 18 years have not yet been established. There is no relevant use of alemtuzumab in children aged from birth to less than 10 years for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. No data are available. LEMTRADA must be diluted before infusion. The diluted solution should be administered by intravenous infusion over a period of approximately 4 hours. For instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. Hypersensitivity to the active substance, or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. Patients with severe active infection until complete resolution. Patients with a history of arterial dissection of the cervicocephalic arteries. Patients with a history of angina pectoris or myocardial infarction. Patients with known coagulopathy, on anti-platelet or anti-coagulant therapy. Patients with other concomitant autoimmune diseases (besides MS). LEMTRADA is not recommended for patients with inactive disease or those stable on current therapy. Patients treated with LEMTRADA must be given the Package Leaflet, the Patient Alert Card and the Patient Guide. Before treatment, patients must be informed about the risks and benefits, and the need to commit to follow-up from treatment initiation until at least 48 months after the last infusion of the second LEMTRADA treatment course. If an additional course is administered, safety-follow up should be continued until at least 48 months after the last infusion. Treatment may result in the formation of autoantibodies and increase the risk of autoimmune mediated conditions which may be serious and life threatening. Reported autoimmune conditions, include thyroid disorders, immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), nephropathies (e.g. anti-glomerular basement membrane disease), autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), and acquired haemophilia A. In the post-marketing setting, patients developing multiple autoimmune disorders after LEMTRADA treatment have been observed. Patients who develop autoimmunity should be assessed for other autoimmune mediated conditions (see section 4.3). Patients and physicians should be made aware of the potential later onset of autoimmune disorders after the 48 months monitoring period. Cases of acquired haemophilia A (anti-factor VIII antibodies) have been reported in both clinical trial and post-marketing setting. Patients typically present with spontaneous subcutaneous haematomas and extensive bruising although haematuria, epistaxis, gastrointestinal or other types of bleeding may occur. A coagulopathy panel including aPTT must be obtained in all patients that present with such symptoms. In case of a prolonged aPTT patient should be referred to a haematologist. Educate patients on the signs and symptoms of acquired haemophilia A and to seek immediate medical attention, if any of these symptoms are observed. Serious events of ITP have been observed in 12 (1%) patients treated in controlled clinical trials in MS (corresponding to an annualised rate 4.7 events/1000 patient years). An additional 12 serious events of ITP has been observed through a median of 6.1 years (maximum 12 years) of follow-up (cumulative annualised rate of 2.8 events/1000 patient years). One patient developed ITP that went unrecognised prior to implementation of monthly blood monitoring requirements and died from intracerebral haemorrhage. In 79.5% of cases, ITP onset occurred within 4 years after first exposure. However, in some cases ITP developed years later. Symptoms of ITP could include (but are not limited to) easy bruising, petechiae, spontaneous mucocutaneous bleeding (e.g., epistaxis, haemoptysis), heavier than normal or irregular menstrual bleeding. Haemoptysis may also be indicative of anti-GBM disease (see below), and an appropriate differential diagnosis has to be undertaken. Remind the patient to remain vigilant for symptoms they may experience and to seek immediate medical help if they have any concerns. Complete blood counts with differential should be obtained prior to initiation of treatment and at monthly intervals thereafter until at least 48 months after the last infusion. After this period of time, testing should be performed based on clinical findings suggestive of ITP. If ITP is suspected a complete blood count should be obtained immediately. If ITP onset is confirmed, appropriate medical intervention should be promptly initiated, including immediate referral to a specialist. Data from clinical trials in MS has shown that adherence to the blood monitoring requirements and education relative to signs and symptoms of ITP has led to early detection and treatment of ITP with most cases responding to first-line medical therapy. Nephropathies, including anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) disease, have been observed in 6 (0.4%) patients in clinical trials in MS through a median of 6.1 years (maximum 12 years) of follow-up and generally occurred within 39 months following the last administration of LEMTRADA. In clinical trials, there were 2 cases of anti-GBM disease. Both cases were serious, were identified early through clinical and laboratory monitoring, and had a positive outcome after treatment. Clinical manifestations of nephropathy may include elevation in serum creatinine, haematuria, and/or proteinuria. While not observed in clinical trials, alveolar haemorrhage manifested as haemoptysis may occur with anti-GBM disease. Haemoptysis may also be indicative of ITP or acquired haemophilia A (see above), and an appropriate differential diagnosis has to be undertaken. The patient should be reminded to remain vigilant for symptoms they may experience and to seek immediate medical help if they have any concerns. Anti-GBM disease may lead to renal failure requiring dialysis and/or transplantation if not treated rapidly and can be life-threatening if left untreated. Serum creatinine levels should be obtained prior to initiation of treatment and at monthly intervals thereafter until at least 48 months after the last infusion. Urinalysis with microscopy should be obtained prior to initiation and at monthly intervals thereafter until at least 48 months after the last infusion. The observation of clinically significant changes from baseline in serum creatinine, unexplained haematuria, and/or proteinuria, should prompt further evaluation for nephropathies including immediate referral to a specialist. Early detection and treatment of nephropathies may decrease the risk of poor outcomes. After this period of time, testing should be performed based on clinical findings suggestive of nephropathies. Thyroid endocrine disorders including autoimmune thyroid disorders have been observed in 36.8% of patients treated with LEMTRADA 12 mg in clinical trials in MS with a median of 6.1 years (maximum 12 years) of follow- up from the first LEMTRADA exposure. The incidence of thyroid events was higher in patients with a medical history of thyroid disorders both in the LEMTRADA and interferon beta 1a (IFNB-1a) treatment groups. Observed autoimmune thyroid disorders included hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism. Most events were mild to moderate in severity. Serious endocrine events occurred in 4.4% of patients, with Basedow's disease (also known as Graves' disease), hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, autoimmune thyroiditis, and goitre occurring in more than 1 patient. Most thyroid events were managed with conventional medical therapy however some patients required surgical intervention. In the post-marketing setting several patients who developed biopsy proven AIH had previously developed autoimmune thyroid disorders. Thyroid function tests, such as thyroid stimulating hormone levels, should be obtained prior to initiation of treatment and every 3 months thereafter until 48 months following the last infusion. After this period of time testing should be performed based on clinical findings suggestive of thyroid dysfunction or in case of pregnancy. Thyroid disease poses special risks in women who are pregnant (see section 4.6). In clinical trials, 74% of patients with positive anti-thyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO) antibodies at baseline developed a thyroid event compared with 38% of patients with a baseline negative status. The vast majority (approximately 80%) of patients who presented with a thyroid event after treatment were anti-TPO antibody negative at baseline. Therefore, regardless of pretreatment anti-TPO antibody status patients may develop a thyroid adverse reaction and must have all tests periodically performed as described above. Suspected autoimmune cytopenias such as neutropenia, haemolytic anaemia and pancytopenia have been infrequently reported in clinical trials in MS. Complete blood count results (see above under ITP) should be used to monitor for cytopenias, including neutropenia. If a cytopenia is confirmed, appropriate medical intervention should be promptly initiated, including referral to a specialist. Cases of autoimmune hepatitis (including fatal cases and cases requiring liver transplantation) and hepatic injury related to infections have been reported in patients treated with LEMTRADA (see section 4.3). Liver function tests should beperformed before initial treatment and at monthly intervals until at least 48 months after the last infusion. Patients should be informed about the risk of autoimmune hepatitis, hepatic injury and related symptoms. During post-marketing use, HLH (including fatal cases) has been reported in patients treated with LEMTRADA. HLH is a life-threatening syndrome of pathologic immune activation characterized by clinical signs and symptoms of extreme systemic inflammation. HLH is characterized by fever, hepatomegaly and cytopenias. It is associated with high mortality rates if not recognized early and treated. Symptoms have been reported to occur within a few months to four years following the initiation of treatment. Patients should be informed about symptoms of HLH and time to onset. Patients who develop early manifestations of pathologic immune activation should be evaluated immediately, and a diagnosis of HLH should be considered. In clinical trials, infusion associated reactions (IARs) were defined as any adverse event occurring during or within 24 hours of LEMTRADA infusion. The majority of these may be due to cytokine release during infusion. Most patients treated with LEMTRADA in clinical trials in MS experienced mild to moderate IARs during and/or up to 24 hours after LEMTRADA 12 mg administration. The incidence of IARs was higher in course 1 than in subsequent courses. Through all available follow-up, including patients who received additional treatment courses, the most common IARs included headache, rash, pyrexia, nausea, urticaria, pruritus, insomnia, chills, flushing, fatigue, dyspnoea, dysgeusia, chest discomfort, generalised rash, tachycardia, bradycardia, dyspepsia, dizziness, and pain. Serious reactions occurred in 3% of patients and included cases of headache, pyrexia, urticaria, tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, nausea, chest discomfort, and hypotension. Clinical manifestations of anaphylaxis may appear similar to clinical manifestations of infusion associated reactions, but would tend to be more severe or potentially life-threatening. Reactions attributed to anaphylaxis have been reported rarely in contrast to infusion associated reactions. It is recommended that patients be premedicated to ameliorate the effects of infusion reactions (see section 4.2). Most patients in controlled clinical trials received antihistamines and/or antipyretics before at least one LEMTRADA infusion. IARs may occur in patients despite pretreatment. Observation for infusion reactions is recommended during and for at least 2 hours after LEMTRADA infusion. Extended observation time (hospitalization) should be considered, as appropriate. If severe infusion reactions occur, the intravenous infusion should be discontinued immediately. Resources for the management of anaphylaxis or serious reactions (see below) should be available. Other serious reactions temporally associated with LEMTRADA infusion During post-marketing use, rare, serious, sometimes fatal and unpredictable adverse events from various organ systems have been reported. In the majority of cases time to onset was within 1-3 days of the LEMTRADA infusion. Reactions have occurred following any of the doses and also after course number 2. Patients should be informed about the signs and symptoms and on the time to onset of the events. Patients should be advised to seek immediate medical attention if any of these symptoms occur and be informed on the potential for delayed onset. Several of the patient reported were below 50 years of age and had no history of hypertension, bleeding disorders or concomitant anticoagulants or platelet inhibitors. In some patients there was increased blood pressure from baseline before the haemorrhage. Several of the patients reported were below 40 years of age and had no risk factors for ischemic heart disease. It was noted that in some of the patients, blood pressure and /or heart rate was temporarily abnormal during the infusion. Cases of cervicocephalic arterial dissections, including multiple dissections, have been reported both within the first days after the LEMTRADA infusion or later on within the first month after the infusion. Reported cases of temporally associated events were not related to anti-GBM disease (Goodpasteurs syndrome). The reported thrombocytopenia occurred within the first days after the infusion (unlike ITP). It was often self-limiting and relatively mild, although severity and outcome was unknown in many cases. Rare cases of pericarditis, pericardial effusion and other pericardial events have been reported, both as part of acute infusion reaction and with later onset. Infusion instructions to reduce serious reactions temporally associated with LEMTRADA infusion o Obtain a baseline ECG and vital signs, including heart rate and blood pressure measurement. o Perform laboratory tests (complete blood count with differential, serum transaminases, serum creatinine, test of thyroid function and urinanalysis with microscopy). o Perform continuous/frequent (at least every hour) monitoring of heart rate, blood pressure and overall clinical status of the patients • If the patient shows clinical symptoms suggesting development of a serious adverse event associated with the infusion (myocardial ischemia, hemorrhagic stroke, cervico-cephalic arterial dissection or pulmonary alveolar haemorrhage o Observation for infusion reactions is recommended for a minimum of 2 hours after LEMTRADA infusion. Patients with clinical symptoms suggesting development of a serious adverse event temporarily associated with the infusion (myocardial ischemia, haemorrhagic stroke, cervico-cephalic arterial dissection or pulmonary alveolar haemorrhage) should be closely monitored until complete resolution of the symptoms. The observation time should be extended (hospitalisation) as appropriate. The patients should be educated on the potential for delayed onset of infusion associated reactions and instructed to report symptoms and seek appropriate medical care. o Platelet count should be obtained immediately after infusion on Days 3 and 5 of the first infusion course, as well as immediately after infusion on Day 3 of any subsequent course. Clinically significant thrombocytopenia needs to be followed until resolution. Referral to a haematologist for management should be considered. Infections occurred in 71% of patients treated with LEMTRADA 12 mg as compared to 53% of patients treated with subcutaneous interferon beta-1a [IFNB 1a](44mcg 3-times weekly) in controlled clinical trials in MS up to 2 years in duration and were predominantly mild to moderate in severity. Infections that occurred more often in LEMTRADA –treated patients than IFNB 1a patients included nasopharyngitis, urinary tract infection, upper respiratory tract infection, sinusitis, oral herpes, influenza, and bronchitis. Serious infections occurred in 2.7% of patients treated with LEMTRADA as compared to 1% of patients treated with IFNB-1a in controlled clinical trials in MS. Serious infections in the LEMTRADA group included: appendicitis, gastroenteritis, pneumonia, herpes zoster, and tooth infection. Infections were generally of typical duration and resolved following conventional medical treatment. The cumulative annualised rate of infections was 0.99 through a median of 6.1 years (maximum 12 years) of follow-up from the first LEMTRADA exposure, as compared to 1.27 in controlled clinical trials. Serious varicella zoster virus infections, including primary varicella and varicella zoster re-activation, have occurred more often in patients treated with LEMTRADA 12 mg (0.4%) in clinical trials as compared to IFNB-1a (0%). Cervical human papilloma virus (HPV) infection, including cervical dysplasia and anogenital warts, has also been reported in patients treated with LEMTRADA 12 mg (2%). It is recommended that HPV screening be completed annually for female patients. Cytomegalovirus infections (CMV) including cases of CMV reactivation have been reported in LEMTRADA-treated patients. Most cases occurred within 2 months of alemtuzumab dosing. Before initiation of therapy, evaluation of immune serostatus could be considered according to local guidelines. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, including reactivation and severe and sometimes fatal EBV hepatitis cases, has been reported in LEMTRADA-treated patients. Tuberculosis has been reported for patients treated with LEMTRADA and IFNB-1a in controlled clinical trials. Active and latent tuberculosis, including a few cases of disseminated tuberculosis, have been reported in 0.3% of the patients treated with LEMTRADA, most often in endemic regions. Before initiation of therapy, all patients must be evaluated for both active or inactive (“latent”) tuberculosis infection, according to local guidelines. Listeriosis/ has been reported in LEMTRADA treated patients, generally within one month of LEMTRADA infusion. To reduce the risk of infection, patients receiving LEMTRADA should avoid ingestion of uncooked or undercooked meats, soft cheeses and unpasteurized dairy products two weeks prior to, during, and for at least one month after LEMTRADA infusion. Superficial fungal infections, especially oral and vaginal candidiasis, occurred more commonly in LEMTRADA –treated patients (12%) than in patients treated with IFNB-1a (3%) in controlled clinical trials in MS. Pneumonitis has been reported in patients who received LEMTRADA infusions. Most cases occurred within the first month after treatment with LEMTRADA. Patients should be advised to report symptoms of pneumonitis, which may include shortness of breath, cough, wheezing, chest pain or tightness and hemoptysis. Initiation of treatment with LEMTRADA should be delayed in patients with severe active infection until resolution. Patients receiving LEMTRADA should be instructed to report symptoms of infections to a physician. Prophylaxis with an oral anti-herpes agent should be initiated starting on the first day of LEMTRADA treatment and continuing for a minimum of 1 month following each course of treatment. In clinical trials patients were administered cyclovir 200 mg twice a day or equivalent. LEMTRADA has not been administered for treatment of MS concomitantly with or following antineoplastic or immunosuppressive therapies. As with other immunomodulating therapies, potential combined effects on the patient's immune system should be taken into account when considering administration of LEMTRADA. Concomitant use of LEMTRADA with any of these therapies could increase the risk of immunosuppression. No data are available on the association of LEMTRADA with Hepatitis B virus (HBV) or Hepatitis C virus (HCV) reactivation as patients with evidence of active or chronic infections were excluded from clinical trials. Screening patients at high risk of HBV and/or HCV infection before initiation of LEMTRADA should be considered and caution should be exercised in prescribing LEMTRADA to patients identified as carriers of HBV and/or HCV as these patients may be at risk of irreversible liver damage relative to a potential virus reactivation as a consequence of their pre-existing status. Rare cases of PML (including fatal), have been reported in MS patients after treatment with alemtuzumab. Patients treated with alemtuzumab must be monitored for any signs that may be suggestive of PML. Risk factors of special importance include previous immunosuppressive treatment, in particular other MS treatments with known risk of causing PML. MRI findings may be apparent before clinical signs or symptoms. Prior to initiation and readministration of alemtuzumab treatment, MRI scan should be made and evaluated for signs that are consistent with PML. Further evaluation, including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing for JC Viral DNA and repeat neurological assessments should be performed as appropriate. The physician should be particularly alert to symptoms suggestive of PML that the patient may not notice (e.g. cognitive, neurological or psychiatric symptoms). Patients should also be advised to inform their relatives or caregivers about their treatment, since they may notice symptoms that the patient is not aware of. PML should be considered as a differential diagnosis in any MS patient taking alemtuzumab presenting with neurological symptoms and/or new brain lesions in MRI. If a diagnosis of PML has been made, treatment with alemtuzumab should not be started or restarted. LEMTRADA may increase the risk of acute acalculous cholecystitis. In controlled clinical studies, 0.2% of LEMTRADA-treated MS patients developed acute acalculous cholecystitis, compared to 0% of patients treated with INFB-1a. During post-marketing use, additional cases of acute acalculous cholecystitis have been reported in LEMTRADA-treated patients. Time to onset of symptoms ranged from less than 24 hours to 2 months after LEMTRADA infusion. Most patients were treated conservatively with antibiotics and recovered without surgical intervention, whereas others underwent cholecystectomy. Symptoms of acute acalculous cholecystitis include abdominal pain, abdominal tenderness, fever, nausea, and vomiting. Acute acalculous cholecystitis is a condition that may be associated with high morbidity and mortality rates if not diagnosed early and treated. If acute acalculous cholecystitis is suspected, evaluate and treat promptly. As with other immunomodulatory therapies, caution should be exercised in initiating LEMTRADA therapy in patients with pre-existing and/or an on-going malignancy. It is not currently known if LEMTRADA confers a higher risk for developing thyroid malignancies, since thyroid autoimmunity may itself be a risk factor for thyroid malignancies. Placental transfer and potential pharmacologic activity of LEMTRADA were observed in mice during gestation and following delivery. Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraceptive measures during treatment and for 4 months following a course of LEMTRADA treatment (see section 4.6). It is recommended that patients have completed local immunisation requirements at least 6 weeks prior to treatment with LEMTRADA. The ability to generate an immune response to any vaccine following LEMTRADA treatment has not been studied. The safety of immunisation with live viral vaccines following a course of LEMTRADA treatment has not been formally studied in controlled clinical trials in MS and should not be administered to MS patients who have recently received a course of LEMTRADA. Varicella zoster virus antibody testing/vaccination As for any immune modulating medicinal product, before initiating a course of LEMTRADA treatment, patients without a history of chickenpox or without vaccination against varicella zoster virus (VZV) should be tested for antibodies to VZV. VZV vaccination of antibody-negative patients should be considered prior to treatment initiation with LEMTRADA. To allow for the full effect of the VZV vaccination to occur, treatment with LEMTRADA should be postponed for 6 weeks following vaccination. Recommended laboratory tests for monitoring patients Clinical examination and laboratory tests should be conducted at periodic intervals until at least 48 months following the last treatment course of LEMTRADA in order to monitor for early signs of autoimmune diseases: • Complete blood count with differential, serum transaminases and serum creatinine levels (prior to treatment initiation and at monthly intervals thereafter). • Urinalysis with microscopy (prior to treatment initiation and at monthly intervals thereafter) • A test of thyroid function, such as thyroid stimulating hormone level (prior to treatment initiation and every 3 months thereafter). Information from use of alemtuzumab prior to the marketing authorisation of LEMTRADA outside of company-sponsored studies The following adverse reactions were identified prior to registration of LEMTRADA during use of alemtuzumab for the treatment of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (B-CLL), as well as for the treatment of other disorders, generally at higher and more frequent doses (e.g. 30 mg) than that recommended in the treatment of MS. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to alemtuzumab exposure. Autoimmune events reported in alemtuzumab-treated patients include neutropenia, haemolytic anaemia (including a fatal case), acquired haemophilia, anti-GBM disease, and thyroid disease. Serious and sometimes fatal autoimmune phenomena including autoimmune haemolytic anaemia, autoimmune thrombocytopenia, aplastic anaemia, Guillain-Barré syndrome, and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy have been reported in alemtuzumab-treated non-MS patients. A positive Coombs test has been reported in an alemtuzumab-treated oncology patient. A fatal event of transfusion associated graft versus host disease has been reported in an alemtuzumab-treated oncology patient. Serious and sometimes fatal IARs including bronchospasm, hypoxia, syncope, pulmonary infiltrates, acute respiratory distress syndrome , respiratory arrest, myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, acute cardiac insufficiency, and cardiac arrest have been observed in non-MS patients treated with alemtuzumab at higher and more frequent doses than used in MS. Severe anaphylaxis and other hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic shock and angioedema have also been reported. Serious and sometimes fatal viral, bacterial, protozoan, and fungal infections, including those due to reactivation of latent infections, have been reported in non-MS patients treated with alemtuzumab at higher and more frequent doses than used in MS. Severe bleeding reactions have been reported in non-MS patients. Congestive heart failure, cardiomyopathy, and decreased ejection fraction have been reported in alemtuzumab-treated non-MS patients previously treated with potentially cardiotoxic agents. Epstein-Barr Virus-associated lymphoproliferative disorders Epstein-Barr Virus-associated lymphoproliferative disorders have been observed outside company-sponsored studies. This medicine contains less than 1 mmol potassium (39 mg) per infusion, i.e. it is essentially 'potassium- free'. This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per infusion, i.e. it is essentially 'sodium- free'. 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction No formal drug interaction studies have been conducted with LEMTRADA using the recommended dose in patients with MS. In a controlled clinical trial in MS patients recently treated with beta interferon and glatiramer acetate were required to discontinue treatment 28 days before initiating treatment with LEMTRADA. Serum concentrations were low or undetectable within approximately 30 days following each treatment course. Therefore, women of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception when receiving a course of treatment with LEMTRADA and up to 4 months after each course of treatment. There is a limited amount of data from the use of alemtuzumab in pregnant women. LEMTRADA should be administered during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus. Human IgG is known to cross the placental barrier; alemtuzumab may cross the placental barrier as well and thus potentially pose a risk to the foetus. Animal studies have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). It is not known whether alemtuzumab can cause foetal harm when administered to pregnant women or whether it can affect reproductive capacity. Thyroid disease (see section 4.4 ) poses special risks in women who are pregnant. Without treatment of hypothyroidism during pregnancy, there is an increased risk for miscarriage and foetal effects such as mental retardation and dwarfism. In mothers with Graves' disease, maternal thyroid stimulating hormone receptor antibodies can be transferred to a developing foetus and can cause transient neonatal Graves' disease. Alemtuzumab was detected in the milk and offspring of lactating female mice. It is unknown whether alemtuzumab is excreted in human milk. A risk to the suckling newborn/infant cannot be excluded. Therefore, breast-feeding should be discontinued during each course of treatment with LEMTRADA and for 4 months following the last infusion of each treatment course. However, benefits of conferred immunity through breast-milk may outweigh the risks of potential exposure to alemtuzumab for the suckling newborn/infant. There are no adequate clinical safety data on the effect of LEMTRADA on fertility. In a sub-study in 13 male LEMTRADA-treated patients (treated with either 12 mg or 24 mg), there was no evidence of aspermia, azoospermia, consistently depressed sperm count, motility disorders or an increase in sperm morphological abnormalities. CD52 is known to be present in human and rodent reproductive tissues. Animal data have shown effects on fertility in humanised mice (see section 5.3), however a potential impact on human fertility during the period of exposure is unknown based on the available data. LEMTRADA has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Most patients experience IARs which occur during or within 24 hours after treatment with LEMTRADA. Some of the IARs (e.g. dizziness) could temporarily impact the patient's ability to drive or use machines and caution should be exercised until these are resolved. A total of 1,486 patients treated with LEMTRADA (12 mg or 24 mg) constituted the safety population in a pooled analysis of MS clinical studies with a median follow-up of 6.1 years (maximum 12 years), resulting in 8,635 patient-years of safety follow-up. The most important adverse reactions are autoimmunity (ITP, thyroid disorders, nephropathies, cytopenias), IARs, and infections. These are described in section 4.4 The most common adverse reactions with LEMTRADA (in ≥20% of patients) were rash, headache, pyrexia, and respiratory tract infections. The table below is based on the pooled safety data on all LEMTRADA 12 mg-treated patients during all available follow up in clinical trials. Adverse reactions are listed by Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) System Organ Class (SOC) and Preferred Term (PT). Frequencies are defined according to the following convention: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions have been presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

Herpes zoster infections include PTs: Herpes zoster, Herpes zoster cutaneous disseminated, Ophthalmic herpes zoster, Herpes ophthalmic, Herpes zoster infection neurological, Herpes zoster meningitis. Terms marked with asterisk (*) in Table 1 include adverse reactions reported as Infusion Associated Reactions. Terms marked with two asterisks (**) in Table 1 include adverse reactions observed in the post marketing setting which have occurred in the majority of cases with time to onset within 1-3 days of LEMTRADA infusion, following any of the doses during the treatment course. Cases of severe (including fatal) neutropenia have been reported within 2 months of LEMTRADA infusion. The type of adverse reactions including seriousness and severity observed in LEMTRADA treatment groups through all available follow-up including patients who received additional treatment courses were similar to those in the active-controlled studies. The incidence of IARs was higher in course 1 than in subsequent courses. In patients continuing from controlled clinical studies and who did not receive any additional LEMTRADA after the initial 2 treatment courses, the rate (events per person-year) of most adverse reactions was comparable to or reduced in years 3-6 as compared to years 1 and 2. The rate of thyroid adverse reactions was highest in year three and declined thereafter. Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed below: or search for MHRA Yellow Card in the Google Play or Apple App Store In controlled clinical trials two MS patients accidentally received up to 60 mg LEMTRADA (i.e. total dose for initial treatment course) in a single infusion and experienced serious reactions (headache, rash, and either hypotension or sinus tachycardia). Doses of LEMTRADA greater than those tested in clinical studies may increase the intensity and/or duration of infusion-associated adverse reactions or its immune effects. There is no known antidote for alemtuzumab over dosage. Treatment consists of discontinuation of the medicinal product and supportive therapy. Pharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, Selective immunosuppressants, ATC code: L04AA34 Alemtuzumab, is a recombinant DNA-derived humanised monoclonal antibody directed against the 21-28 kD cell surface glycoprotein CD52. Alemtuzumab is an IgG1 kappa antibody with human variable framework and constant regions, and complementary-determining regions from a murine (rat) monoclonal antibody. The antibody has an approximate molecular weight of 150 kD. Alemtuzumab binds to CD52, a cell surface antigen present at high levels on T (CD3) and B (CD19) lymphocytes, and at lower levels on natural killer cells monocytes, and macrophages. There is little or no CD52 detected on neutrophils, plasma cells, or bone marrow stem cells. Alemtuzumab acts through antibody-dependent cellular cytolysis and complement-mediated lysis following cell surface binding to T and B lymphocytes. The mechanism by which LEMTRADA exerts its therapeutic effects in MS is not fully elucidated. However, research suggests immunomodulatory effects through the depletion and repopulation of lymphocytes, including: - Alterations in the number, proportions, and properties of some lymphocyte subsets post-treatment - Increased representation of regulatory T cell subsets - Increased representation of memory T- and B-lymphocytes - Transient effects on components of innate immunity (i.e., neutrophils, macrophages, NK cells) The reduction in the level of circulating B and T cells by LEMTRADA and subsequent repopulation, may reduce the potential for relapse, which ultimately delays disease progression. LEMTRADA depletes circulating T and B lymphocytes after each treatment course with the lowest observed values occurring 1 month after a course of treatment (the earliest post-treatment time point in phase 3 studies). Lymphocytes repopulate over time with B-cell recovery usually completed within 6 months. CD3 and CD4 lymphocyte counts rise more slowly towards normal, but generally do not return to baseline by 12-months post-treatment. Approximately 40% of patients had total lymphocyte counts reaching the lower limit of normal (LLN) by 6 months after each treatment course, and approximately 80% of patients had total lymphocyte counts reaching the LLN by 12 months after each course. Neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils, and natural killer cells are only transiently affected by LEMTRADA. The safety and efficacy of alemtuzumab in MS were evaluated in 3 randomised, rater-blinded, active-comparator clinical trials and 1 uncontrolled, rater-blinded extension study in patients with RRMS. Study design/demographics for Studies 1, 2, 3 and 4 are shown in Table 2 Table 2: Study Design and Baseline Characteristics for Studies 1,, Patients with active MS, defined as at least 2 relapses within the prior 2 years. Patients with active MS, defined as at least 2 relapses within the prior 2 years and 1 or more contrast-enhancing lesions Patients with inadequate response to prior therapy* Patients who participated in CAMMS223, CAMMS323, or CAMMS32400507 * Defined as patients having experienced at least 1 relapse during treatment with beta interferon or glatiramer acetate after having been on therapy with medicinal product for at least 6 months. Study primary endpoint was scored at 3 years. Additional follow-up provided data through a median of 4.8 years (maximum 6.7). Table 3: Key Clinical and MRI Endpoints from Studies 1 and 2 Relapse Rate Annualised Relapse rate (ARR) (95% CI) (Confirmed Disability Worsening [CDW] Patients with 6-month CDW (95% CI) Patients with new or enlarging T2 lesions through Year 2 Patients with Gadolinium enhancing lesions through Year 2 Patients with new T1 hypointense lesions through Year 2 1 Co-primary endpoints: ARR & CDW. The study was declared successful if at least one of the two co-primary endpoint was met. 2 CDW was defined as an increase of at least 1 point on the expanded disability status scale (EDSS) from a baseline EDSS score ≥1.0 (1.5 point increase for patients with baseline EDSS of 0) that was sustained for 6 months. 3 Estimated using a mixed model for repeated measures. In alignment with the effect on relapse rate, supportive analyses from Study 1 (CAMMS323) showed that LEMTRADA 12 mg/day led to significantly fewer LEMTRADA -treated patients experiencing severe relapses (61% reduction, p=0.0056) and signficantly fewer relapses that led to steroid treatment (58% reduction, p<0.0001) compared to IFNB-1a. Supportive analyses from Study 2 (CAMMS32400507) showed that LEMTRADA 12 mg/day led to significantly fewer LEMTRADA -treated patients experiencing severe relapses (48% reduction, p=0.0121), and significantly fewer relapses that led to steroid treatment (56% reduction, p<0.0001) or to hospitalization (55% reduction, p=0.0045) compared to IFNB-1a. Time to onset of CDI was defined as a decrease of at least one point on the EDSS from a baseline EDSS score ≥ 2 that was sustained for at least 6 months. CDI is a measure for sustained disability improvement. 29% of patients treated with LEMTRADA reached CDI in Study 2, while only 13% of subcutaneous IFNB-1a treated patiets reached this endpoint. The difference was statistically significant (p=0.0002). Study 3 (phase 2 study CAMMS223) evaluated the safety and efficacy of LEMTRADA in patients with RRMS over the course of 3 years. Patients had an EDSS from 0-3.0, at least 2 clinical episodes of MS in the prior 2 years, and ≥1 gadolinium-enhancing lesion at study entry. Patients had not received prior therapy for MS. Patients were treated with LEMTRADA 12 mg/day (N=108) or 24 mg/day (N=108) administered once per day for 5 days at month 0 and for 3 days at month 12 or subcutaneous IFNB-1a 44 µg (N=107) administered 3 times per week for 3 years. Forty-six patients received a third course of LEMTRADA treatment at 12 mg/day or 24 mg/day for 3 days at month 24. At 3 years, LEMTRADA reduced the risk of 6-month CDW by 76% (hazard ratio 0.24 [95% CI: 0.110, 0.545], p<0.0006) and reduced the ARR by 67% (rate ratio 0.33 [95% CI: 0.196, 0.552], p<0.0001) as compared to subcutaneous IFNB-1a. LEMTRADA 12 mg/day led to significantly lower EDSS scores (improved compared to baseline) through 2 years of follow up, compared with IFNB-1a (p<0.0001). In the subgroup of RRMS patients with 2 or more relapses in the prior year and at least 1 Gd-enhanced T1 lesion at baseline, the annualised relapse rate was 0.26 (95% CI: 0.20, 0.34) in the Lemtrada treated group (n = 205) and 0.51 (95% CI: 0.40, 0.64) in the IFNB-1a group (n = 102) (p<0.0001). This analysis includes data from Phase 3 studies only (CAMMS324 and CAMMS323) due to differences in the MRI acquisition algorithms between the Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies. These results were obtained from a post hoc analysis and should be interpreted cautiously. Study 4, was a Phase 3, multicenter, open-label, rater-blinded, efficacy and safety extension study for patients with RRMS who participated in Study 1, 2, or 3 (prior phase 3 and 2 studies) to assess long-term efficacy and safety of LEMTRADA. The study provides efficacy and safety through a median of 6 years from entry into Studies 1 and 2. Patients in the extension study (Study 4) were eligible to receive additional as-needed LEMTRADA treatment course(s) upon documentation of resumed disease activity, defined as the occurrence of ≥1 MS relapse and/or ≥2 new or enlarging brain or spinal lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Additional course(s) of LEMTRADA were administered at 12 mg/day for 3 consecutive days (36 mg total dose) at least 12 months after the prior treatment course. 91.8% of the patients treated with LEMTRADA 12 mg in Studies 1 and 2 entered Study 4. 82.7% of these patients completed the study. Approximately half (51.2%) of patients initially treated with LEMTRADA 12 mg/day in Study 1 or 2 who enrolled in Study 4, received only the initial 2 courses of LEMTRADA and no other disease modifying treatment throughout 6 years of follow-up. 46.6% of the patients initially treated with LEMTRADA 12 mg/day in Study 1 or 2 received additional courses upon documented evidence of MS disease activity (relapse and/or MRI) and the treating physician's decision to retreat. No characteristics at study entry identified patients who would later receive one or more additional courses. Through 6 years from initial LEMTRADA treatment, patients continuing in follow-up showed rates of MS relapse, brain lesion formation on MRI, and brain volume loss consistent with LEMTRADA's treatment effects during Studies 1 and 2 as well as predominantly stable or improved disability scores. Including follow-up in Study 4, patients originally treated with LEMTRADA in Studies 1 and 2, respectively, had ARRs 0.17 and 0.23, CDW was seen in 22.3% and 29.7%, while 32.7% and 42.5% achieved CDI. In each year of Study 4, patients from both studies continued to show a low risk of forming new T2 (27.4% to 33.2%) or gadolinium-enhancing lesions (9.4% to 13.5%), and the median annual percent change in brain parenchymal fraction ranged from 0.19% to -0.09%. Among patients who received one or two additional LEMTRADA treatment courses, improvements were seen in relapse rate, MRI activity and mean disability scores following a first or second LEMTRADA retreatment (Courses 3 and 4) when compared with outcomes in the preceding year. For these patients, the ARR declined from 0.79 in the year prior to Course 3 to 0.18 one year after, and the mean EDSS score from 2.89 to 2.69. The percentage of patients with new or enlarging T2 lesions declined from 50.8% the year prior to Course 3 to 35.9% one year after, and new gadolinium-enhancing lesions from 32.2% to 11.9%. Similar improvements in ARR, mean EDSS score, and T2 and gadolinium-enhancing lesions were seen after Course 4 when compared with the prior year. These improvements were subsequently maintained, but no firm conclusions can be made with regards to the longer-term efficacy (e.g. 3 and 4 years after additional treatment courses) because many patients completed the study before reaching these time points. The benefits and risks of 5 or more treatment courses have not been established. As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. Data reflect the percentage of patients whose test results were considered positive for antibodies to alemtuzumab using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and confirmed by a competitive binding assay. Positive samples were further evaluated for evidence of inhibition using a flow cytometry assay. Patients in clinical trials in MS had serum samples collected 1, 3, and 12 months after each treatment course for determination of anti-alemtuzumab antibodies.Approximately 85% of patients receiving LEMTRADA tested positive for anti-alemtuzumab antibodies during the study, with ≥90% of these patients testing positive also for antibodies that inhibited alemtuzumab binding . Patients who developed anti-alemtuzumab antibodies did so by 15 months from initial exposure. Through 2 treatment courses, there was no association of the presence of anti-alemtuzumab or inhibitory anti-alemtuzumab antibodies with a reduction in efficacy, change in pharmacodynamics, or the occurrence of adverse reactions, including infusion associated reactions. High titer anti-alemtuzumab antibodies observed in some patients were associated with incomplete lymphocyte depletion following a third or fourth treatment course, but there was no clear impact of anti-alemtuzumab antibodies on the clinical efficacy or safety profile of LEMTRADA. The incidence of antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including inhibitory antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medicines, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to LEMTRADA with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading. The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with alemtuzumab in children from birth to less than 10 years in treatment of multiple sclerosis (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with LEMTRADA in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in RRMS (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use) The pharmacokinetics of alemtuzumab were evaluated in a total of 216 patients with RRMS who received intravenous infusions of either 12 mg/day or 24 mg/day on 5 consecutive days, followed by 3 consecutive days 12 months following the initial treatment course. Serum concentrations increased with each consecutive dose within a treatment course, with the highest observed concentrations occurring following the last infusion of a treatment course. Administration of 12 mg/day resulted in a mean C of 3014 ng/ml on day 5 of the initial treatment course, and 2276 ng/ml on day 3 of the second treatment course. The alpha half-life approximated 4-5 days and was comparable between courses leading to low or undetectable serum concentrations within approximately 30 days following each treatment course. Alemtuzumab is a protein for which the expected metabolic pathway is degradation to small peptides and individual amino acids by widely distributed proteolytic enzymes. Classical biotransformation studies have not been conducted. Conclusions cannot be made with available data on the effect of race and gender on the pharmacokinetics of alemtuzumab. The pharmacokinetics of alemtuzumab in RRMS has not been studied in patients aged 55 years and older. There have been no studies to assess the carcinogenic or mutagenic potential of alemtuzumab. Treatment with intravenous alemtuzumab at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day, administered for 5 consecutive days (AUC of 7.1 times the human exposure at the recommended daily dose) had no effect on fertility and reproductive performance in male huCD52 transgenic mice. The number of normal sperm was significantly reduced (<10%) relative to controls and the percent abnormal sperm (detached heads or no heads) were significantly increased (up to 3%). However, these changes did not affect fertility and were therefore considered to be non-adverse. In female mice dosed with intravenous alemtuzumab up to 10 mg/kg/day (AUC of 4.7 times the human exposure at the recommended daily dose) for 5 consecutive days prior to cohabitation with wild-type male mice, the average number of corpora lutea and implantation sites per mouse were significantly reduced as compared to vehicle treated animals. Reduced gestational weight gain relative to the vehicle controls was observed in pregnant mice dosed with 10 mg/kg/day. A reproductive toxicity study in pregnant mice exposed to intravenous doses of alemtuzumab up to 10 mg/kg/day (AUC 2.4 times the human exposure at the recommended dose of 12 mg/day) for 5 consecutive days during gestation resulted in significant increases in the number of dams with all conceptuses dead or resorbed, along with a concomitant reduction in the number of dams with viable foetuses. There were no external, soft tissue, or skeletal malformations or variations observed at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day. Placental transfer and potential pharmacologic activity of alemtuzumab were observed during gestation and following delivery in mice. In studies in mice, alterations in lymphocyte counts were observed in pups exposed to alemtuzumab during gestation at doses of 3 mg/kg/day for 5 consecutive days (AUC 0.6 times the human exposure at the recommended dose of 12 mg/day).

604e8e00-9f74-4b51-9ecb-3c342510f9ca,"Primary-Progressive MS (PPMS): Symptoms and Diagnosis Medically reviewed by — — (MS) is the most common disease of the . It’s caused by an immune response that destroys the myelin sheath, or coating on nerves. Primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) is one of the four types of MS. The three other types of MS are: PPMS is one of the least common types, affecting about of all people diagnosed with MS. Most people affected by MS have acute attacks with symptoms, called relapses, and periods of months or years with little to no symptoms, called remissions. PPMS is different. The disease progresses once symptoms start to appear, hence the name primary progressive. There may be periods of active progression and then periods of inactive progression of symptoms and disability. One difference between PPMS and the relapsing forms is that while active progression may stop temporarily, the symptoms don’t resolve. In relapsing forms, the symptoms may actually improve or return near where they were before the most recent relapse. Another difference is that there isn’t as much inflammation in PPMS compared to relapsing forms. Because of this, many of the drugs that work for relapsing forms don’t work for PPMS or SPMS. The progression of symptoms can worsen over a few months or several years. PPMS is often diagnosed in people in their . RRMS, on the other hand, usually presents in people in their 20s and 30s. PPMS also affects both sexes equally, while RRMS affects two to three times as many women as men. PPMS is caused by slow nerve damage that stops nerves from sending signals to each other. All four types of MS involve damage to the protective coating (myelin) of the central nervous system, called demyelination, as well as damage to the nerve. PPMS symptoms are similar to SPMS symptoms. Of course, what one person experiences will be different from another. A continuous contraction of certain muscles may cause stiffness and tightness, which may affect movement. This can make it more difficult to walk, use the stairs, and influence your overall activity level. About of those with PPMS experience . This can significantly affect daily life and make it difficult to work and complete regular activities. Those diagnosed with PPMS may find themselves very tired from simple activities. For example, the task of cooking dinner could wear them out and require them to take a nap. Another early symptom of PPMS is or tingling in various body parts, such as your face, hands, and feet. This can be confined to one area of your body, or travel to other parts. This can include , , inability to identify colors and contrasts, and pain when moving your eyes. While PPMS typically affects mobility, some individuals may experience a cognitive decline. This can significantly impair remembering and processing information, solving problems, focusing, and learning anything new. Those with PPMS may have episodes of and lightheadedness. Others may experience vertigo, a sensation that they’re spinning and losing their balance. Bladder and bowel problems can range from , to the constant need to go, to . This can lead to sexual problems, such as , , and less sensation in the genitals. About will face at least one depressive episode. Although it’s common to be upset or angry about the increasing disability, these mood changes typically go away with time. , on the other hand, doesn’t subside and requires treatment. PPMS has similar symptoms to other types of MS, as well as other nervous system disorders. As a result, it may take up to longer to get a confirmed PPMS diagnosis than a RRMS diagnosis. have a year of progressively worsening neurologic function meet two of the following criteria: Your doctor will likely conduct a medical history exam and ask you about any previous neurologic events. They may ask for family members to be present, as they can contribute their experiences with past symptoms. Your doctor will then likely do a thorough physical exam, specifically checking your nerves and muscles. Your doctor will order an MRI scan to check for lesions in the brain and spinal cord. They may also order an to check for electrical activity in the brain. Finally, your doctor will perform a to look for signs of MS in the spinal fluid. There’s no cure for PPMS. One medication, ocrelizumab (Ocrevus), is approved for PPMS as well as relapsing forms of MS. are commonly used in relapsing forms, however, because they decrease inflammation. PPMS doesn’t have a lot of inflammation, so immunosuppressants may not be recommended as useful. Research on effective treatments is ongoing. While there’s no cure for PPMS, those diagnosed with PPMS shouldn’t give up hope. With the help of doctors, physical therapy professionals, speech pathologists, and specialists in mental health, there are ways to manage the disease. These can include medications that help relieve symptoms, such as for muscle spasms, as well as a healthy diet, exercise, and a proper sleep routine.

efb2c42e-32ed-474e-bfa5-390f8a646b95,"Disease-Modifying Treatment Approaches Targeting Inflammation The greatest success in MS has been in treating relapsing forms of MS. Relapsing forms of MS largely involve inflammation and nearly all of the approved disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) are approved to treat these types of MS. These DMTs have been shown to: Reduce the development of new areas of inflammation as seen on MRI Show some evidence of delaying disease progression and/or disability Some may prevent or delay a second clinical attack (relapse) for individuals with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS); CIS refers to individuals who do not meet the criteria to be diagnosed with MS, but have experienced symptoms The largest unmet need in MS is treatment of the progressive course of the disease. Developing new therapies for progressive MS has been difficult, as the underlying driver in this form of MS remains unclear. Researchers know that inflammation is a part of the disease, but progressive MS is believed to be largely driven by the degeneration of neurons in the brain and spinal cord, which is a complex process. Long-term goals in the development of treatments include turning off the inflammation; however, the major target for preventing progression is to slow or halt neurodegeneration. Traditional MS clinical trials have been performed for decades with various therapies to treat relapsing forms of MS, and these are typically conducted over a two-year period. The disease process in progressive forms of MS occurs more slowly, over the course of several years, so two-year studies often have trouble adequately measuring progression or determining the effectiveness of a potential treatment. MS researchers are currently looking at measures of brain volume on MRI and ocular coherence tomography (an imaging technique that provides three-dimensional pictures of the nerves around the eye) as quantifiable measures of progression in MS. These are separate from the changes in symptoms reported by people with MS or neurologic exam findings and disability scores according to EDSS. Currently, the focus of research has switched to early-phase studies using neuroprotective agents to determine if these may alter the course of progression in MS. Disease-Modifying Therapy to Delay Progression in MS Disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) that target the progressive course of the disease are desperately needed. In recent years, with the success and inception of multiple new therapies for relapsing MS, the focus is finally shifting to progressive MS. Fortunately, in 2016, successful results of the ORATORIO phase III clinical trial in PPMS studying ocrelizumab, a monoclonal antibody that depletes mature B cells, showed positive results in delaying progression in PPMS, while demonstrating superiority to Rebif® (interferon beta-1a). Ocrelizumab is infused once on day one, a second time on day 14, and then one infusion every six months. In people with PPMS, ocrelizumab was shown to delay progression of clinical disability (worsening function) at 12 weeks in 24 percent of patients. Given the brand name Ocrevus®, this therapy was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in March 2017. This therapy also demonstrated significant benefit in two phase III clinical trials in RRMS, OPERA I and II. A prior study, the OLYMPUS trial in PPMS, using a similar agent, Rituxan® (rituximab), did not show benefit in overall prevention of disease progression, but did show benefit in a subset of individuals who were younger than 50 and with active gadolinium-enhancing lesions on MRI (these are lesions with active inflammation). Rituxan has been used off-label in both progressive and relapsing forms of MS, which is a challenge to obtain for many people with MS due to insurance denials. This is related to the lack of an FDA-approved indication for MS at this time. Prior to the Ocrevus studies, clinical trials in progressive MS with other experimental treatments have been disappointing. Among others, the following agents have been tested in PPMS in phase III clinical trials without benefit in the overall study population: Copaxone® (glatiramer acetate), Rituxan, IV immunoglobulin, Marinol® (dronabinol), and Gilenya® (fingolimod). Additional studies evaluating pulse methylprednisolone IV and other immunosuppressants, including methotrexate, did not delay progression of the disease. In SPMS, a recent study using an oral therapy that is similar to Gilenya, called siponimod, was shown to have beneficial effects in a phase II clinical trial. As of the time of this publication, siponimod is not FDA-approved for MS. Previously, Novantrone® (mitoxantrone), originally approved in 2000, was FDA-approved in SPMS; however, it has largely fallen out of use due to serious risks of secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and cardiotoxicity (congestive heart failure). Some of the additional agents that have been evaluated in clinical trials and failed to show any benefit in SPMS include: Avonex® (interferon beta-1a), Rebif® (interferon beta-1a), Betaseron® (interferon beta-1b), IV immunoglobulin, cyclophosphamide, myelin basic protein 8298, and linomide Currently, many individuals with progressive MS continue on DMTs used to treat relapsing forms of MS. Although not approved by the FDA for this type of MS, these individuals have a perceived benefit from a DMT for MS – even in the secondary-progressive phase of the disease. Their treating neurologists believe that the DMTs approved for RRMS reduce inflammation in all MS, including progressive MS. As always, people with progressive MS are encouraged to discuss treatment options with their neurologist. Individuals with MS and their families need to understand that current disease-modifying therapies for MS do not restore function, but are used in an effort to slow progression of the disease. Remyelinating and restorative therapies are currently being studied. Rehabilitation through Physical, Occupational, and Speech Therapy The medical community embraces the “it takes a village” comprehensive approach to MS care. As such, people with MS can often greatly benefit from working closely with neuro-physical therapists (neuro-PTs), occupational therapists (OTs), and speech pathologists. Generally speaking, neuro-PTs can help improve one’s ability to walk and remain mobile. PTs often help people with gait, transfers, balance, and coordination, along with stretching and strengthening the muscles of ambulation. Specialized PTs can also assist with more specialized issues, such as those related to the pelvic floor, fitting individuals for custom wheelchairs, and addressing other specific needs requiring individualized attention. OTs are experts at improving independence with activities of daily living, such as brushing teeth, using the bathroom, and putting on socks. They are experienced in optimizing hand dexterity and function. OTs can also assist with retraining people with MS to drive cars safely with adaptive equipment. In addition to helping with any speech and communication difficulties one may be experiencing, speech pathologists provide expert assistance to optimize safe swallowing. Speech pathologists also help with improving/maintaining aspects of cognition and memory via “cognitive rehabilitation” training. A wide variety of symptoms can occur with progressive forms of MS. A great deal of information on these symptoms and their treatments may be found on MSAA’s website at . To help categorize the effects of MS, MSAA has grouped the commonly experienced symptoms as follows: Common Emotional, Mental, and Psychological Symptoms of MS Uhthoff’s syndrome (the temporary appearance of symptoms resulting from heat stress) A few of the more impactful symptoms in progressive MS have been highlighted in the sections to follow. However, as noted earlier, details on all of the common MS symptoms, along with treatment options, are available on MSAA’s website at . Bladder dysfunction in MS happens when nerve signals to the bladder and urinary sphincter (the muscles surrounding the opening to the bladder) are blocked or delayed because of MS lesions in the brain and/or spinal cord. There are basically two major muscles involved in emptying the bladder: the detrusor muscle and the sphincter muscle. As a result of MS, the detrusor muscle in the wall of the bladder involuntarily contracts, increasing the pressure in the bladder and decreasing the volume of urine the bladder can hold. This causes symptoms of going frequently, leaking urine, urgency, or interfering with a good night’s sleep. In other words, the inability to store or hold urine in the bladder occurs when the bladder is unable to retain urine when it accumulates. Instead of expanding when urine collects, the bladder involuntarily contracts, which can make people feel as if they have an urgent need to go to the bathroom much of the time – even when there isn’t much urine in the bladder. The flow of urine is controlled by the sphincter in the bladder, the muscle which relaxes to open and contracts to close. An “inability to empty” means that even though a person senses that his or her bladder is full, the nerve impulse telling the muscle to open is interrupted and never reaches the urinary sphincter, and the sphincter muscle closes before all the urine is emptied from the bladder. When emptying the bladder completely, one might feel the urge to void often but have hesitancy when trying to void. People may also wake up at night often to void since the bladder is not completely empty during the day. Bladder infections or urinary tract infections (UTIs) can occur if urine, which is a waste product, sits in the bladder too long. Leakage of urine can occur in some cases when the sphincter remains at least partially open, resulting in involuntary leaks. Sometimes the detrusor muscle and the sphincter muscle do not work in coordination and a person with MS can experience many bladder symptoms. Individuals with MS can experience a variety of bladder issues: urinary frequency, which is the need to urinate often; urgency, referring to the sudden urge to urinate; or hesitancy, where an individual has trouble initiating urination urinary retention, referring to difficulty emptying the bladder urinary incontinence, which is the inability to or difficulty with holding urine pelvic floor therapy, using exercises to strengthen pelvic muscles staying well-hydrated until a few hours prior to bedtime percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (PTMS) for overactive bladder, giving electrical stimulation to the ankle, which stimulates sacral nerves that control bladder function using medications to treat bladder problems; these include: intermittent catheterization, where a tube is inserted into the urethra to manually empty the bladder InterStim, which is a surgically placed device to help treat overactive bladder, urinary retention, and some forms of bowel dysfunction surgical interventions, such as a suprapubic, indwelling catheter Bladder symptoms can be treated once symptoms are discussed openly with a medical professional and proper assessment is completed. Sharing concerns with a healthcare provider is important. Individuals may need a referral to a urologist to treat bladder symptoms. Spasticity is a term used to describe muscle stiffness and muscle spasms that are common in MS and other diseases affecting the brain and spinal cord. Stretching one’s limbs, walking, or even bathing can all become difficult. Spasticity can also be incredibly painful. Spasticity can occur in any limb, but it is the most common in the legs. It can be exaggerated by cold temperatures, infection, fever, recent surgery, or any other harmful stimuli to the body. It may increase with movement or a change in position. If spasticity is untreated, serious medical problems can occur. These can include pressure sores (ulcers) on the body where pressure occurs. The most common locations for pressure sores are the buttock area, sacral area (at the tip of the spine), on the heels, and other areas that may experience pressure for an extended period of time when sitting or lying still. Untreated spasticity can also lead to contracture, known as frozen joints. Some degree of spasticity is beneficial, as it can stiffen weak muscles and enable one to stand, walk, or transfer better. Treatment of spasticity focuses on a balance between loosening muscles for comfort, and preventing complications by avoiding complete resolution of spasticity. This balance is needed in order to allow an individual to continue to engage in activities of daily living (ADLs). Treatments for spasticity are individualized, and may be grouped according to the severity of the symptoms. medications used include: Zanaflex® tablets and Zanaflex Capsules® (tizanidine hydrochloride) botulinum toxin injections for focal (localized) areas of spasticity; these are best for isolated muscles that are stiff; not for widespread spasticity Medical marijuana (cannabis) has been used experimentally in treating spasticity and is available by prescription in some states Therapies for moderate to severe spasticity (the first four listed are also used for mild to moderate spasticity, noted above) intrathecal baclofen; this medication works to relax muscles, and when infused directly into the spinal fluid via an intrathecal pump, it relaxes muscles more effectively and at significantly lower doses, versus the oral form of baclofen (these small doses also avoid the generalized side effects of drowsiness and memory difficulties, which can occur with higher doses of the medication) phenol injection; although rarely prescribed, this nerve-blocking agent is sometimes used for severe cases of spasticity surgical tendon release; although rarely prescribed, this surgical procedure cuts a tight tendon to relieve pressure Everyone should have the goal of achieving, and then maintaining, the highest possible level of independent function. This includes safe mobility – both at home and in the community. Ideally, anyone with MS should receive a baseline evaluation from a physical therapist (PT) experienced in MS care. An evaluation can spotlight many subtle symptoms that can be addressed before they worsen into significant issues. These symptoms might include: Mild spasticity (increased tone, which gets worse with fatigue) Compensatory movement patterns (such as “hiking” or lifting of the hip; leaning to clear the weak leg when walking; or using arms to help stand up) Problems with balance (which may include falls, near-falls, and/or difficulty on stairs) All of these problems will affect independent walking and can be targeted in a corrective program. If an individual may benefit from some type of an aid, a physical therapist may have a variety of ambulation aids available to try to see which items work the best. Understandably, many individuals with MS are initially quite reluctant to accept a walking aid and often delay going to therapy. Individuals with MS should try to view ambulation aids as tools that have the potential to normalize their walking pattern. By doing so, this can result in less fatigue, improved posture and balance, less pain, more endurance, less risk of falling and the correct training of the walking muscles. Dramatic improvement may be seen in an individual’s gait and endurance by initially using these aids for training, and later, just as needed for issues such as distance, energy conservation, and worsening symptoms during MS flare-ups. Many different ambulation tools are on the market, so a professional should be involved in assessing and prescribing those best suited to each person’s needs. These include items such as a foot-drop brace, folding cane, lightweight forearm crutches, rolling walkers, and Functional Electrical Stimulation (a wireless technology only appropriate for some). Many wheeled-mobility options are also available for those with limited or no ambulation abilities. Currently, Ampyra® (dalfampridine) is the only medication approved by the FDA specifically to improve walking speed in individuals with MS. It is an oral, timed-release medication developed to improve the conduction of impulses between damaged nerves of the central nervous system (CNS). Anxiety and depression are more common in MS than in the general population. In fact, more than half of all people with MS will experience these symptoms at some point during their lives. Emotional health is a critical component to successfully managing progressive MS. This includes, when appropriate, the judicious use of antidepressant medications, referrals to trained counselors, and participation in support groups. Additionally, staying physically, intellectually, and socially active all help to promote good emotional health. Anxiety is perhaps the most taxing and under-treated psychological effect of living with MS. It does not appear to result from the physical disease process of MS, but rather stems from the realities of living with MS. Individuals living with MS know that it’s the unpredictability, and therefore the difficulty, in planning and preparing for the effects of MS on life, that drives one’s anxiety. Anxiety disorders are estimated to affect 43 percent of those with MS, and are also more common among women. Anxiety represents a symbolic, perceived threat to one’s sense of self, which may be defined as how someone sees him or herself and the unique qualities that he or she possesses. As MS progresses, different challenges and new uncertainties must be faced. This can result in more adjustments, more losses, and more anxiety. Examples of the physiological symptoms of anxiety include (among others): trembling, increased heart rate or heart palpitations, dry mouth, nausea, tingling in fingers or toes, lightheadedness, insomnia, and more. Examples of the psychological symptoms of anxiety include (among others): chronic unhappiness, frequent worry or guilt, fearfulness, indecisiveness, feelings of inadequacy, repeating certain behaviors or ruminative thoughts (pondering over something repeatedly), excessive concern with physical health, and negative thinking about the future. Lowering anxiety requires many steps that include learning stress-reduction techniques. Learning to control reactions and quiet oneself can allow someone to feel anxiety when needed to problem-solve, but not to become so overwhelmed by it. Increasing the areas of where you can have control and prioritizing activities can also help. Developing a more spiritual, entrusting attitude has also been found to be helpful to many. Psychotherapy, either psychodynamic or cognitive/behavioral, includes stress-reduction techniques such as guided imagery, biofeedback (a technique that teaches individuals how to control their body’s responses), and meditation. These can be very helpful to reduce anxiety. Medication management is also available. However, options should be discussed with one’s doctor, as some medications for depression may worsen anxiety, and some medications may also have the potential for addiction. In regard to depression, researchers believe that the high rate of major depressive disorder, dysthymia (a chronic type of depression), and bipolar disorder with MS, is a result of the disease process or the etiology of the disease itself. In other words, the damage to the nerves within certain areas of the brain is believed to increase the chance of greater depressive reactions. Depressive reactions are not to be confused with sadness or fatigue. In all types of depression, activities of daily living can feel overwhelming and people tend to believe that their feelings will never change. Several symptoms of depression are common ones of MS, such as fatigue, trouble sleeping, cognitive difficulties – especially being unable to focus and concentrate – and feeling slowed down. These similarities can, however, be distinguished by a mental-health specialist who has experience with chronic disease, such as a social worker, psychologist, or psychiatrist, who is specialized or certified in a related area. For family members, understanding the physical symptoms of MS is often easier than understanding the emotional ones. When depressed, becoming passive, exhibiting a negative mood, and experiencing low motivation are common; some may even withdraw from others. This may irritate family members, causing them to be critical or expecting the person to do one thing to snap out of his or her mood. They may feel at a loss encountering the individual’s helpless mood. If withdrawn, family members may withdraw too, as they may not fully understand what is needed. A loss of sexual interest or libido is also common and this too can have a negative impact on couples. Depression is not overcome by the power of positive thinking. Family members should avoid giving advice. Instead, a referral to a skilled mental-health professional who can work with both the individual and/or family is needed, as well as an evaluation with a psychiatrist to see if specific antidepressant medication would be helpful. Since individuals with depression experience greater fatigue, withdrawing to try to preserve energy is natural. This can result in not taking one’s medication or forgetting to do so, not having the energy to exercise, and less energy to put into relationships and work. A good plan is to focus on a few tasks to accomplish each day to conserve energy, instead of trying to cover all of them. Taking the steps needed to engage social supports and resources is far more difficult when depressed, so having these supports and resources in place beforehand is another vital strategy. Participating in psychological therapy and taking a medication for depression appear to be the most effective means of treating depression. Treating depression with a medication or a drug alone does not address the underlying causes. This is because communicating and sharing experiences with others and with a mental-health professional has been shown to improve one’s ability to cope and to continue to find meaning in one’s life. Many types of psychotherapies may be effective in treating depressive disorders. These include cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), psychotherapy, problem-focused supportive-group therapy, and telephone-administered CBT for individuals with MS who experience significant levels of depression. For treatment with medications, consulting a psychiatrist, if possible, may be of greater benefit. Many managed-care and insurance plans have psychiatrists available for medication management. A therapist can also aid in this referral process. Consulting a psychiatrist is important because general practitioners or family physicians may not be as familiar with the range of antidepressant medications available, versus someone who specializes in this field. Some of the commonly prescribed medications for depression include: Selective Serotonin and Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SRNI): Individuals should note that steroid use is known to induce depressive reactions or exacerbate bipolar reactions in individuals. Additional medications, such as those used to treat urinary incontinence or spasticity, can also affect mood. If taking one or more of these medications, individuals are advised to check with their physician to see if these in any way are lowering mood. For some, an antidepressant, such as certain SSRIs that work on depressive and anxious symptoms, is prescribed. Examples include Celexa® (citalopram) or Lexapro® (escitalopram). Additionally, Effexor® (venlafaxine) or Cymbalta® (duloxetine hydrochloride) may also be considered. Specific anti-anxiety medications like Valium® (diazepam) may work on an as-needed basis, but these tend to have short half-lives. This means that they work only for short periods of time or to aid sleep, but they are not designed for long-term use. Traditionally, cognitive issues were not believed to be a symptom of MS. In more recent years, researchers and physicians have come to find that roughly half of the MS population will experience some type of change in their cognitive abilities during the course of their disease. The most commonly affected cognitive processes in MS are speed-of-information processing, memory, and executive functions (decision making). Other domains of cognition can also be affected depending on where lesions are located. However, rarely are all domains of cognition impacted by MS. Changes in cognitive abilities typically are clinically considered mild-to-moderate in severity, although even mild changes can be annoying and irritating in day-to-day functioning. Several strategies may be used to help with cognitive problems. These range from avoiding distractions, writing reminders, and asking others to speak clearly, to participating in cognitive rehabilitation, taking medications or supplements (for memory, depression, and/or fatigue), and if appropriate, taking a disease-modifying therapy to slow disease activity. Several books and other resources are available on this topic, although anyone experiencing cognitive changes should first speak with his or her doctor to identify potential causes and appropriate treatment choices. Fatigue has been described as an “overwhelming sense of tiredness.” Up to 80 percent of people with MS experience the disabling effects of fatigue. This overwhelming tiredness could occur any time in the course of MS, and it has not been shown to be related to measures of disability like the EDSS (Extended Disability Status Scale). Many people with MS find that fatigue increases as the day goes on, and worsens with a rise in body temperature, which might be caused by hot and humid weather. Many people with MS find that fatigue limits their enjoyment and participation in many activities. Fatigue can make performing tasks on the job or at home difficult. Although researchers do not know at this time what causes fatigue in MS, a number of influences on fatigue have been identified. Fatigue is complex. Among others, some of the many types of fatigue include: motor fatigue, caused by prolonged physical activity generalized pathologic fatigue, associated with an underlying medical or psychological condition, such as MS or depression cognitive fatigue, where someone experiences reduced attention and slowed thought processing heat-induced fatigue, caused by a warm environment or fever These multifaceted origins involve both central nervous system and peripheral nervous system mechanisms. Since MS may be associated with depression, fatigue, and cognitive dysfunction, treating all of these conditions may create a synergistic effect – referring to a greater effect through the combination of treatments. Other contributing factors can include infection, poor sleep, and sedating medications. Strategies to help fight or treat fatigue include: Exercising, which has been shown to significantly reduce fatigue in MS Planning activities to avoid triggers and conserve energy; for example, individuals who are heat sensitive can plan ahead to avoid outside activities in the midday sun, as well as make efforts to reduce activity – such as by parking closer to a store entrance to avoid a long walk; a handicapped parking permit can be of help Treating depression in MS can sometimes improve aspects of fatigue, which can occur with pseudo-dementia (cognitive dysfunction as a consequence of any underlying depression; may be reversible with antidepressants) and generalized pathological fatigue (caused by the disease) The judicious use of prescription stimulant medications can help to pharmacologically combat fatigue in MS, although insurance companies may not always cover these types of medications Commonly prescribed medications include: Fatigue can be difficult for family members and friends to understand, because it is invisible to others. If fatigue is poorly understood, a person with MS who is experiencing fatigue might be characterized as “lazy.” Educating family, friends, and partners about MS fatigue is very important. More than 50 percent of individuals with MS identify pain as a significant symptom. For many years, the medical community did not support the idea that pain could be caused by the effects of MS, but physicians today recognize that pain is a common symptom. MS pain is mixed and may be divided into two different types. Pain from MS can be a direct result of damage to the nerves (referred to as “axons”) of the central nervous system (CNS), which consists of the brain and spinal cord. This first type of pain is referred to as , and is caused by a lesion in the CNS. This type of pain may be intermittent or steady; spontaneous or evoked. It is often described as numbness, pins and needles, burning, or hypersensitivity. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen usually won’t work well on this type of pain. The over-stimulated nerves need to be calmed, and this may best be accomplished with anti-epileptic drugs, tricyclic antidepressants, and antispasticity drugs, to treat painful spasticity and spasms. Topical medications such as lidocaine gel or Zostrix® (capsaicin topical analgesic) may help reduce the burning and tingling. Optic neuritis is often treated with steroids to reduce the inflammation of the optic nerve. Non-pharmaceutical strategies may help to reduce the perceived severity of the pain. Integrative medical therapies such as acupuncture, hypnosis, cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness, and meditation Some of the more common neuropathic pain medications include: Anti-Anxiety Agents (such as Cymbalta®, Valium®, and Klonopin®) Tricyclic Antidepressants (such as Elavil® and Pamelor®) Capsaicin cream or a lidocaine patch may also be used topically. Additionally, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SRNIs) may be used as well. These specific medications are listed in the section on depression. Medical marijuana (cannabis) has been used experimentally in treating pain and is available by prescription in some states. If taking long-term narcotics, a pain-management specialist may be consulted to address potential addiction, provide psychiatric care, and care for other related issues. A second type of pain is associated with living with disability and its effects. This is referred to as . Caused by any mechanism that stimulates a pain response, it can be mechanical, thermal, chemical, or electrical. Examples of this type of pain include musculoskeletal pain, lower-back pain, painful spasms, pain related to urinary-tract infection, pain of pressure sores, and even pain associated with disease-modifying drugs. Unlike neurogenic pain, neuromuscular pain may respond to NSAIDs, which includes ibuprofen (Advil® and Motrin®). Tylenol® (acetaminophen) may help with this type of discomfort too. Antidepressants are sometimes effective and their function is twofold: they may help to shift the perception of pain, while also elevating one’s mood (living with chronic pain is known to increase depression, fatigue, and anxiety). Anti-spasticity medications may be used if spasticity and/or spasms are contributing to one’s discomfort. Non-pharmaceutical approaches include acupuncture, massage, tai chi, yoga, meditation, hydrotherapy, and physical therapy, among others. A physical therapist experienced with MS can be particularly useful in returning balance and good posture back to one’s movement. Warm compresses can sometimes loosen a tight muscle or reduce lower back pain, while an ice pack is normally prescribed for a recent muscle injury or injection-site reactions. MS experts caution their patients about chiropractic care as it can potentially aggravate the nerves of the back and neck. If back pain is severe, tests should be done to see if a pinched nerve, slipped disc, or other structural problem is at fault. | | Improving Lives Today! – A Guide to MSAA’s Programs and Services How to S.E.A.R.C.H.™ for the Right MS Therapy for You!

6466eec7-eb8b-4b88-a683-124de422ed54,"Medically reviewed by — — Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most widespread disabling neurological condition of young adults around the world. You can develop MS at any age, but most people receive diagnoses between the . There are relapsing, remitting, and progressive types of MS, but the course is rarely predictable. Researchers still don’t fully understand the cause of MS or why the rate of progression is so difficult to determine. The good news is that many people living with MS don’t develop severe disabilities. Most have a normal or near-normal lifespan. There’s no national or global registry for new MS cases. Known figures are only estimates. Recent findings from a National MS Society study estimate nearly in the United States are living with MS. This is more than double the last reported number, and the first national research on MS prevalence since 1975. The society also estimates that 2.3 million people live with MS globally. About are diagnosed each week in the United States, says the MS Discovery Forum. Rates of MS are higher . It’s estimated that in (below the 37th parallel), the rate of MS is between 57 and 78 cases per 100,000 people. The rate is twice as high in northern states (above the 37th parallel), at about 110 to 140 cases per 100,000. The incidence of MS is also higher in colder climates. People of Northern European descent have the highest risk of developing MS, no matter where they live. Meanwhile, the lowest risk appears to be among Native Americans, Africans, and Asians. A 2013 study found only of all diagnosed MS cases are in children. Far more women have MS. In fact, the National MS Society estimates MS is more common in women than men. MS is , but researchers believe there may be a genetic predisposition to developing the disease. About of people with MS have one or more family members or relatives who also have MS, notes the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. In the case of identical twins, there’s a 1 in 3 chance for each sibling to have the disease. Researchers and neurologists still can’t say with certainty what causes MS. The ultimate cause of MS is damage to myelin, nerve fibers, and neurons in the brain and spinal cord. Together these make up the central nervous system. Researchers speculate that a combination of genetic and environmental factors is at play, but it’s not fully understood how. The relationship of the immune system and the brain, however, could be considered a culprit. Researchers suggest the immune system could mistake normal brain cells for foreign ones. One thing the MS community knows for certain is that the disease is . CISis considered to be of MS, but it may or may not progress to MS.To get a diagnosis of MS: A person has to experience a neurologic episode (typically lasting 24 hours or more) that resulted in damage to the central nervous system. People who are at high risk of developing MS are found to have MRI-detected brain lesions. There’s a chance of receiving an MS diagnosis within a few years, estimates the National MS Society. Meanwhile, people at low riskdon’t have MRI-detected brain lesions. They have a 20 percent chance of receiving an MS diagnosis in the same amount of time. RRMS is characterized by clearly defined relapses of increased disease activity and worsening symptoms. These are followed by remissions when the disease doesn’t progress. Symptoms may improve or disappear during remission. Approximately of people receive a diagnosis of RRMS at first, says the National MS Society. SPMS follows an initial RRMS diagnosis. It sees disability gradually increase as the disease progresses, with or without evidence of relapse or changes in an MRI scan. Occasional relapses may occur, as will periods of stability. Untreated, about of people with RRMS transition to SPMS within a decade of the initial diagnosis, estimates a 2017 study. About 90 percent of people transition within 25 years. PPMS is diagnosed in about of people with MS, estimates the National MS Society. People with PPMS experience a steady progression of the disease with no clear relapses or remissions. The rate of PPMS is equally divided between men and women. Symptoms usually begin between the ages of 35 and 39. A high percentage of MS cases don’t progress. These may fit into a subgroup with a “very stable benign” form of the disease, per a presented in 2017. Researchers say it’s possible for people to remain in the RRMS phase for 30 years. At the other end of the spectrum, a 2015 study found about of people with MS develop a more aggressive course of the disease. It’s known as highly active relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (HARRMS). Symptoms vary a great deal from one person to another. No two people have the same combination of symptoms. This, of course, complicates identification and diagnosis. In a , one-fifth of European women surveyed received misdiagnoses before eventually receiving an MS diagnosis. The average woman was found to go through about five visits with a healthcare provider over the course of six months before reaching a diagnosis. According to the , symptoms can impact the mind, body, and senses in a number of ways. These include: There’s no single “MS test.” To receive a diagnosis, your doctor needs to collect your medical history and perform a neurological examination and a series of other tests. Tests may include: Since the exact cause of MS is still unknown, there’s no known prevention. There’s also no cure for MS yet, but treatments can manage symptoms. MS medications are designed to lessen the frequency of relapses and slow the progression of the disease. There several approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat MS. They include: These medications aren’t approved for use during pregnancy. It’s also unclear if MS medications are excreted through breast milk. Talk to your doctor about your MS medications if you’re considering becoming pregnant. People with MS can safely carry a baby to term. Pregnancy doesn’t generally affect MS in the long term. MS has been found to affect decisions about pregnancy, though. In a , 36 percent of women participants decided not to have children at all or postponed the timing of getting pregnant due to their MS. While people with MS often experience during pregnancy, about have a relapse within six months of giving birth. MS is an expensive disease to treat. A found the total lifetime costs per person with MS to be $4.1 million. The average yearly healthcare costs range from $30,000 to $100,000 based on the mildness or severity of the disease.

a6fdc1e6-18c9-4d7a-aad4-f46b1264175f,"Reviewed by MSAA Chief Medical Officer To live with multiple sclerosis (MS) is to cope with the challenges it presents and to look forward to the promise of ongoing progress in understanding and managing the condition. This edition of “What’s New in MS Research” reflects that mix of obstacles and opportunities. Highlighting 11 studies, topics range from symptoms associated with MS to strategies for improving quality of life and factors affecting life expectancy. This article also reports on the anticipated expansion of the medications available to treat MS, continued favorable results in stem cell research, promising non-pharmacologic interventions, and more. As we open not only a new year but a new decade, the prospect ahead is for the opportunities to increase and the obstacles to recede. Researchers such as those whose work is summarized below continue to unlock insights that will enable clinicians and patients alike to make still greater strides in the understanding and treatment of MS. FDA approves applications for generic versions of Gilenya The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved three applications for the first generics of the oral disease-modifying therapy Gilenya (fingolimod) for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS) in adults. The approvals were granted to HEC Pharm Co. Limited, Biocon Limited, and Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Limited. However, due to ongoing legal issues, it is unclear when generic versions of the agent will become commercially available. Gilenya received FDA approval for the treatment of relapsing-remitting MS in adults in September 2010. In May 2018, the FDA approved use of Gilenya in children and adolescents aged 10 years and older, making it the first drug approved by the FDA to treat MS in pediatric patients. (The FDA’s December 2019 approval of generic versions of Gilenya was for the treatment of adults only.) Another small study on stem cell therapy in MS yields favorable findings Interest continues among both clinicians and patients alike by the prospect of treating multiple sclerosis (MS) with stem cells obtained from a patient’s own bone marrow. In preparing participants for stem-cell transplantation, physicians generally administer high-dose chemotherapy, radiation, or both to kill cells in the bone marrow. The stem cells are then reintroduced to the patients by infusion, and these transplanted stem cells can then “re-set” the body’s immune system. While the safety and efficacy of various stem cell treatment strategies are being assessed in relatively large trials, the evidence from smaller studies continues to be generally favorable. One of the latest such inquiries was a Phase I study conducted at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden. The research involved seven patients with progressive MS. When given during clinical remission, the infusions were well tolerated and safe, investigators noted. Five of the seven patients completed a 48-week follow-up period after being infused with their own bone marrow-derived stem cells. At 12 weeks post-infusion, five of the six patients had no new T2 lesions on brain MRI (magnetic resonance imaging). At the 48-week point, however, three of five patients assessed had such lesions evident on MRI. Meanwhile, all six patients assessed at 12 weeks had stable scores on the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), while three of five patients had worse scores at 48 weeks. Additionally, evidence of favorable changes in the patients’ immune systems was observed at seven days after infusion. The researchers concluded that the therapy “was safe and well tolerated, and is associated with possible transient beneficial clinical and [immune system] effects.” Just under half of people with multiple sclerosis experience some degree of tremor, with roughly 6% being affected by severe tremor. This is according to a survey of more than 550 participants in the North American Research Committee on MS (NARCOMS) registry. A recent analysis of 13 studies suggests that individuals experiencing tremors may be helped by deep brain stimulation, or DBS. This treatment approach involves implanting electrodes within specific areas of the brain. A thin wire connects these electrodes to a pacemaker-like device placed under the skin in the upper region of the chest. The device controls the electrodes’ release of electrical impulses, which can affect certain cells or chemicals within the brain, or counter abnormal electrical impulses. DBS has been approved by the FDA to treat conditions including epilepsy, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and Parkinson’s disease. It is being investigated for several other conditions, including addiction, chronic pain, dementia, major depressive disorder, traumatic brain injury, Huntington’s disease, and MS. In analyzing the 13 studies that assessed the impact of DBS in multiple sclerosis, the investigators found consistent evidence that the treatment approach offered benefits as measured by changes in scores on various scales used to measure the degree or severity of tremor. The reported rates of adverse effects in the studies ranged from 8% to 50%. As researchers, clinicians, and patients continue to address the various manifestations of MS and the impact those symptoms have on quality of life, interventions such as DBS are likely to become the focus of increased attention. Understanding the prevalence of swallowing problems in MS A recent Italian study found that a majority of people with multiple sclerosis had dysphagia – or difficulty with swallowing – with one-fourth of them having problems significant enough to require nutritional or dietary modifications. More than 200 people participated in the research. The study participants underwent fiber-optic endoscopy, in which a thin scope is used to examine the throat and upper esophagus to assess swallowing function. More than half (58%) of the participants had some degree of dysphagia (difficulty with swallowing), while 26.5% needed to change their approach to eating and obtaining nutrition due to the severity of their dysphagia. Problems with swallowing were more common in people with progressive forms of MS, who had higher degrees of overall disability, and who were 60 years of age or older. Although difficulty with swallowing can be a frightening development to contemplate – or report to clinicians – early recognition and intervention can speed adoption of effective strategies. These strategies may include using liquid nutritional supplements, adjusting the consistency of foods and drinks, as well as receiving therapy (through a speech or occupational therapist) to lessen the impact of dysphagia, which can promote long-term wellbeing. Three-quarters of people with MS participating in a recent international study reported some degree of language impairment. Researchers worked with MS-related medical organizations as well as patient advocacy and support groups to recruit 160 people with MS living in various countries. Those study participants completed an online survey, answering questions on speech issues and on quality of life. Overall, 75% of participants reported some form of language impairment. Those issues included: difficulty with word retrieval (65.7%); difficulty with expressive language (53.8%); difficulty coming up with the names of objects (49.4%); and difficulty with understanding what others were saying to them (40.6%). Please note that some of these problems may also be attributed to cognitive issues. Investigators found that the prevalence of language issues is not limited to age, gender, educational status, years since diagnosis of MS, country of residence, type of MS, and other factors. Not surprisingly, they also found that study participants with language impairment had a lower health-related quality of life than their counterparts who did not experience this issue. Noting that, “A decline in language abilities can lead to restricted participation in everyday activities that require communication, including vocational, social, and educational contexts,” the researchers concluded, “frontline healthcare providers need to be aware of potential language impairment in MS and should make timely referrals to speech pathologists for further evaluation and support.” For patients and their families, that translates into reporting any early signs of language issues without delay. Some good (bien, bueno, bene) news on learning a second language and protecting the brain A small, MRI-based study suggests that learning a second language may be an effective way for people with MS to stave off the decline in the brain’s grey matter volume (GMV) that is a frequent hallmark of the condition. Researchers had 11 people with relapsing-remitting MS and 12 healthy adult volunteers take eight weeks of training in a language other than their first language. Members of the two groups were matched by age and sex. When comparing MRIs obtained before the language training began with follow-up MRIs at the end of the program, investigators found significant increases of GMV in specific areas of the brain (the right hippocampus, parahippocampus, and putamen) of the people with MS. Further, all study participants had significant gains in listening comprehension, speaking fluency, and vocabulary knowledge. The people with MS also reported improved health-related quality of life. Based on these results, it appears there is something to be said (though perhaps not in English) for learning a second language. People with MS are more frequently hospitalized for the flu versus those without MS Investigators from Norway recently published some compelling evidence pertaining specifically to people with MS who acquire the flu. Drawing on records for the entire population of Norway – more than 5.2 million people – from 2008 through 2014, the researchers examined how contracting the flu affected people with MS versus those who did not have MS. They found that people with MS were 3.4-times more likely than people without MS to require emergency hospitalization within one week of being diagnosed with influenza. With several weeks still to go in the flu season, knowing that the risk of hospitalization is greater for individuals with MS who get the flu, members of the MS community may want to check with their doctor to see if getting a flu shot is advised for them. Researchers in Manitoba, Canada, compared bone density and the incidence of osteoporosis in 783 people with multiple sclerosis (MS) to that of 3,915 healthy controls matched to the MS group in terms of age and gender. They found that people with MS had lower bone mineral density than the controls, and were 2.41-times more likely to have osteoporosis. The authors concluded, “These findings indicate the importance of addressing bone health as part of comprehensive MS care.” With this in mind, individuals with MS may want to consult their physician about having their bone density evaluated. Common treatments for osteoporosis may include calcium supplements, prescribed exercise, and possibly other types of medicines and therapies. Self-efficacy, physical activity, and enhanced quality of life in MS Regular physical activity has been shown to enhance physical health, mental wellbeing, and health-related quality of life in people with multiple sclerosis (MS). A recent study of 28 people with MS suggests that having confidence in one’s own ability to achieve desired results, or self-efficacy, when setting goals, serves as an important link between moving more and feeling better. The study recruited 18 women and 10 men with varying levels of physical activity. Those study participants completed four separate surveys or similar forms designed to assess the extent of their physical activity, health-related quality of life, self-efficacy in the management of MS, and exercise self-efficacy. Researchers then analyzed the responses, looking for relationships between individuals’ scores on the various instruments. They found that self-efficacy in goal setting mediated the relationship between physical activity and mental health to a greater degree than a sense of self-efficacy with exercise alone. They concluded, “Our findings suggest that self-efficacy in goal setting can contribute to the adoption and maintenance of regular physical activity for long-lasting times, supporting and increasing the mental quality of life of people suffering from MS.” If knowledge is power, a recent study from the Veterans Administration (VA) system may empower clinicians to recognize which patients are at highest risk for missing a significant number of appointments and to take steps to address the underlying causes of that absenteeism. The study drew on three-years’ worth of information from a VA database to examine possible associations between several factors and a patient having excessive missed appointments, which was defined as missing 20% or more of scheduled visits. The factors identified by the analysis included distance from the clinic and having a history of post-traumatic stress disorder, congestive heart failure, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. None of those factors are particularly surprising, given the challenges they can pose, but validating their importance can help clinicians and social workers become more attuned to the obstacles they represent. As a result, they can flag the need for steps such as helping to arrange transportation or helping to overcome other obstacles. Looking beyond the VA system, the larger message may be for all people with MS to speak up about any situations that may interfere with keeping their appointments, and ideally avail themselves of assistance. Mapping the geography of MS risk on a smaller scale Researchers have long known that multiple sclerosis (MS) is more common in northern latitudes, with potential reasons for this phenomenon, including the reduced amount of Vitamin D-producing sunlight found in those latitudes versus those climates closer to the equator. Now, however, Italian investigators have reported some intriguing results regarding differences in the prevalence of MS within one region of their country. They found that the overall prevalence (or rate of diagnosed people per 100,000 population) of MS in the province of Pavia, which is located in the northern part of Italy, increased from 86 per 100,000 in 2000 to 169.4 per 100,000 in 2016. That doubling of prevalence represents a significantly increased risk. While the researchers were not able to identify definitive reasons for that increase, they did show that the prevalence varied widely across the province, with several municipalities in the northern part of Pavia having far more cases of MS than other towns and so driving the overall rise in prevalence. They added that their mapping provides a basis for exploring whether environmental or genetic factors may play a role in the higher rates of MS seen in certain towns. As Americans increasingly examine whether environmental or other causes, or plain random chance, are responsible for “clusters” of cancer cases and other diseases in particular communities, the Italian research may provide the basis for similar MS-related mapping in the United States.

5e452ec0-91c4-498e-acbf-3b2bacd3cfda,"Complementary & Alternative Medicines Find Programs & Services in Your Area COVID-19 Vaccine Guidance for People Living with MS     Combined Analysis of Previously Published HSCT/Bone Marrow Transplantation Studies Combined Analysis of Previously Published HSCT/Bone Marrow Transplantation Studies SUMMARY Researchers in Italy combined and analyzed results from 15 previously published studies of HSCT () involving 764 people with various forms of MS, and published results on . Overall, the procedure showed a significant benefit against disease activity and progression. Two years after transplantation, about 83% of all participants had not progressed; overall, studies involving more people with relapsing-remitting MS had lower progression rates. The pooled results showed an overall transplant-related mortality rate of 2.1%. There were fewer deaths in later studies as researchers gained more experience with the procedure. Transplant-related mortality was lower in studies conducted after 2005 (1 death out of 349 patients, or 0.3%), compared to 3.6% in older studies. DETAILS HSCT () attempts to “reboot” the immune system, which is involved in damaging the brain and spinal cord in MS. In HSCT for MS, hematopoietic (blood cell-producing) stem cells, which are derived from a person’s own “autologous” bone marrow, are then collected and stored, and the rest of the individual’s immune cells are depleted by chemotherapy. Then the stored hematopoietic stem cells are re-introduced to the body. The new stem cells migrate to the bone marrow and over time reconstitute the immune system. The goal is to reset the immune system and stop the inflammation that contributes to active relapsing MS.   Dr. Maria Pia Sormani, Gian Luigi Mancardi (University of Genoa, Italy) and collaborators combined and analyzed the results from 15 HSCT studies previously published from 1995 to 2016. This goal of this type of “meta-analysis” is meant to provide a big-picture view of multiple smaller studies. All but one of the studies were conducted “open label,” which means that there was no blinding or placebo controls and the doctors and participants were aware of the treatment they were receiving.   The number of participants involved in the individual studies ranged from 7 to 178, with a total of 764 people with MS. Participants varied in terms of age (9 to 64), levels of disability (1.5 to 9.0 EDSS), disease duration (0.2 to 28 years) and types of MS (relapsing, progressive or not indicated).   Strength of the immune-suppressing regimens used before transplantation varied, and included low-intensity, intermediate intensity, and high intensity.  Key findings of this meta-analysis include: The pooled results showed an overall transplant-related mortality rate of 2.1%. Transplant-related mortality was lower in studies conducted after 2005 (1 death out of 349 patients, or 0.3%), compared to 3.6% in older studies. Studies that included a higher proportion of people with relapsing-remitting MS had a lower mortality rate (1%), and studies that included people with higher levels of disability had a higher mortality rate.  Overall, at two years after transplantation, 17.1% of all participants had progressed, and 82.9% had not. In studies that included a higher proportion of people with relapsing-remitting MS, 7.8% had progressed, compared to 24.8% in studies that included people with a lower proportion of people with relapsing-remitting MS. An evolving measure of treatment benefit is called “No Evidence of Disease Activity” or NEDA. NEDA is achieved if there were no relapses, no progression, and no new signs of disease activity on MRI scans. In five studies that reported NEDA at 2 years (involving 274 patients), 83.4% had NEDA. In four studies that reported NEDA at 5 years (involving 233 patients), 67% had NEDA.    Most of the studies did not employ control groups to compare HSCT to a standard therapy or placebo, and, as noted by the authors of the study, “It is difficult to compare outcomes of aHSCT with those reported in clinical trials of drugs for MS, since the population eligible to receive aHSCT generally has much more aggressive or advanced forms/stages of MS than the ones enrolled in clinical trials.”    The paper was published early online on .   This paper compiles results from a number of small and larger studies of HSCT in MS, and shows results related to the procedure’s safety and effectiveness. “It’s becoming clear that improvements in the procedure and patient selection have made this safer when it is performed in centers with extensive experience,” says Bruce Bebo, PhD, the National MS Society’s Executive Vice President, Research. “We still need well-controlled trials to better understand who will benefit from this procedure and how it compares to the risks and benefits of the FDA-approved disease-modifying treatments. At least one phase 3 trial of HSCT is underway and another is in planning stages, so we should have a much better idea of how HSCT can best be used to treat MS in the near future.”   The Society has formed a Work Group on HSCT in MS Management to discuss what is known and what we still need to know about HSCT, and provide guidance on information, resources and advice the Society should provide for people with MS, healthcare professionals and payers. In addition, the Society is engaged with the team planning a phase 3 trial of HSCT and is encouraging quick action to design and launch the trial. With research rapidly advancing, in November 2015 the Society co-sponsored the International Conference on Cell-Based Therapy for Multiple Sclerosis in Lisbon, Portugal. HSCT was among the topics covered, with participation from HSCT experts including Dr. Mark Freedman (University of Ottawa), Dr. Richard Burt (Northwestern University) and Dr. Gian Luigi Mancardi (University of Genoa) and 70 other leading researchers and clinicians. A review of the findings and consensus on next steps will be published by the conference organizers, with recommendations to help speed the development of new cell-based treatment solutions, including HSCT. , including the procedures involved and (.pdf) Multiple sclerosis is an unpredictable, often disabling . range from numbness and tingling to blindness and paralysis, and there is currently no cure for MS.

For this reason, they have not been shown to be effective in progressive forms of the disease unless a person demonstrates relapses or MRI activity caused by inflammation. Several of these agents, including and an experimental drug called Rituxan, have been studied in PPMS, but unfortunately without a positive effect on progression. There are several clinical trials either recently completed or ongoing for progressive forms of MS and some are for PPMS. Read more about .

There are no specific tests for . Instead, a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis often relies on ruling out other conditions that might produce similar signs and symptoms, known as a differential diagnosis. Your doctor is likely to start with a thorough medical history and examination. During a spinal tap (lumbar puncture) procedure, you typically lie on your side with your knees drawn up to your chest. Then a needle is inserted into your spinal canal — in your lower back — to collect cerebrospinal fluid for testing. Brain MRI scan showing white lesions associated with multiple sclerosis. to help rule out other diseases with symptoms similar to . Tests to check for specific biomarkers associated with are currently under development and may also aid in diagnosing the disease. in which a small sample of cerebrospinal fluid is removed from your spinal canal for laboratory analysis. This sample can show abnormalities in antibodies that are associated with . A spinal tap can also help rule out infections and other conditions with symptoms similar to . which can reveal areas of (lesions) on your brain and spinal cord. You may receive an intravenous injection of a contrast material to highlight lesions that indicate your disease is in an active phase. which record the electrical signals produced by your nervous system in response to stimuli. An evoked potential test may use visual stimuli or electrical stimuli. In these tests, you watch a moving visual pattern, or short electrical impulses are applied to nerves in your legs or arms. Electrodes measure how quickly the information travels down your nerve pathways. In most people with relapsing-remitting , the diagnosis is fairly straightforward and based on a pattern of symptoms consistent with the disease and confirmed by brain imaging scans, such as MRI. Diagnosing can be more difficult in people with unusual symptoms or progressive disease. In these cases, further testing with spinal fluid analysis, evoked potentials and additional imaging may be needed. Brain MRI is often used to help diagnose multiple sclerosis. Our caring team of Mayo Clinic experts can help you with your multiple sclerosis-related health concerns There is no cure for multiple sclerosis. Treatment typically focuses on speeding recovery from attacks, slowing the progression of the disease and managing symptoms. Some people have such mild symptoms that no treatment is necessary. Multiple sclerosis research laboratory at Mayo Clinic such as oral prednisone and intravenous methylprednisolone, are prescribed to reduce nerve inflammation. Side effects may include insomnia, increased blood pressure, increased blood glucose levels, mood swings and fluid retention. The liquid portion of part of your blood (plasma) is removed and separated from your blood cells. The blood cells are then mixed with a protein solution (albumin) and put back into your body. Plasma exchange may be used if your symptoms are new, severe and haven't responded to steroids. For primary-progressive , ocrelizumab (Ocrevus) is the only FDA-approved disease-modifying therapy (DMT). Those who receive this treatment are slightly less likely to progress than those who are untreated. For relapsing-remitting , several disease-modifying therapies are available. Much of the immune response associated with occurs in the early stages of the disease. Aggressive treatment with these medications as early as possible can lower the relapse rate, slow the formation of new lesions, and potentially reduce risk of brain atrophy and disability accumulation. Many of the disease-modifying therapies used to treat carry significant health risks. Selecting the right therapy for you will depend on careful consideration of many factors, including duration and severity of disease, effectiveness of previous treatments, other health issues, cost, and child-bearing status. Treatment options for relapsing-remitting include injectable and oral medications. These drugs are among the most commonly prescribed medications to treat . They are injected under the skin or into muscle and can reduce the frequency and severity of relapses. Side effects of interferons may include flu-like symptoms and injection-site reactions. You'll need blood tests to monitor your liver enzymes because liver damage is a possible side effect of interferon use. People taking interferons may develop neutralizing antibodies that can reduce drug effectiveness. This medication may help block your immune system's attack on myelin and must be injected beneath the skin. Side effects may include skin irritation at the injection site. This once-daily oral medication reduces relapse rate. You'll need to have your heart rate and blood pressure monitored for six hours after the first dose because your heartbeat may be slowed. Other side effects include rare serious infections, headaches, high blood pressure and blurred vision. This twice-daily oral medication can reduce relapses. Side effects may include flushing, diarrhea, nausea and lowered white blood cell count. This drug requires blood test monitoring on a regular basis. This twice-daily capsule is similar to dimethyl fumarate but typically causes fewer side effects. It's approved for the treatment of relapsing forms of . This once-daily oral medication can reduce relapse rate. Teriflunomide can cause liver damage, hair loss and other side effects.

Couples who wish to become pregnant should talk to their doctor about ways to speed elimination of the drug from the body. This drug requires blood test monitoring in a regular basis. Research shows that this once-daily oral medication can reduce relapse rate and help slow progression of . It's also approved for secondary-progressive . Possible side effects include viral infections, liver problems and low white blood cell count. Other possible side effects include changes in heart rate, headaches and vision problems. Siponimod is harmful to a developing fetus, so women who may become pregnant should use contraception when taking this medication and for 10 days after stopping the medication. Some might need to have the heart rate and blood pressure monitored for six hours after the first dose. This drug requires blood test monitoring on a regular basis This medication is generally prescribed as second line treatment for those with relapsing-remitting . It was also approved for secondary-progressive . It is given in two treatment courses, spread over a two-week period, over the course of two years. Side effects include upper respiratory infections, headaches, tumors, serious infections and reduced levels of white blood cells. People who have active chronic infections or cancer should not take this drug, nor should women who are pregnant or breast-feeding. Men and women should use contraception when taking this medication and for the following six months. You may need monitoring with blood tests while taking cladribine. This humanized monoclonal antibody medication is the only approved by the FDA to treat both the relapse-remitting and primary-progressive forms of . Clinical trials showed that it reduced relapse rate in relapsing disease and slowed worsening of disability in both forms of the disease. Ocrelizumab is given via an intravenous infusion by a medical professional. Infusion-related side effects may include irritation at the injection site, low blood pressure, a fever and nausea, among others. Some people may not be able to take ocrelizumab, including those with a hepatitis B infection. Ocrelizumab may also increase the risk of infections and some types of cancer, particularly breast cancer. This medication is designed to block the movement of potentially damaging immune cells from your bloodstream to your brain and spinal cord. It may be considered a first line treatment for some people with severe or as a second line treatment in others. This medication increases the risk of a potentially serious viral infection of the brain called progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) in people who are positive for antibodies to the causative agent of JC virus. People who don't have the antibodies have extremely low risk of . This drug helps reduce relapses of by targeting a protein on the surface of immune cells and depleting white blood cells. This effect can limit potential nerve damage caused by the white blood cells. But it also increases the risk of infections and autoimmune disorders, including a high risk of thyroid autoimmune diseases and rare immune mediated kidney disease. Treatment with alemtuzumab involves five consecutive days of drug infusions followed by another three days of infusions a year later. Infusion reactions are common with alemtuzumab. The drug is only available from registered providers, and people treated with the drug must be registered in a special drug safety monitoring program. Alemtuzumab is usually recommended for those with aggressive or as second line treatment for patients who failed another medication. Physical therapy can build muscle strength and ease some of the symptoms of .

GM-CSF and CXCR4 define a T helper cell signature in multiple sclerosis   ,   ,   ,   ,     , –() Cytokine dysregulation is a central driver of chronic inflammatory diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). Here, we sought to determine the characteristic cellular and cytokine polarization profile in patients with relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) by high-dimensional single-cell mass cytometry (CyTOF). Using a combination of neural network-based representation learning algorithms, we identified an expanded T helper cell subset in patients with MS, characterized by the expression of granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor and the C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4. This cellular signature, which includes expression of very late antigen 4 in peripheral blood, was also enriched in the central nervous system of patients with relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis. In independent validation cohorts, we confirmed that this cell population is increased in patients with MS compared with other inflammatory and non-inflammatory conditions. Lastly, we also found the population to be reduced under effective disease-modifying therapy, suggesting that the identified T cell profile represents a specific therapeutic target in MS.

b3669cc3-1cd3-4c89-acd4-b019b4150ef7,"— — Multiple sclerosis (MS) is often diagnosed when people are in their 20s and 30s. The disease typically follows a pattern, moving through different variations or types over the years. This is because as you get older, your MS symptoms are likely to change. MS damages myelin, the protective coating around nerves. This damage interrupts the flow of nerve impulses from the brain to the body. The greater the damage that’s done to the myelin, the more severe your symptoms will become. Everyone with MS is different. How quickly your disease progresses and the symptoms you experience won’t necessarily be the same as someone else’s with the condition. Your doctor can’t predict exactly how your disease will change over time. But advances in MS research are offering better treatments to slow the disease’s progression and improve the outlook for people living with MS. MS often starts with a single attack. Suddenly your vision becomes blurry, or your legs feel numb or weak. When these symptoms last for at least 24 hours and this is the first attack, they’re called clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). CIS typically starts between ages 20 and 40. It’s caused by inflammation or damage to myelin in your central nervous system. CIS can be a warning of MS to come, but that isn’t always the case. Between of people with CNS will develop MS. If an MRI shows signs of brain lesions, MS is much more likely to develop. Up to of people with MS are first diagnosed with RRMS. It typically starts when people are in their 20s or 30s, although it can begin earlier or later in life. In RRMS, attacks on myelin produce periods of symptom flare-ups called relapses. During a relapse, symptoms may include: Each relapse can last from a few days to a few months. The exact symptoms and their severity can be different for each person. After a relapse, you’ll enter a symptom-free period called remission. Each remission lasts for several months or years. The disease doesn’t progress during remission. Some people stay in RRMS for many decades. Others progress to the secondary-progressive form within a few years. It’s impossible to predict how each person’s disease will act, but new treatments are helping to slow the progression of MS overall. About of people with MS are diagnosed with the primary progressive form. PPMS usually appears during the mid to late 30s. In PPMS, nervous system damage and symptoms steadily get worse over time. There are no real remission periods. The disease continues to progress, and it can eventually lead to problems walking and performing other daily activities. SPMS is the stage that follows RRMS. In this type of MS, myelin damage gets worse over time. You won’t have the long remissions that you had with RRMS. Increasing nervous system damage will lead to more severe symptoms. In the past, about with RRMS moved into the SPMS stage within 10 years, and transitioned to SPMS within 25 years. With new MS drugs, fewer people are progressing to SPMS, and the transition is happening much more slowly. Experts don’t yet know how long these treatments can delay the progression to SPMS. MS is a disease that starts early in life but progresses over time. Most people start with the relapsing-remitting form, alternating periods of symptoms called relapses with symptom-free periods called remissions. Without treatment, the disease continues to the secondary-progressive form. Yet new and more effective treatments are slowing MS progression, sometimes for decades. — — Advancing MS: Coping with Depression, Stress, and Anger Understanding Secondary-Progressive Multiple Sclerosis Depression and MS: Ways to Care for Your Mental Health If you have MS, you're at an increased risk of developing depression.

Your nerve cells have a protective covering called myelin. Without myelin, the brain and spinal cord can't communicate with the nerves in the rest of the body. MS gradually destroys myelin in patches throughout the brain and spinal cord, causing muscle weakness and other symptoms. These patches of damage are called lesions. MS is different for each person. You may go through life with only minor problems. Or you may become seriously disabled. Most people are somewhere in between. Generally, MS follows one of four courses: , where symptoms fade and then return off and on for many years. , which at first follows a relapsing-remitting course and then becomes progressive. ""Progressive"" means it steadily gets worse. , where the disease is progressive from the start. , where the symptoms are progressive at first and are relapsing later. The exact cause is unknown, but most experts believe that MS is an autoimmune disease. In this kind of disease, the body's defenses, called the , mistakenly attack normal tissues. In MS, the immune system attacks the central nervous system—the . Experts don't know why MS happens to some people but not others. There may be a link, because the disease seems to run in families. Where you grew up may also play a role. MS is more common in those who grew up in colder regions that are farther away from the equator. Symptoms depend on which parts of the brain and spinal cord are damaged and how bad the damage is. Early symptoms may include: You may feel weak and stiff, and your limbs may feel heavy. You may drag your leg when you walk. Your vision may be blurred or hazy. You may have eyeball pain (especially when you move your eyes), blindness, or double vision. You may feel tingling, a pins-and-needles sensation, or numbness. You may feel a band of tightness around your trunk or limbs. You may feel lightheaded or dizzy or feel like you're spinning. Diagnosing MS isn't always easy. The first symptoms may be vague. And many of the symptoms can be caused by problems other than MS. MS is not diagnosed unless a doctor can be sure that you have had at least two attacks affecting at least two different areas of your central nervous system. The doctor will examine you, ask you questions about your symptoms, and do some tests. An is often used to confirm the diagnosis, because the patches of damage (lesions) caused by MS attacks can be seen with this test. During a relapse, to make the attack shorter and less severe. Over a long period of time, to keep down the number of attacks and how severe they are and to slow the progression of the disease. (This is called disease-modifying therapy.) You may find it hard to decide when to start taking the drugs that slow the progression of MS. The drugs may not work for everyone, and they often have side effects. You and your doctor will decide together when you should start any of these drugs. There is no cure for MS. Treatment and self-care can help you maintain your quality of life. Physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy can help you manage some physical problems caused by MS. You can also help yourself at home by eating balanced meals, getting regular exercise and rest, and learning to use your energy wisely. Dealing with the physical and emotional demands of MS isn't easy. If you feel overwhelmed, talk to your doctor. You may be depressed, which can be treated. And finding a support group where you can talk to other people who have MS can be very helpful. Health Tools help you make wise health decisions or take action to improve your health. Decision Points focus on key medical care decisions that are important to many health problems. Multiple Sclerosis: Should I Start Taking Medicines for MS? The cause of multiple sclerosis (MS) is unknown. Because a person's risk of MS is slightly higher in some families when a relative has MS, there may be a . For more information, see . Some research suggests that where you lived as a child and you have had could be triggers for MS later in life. But these links have not been proved. The symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS) vary from person to person depending on which parts of the brain or spinal cord (central nervous system) are damaged. The and scarring caused by MS can affect any part of the central nervous system. Myelin is the insulating coating around a nerve. Symptoms may come and go or become more or less severe from day to day or, in rare cases, from hour to hour. Symptoms may become worse with increased body temperature or after a viral infection. , such as weakness, leg dragging, stiffness, a tendency to drop things, a feeling of heaviness, clumsiness, or a lack of coordination (). , such as blurred, foggy, or hazy vision, eyeball pain (especially when you move your eyes), blindness, or double vision. Optic neuritis—sudden loss of vision that is often painful—is a fairly common first symptom. It occurs in up to 25 out of 100 people who have MS. , such as tingling, a pins-and-needles sensation, numbness, a band of tightness around the trunk or legs, or electrical sensations moving down the back and legs. As MS progresses, symptoms may become more severe and may include: Worse muscle problems, and stiff, mechanical movements () or uncontrollable shaking (). These problems may make walking difficult. A wheelchair may be needed some or all of the time. Bladder symptoms, such as an inability to hold urine () or to completely empty the bladder, or a loss of bladder sensation. (impotence) and . . These are common in people who have had MS for some time. Feeling very tired (fatigue). This can be worse if symptoms such as pain, spasticity, bladder problems, anxiety, or depression make it hard to sleep. In general, multiple sclerosis follows one of four courses: , where symptoms may fade and then recur at random for many years. The disease doesn't advance during the remissions. Most people who develop MS have a relapsing-remitting course. In 8 to 9 out of 10 people with this course of MS, the relapsing-remitting phase lasts about 20 years. , which at first follows a relapsing-remitting course. Later on, it becomes steadily progressive. , where the disease is progressive from the start. , where steady deterioration of nerve function begins when symptoms first appear. Symptoms appear and disappear, but nerve damage continues. Few people have this course of MS. MS is different for every person. You may go through life with only minor problems. Or you may become seriously disabled. Most people are somewhere in between. The duration of the disease varies. Most people who get MS live with it for decades. MS usually progresses with a series of that occur over many years (relapsing-remitting MS). In many people the first MS attack involves just a single symptom. It may be weeks, months, or years before you have a relapse. As time goes by, symptoms may linger after each relapse so you lose the ability to fully recover from the relapse. New symptoms often develop as the disease damages other areas of the . Events that can mean you may have a more severe type of MS include: Frequent relapses during the first few years of the disease. Early, lasting motor problems that affect movement. Many lesions that show up on an early in the disease. Some people have a few mild attacks from which they recover entirely. This is called benign MS. Although rare, a small number of people die within several years of the onset of MS. This is called malignant or fulminant MS. Because MS may affect your ability to move and walk, it can place limits on your daily living, particularly as you age. If you or someone in your family has MS, talk to your doctor about . Knowing what to expect will help you plan for the future. Reduced ability to move and walk. This makes it necessary to use a wheelchair some or all of the time. Your risk for multiple sclerosis (MS) increases with: Geographic location, or where you lived during childhood (up to age 15). People who spend the first 15 years of their lives in colder climates that are farther away from the equator tend to be more likely to get MS than people who lived closer to the equator during those years. Family history of MS. About 15 out of 100 people who have MS have a relative with MS, most often a brother or sister. Certain genetic characteristics associated with the . These appear more frequently in people who have MS. This may mean that there are one or more that may increase the chance of getting MS. Race. People of Western European ancestry are more likely to get MS. Being female. MS is about 3 times as common in women as in men. Some of the symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS) are similar to those of many other illnesses. See your doctor if over a period of time you have more than one symptom, such as: Blurry, foggy, or hazy vision, eyeball pain, loss of vision, or double vision. A feeling of heaviness or weakness, involuntary leg dragging, stiffness, walking problems, and clumsiness. Tingling or a pins-and-needles sensation; numbness; tightness in a band around the trunk, arms, or legs; or electric shock sensations moving down the back, arms, or legs. Inability to hold urine or to completely empty the bladder. Problems with memory, attention span, finding the right words for what you mean, and daily problem-solving. If you have been diagnosed with MS, see your doctor if: You begin having a symptom that you have not had before or you notice a significant change in symptoms that are already present. Milder MS-type symptoms can be caused by many other conditions or may occur now and then in healthy people. For example, lots of people have minor numbness in their fingers or a mild dizzy spell once in a while. Stiffness and muscle weakness can result from being more active than usual. A wait-and-see approach () is appropriate for these types of everyday aches and pains, so long as they do not continue. If your symptoms occur more often or don't go away, talk to your doctor. Talk to your doctor about what to expect from the disease and from treatment. MS is an unpredictable disease, but you probably can get some idea of what is ""normal"" and what symptoms or problems are reasons for concern. Some people who have MS want active, regular support from their doctors. Others want to manage their condition on their own as much as possible. Wherever you are in this range, find out which signs or symptoms mean that you need to see your doctor. And seek help when you need it. Health professionals who may be involved in evaluating symptoms of MS and treating the condition include: or . Consult your doctor when symptoms first start. He or she will refer you to a neurologist if needed. If you have MS, your family doctor or internist can treat your general health problems even if you see a neurologist for MS treatment. . A neurologist can decide whether your symptoms are caused by MS. He or she can also help you decide what may be the best treatment for your condition. Many university medical centers and large hospitals have MS clinics or centers staffed by neurologists and other health professionals who specialize in diagnosing and treating MS. They may be able to provide the most thorough evaluation. If you have been diagnosed with MS, at some point you may need to seek the help of: A , to assist with exercise to maintain body strength and flexibility and deal with movement problems. An , to identify ways of accomplishing daily activities if MS has caused any physical limitations. A , to improve speech, chewing, and breathing if MS has affected the muscles of the face and throat. A , to help with managing pain, maintaining strength, and adapting to physical disability. A or , to evaluate and treat , or other mood disorders, and problems with memory and concentration if these develop. A , to help with any significant chronic pain that MS may cause. A pain specialist, often as part of a pain clinic, can help find ways of reducing pain when possible and dealing with pain that doesn't go away. A , to do surgery for severe or . Diagnosing multiple sclerosis (MS) isn't always easy and in some cases may take time. Your medical history and can identify possible nervous system problems and are often enough to strongly suggest a diagnosis of MS. Tests may help confirm or rule out the diagnosis when your history and exam do not provide clear evidence of the disease. MRI and neurological exam may help doctors predict which people will develop MS after a first attack of symptoms. of the brain and spinal cord. This test is done to . (sometimes called a spinal tap). This test may be done to evaluate . Most people with MS have abnormal results on this test. . This test can often reveal abnormalities in the and in the that other tests may not detect. MS is diagnosed when it is clear from neurological tests and a neurological exam that lesions (damaged areas) are present in more than one area of the (usually the brain, spinal cord, or the nerves to the eyes). Tests will also clearly show that damage has occurred at more than one point in time. Some people have had only one episode of a neurological symptom such as optic neuritis, but MRI tests suggest they may have MS. This is known as a clinically isolated syndrome. Many of these people go on to develop MS over time. Urinary tract tests may be needed to help diagnose a problem with bladder control in a person who has MS. may be needed to identify thinking or emotional problems, which may be present without the person being aware of them. Typically, these tests are in a question-and-answer format. A blood test for JC virus antibodies may be done. This test can help you and your doctor understand your risk for getting a rare but serious brain infection called PML (progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy). Treatment can make living with multiple sclerosis (MS) easier. Your type of treatment will depend on how severe your symptoms are and whether your disease is active or in remission. You may get medicines, physical therapy, and other treatment at home. Medicines are used to treat relapses, control the course of the disease (disease-modifying drugs or DMDs), or treat symptoms. The National Multiple Sclerosis Society recommends that people with a definite diagnosis of MS and who have active, relapsing disease start treatment with medicines. This group also recommends treatment with medicine after the first attack in some people who are at a high risk for MS. If you decide not to try medicines at this time, meet with your doctor regularly to check whether the disease is progressing. Multiple Sclerosis: Should I Start Taking Medicines for MS? You and your doctor will set up a schedule of periodic appointments to monitor and treat your symptoms and follow the progress of your MS. Monitoring your condition helps your doctor find out if you may need to try a different treatment. , occupational therapy, and nonmedical treatment done at home may also help you manage symptoms and adjust to living and working situations. To learn more, see . In rare cases, MS is life-threatening. If your condition gets considerably worse, you may want to make a living will, which allows your wishes to be carried out if you are not able to make decisions for yourself. For more information, see the topic . In general, there is no way to prevent multiple sclerosis (MS) or its attacks. For people with , , and , treatment with medicine may reduce the frequency of relapses and delay disability. If you have multiple sclerosis (MS), it is important to find ways of coping with the practical and emotional demands of the disease. These are different for everyone, so home treatment varies from person to person. Home treatment may involve making it easier to get around your home, dealing with , handling specific symptoms, and getting support from your family and friends. to keep it safe and easy to get around. For example, to help prevent falls, install grab bars in the bathroom and don't use throw rugs. And try adjusting your daily schedule so that your routine is less stressful or tiring. , either on your own or with the help of a physical therapist. . At some time, most people with MS have bladder problems. Your doctor may prescribe a medicine to help you. Avoid getting overheated. Increased body temperature can temporarily make your symptoms worse. Use an air conditioner, keep your home somewhat cool, and avoid hot swimming pools and hot tubs. During warm or hot weather, exercise in an air-conditioned area rather than outdoors. Eat plenty of fruits, vegetables, grains, cereals, legumes, poultry, fish, lean meats, and low-fat dairy products. A balanced diet for a person who has MS is the same as that recommended for most healthy adults. Change how and what you eat if you are having problems swallowing. Thicker drinks make swallowing easier. Try milk shakes or juices in gelatin form. Avoid foods such as crackers or cakes that crumble easily. These can cause choking. Soft foods need less chewing. Use a blender to prepare food for easiest chewing. Eat frequent, small meals to avoid fatigue from eating heavy meals. Ask your doctor about and occupational therapy to help you manage at work and home. Make all efforts to preserve your health. Proper diet, rest, wise use of energy, and practical and emotional support from your family, friends, and doctor can all be very helpful. For more advice about coping with MS at home, contact the National Multiple Sclerosis Society at www.nationalmssociety.org. Medicines for multiple sclerosis (MS) may be used: During a , to make the attack shorter and less severe. Over a long period of time, to alter the natural course of the disease (disease-modifying drugs or DMDs). These medicines can shorten a sudden relapse and help you feel better sooner. They have been shown to affect the long-term course of the disease or to prevent disability. Strong evidence suggests that MS is caused by the causing and attacking nerve cells and myelin, which is the protective coating surrounding the nerve fibers. Medicines that change the way the immune system works can reduce the number and severity of attacks that damage the nerves and myelin. For people who have , disease-modifying therapy can reduce the number and severity of relapses. It may also delay disability in some people. Some of these medicines may also delay disease progression and reduce relapses in some people who have or . The most commonly used disease-modifying therapies are: Interferon beta (such as Betaseron), for clinically isolated syndrome (first MS attack), relapsing-remitting MS, and secondary progressive MS. Glatiramer (Copaxone), for clinically isolated syndrome and relapsing-remitting MS. Other disease-modifying medicines may also be used for MS. Your doctor will prescribe a medicine depending on the type of MS you have, your symptoms, and how your body responds. They include: Some people have only one episode of a neurological symptom such as . Yet or other tests suggest that these people have MS. This is known as a clinically isolated syndrome. Many of these people go on to develop MS over time. In most cases, doctors will prescribe medicine for people who have had a clinically isolated syndrome. These medicines, when taken early or even before you have been diagnosed with MS, may keep the disease from getting worse or extend your time without disease. Treating specific symptoms can be effective, even if it doesn't stop the progression of the disease. Symptoms that can often be controlled or relieved with medicine include: Medicines can also help with sexual problems, emotional problems, and walking problems. Sildenafil (Viagra) can help with sexual problems in both men and women. Clomipramine may also be given to improve . Dextromethorphan and quinidine (Nuedexta) is a medicine that can be used for uncontrollable outbursts of crying or laughing at strange or inappropriate times. Dalfampridine (Ampyra) is a medicine that can be used to help with walking problems. Medicine may be used only some of the time or regularly, depending on how severe or constant a certain symptom is. Changes in diet, schedule, exercise, and other habits can also help manage some of these symptoms. See . Cannabinoids are substances found in marijuana. Similar drugs can be created in a lab. Some forms of natural and man-made cannabinoids may help with symptoms such as pain and spasticity. They are not available in all areas. Talk to your doctor if you are considering cannabinoids. A variety of other medicines and biological chemicals have been tried or are being studied as therapy for MS. None of them have been clearly proved as beneficial, and none have been approved for treatment of MS. Several medicines are being tested in clinical trials. People with MS who have not responded to standard therapy sometimes choose to take part in these trials. To learn more about clinical trials, talk to your doctor or contact the National Multiple Sclerosis Society at www.nationalmssociety.org. The National Multiple Sclerosis Society recommends that people with a definite diagnosis of MS and active, relapsing disease start treatment with interferon beta or glatiramer. Most neurologists support this recommendation and now agree that permanent damage to the nervous system may occur early on, even while symptoms are still quite mild. Early treatment may help prevent or delay some of this damage. In general, treatment is recommended until it no longer provides a clear benefit. The National MS Society also says that treatment with medicine may be considered after the first attack in some people who are at a high risk for MS (before MS is definitely diagnosed). Despite the recommendation, some people find it hard to decide whether to begin disease-modifying therapy, especially when their symptoms have been fairly mild. Some may not want to bear the risks and side effects of medicine when they are not sure they need it. Some may want to see whether their disease gets worse before they start therapy. A small percentage of people diagnosed with MS may never have more than a few mild episodes and may never develop any disability, but the disease is unpredictable. Multiple Sclerosis: Should I Start Taking Medicines for MS? The need and desire for medicine vary. If your symptoms are mild, you may choose to manage them without any medicine. If you have specific symptoms that are causing problems, certain medicines may help you keep them under control. Or you may want to use medicine only during a relapse. The possible side effects of using steroids or other medicines to treat symptoms or control a relapse. Some people have only minor side effects. But others may have side effects that concern them more than their MS symptoms. The costs of treating symptoms and controlling relapses. In some cases, using medicine to control symptoms and relapses may reduce the need for hospital stays. Other personal issues that you face at work or at home. Also keep in mind that it can be hard to tell if medicine is helping. Multiple sclerosis is a disease with spontaneous remissions. This means that your condition can improve on its own, without any treatment. Just because your symptoms improve after treatment doesn't mean that a treatment is working. People with multiple sclerosis (MS) who have severe (shakiness) affecting movement may be helped by surgery. People with severe (muscle stiffness) may be helped by insertion of a spinal pump to deliver medicines when oral medicines fail. for tremor. This treatment is only considered after other options have failed. Severe and disabling tremor that occurs with the slightest movement of the limbs may be helped by an implanted device that stimulates an area of the brain. A does the surgery to implant the device. Implantation of a drug catheter or pump, for spasticity. This treatment is only considered after other options have failed. People who have severe pain or spasticity may benefit from having a catheter or pump placed in the lower spinal area to deliver a constant flow of medicine, such as baclofen. The unpredictability and variety of symptoms caused by multiple sclerosis (MS) make it a disease that people have tried to treat in many different ways. Many have been proposed as treatments for MS. None of these treatments have been shown to modify the course of the disease. Some of those most commonly used are: Diets and vitamin, mineral, herbal, or dietary supplements. (often used by ). Although clinical research has not shown all of these complementary therapies to be effective, a person with MS may benefit from safe nontraditional therapies along with conventional medical treatment. Some complementary therapies may help relieve stress, depression, fatigue, and muscle tension. And some may improve your overall well-being and quality of life. Talk to your doctor if you are interested in trying any of these complementary therapies or to MS treatment. Clinical research also has been unable to show that treatments such as ""liberation"" angioplasty for chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency (CCSVI), bee venom therapy, Prokarin (a caffeine and histamine combination), removal of mercury fillings (dental amalgams), and have any benefits for people who have MS. Some of these therapies may be harmful as well as expensive and are not recommended by most experts. Experimental treatments for MS involve reducing the activity of the . This may be done with medicines and biological chemicals or through methods such as total lymphoid irradiation, in which the entire lymph node system is exposed to radiation. While these methods have been used with success in the treatment of certain other medical conditions, they have failed to produce significant benefits when tested in controlled clinical trials. They remain experimental treatments for MS. , which uses immature cells from the bone marrow, has been studied. Early results suggest that stem cell transplant may delay disability, especially in people with relapsing-remitting MS. Stem cell transplant may be an option for people who have very aggressive or malignant forms of MS. It remains unproved and isn't recommended for treating relapsing-remitting MS. There is no cure for MS. So far, the only treatments proved to affect the course of the disease are approved disease-modifying therapies. Other types of treatment should replace these medicines if you are a candidate for treatment with them. Some people who have MS report that complementary therapies have worked for them. This may be in part because of the . Some complementary therapies don't treat the disease itself, but they may affect a person's sense of well-being and help the person feel better and healthier. If you are thinking about trying a complementary treatment, get the facts first. Discuss these questions with your doctor: Talk with your doctor about the safety and potential side effects of the treatment. This is especially important if you are on drug therapy for MS. Some complementary treatments in combination with drug therapy can be quite dangerous. A treatment that could be harmful to you and may or may not improve your symptoms isn't worth the risk. Because MS symptoms can come and go, you may find it hard to judge whether a particular treatment is really working. Keep in mind that if you get better after using a certain treatment, the treatment isn't always the reason for the improvement. MS may often improve on its own (spontaneous remission). An expensive, unproven treatment that may or may not help you may not be worth its cost. Beware of therapy providers or products that require a large financial investment at the beginning of a series of treatments. Even if they aren't effective in treating MS, some complementary practices (such as acupuncture, massage, or yoga) may be safe. And they may lead to healthy habits that improve your overall well-being. These might be worth trying. With a hard-to-treat disease like MS, it can be tempting to jump at the promise of an effective treatment. Be cautious about trying unproven treatments.

DETAILS Many people who are diagnosed with eventually transition to a course in which there is a progressive worsening of neurologic function (accumulation of disability) over time. There has been some evidence that early and ongoing treatment with MS is the best way to reduce current and future disease activity, but specific information is needed about the timing and best types of therapies to achieve the optimal impacts against the disease. A team of researchers including J. William L. Brown, MRCP, University of Cambridge, and Tomas Kalincik, PhD, University of Melbourne, and colleagues sought to determine the association between the use, the type of, and the timing of disease-modifying therapies with the risk of conversion to the secondary progressive phase of MS.   Investigators looked at records of 1,555 people with relapsing-remitting MS who began treatment with disease-modifying therapies from 1988-2012, or who remained untreated, and who had been followed for at least four years. Treated individuals were identified in MSBase, an international online registry that currently includes records of more than 60,000 people with MS from hundreds of clinics worldwide. Untreated individuals for the study were selected from the database of the University Hospital of Wales.   People who took fingolimod, alemtuzumab, and natalizumab (“higher-efficacy therapy” therapies with greater effectiveness but possibly more risk of side effects) were compared with those initially treated with glatiramer acetate or interferon beta (traditional, first generation disease-modifying therapies). Those initially treated with glatiramer acetate or interferon beta within five years of MS onset were compared with those initially treated after five years. Investigators also looked at whether treatment was escalated from traditional to higher-efficacy within five years or later.   The outcome being measured in all these comparisons was conversion to secondary progressive MS, which was defined as an increase of 1 point on the EDSS scale of disability progression (if the EDSS score was 5.5 or less) or .5 point (if the EDSS score was more than 5.5). This EDSS increase had to occur without a relapse and be confirmed after 3 months or more.   The investigators report that people who were treated with any type of disease-modifying therapy were significantly less likely to later develop secondary progressive MS than those who remained untreated. In addition, they reported that initial treatment with the higher-efficacy therapies was associated with a significantly decreased risk of conversion to secondary progressive MS compared with treatment with initial treatment with traditional therapies. They also found that the risk of developing secondary progressive MS was significantly lower when treatment was started within five years of MS onset compared to after five years, and when treatment was escalated from traditional therapy to a higher-efficacy therapy in the first five years compared to later.   The team (J. William L. Brown, MRCP, University of Cambridge, and Tomas Kalincik, PhD, University of Melbourne, and colleagues) report their findings in ().   Although this type of observational study cannot provide the same level of evidence as a well-designed, controlled clinical trial, Ari Green, MD (University of California, San Francisco) suggests in an that, based on this and other studies, “The signs are strongly pointing to the benefits of early and aggressive treatment to forestall damage.” He cautions that the study did not show that disease modifying therapies can stop MS completely since a significant number of people studied did develop secondary progressive MS.    Further studies are underway in this area. The is one of two studies funded by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute that will help inform treatment decisions around whether, and which, people with MS would most benefit from early, possibly more risky aggressive therapy. The other study is Determining the Effectiveness of Early Intensive versus Escalation Approaches for the Treatment of Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (DELIVER-MS). UPDATE 2/22/19: Further Results on Early, Aggressive Treatment A second study has reported that, among 592 people with MS, 104 who were prescribed early high efficacy therapies had more favorable outcomes as measured by the EDSS, compared with 488 people who started with traditional disease-modifying treatments.

Most people are diagnosed with PPMS in their 40s and 50s. People with RRMS tend to have more brain lesions with more inflammatory cells.Those with PPMS tend to have more spinal cord lesions and fewer inflammatory cells. RRMS affects women two to three times more often than men. People with RRMS will likely have mobility issues, but these issues are more gradual.People with PPMS often experience more mobility issues and have more trouble walking. In general, PPMS tends to affect the body’s ability to function more than RRMS does. For example, those with PPMS may also find it more difficult to continue working because of their mobility issues and declining neurologic function. As far as symptoms go, RRMS and PPMS are oftentimes very different from each other. People with RRMS enter periods of flare-ups and remission, while those with PPMS are in a continual phase of deterioration.

One impediment is the lack of a quick way to detect whether a therapy is working, since progression can occur slowly. The search has been on for biomarkers that can predict disease activity and detect response to therapy. To advance this search, the , a global initiative that includes leadership from the National MS Society, convened a panel of experts to evaluate the potential of “neurofilament light” (NfL) as a fluid biomarker in MS and progressive MS in particular, and to outline research needed to advance the field. The panel has that summarizes what is known about NfL as a potential biomarker, and makes recommendations for further research to refine its potential to predict disease course and detect response to therapy in progressive MS. MORE DETAILS  Amidst a growing list of disease-modifying therapies for relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis, there is an unmet need for treatments that can stop and prevent disease worsening for those in progressive stages of the disease.   Clinical trials involving people with relapsing MS often rely on counting relapses or MRI-detected lesions to detect disease activity. Progression is less easily measured, and usually happens over longer periods of time. This makes it hard to detect quickly whether a therapy is slowing or stopping progression in early phase 2 proof of concept clinical trials. This is a serious roadblock for developing therapies for progressive MS.   Having objective indicators that detect progression, measure treatment impact, and predict an individual’s course and response to therapy would speed the development of new therapies and improve care for progressive MS.   To consider the current state of research on fluid biomarkers in MS in general and progressive MS specifically, the convened a panel of experts, including people affected by MS, scientists, and MS clinicians, with a view to mobilizing the MS community toward filling key gaps in knowledge and understanding. Under the leadership of Raju Kapoor, FRCP  (then at University College London) and Robert J. Fox, MD (Cleveland Clinic) the panel’s first published paper summarizes the state of knowledge about neurofilament light (NfL), and provides recommendations for next steps to advance NfL as a potential biomarker for MS.   Neurofilaments are important proteins that function to maintain nerve cell structure necessary for proper electrical impulse conduction along axons (nerve wires). NfL is a fragment that is part of the debris that enters the spinal fluid and blood when axons are damaged by MS and other causes. Recent technological advances have enabled the detection of NfL in the blood (serum and plasma), and not just in spinal fluid obtained by spinal tap, which makes it more convenient and practical as a potential biomarker.   Studies of NfL in serum, plasma and spinal fluid have been underway to better define how this biomarker may be employed to help detect and predict disease activity, progression, and response to treatments, not only in MS but in other neurologic disorders. NfL is also detected in healthy individuals, and its concentrations increase with age, so it is important to understand what is normal and what is not.   Recent clinical trials in MS have incorporated periodic monitoring of NfL levels as a possible indicator of treatment effect. The paper and accompanying tables outline how NfL levels behave before and after treatment in the course of clinical trials in both relapsing and progressive forms of MS. Results vary, but generally suggest that on a group level (rather than in individuals), NfL levels can predict relapse rates, brain tissue loss, disability progression, and are indicators of treatment response.   The authors outline additional research needed to establish the value of serum NfL as a biomarker in progressive MS and to have it recognized by drug regulators as a measure of treatment response in clinical trials. These include: Standard protocols should be established for how fluid samples for NfL detection are collected, handled, stored and analyzed, so that findings may be compared across multiple studies. Establishing normal NfL values across a broad age range of individuals with and without known medical issues, and potential confounding factors such as smoking, is a critical next step. Having these “normative” values not only increase the value of NfL as a biomarker in clinical trials, but will also facilitate its use for guiding treatment decisions in individuals, which is not yet understood. Additional studies of prior clinical trial data are needed to further understand how predictive serum NfL levels are of future disease activity and progression, how they correspond with MRI findings, and how they are influenced by inflammation and various therapies. The authors highlight several studies that are already underway that will help establish normative values of NfL, the impact of lifestyle, age and other demographic factors, and help define its predictive value, not just in MS but other disorders. Additional molecules are also under investigation as potential fluid biomarkers.   The International Progressive Multiple Sclerosis Alliance and its partners will continue to advance these initiatives to support its goal of speeding the development of therapies for progressive stages of MS.   The paper, “Serum Neurofilament Light as a Biomarker in Progressive Multiple Sclerosis,” was published in the September 8, 2020 online issue of , the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology, by authors Raju Kapoor, FRCP  (University College London), Robert J Fox, MD (Mellen Center for Multiple Sclerosis, Cleveland Clinic), and their international collaborators.

ca0ac6ad-61c2-4f2e-a56d-6f090cb34962,"— After a successful clinical trial, the drug Gilenya has been approved by the FDA to treat children who have relapsing multiple sclerosis. Thousands of children have multiple sclerosis (MS). Until now, there had been no treatment approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for them. That’s now changed. Earlier this month, the FDA the drug Gilenya to treat relapsing MS in children 10 years and older. It’s the first FDA-approved drug to treat MS in pediatric patients. The approval came after a recent in which Gilenya reduced the frequency of MS flare-ups in children. The drug, manufactured by Novartis, was approved by the FDA in 2010 to treat adults with relapsing MS. “Currently none of the FDA approved [disease-modifying treatments] have an indication for use in pediatric patients, but they are used off-label,” said Dr. Barbara Giesser, professor of clinical neurology at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) and clinical director of the UCLA MS program. “It is reassuring to have data that indicates safety and efficacy in pediatric patients for this widely used [disease-modifying treatment],” she told Healthline. MS has no cure, and it can be disabling. It usually hits people in their 30s and 40s. But there are an estimated 8,000 to 10,000 children under the age of 18 who have received diagnoses with MS in the United States. Another 10,000 to 15,000 children have experienced at least one symptom that suggests MS, according to the . “The Society has been working on this issue for more than a decade, creating awareness and consistency around the diagnosis and care of children with MS,” said Cyndi Zagieboylo, president and CEO of the National MS Society. The recent clinical trial was a result of years of hard work. Until recently, no one knew how to test a drug for children. After a congressional in 2003, all FDA drugs approved for adults that show potential for children are tested for a pediatric plan. “The challenge was how to conduct that study,” explained Dr. Tanuja Chitnis, FAAN, associate professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School, director of Partners Pediatric Multiple Sclerosis Center at Massachusetts General Hospital, and director of the . Chitnis explained to Healthline the process for approving a drug for children. A decade or so ago, the MS community became more aware of a growing number of children with the disease. MS organizations around the world joined together to make a concerted effort to find some answers. The International Pediatric MS Study Group was formed. Chitnis is the first chair of this steering committee of nine people. Her first job was to figure out how to develop a way to move forward with testing drug therapies for children. Guidelines were created, followed by the first study. Pediatric patients are often treated with conservative options such as injectable interferon-A (Avonex) and injectable glatiramer acetate (Copaxone). Neither of these drugs are FDA-approved for those 18 and under. “This was the first study out since the group created guidelines,” Chitnis said. In the clinical trial, 215 children across the world participated over a two-year period. Gilenya, the brand name for fingolimod, was shown to be 82 percent better in reducing relapse rate than Avonex. Most disease-modifying treatments for adults average 30 to 50 percent effectiveness. In addition, 86 percent of the children using Gilenya were relapse-free over the study period. That compared to 39 percent of Avonex who remained relapse-free. These numbers suggest that “Gilenya especially works in inflammatory MS,” said Chitnis, explaining that this is the dominant type of MS in children. “The [18 and under] is a rare but important population. A lot of thought went into the study,” she said. She adds that the study provided a better understanding of pediatric MS. Researchers found that pediatric MS was more inflammatory and that children had two to three times more relapses than adults. MS is difficult enough for adults. But Chitnis notes there are challenges of working with children who have chronic illness. As director of the Partners Pediatric Multiple Sclerosis Center, she provides family counselors and neuropsychologists to help neurologists and patients. They work together with school programs and create individual education plans for the patients. “Many younger patients have cognitive issues. Add high school, slow processing speeds. Stress may add relapses, causing the two to spiral. It is a challenging disease,” Chitnis said. Pediatric MS patients are usually 13 to 15 years old when the disease appears. “It’s not insignificant that puberty has happened right before,” Chitnis said. Younger onset of puberty is associated with younger onset of MS. “More obesity and earlier age of menarche may play a role,” she added. “The risk factors for MS and pediatrics are vitamin D, Epstein-Barr virus, obesity, smoking exposure, and there are some signals with gut microbiome and diet,” Chitnis explained. “And then add hormones. Hormones can be pro-inflammatory.” Side effects are always a concern, especially for younger people. “Gilenya is overall well tolerated,” Chitnis aid. “There were slightly more infections and more cases of low white blood cell count, but that is to be expected, as it’s how [the drug] works.” The drug targets and suppresses immune cells in order to keep MS at bay. The Gilenya group did report more seizure-type symptoms, with six participants reporting symptoms versus one participant in the Avonex group. Chitnis told Healthline that the next step is to spread the word. She suggests discussions between families and neurologists to see if they’re good candidates to start or switch to this treatment. There are numerous active for pediatric MS, including four trials testing the efficacy of adult disease-modifying treatments. “Having clear efficacy and safety information to share with patients and families is so critical for care,” Chitnis said. “The fact it worked so well gives a lot of hope for both the immediate future and the long term. If we could reduce inflammatory relapses by 82 percent, there is hope these patients could have relatively normal lives.” Editor’s note: Caroline Craven is a patient expert living with MS.

Exploring the link between pediatric MS and a family history of autoimmune disorders The “economic complications” of MS: unemployment and underemployment Assessing the extent and impact of “stem cell tourism” The opening months of 2019 saw significant research advances on many fronts in multiple sclerosis (MS). A sophisticated analysis of data using healthcare claims found that the number of people in the United States living with MS is more than twice as high as previously estimated. Dietary studies sounded a cautionary note for people with MS drinking soda and many other sweetened beverages, and a hopeful note on the potential for flavonoid-rich cocoa to reduce MS-associated fatigue. A promising stem-cell therapy is moving forward in the clinical-trials process, while the FDA is considering whether to approve a new disease-modifying therapy (DMT). Additionally, genetic analysis, population-based studies, and other investigations are steadily expanding scientists’ understanding of MS risk factors and physiologic processes, laying the groundwork for new treatments and other interventions. This edition of “What’s New in MS Research” covers all of those developments and more. Beyond perusing the items that follow, please check the Multiple Sclerosis Association of America’s periodically for updates on other research advances and comprehensive information on all aspects of living with MS. Analysis shows the number of people with MS to be much higher than previously estimated As many as 913,925 people living in the United States had multiple sclerosis (MS) in 2017, according to estimates derived from an extensive analysis of healthcare claims. That number is more than double the previous estimate of 400,000 affected people in the United States. [Wallin 2019] Researchers arrived at the higher figure by using a sophisticated algorithm (a step-by-step problem-solving process) to analyze the data found in claims from private, public, and military healthcare systems covering more than 125 million people. Drawing on the claims data, the investigators first calculated that 727,344 people in the United States were affected by MS in 2010. They then extrapolated their findings to come up with a low and a high estimate of the number of people living with MS in 2017. Those 2017 estimates ranged from 851,749 people to 913,925 people, or from 337.9 cases per 100,000 population to 362.6 cases per 100,000. The figures represent the MS prevalence, which is the cumulative number of cases diagnosed over several years among people who are still living. [Wallin 2019] The analysis also confirmed the long-standing finding that MS is more common in women than men. For 2010, investigators found that MS prevalence was 450.1 cases per 100,000 women versus 159.7 cases per 100,000 men, for a female:male ratio of 2.8-1. Further, the 2010 data showed that MS prevalence was highest in people aged 55 to 64 years, and that MS is more common in the north than in the south, differing from a high of 377.4 cases per 100,000 in the northeast to 272.6 cases per 100,000 in the south. [Wallin 2019] Our findings suggest that there has been a steady rise in the prevalence of MS over the past five decades, the researchers noted. [Wallin 2019] Correcting lower, inaccurate estimates of how many people are affected by MS is critical as the government, payers, and healthcare systems determine how to allocate resources – including research funds and patient-care staff – to address various conditions and diseases. Drinking roughly two cans per day of non-diet soda or other beverages sweetened with sugar may be tied to more severe multiple sclerosis (MS) symptoms and greater disability relative to not drinking or seldom consuming such beverages. This conclusion is according to a study involving 135 people with MS. [AAN Feb. 26] The study focused on how participants’ diets compared to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet. The DASH diet recommends whole grains, fruits and vegetables, low-fat dairy products, lean meats, poultry and fish, and nuts and legumes. It also limits foods that are high in saturated fat and sugar. [AAN Feb. 26] Researchers divided the participants into five groups based on those study subject’s self-reported consumption of soda and sugar-sweetened beverages. The people in the top group drank an average of 290 calories of sugar-sweetened beverages – the rough equivalent of two cans of non-diet soda – per day. The lowest group seldom drank sugar-sweetened beverages. The study found that people with MS who drank the largest amounts of sugar-sweetened beverages were five-times more likely to have severe disability than those in the lowest-consumption group. The top group had an average score of 4.1 points on the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), while the bottom group had an average score of 3.4 points. [AAN Feb. 26] MS patients often want to know how diet and specific foods can affect the progression of their disease, noted study author Elisa Meier-Gerdingh, MD, of St. Josef Hospital in Bochum, Germany. While we did not find a link with overall diet, interestingly, we did find a link with those who drank sodas, flavored juices and sweetened teas and coffees. Dr. Meier-Gerdingh added that while the results of the research need to be confirmed by larger, longer studies, We do know that sodas have no nutritional value, and people with MS may want to consider reducing or eliminating them from their diet. [AAN Feb. 26] The researcher also noted that the study assessed participants diets and sugar-sweetened beverages at the same time as disability, precluding investigators from determining whether sugar-sweetened beverages contribute to higher disability or whether more severe disease affects a person’s ability to follow a healthy diet. [AAN Feb. 26] Further information on the study will be presented at the 71st annual meeting of the American Academy of Neurology, which will take place in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in early May 2019. Meanwhile, a sweet remedy for MS-related fatigue shows early promise A cup of flavonoid-rich cocoa may someday be just what the doctor orders to help with the fatigue frequently experienced by people with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). Flavonoids are a group of more than 5,000 plant chemicals found in fruits and vegetables, and are especially abundant in cocoa and dark chocolate. Flavonoids, which are associated with anti-inflammatory properties, have been previously studied in people with chronic fatigue syndrome. [BMJ March 4] Researchers in the United Kingdom recently assessed the impact of flavonoids on MS-related fatigue in a randomized, double-blind study that involved 30 women and 10 men with RRMS. Those study participants were randomized to drink either high-flavonoid or low-flavonoid cocoa each day for six weeks. [Coe 2019] At the end of the study period, the people drinking the high-flavonoid cocoa showed a 45% improvement in subjectively assessed fatigue and an 80% improvement in walking speed. Overall, 11 of the 19 people in the high-flavonoid group and eight of the 21 people in the low-flavonoid group reported improvement in their fatigue. [Coe 2019] The researchers noted that the mental and physical fatigue experienced by people with MS arise from complex causes, likely involving neural, inflammatory, metabolic, and psychological factors. Flavonoids potentially could be used in conjunction with exercise, medication, and physical therapy to provide a comprehensive approach to managing fatigue in MS, they added. The use of dietary approaches to reduce fatigue and associated factors in people with MS may be an easy, safe, and cost-effective way to have an impact on quality of life and independence, allowing people to feel more in control of their condition, the investigators said in calling for more-extensive research into the potential for flavonoids to reduce MS-related fatigue. [BMJ March 4] Clinical trial to evaluate stem-cell therapy for progressive MS A therapy that would use a patient s own stem cells to treat progressive MS is moving toward the clinical trial stage. In December 2018, the FDA approved an application from BrainStorm Cell Therapeutics to begin a Phase II clinical trial of NurOwn mesenchymal stem cell-neurotrophic factors (MSC-NTF) cells. [BrainStorm] The trial is scheduled to get under way early this year, with an estimated primary completion date of February 2020 and full completion date of September 2020. [clinicaltrials.gov NCT03799718] The Phase II trial will involve 20 people with progressive MS, and will be conducted at multiple locations. [clinicaltrials.gov NCT03799718] Participants mesenchymal stem cells will first be removed from their bone marrow via insertion of a hollow needle. Those cells then will be converted into MSC-NTF cells by growing them under patented conditions that cause the cells to secrete high levels of neurotrophic factors, which are molecules that support the development and differentiation of neurons. [BrainStorm] The MSC-NTF cells will be re-introduced into the patients bodies through three intrathecal cell transplantations over the course of 16 weeks. [clinicaltrials.gov NCT03799718] Autologous (meaning from the patient’s own body) MSC-NTF cells can deliver neurotrophic factors and other immune-modulating molecules directly to the site of damage to elicit a desired biological effect and ultimately slow or stabilize disease, BrainStorm Cell Therapeutics explained in outlining the rationale for the treatment. [BrainStorm] Participants will be followed for 28 weeks after the start of treatment, with researchers monitoring for adverse events. The study will also measure the change from baseline to 28 weeks post-treatment in the participants 25-foot walking speed. Sixteen weeks after treatment, researchers will analyze the participants cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to determine how many individuals had changes in neurotrophic factors in their CSF. [clinicaltrials.gov NCT03799718] In announcing the FDA’s acceptance of its application to conduct a Phase II study, BrainStorm Cell Therapeutics noted, There are currently no FDA-approved autologous cellular therapies addressing MS or other neurological diseases. The company is also conducting a Phase III clinical trial of autologous MSC-NTF cells for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease. [BrainStorm] Late 2019 target date for FDA action on potential new treatment for relapsing-remitting MS The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has set a fourth quarter 2019 target date to act on an application to approve the oral agent diroximel fumarate to treat relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). [Alkermes Feb. 25] In late February, the pharmaceutical companies Alkermes plc and Biogen Inc. announced that the FDA had accepted a new drug application (NDA) for diroximel fumarate. [Alkermes Feb. 25] Biogen currently markets the oral disease-modifying therapy (DMT) dimethyl fumarate in the United States as Tecfidera. Biogen and Alkermes note that diroximel fumarate may have the potential to offer differentiated GI [gastrointestinal] tolerability due to its chemical structure as compared to dimethyl fumarate. [Alkermes Feb. 25] The prescribing information for Tecfidera notes that in clinical trials of the agent, 18% of patients reported abdominal pain, 14% reported diarrhea, 12% said they experienced nausea, and 9% reported vomiting. [Tecfidera PI] The application for FDA approval of diroximel fumarate is based on the results of the Phase III, open-label, two-year safety study EVOLVE-MS-1, along with studies comparing the pharmacologic profiles of diroximel fumarate and dimethyl fumarate. Alkermes is also conducting the EVOLVE-MS-2 study in people with RRMS. That five-week study will compare the GI tolerability of diroximel fumarate with that of dimethyl fumarate. [Alkermes Feb. 25] If the FDA approves diroximel fumarate, Biogen intends to market the oral DMT under the brand name VUMERITY, subject to approval by the FDA, which has conditionally accepted the name. [Alkermes Feb. 25] Biogen studying an extended dosing interval for Tysabri Can stretching out the time between doses of Tysabri (natalizumab) enable people with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) to continue to derive health benefits from the disease-modifying therapy (DMT), while reducing the risk for a rare but serious brain infection, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)? It is a question that MS researchers have been asking since evidence emerged a few years ago that Tysabri was associated with an elevated risk for the viral infection. Since then, individual MS centers and neurologists have adapted extended-dosing intervals and reported their results to Biogen, the company that markets Tysabri. They in turn have used this information to conduct a retrospective analysis of patients receiving extended-interval dosing (EID) vs. those on the FDA-approved standard-interval dose (SID) of 300 mg every four weeks. [Biogen January 3] Now, however, Biogen will be comparing the safety and efficacy of six-week dosing to that of the standard four-week dose in a prospective, randomized study that will enroll approximately 480 people with RRMS. In early January, the company announced that it had enrolled the first patient in the two-year, Phase IIIB study, known as NOVA. The global study will evaluate people who switch to the six-week EID after one year on the four-week SID regimen to those who remain on SID. The primary endpoint will be the number of new or newly enlarging T2-hyperintense lesions seen on MRI at 48 weeks of treatment. [Biogen January 3] Biogen initiated the NOVA study after its retrospective analyses showed that EID was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of PML, the company noted. More than 190,000 people worldwide have been treated with Tysabri. [Biogen January 3] An analysis of pooled data from more than 37,000 patients participating in four large clinical trials found that fewer than 1% overall had developed PML. [Ho] However, among those who had an antibody known as the anti-John Cunningham virus (anti-JCV) antibody, the estimated cumulative probability of having PML over the course of six years of Tysabri treatment was 2.7% in those who had used an immunosuppressant agent before Tysabri and 1.7% in those who had not received an immunosuppressant previously. [Ho] The NOVA study may generate valuable data that we hope will answer questions for the scientific community about the efficacy of nataliuzumab when its dosing schedule is extended to every six weeks, and in conjunction with prior safety analyses, may inform on the drug’s benefit-risk profile, noted Alfred Sandrock, MD, PhD, Biogen’s executive vice president and chief medical officer. [Biogen January 3] Use of a disease-modifying therapy (DMT) early in pregnancy does not appear to be associated with a significant risk of miscarriage, preterm delivery, poor fetal growth, or other adverse pregnancy outcomes. That’s the conclusion of a database analysis that evaluated 984,058 pregnancies occurring between 2011 and 2015, including 1,649 pregnancies to women with MS. Thirty-five percent of the women with MS filled a DMT prescription within 90 days before pregnancy. Researchers concluded, Pregnancies with and without early DMT exposure had similar risks of outcomes to one another and to pregnancies in women without MS. [MacDonald 2019] Please note that while these findings are encouraging, women who are pregnant or are planning to become pregnant while taking a DMT are advised to consult with their physician. Rituxan and no evidence of disease activity (NEDA) in pediatric-onset MS Rituxan (rituximab) is a monoclonal antibody approved by the FDA to treat rheumatoid arthritis, forms of lymphoma and leukemia, and other conditions. Although it is not approved for use in multiple sclerosis (MS), some neurologists use it off-label to treat their adult MS patients. Now, a chart review of pediatric-onset MS (POMS) patients treated with Rituxan at Texas Children’s Hospital suggests that the agent is effective in younger people. The analysis examined data on 17 patients who ranged in age from 13 years to 22 years at the time of the chart review. All had undergone magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) six months or longer after starting Rituxan. Their mean age was 18 years, and their mean disease duration was 41 months (close to three and a half years). Four of the study subjects received Rituxan as their first disease-modifying therapy. Nine switched to Rituxan from another DMT because of disease progression, while another four switched to Rituxan after experiencing side effects on an earlier DMT. [Shukla ACTRIMS 2019] The review found that 82% (14 of 17) of those young patients had no evidence of disease activity (NEDA) as measured by absence of new T2 or contrast-enhancing lesions on MRI, absence of relapses, and absence of increased post-treatment disability. [Shukla ACTRIMS 2019] While acknowledging that the retrospective nature of the analysis and the small number of patients involved were study limitations, the authors nonetheless noted that our data supports the use of rituximab in POMS and suggests high rates of NEDA in this population. [Shukla ACTRIMS 2019] Can reducing children’s weight reduce their risk for MS later in life? Clinicians long have noted that many people with multiple sclerosis (MS) were overweight as children, but the complex nature of MS makes establishing a cause-and-effect relationship difficult. Now, however, a team of Canadian and British researchers has found genetic support for childhood obesity playing a role in the development of MS. Those researchers conducted a genome-wide association study involving 14,802 people with MS and 26,703 controls. They identified 22 genetic variants strongly associated with childhood body mass index (BMI) and examined the effect that each variant had on MS. [Harroud 2019] One key finding: a one-standard deviation (SD) increase in childhood BMI increased the risk of developing MS by 29%. [Harroud 2019] The researchers noted, These findings suggest that targeting childhood obesity may be an effective strategy to reduce MS incidence. [Harroud 2019] Exploring the link between pediatric MS and a family history of autoimmune disorders Children and adolescents with multiple sclerosis (MS) are more than twice as likely as other young people to have a close relative with an autoimmune disorder. [Greenberg ACTRIMS] That finding emerged from an ongoing, multi-center study of risk factors for pediatric MS. The study, which began in 2011, compares the medical data, biologic specimens, and family history of children and adolescents with MS with that of their peers unaffected by the condition. After adjusting for variables such as sex, race, age, and ethnicity, the analysis identified family history of autoimmune disease as a factor associated with an increased risk for developing MS before adulthood. [Greenberg ACTRIMS] The odds of a pediatric MS patient having either a first- or second-degree relative with an autoimmune condition were 2.27 times that of a young person without MS, according to researchers. They noted that the differences between young people with MS and healthy controls were most marked when there was a family history of diabetes, thyroid disorders, or rheumatoid arthritis. Conversely, no difference in risk was observed when a family member had eczema or psoriasis. [Greenberg ACTRIMS] Researchers also found that the odds of autoimmune disease among family members was significantly higher on the father’s side of a young person’s family compared to the mother’s side. The investigators noted that this increased prevalence of certain autoimmune disorders in close relatives of pediatric MS patients aligns with prior findings among adult populations. [Greenberg ACTRIMS] As investigators continue to explore how genetics and immunologic function contribute to the development of MS in children and teenagers, this study adds another piece to a complex puzzle. The “economic complications” of MS: unemployment and underemployment Unemployment and underemployment are common among people with multiple sclerosis (MS), with fatigue being a major obstacle to workplace participation and productivity. That’s one of the early insights from ongoing research being conducted by the North American Registry for Care and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (NARCRMS). [Rammohan ACTRIMS 2019] The Registry collects a wide range of information on people with MS, and uses that information to examine issues such as the economic impact of MS. An early analysis of data from 212 NARCRMS patients found that 31% either were unemployed or underemployed. Among those who were employed, almost one-third said that MS affected their work, with fatigue being the leading issue cited. The economic impact of identifying an effective treatment for this disabling symptom of MS cannot be overstated, the study’s authors noted. [Rammohan ACTRIMS 2019] Assessing the extent and impact of “stem cell tourism” “Stem cell tourism” is the latest manifestation of a trend as old as the disease itself offering unproven therapies to desperate patients. The phenomenon is increasingly prevalent in multiple sclerosis (MS) and other neurologic diseases, according to a team of researchers from Ohio State University. Those investigators recently surveyed academic neurologists across America, and found that 65% had at least one patient who had received unproven cellular preparations. [Rai ACTRIMS 2019] It should be noted that patients receiving such preparation without their physician’s knowledge or against their physician’s advice is entirely different from participating in a stem cell clinical trial that has been carefully designed, approved by hospital officials, registered on clinicaltrials.gov, and meets rigorous ethical, safety, and monitoring standards. [Rai ACTRIMS 2019] The academic neurologists reported that 33% of their patients had received unproven “stem cell therapies” in the United States, 22% had received their treatment abroad, and 37% had received preparations in both the United States and abroad. Overseas destinations included China, Germany, Mexico, the Bahamas, Russia, and Costa Rica. [Rai ACTRIMS 2019] Three-quarters of the survey respondents said their patients did not report complications from receiving these unproven preparations. However, among the 25% whose patients did report adverse effects, complications included stroke, meningoencephalitis, quadriparesis, sepsis, hepatitis C, seizures, and infections. At least three respondents had patients who died following these procedures. [Rai ACTRIMS 2019] The authors said that the complications of these unproven approaches and the overall negative impact on people with MS underscore the need for a comprehensive education campaign to prevent the exploitation of individuals with MS.

This mirrors the frequency of seen in other studies of people with MS. Those who developed primary-progressive MS were more likely to be men, were significantly older, and were more likely to have MS-like lesions in the spinal cord compared to those who went on to develop clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) or relapsing-remitting MS. This study provides a rare glimpse of a very early stage of disease even before progression begins, and provides additional evidence of the value of research into radiologically isolated syndrome. Finding a way to identify and track primary-progressive MS earlier may help to improve access to care for those who have it. The team (Dr. Orhun Kantarci, Mayo Clinic and Foundation, and national and international collaborators) published their findings in (). can be challenging, and it often happens in stages. The term “clinically isolated syndrome” (CIS) is used to describe a first episode of neurologic symptoms  that lasts at least 24 hours and is caused by inflammation and demyelination in one or more sites in the brain and spinal cord. Individuals who experience a CIS may or may not go on to develop definite MS. However, clinical trials of specific disease-modifying therapies have led to approvals for their use to treat CIS.   Some people have specific, “clinically silent” lesions (areas of inflamed or damaged tissue) on MRI, meaning that they are experiencing no symptoms and only have imaging findings. There has been growing research on this phenomenon, called “radiologically isolated syndrome (RIS),” which like CIS may or may not go on to develop into definite MS. There is debate as to whether people with RIS would benefit from early treatment with disease-modifying therapies.   is a relatively rare form of MS, with about 10% of all people with MS receiving this diagnosis. It is characterized by steady worsening of neurologic functioning, without any distinct relapses (also called attacks or exacerbations) or periods of remission.    This team examined data from 453 people with RIS collected from 22 investigators in five countries; a database of 210 people with MS in Olmsted County, Minnesota; and a cohort of 754 people with progressive MS.    Of the 453 people with RIS, 128 (28%) went on to develop a first neurological event consistent with CIS or relapsing MS. Of these, 15 (11.7%) developed primary-progressive MS. Those who developed primary-progressive MS were more commonly men, and older at diagnosis by approximately 10 years, than the 113 people who developed CIS/MS. The frequency of primary-progressive MS and age comparisons were similar to those identified in other groups of MS. Of the 15 who went on to develop primary-progressive MS, 12 had MRI scans of the spinal cord, and all 12 had lesions in the spinal cord, compared with 64% of those who developed CIS/MS.    The team (Dr. Orhun Kantarci, Mayo Clinic and Foundation, and national and international collaborators) published their findings in ().   This study provides a rare glimpse of a very early stage of disease even before progression begins, and provides additional evidence of the value of research into radiologically isolated syndrome.

e5f20083-ab02-4f86-9c3d-e88ce0c81c57,"Complementary & Alternative Medicines Find Programs & Services in Your Area COVID-19 Vaccine Guidance for People Living with MS     Preliminary Results from Phase 2 Clinical Trial of Sex Hormone Estriol in Women with MS Show Interes Preliminary Results from Phase 2 Clinical Trial of Sex Hormone Estriol in Women with MS Show Interesting Results that Call for Further Study Early results from a Phase 2 clinical trial that tested the ability of the sex hormone estriol (TrimestaTM, Synthetic Biologics), in combination with Copaxone® (glatiramer acetate, Teva Neuroscience), in women with relapsing-remitting MS offer valuable insights  which invite further study of this hormone as a potential approach for treating women with multiple sclerosis. Lead investigator Rhonda Voskuhl, MD (University of California, Los Angeles) and colleagues reported these findings today at the Annual Meeting of the American Academy of Neurology. This study was funded by the National MS Society, additional private donors, and the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. Synthetic Biologics, a Maryland pharmaceutical company, provided the estriol for the trial at no charge. MS affects women two to three times as often as men. This demographic observation along with a series of other gender differences prompted the National MS Society to launch a special five-year, $10 million research initiative to explore the importance of the meaning behind these observations as they apply to the MS disease process. Among the findings from the 50 projects supported through this initiative was the possibility that the female hormone estriol may help protect against the immune attacks that underlie MS. Read more about this success. Estriol levels naturally rise significantly during later pregnancy, a time when many women’s MS disease activity declines. This led some to suspect that estriol may be responsible for this easing of symptoms during pregnancy. Dr. Voskuhl and others explored this lead in mice with an MS-like disease. Later, with National MS Society support, Dr. Voskuhl conducted a small, early-phase trial of estriol in 12 women with relapsing-remitting MS. Results suggested that estriol might decrease disease activity. The phase 2 study of estriol combined with Copaxone that was reported today was a direct result of this initiative. Phase 2 trials such as this one are designed to provide information about a therapy’s safety and potential effectiveness, but longer, larger Phase 3 studies are needed to confirm potential benefits and risks and to gain approval from drug regulators such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Estriol is one of several estrogen sex hormones in the body. Some forms of estrogen are available for prescription as methods of birth control and for the treatment of symptoms associated with menopause. Estriol has been used in Europe and Asia as a treatment for symptoms of menopause. The oral form of estriol used in this trial is not available in the United States. Investigators recruited 164 women with relapsing-remitting MS between the ages of 18-50 at 16 sites across the U.S. All participants were on standard Copaxone therapy (injected daily under the skin) and were randomly assigned to also take estriol in pill form, or inactive placebo, for two years. The primary outcome measured was the effects of the treatment combination on relapse rates. Secondary outcomes included several clinical and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), measures of disability progression and cognitive function. There were also  laboratory and gynecological tests built into the study to monitor for potential safety issues associated with the use of estriol and other estrogen hormones, including breast and endometrial (uterine) cancers. The preliminary results showed that the combination of Copaxone and estriol appeared safe over the two-year trial period, and there were no severe adverse events experienced by those in either treatment group. After the first year of the study, those on the combined therapy had a significant reduction in relapse rates compared to those on Copaxone plus placebo, and secondary cognitive testing suggested possible benefit for those on the combined treatment. However, after the second year of the study, there was no statistical difference in relapse rates between those on Copaxone combined with estriol versus those on Copaxone combined with placebo. Since these are preliminary results that were presented at a medical meeting, without peer review as of yet, we are likely to learn more about the significance and implications of the study’s results when the full findings are published in a peer-reviewed medical journal. “These preliminary results are intriguing and invite further research,” noted Timothy Coetzee, PhD, Chief Advocacy, Services, and Research Officer of the National MS Society. “We look forward to seeing the full data when it is published in a medical journal, which should help determine next best steps for the possible development of estriol as a potential therapy for women with MS.”   Multiple sclerosis is an unpredictable, often disabling . range from numbness and tingling to blindness and paralysis, and there is currently no cure for MS.

1720eefe-971c-4cae-ad82-e42dd6ebcd75,"Antidepressant Shows Potential as Treatment for Progressive MS — Research that used a systematic screening of generic drugs showed clomipramine as a promising therapy for progressive multiple sclerosis. While people with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) are getting assistance from successful studies and new treatments, those with progressive MS may feel they’re less likely to find help. But a new out of Canada has made two major discoveries to help end this pattern. The first is a clinical way to measure currently approved oral generic drugs that benefit people with MS in a timely manner. The second is to further study the benefits of the antidepressant clomipramine as a potential therapy for progressive MS. According to the study, in order to successfully treat progressive MS, the treatment should simultaneously target three MS disease drivers. These drivers include iron-mediated neurotoxicity, lymphocyte activity, and oxidative stress. The study looked at generic, orally available medicines that target the three drivers of progressive MS. A successful drug must be able to cross the blood-brain barrier and have a positive effect on all three disease drivers. Out of the initial 1,040 drugs tested, 249 were able to cross this barrier. Of these, 35 prevented iron-mediated neurotoxicity in culture. This list was further narrowed down based on how the drugs managed the remaining two disease drivers. Among the semifinalists were several antipsychotics and antidepressants. One antidepressant that stood out was clomipramine. It also showed the ability to inhibit lymphocyte activity. In addition, clomipramine is a well-tolerated antidepressant. Discovered in 1964, clomipramine has been used to treat obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, major depressive disorder, and chronic pain. It’s on the World Health Organization’s Model List of Essential Medicines, considered to be the most effective and safe medicines needed in a health system. Common side effects include constipation, dry mouth, loss of appetite, sleepiness, sexual dysfunction, trouble urinating, and weight gain. It also runs a risk of affecting the liver. This could interfere with some MS disease-modifying therapies. In some cases, the risk of suicide increases, around 25 years of age. The drug may also not be safe during pregnancy. Clomipramine works by reducing inflammation and microglial activation. The human body manages inflammation by activated microglia. These are the immune cells of the central nervous system. The microglia respond to neuronal damage and remove the damaged cells by phagocytosis — a fancy word for a Pac-Man sort of behavior where one cell engulfs another. The study also looked at clomipramine in mice, specifically those with autoimmune encephalomyelitis, which is considered a model for MS. In mice, clomipramine significantly improved the clinical signs of acute and chronic phases of MS. “This is an interesting approach of ‘repurposing’ old drugs for new uses,” explained Dr. Barbara Giesser, professor of clinical neurology at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA and clinical director of the UCLA MS program. “The animal results are very intriguing,” Giesser told Healthline, “and if they are shown to translate into efficacy in human trials, [that] would represent significant advances in treating progressive MS.” Mark Allegretta, PhD, associate vice president of commercial research at the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, did issue a caution. “This is early laboratory research, so there is no immediate consequence yet for people living with MS,” Allegretta told Healthline. But, he added, “this kind of systematic approach to screen based on multiple readouts relevant to progressive MS may lead to a compound with greater efficacy.” “It is always good for people living with MS to communicate with their clinical care professionals,” he advised. “However, clomipramine has not been tested in people with MS, and much more testing is needed to determine if it is safe and efficacious.” Editor’s Note: Caroline Craven is a patient expert living with MS.

Reaching an evidence-based prognosis for personalized treatment of multiple sclerosis , –() Personalized treatment is ideal for multiple sclerosis (MS) owing to the heterogeneity of clinical features, but current knowledge gaps, including validation of biomarkers and treatment algorithms, limit practical implementation. The contemporary approach to personalized MS therapy depends on evidence-based prognostication, an initial treatment choice and evaluation of early treatment responses to identify the need to switch therapy. Prognostication is directed by baseline clinical, environmental and demographic factors, MRI measures and biomarkers that correlate with long-term disability measures. The initial treatment choice should be a shared decision between the patient and physician. In addition to prognosis, this choice must account for patient-related factors, including comorbidities, pregnancy planning, preferences of the patients and their comfort with risk, and drug-related factors, including safety, cost and implications for treatment sequencing. Treatment response has traditionally been assessed on the basis of relapse rate, MRI lesions and disability progression. Larger longitudinal data sets have enabled development of composite outcome measures and more stringent standards for disease control. Biomarkers, including neurofilament light chain, have potential as early surrogate markers of prognosis and treatment response but require further validation. Overall, attainment of personalized treatment for MS is complex but will be refined as new data become available. Personalized treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS) depends on prognostication at baseline, a shared treatment decision between the physician and patient, and early assessment of response to therapy. Prognosis can be evaluated soon after diagnosis on the basis of demographic and environmental factors, clinical features, MRI measures and biomarkers. Individuals with poor prognostic features should be recommended high-efficacy therapies early on; studies are underway to investigate whether most patients with relapsing–remitting MS could benefit from initial aggressive therapy. During the treatment discussion between the neurologist and patient, factors such as comorbidities, pregnancy planning, patient preferences, risk tolerance, safety, cost and treatment sequencing should be considered in addition to prognosis. Early assessment of treatment response is important to identify the need to switch therapy; composite outcome measures that incorporate clinical and MRI data are best for predicting long-term disability. Personalized MS therapy is currently limited by a lack of evidence-based biomarkers; newer biomarkers, such as neurofilament light chain, have potential, but further validation and standardization of assays are required.

ff472639-eb0c-49da-b263-2d3dc45cf43c,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is considered an essential tool in the diagnosis and management of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), mostly due to its high sensitivity to depict white matter lesions and characterize disease dissemination in space and time. However, the standardization of its interpretation in adult patients with MS has not yet been paralleled in the pediatric population. For instance, until recently, the diagnosis of MS in the pediatric population did not include MRI criteria as it does in adults [1–4]. This is despite the fact that MRI has been studied for more than 20 years in the diagnosis of MS in pediatric patients [5]. Similarly, the operational definitions for pediatric-onset MS [6] that aim at creating a uniform terminology to be used in future prospective studies rely on the adult MRI criteria, not specific pediatric ones (see Chapter 2). MS in children has several characteristic features, including an almost exclusive relapsing–remitting course of disease [7,8] with more frequent relapses and seizures [9]. Involved anatomical regions differ somewhat in children and adults, with children showing more frequent involvement of the posterior fossa, and less frequent involvement of the spinal cord, although this remains to be confirmed [10]. These particularities raise questions about the ability to use the same diagnostic criteria in the children and adults with MS, especially in prepubertal patients in whom the clinical, biological, and radiological presentation seem to be distinct [11–13].

Central nervous system-infiltrating immune cells in multiple sclerosis also possess a neuroprotective activity through secretion of neurotrophins, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor. Fingolimod was shown to slow the progression of disability and loss of brain volume. The objective of this study was to explore whether fingolimod induces secretion of neurotrophins by immune cells. Blood was drawn from 21 patients before the initiation of treatment with fingolimod and at 6 and 12 months of follow-up. The levels of the neurotrophic factors brain-derived neurotrophic factor, glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor, β-nerve growth factor, neurotrophin-3, neurotrophin-4, basic fibroblast growth factor, epidermal growth factor, and vascular endothelial growth factor were screened in the supernatants of separated T cells and monocyte cultures using a customized, multiplex enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels were further validated by a specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Treatment with fingolimod significantly increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor secretion from T cells. A specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay confirmed these results in the supernatant of T cells after 6 and 12 months of therapy. T cells that reach the bloodstream of fingolimod-treated patients with multiple sclerosis may contribute to the neuroprotective effect of this therapy by increased secretion of brain-derived neurotrophic factor. This mechanism of action of fingolimod in patients with multiple sclerosis has not been previously reported. This is a preview of subscription content, .

989f887f-2454-437a-bbeb-749abb921d96,"The FDA has approved Vumerity, a new drug to treat relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. Experts say Vumerity is effective and has fewer side effects than current medications. Biogen has set the annual price of Vumerity at $88,000, drawing criticism from the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. Biogen has released the annual price it will charge for a new oral treatment for relapsing forms of . The company said the price for Vumerity will be $88,000 per year. The company sent a statement to Healthline saying it is taking steps to make sure the drug is affordable for customers. “Biogen will work to maximize patient access to Vumerity through their insurance benefits, including potential value-based agreements with payers based on real-world patient outcomes,” the statement read. Biogen and Alkermes plc the approval of by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in late October, making it the 18th FDA-approved treatment for multiple sclerosis (MS). The announced price tag brought quick criticism from the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. “Vumerity is an efficacious and tolerable treatment option for people with relapsing MS, but being priced only $500 lower than the least expensive oral disease modifying treatment does not show the commitment to affordable access that we had hoped,” Bari Talente, executive vice president, advocacy, National MS Society, said in a . She noted the price of Tecfidera, another Biogen treatment for MS, has risen $40,000 to almost $95,000 since it debuted in 2013. “We urge Biogen to publicly commit to keeping price increases lower than the rate of inflation,” Talente said. Vumerity is expected to be similar in results to but with fewer side effects. “Both drugs use a unique mechanism of action that is not offered by other treatments,” , a nurse practitioner at the Johns Hopkins Multiple Sclerosis Center in Maryland and the vice president of healthcare access for , told Healthline. Past has shown that Tecfidera has success on multiple sclerosis with a 53 percent reduction of relapses, 38 percent reduction in the likelihood of disability progression, and 90 percent reduction on active contrast MRI lesions. However, “Tecfidera has bad side effects, especially in the beginning,” noted Costello. “Vumerity is different and has less gastrointestinal problems.” Costello explained that people with uncomfortable side effects may not adhere to a treatment. Considered a follow-up drug to Tecfidera, doctors predict better adherence with Vumerity due to the fewer side effects. The active ingredient in Vumerity is diroximel fumarate, which is rapidly converted to monomethyl fumarate in the body. Tecfidera is a dimethyl fumarate and also converts to monomethyl fumarate. “[The drugs] become identical in what they do in the body. But, how they get there is different,” explained Costello. “We expect Vumerity to provide the same benefits as Tecfidera, but we are waiting [on] results,” , neurologist at Missouri Baptist Medical Center in St. Louis, a trial site for the EVOLVE-MS study, told Healthline. Singer is also the director and founder of . “The research I presented at ECTRIMS in September 2019 showed approximately 30 percent of those on Vumerity had gastrointestinal side effects but less than 1 percent discontinue due to this side effect,” Singer told Healthline. “The full results from the EVOLVE-MS trials are pending.” Vumerity is approved for clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), relapsing-remitting MS, and active secondary progressive MS. It’s not approved for primary progressive or secondary progressive MS that’s not active. But, “it may work for other forms of MS,” said Costello. “We want the DMTs to be a positive experience,” Singer said. “Vumerity provides another option for MS.” The drug’s warning label does include progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) as a possible risk. Flushing and stomach problems are the most common reactions, especially at the start of therapy. Gastrointestinal issues are common but not to the extent with Tecfidera. Other warnings are allergies, liver damage, and low white blood cell count. “There are very rare cases of PML with Tecfidera in MS patients with very low lymphocytes (white blood cell type) for numerous months in patients over age 50. Simple blood counts should be done to monitor,” said Singer. “The goal with Vumerity is to achieve success of Tecfidera with better tolerability,” explained Singer. Biogen offers customer-assisted programs to help reduce or eliminate costs. Costello explained that both Tecfidera and Vumerity have a unique mechanism of action, unlike any other drug. This provides people with options and different ways to reduce inflammation with MS. Treatment choices are up to doctors and their patients making a shared decision. Costello suggests talking about goals, risk tolerance, monitoring, and your ability to adhere to a specific treatment. “The disease, plus the person’s goals and values, is the conversation that drives the medication choice,” said Costello.

Relapsing forms of MS  includes people with  (an initial episode of neurological symptoms), , and active . People with active secondary progressive MS have had progression of disability but still experience acute relapses or new MRI activity. Vumerity is similar to dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera, Biogen) but has a distinct chemical structure that has been shown to have fewer reported gastrointestinal side effects than Tecfidera. This approval provides another treatment option for people living with relapsing forms of MS and specifically includes people with secondary progressive MS who are continuing to experience active disease.   “We are pleased that there is a new oral treatment option for people with relapsing MS,” said Kathy Costello, MS, ANP-BC, MSCN, Associate Vice President of Healthcare Access at the National MS Society.    (.pdf)  (.pdf) DETAILS The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved Vumerity™ (diroximel fumarate, Biogen and Alkermes plc) as a disease-modifying therapy for people with relapsing forms of MS, including  (an initial neurological episode), , and active . People with active secondary progressive MS have had progression of disability but still experience acute relapses or new MRI activity.   Multiple sclerosis involves immune system attacks that cause inflammation and damage in the brain and spinal cord tissues. Vumerity is similar to Tecfidera but has a distinct chemical structure that has been shown to be better tolerated, with fewer reported gastrointestinal side effects than Tecfidera. Once in the body, Vumerity rapidly converts to the same active ingredient as Tecfidera. Because of the bio-equivalence to Tecfidera, it was not necessary for Vumerity to undergo extensive clinical trials to demonstrate benefits for relapsing MS. Although their exact mechanisms of action are not known, Vumerity and Tecfidera are thought to modulate the immune response to be less inflammatory and may have antioxidant properties that could be protective against damage to the brain and spinal cord.   Biogen Inc. and Alkermes plc announced top-line results of a five-week, Phase III study that compared gastrointestinal side effects and tolerability of Vumerity and Tecfidera. According to a press release, diroximel fumarate was better tolerated and had significantly fewer reported gastrointestinal symptoms compared to Tecfidera. The most common adverse events for both treatment groups were flushing, diarrhea and nausea. Rates of these events were significantly lower for the diroximel fumarate group, and fewer people on diroximel fumarate dropped out of the study due to side effects.   The approval of Vumerity is based largely on the FDA’s findings of safety and efficacy for Tecfidera. Twice-daily Tecfidera was shown in clinical trials to significantly reduce relapses and disease activity on MRIs, and in one trial it reduced progression of disability. The Tecfidera approval was based on results of two large-scale phase III studies, called DEFINE and CONFIRM, which were conducted in people with relapsing-remitting MS. The results were published in 2012.   Like Tecfidera, Vumerity may cause serious side effects including: allergic reaction (such as welts, hives, or difficulty breathing); PML (progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy - a rare brain infection that can lead to death or severe disability over a period of weeks or months); decreases in white blood cell count, and liver problems.   The most common side effects of Vumerity include: flushing, redness, itching, or rash; nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach pain, or indigestion. Flushing and stomach problems are the most common reactions, especially at the start of therapy, and may decrease over time. Taking Vumerity with food (avoid high-fat, high-calorie meal or snack) may help reduce flushing. The (.pdf)provides full information on potential side effects.   Before starting treatment, the FDA recommends that a person’s health care provider assess a recent (within 6 months) blood cell count, and repeat the blood cell count every 6 to 12 months thereafter. Providers should test liver function before starting treatment, and during treatment if clinically indicated. Vumerity is not recommended for people with moderate to severe impairment of kidney function. Before treatment with Vumerity, women should talk to their health care providers if they are pregnant or planning to become pregnant. There are no adequate data on the developmental risk associated with the use of Vumerity in pregnant women.   Taking a disease-modifying therapy is currently the best way to reduce MS disease activity and future deterioration. Selecting an MS therapy should be done by people with MS in collaboration with their MS healthcare provider, taking into account a variety of factors, including the effectiveness of any therapy they are currently using, and weighing potential risks and benefits, costs and lifestyle factors.   For more information about support services provided by Biogen, people can contact the company’s Above MS program at www.AboveMS.com.     (.pdf)  (.pdf) Read more about disease-modifying therapies and other treatments for MS and MS symptoms.   Tecfidera is a registered trademark of Biogen.

What types of MS is Vumerity approved to treat? A. The FDA has approved Vumerity for the treatment of relapsing forms of MS, including  (an initial neurological episode), , and active . People with active secondary progressive MS have had progression of disability but still experience acute relapses or new MRI activity.  A. The capsules are taken orally twice per day. When Vumerity is begun, individuals will be provided with a one-week starter dose, and thereafter a maintenance dose, both taken twice daily.  Q. What are the potential side effects of Vumerity? A. Vumerity may cause serious side effects including: allergic reaction (such as welts, hives, or difficulty breathing); PML (progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy -- a rare brain infection that usually leads to death or severe disability over a period of weeks or months); decreases in white blood cell count, and liver problems. The most common side effects of Vumerity include flushing, redness, itching, or rash; nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach pain, or indigestion. Flushing and stomach problems are the most common reactions, especially at the start of therapy, and may decrease over time. Taking Vumerity with food (avoid high-fat, high-calorie meal or snack) may help reduce flushing. The (.pdf) provides full information on potential side effects.  Q. Why should a person with MS consider taking a disease-modifying therapy? A. Taking a disease-modifying therapy is currently the best way to reduce MS disease activity and future deterioration. Studies comparing people in clinical trials who started therapy earlier than those on inactive placebo suggest that early treatment offered important benefits against the accumulation of disability, which were generally not experienced to the same degree by those who started treatment later.  Selecting an MS therapy should be done by people with MS in collaboration with their MS healthcare provider, taking into account a variety of factors, including the effectiveness of any therapy they are currently using, and weighing potential risks and benefits, costs and lifestyle factors.  Q. Should I switch from my current therapy to Vumerity? A. The decision about whether to take Vumerity should be made in collaboration with your MS doctor, taking into account a variety of factors including the effectiveness of any therapy you are currently using, the potential risks and benefits, as well as costs and lifestyle factors. Important questions to be considered and discussed with your doctor in terms of Vumerity include: What is my tolerance for the risk of known side effects? What is my tolerance for the risk of adverse consequences that might emerge with longer-term use? How will my medication choice affect my ability or plans to become pregnant? What are the comparative costs of my current therapy versus Vumerity?  A. There is no specified time limit for taking Vumerity. Q. Are there any risk factors or medical conditions that would make it inappropriate for an individual to take Vumerity? A. Vumerity is not recommended for people with moderate to severe impairment of kidney function. Before treatment with Vumerity, women should talk to their health care providers if they are pregnant or planning to become pregnant. There are no adequate data on the developmental risk associated with the use of Vumerity in pregnant women. Q. Will a person taking Vumerity have to get any special medical tests or monitoring? A. Before starting treatment, the FDA recommends that a person’s health care provider assess a recent (within 6 months) blood cell count, and repeat the blood cell count every 6 to 12 months thereafter. Providers should test liver function before starting treatment and during treatment if needed.  A.The yearly cost of Vumerity was announced to be $88,000wholesale acquisition cost (WAC). The actual cost to an individual who has MS will depend on the provisions of his or her insurance coverage and the degree to which that individual will be eligible for programs designed to assist with out-of-pocket costs. Q. What is the Society's view of the cost of Vumerity? A. “Vumerity is an efficacious and tolerable treatment option for people with relapsing MS, but being priced only $500 lower than the least expensive oral disease modifying treatment, does not show the commitment to affordable access that we had hoped,” said Bari Talente, Executive Vice President, Advocacy, National MS Society.  “We know that high wholesale acquisition cost (WAC) prices for MS disease modifying treatments put a heavy burden on people with MS. Too many are forced to take on high out-of-pocket costs, navigate through complex systems, and face varied and unpredictable decisions by public and private payers and pharmacy benefit managers.   A.Coverage will depend on individual insurance plans.   A. No.  Q. Where can I get information about the patient support that Biogen plans to provide? A. For more information about support services provided by Biogen, people can contact the company’s Above MS program at www.AboveMS.com.  Q. Is Vumerity being tested in primary progressive MS or non-active secondary-progressive MS? A. Not at this time.   Multiple sclerosis is an unpredictable, often disabling . range from numbness and tingling to blindness and paralysis, and there is currently no cure for MS. The progress, severity and specific symptoms of MS in any one person cannot yet be predicted, but advances in and are leading to better understanding and moving us closer to . An estimated 1 million people live with MS in the United States. Most are diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 50, and it affects women three times more than men. © 2020 The National Multiple Sclerosis Society is a tax exempt 501(c)3 nonprofit organization.

This approval provides another treatment option for people living with relapsing forms of MS and specifically includes people with secondary progressive MS who are continuing to experience active disease.   “We are pleased that there is a new oral treatment option for people with relapsing MS,” said Kathy Costello, MS, ANP-BC, MSCN, Associate Vice President of Healthcare Access at the National MS Society.    (.pdf)  (.pdf) DETAILS The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved Vumerity™ (diroximel fumarate, Biogen and Alkermes plc) as a disease-modifying therapy for people with relapsing forms of MS, including  (an initial neurological episode), , and active . People with active secondary progressive MS have had progression of disability but still experience acute relapses or new MRI activity.   Multiple sclerosis involves immune system attacks that cause inflammation and damage in the brain and spinal cord tissues. Vumerity is similar to Tecfidera but has a distinct chemical structure that has been shown to be better tolerated, with fewer reported gastrointestinal side effects than Tecfidera. Once in the body, Vumerity rapidly converts to the same active ingredient as Tecfidera. Because of the bio-equivalence to Tecfidera, it was not necessary for Vumerity to undergo extensive clinical trials to demonstrate benefits for relapsing MS. Although their exact mechanisms of action are not known, Vumerity and Tecfidera are thought to modulate the immune response to be less inflammatory and may have antioxidant properties that could be protective against damage to the brain and spinal cord.   Biogen Inc. and Alkermes plc announced top-line results of a five-week, Phase III study that compared gastrointestinal side effects and tolerability of Vumerity and Tecfidera. According to a press release, diroximel fumarate was better tolerated and had significantly fewer reported gastrointestinal symptoms compared to Tecfidera. The most common adverse events for both treatment groups were flushing, diarrhea and nausea. Rates of these events were significantly lower for the diroximel fumarate group, and fewer people on diroximel fumarate dropped out of the study due to side effects.   The approval of Vumerity is based largely on the FDA’s findings of safety and efficacy for Tecfidera. Twice-daily Tecfidera was shown in clinical trials to significantly reduce relapses and disease activity on MRIs, and in one trial it reduced progression of disability. The Tecfidera approval was based on results of two large-scale phase III studies, called DEFINE and CONFIRM, which were conducted in people with relapsing-remitting MS. The results were published in 2012.   Like Tecfidera, Vumerity may cause serious side effects including: allergic reaction (such as welts, hives, or difficulty breathing); PML (progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy - a rare brain infection that can lead to death or severe disability over a period of weeks or months); decreases in white blood cell count, and liver problems.   The most common side effects of Vumerity include: flushing, redness, itching, or rash; nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach pain, or indigestion. Flushing and stomach problems are the most common reactions, especially at the start of therapy, and may decrease over time. Taking Vumerity with food (avoid high-fat, high-calorie meal or snack) may help reduce flushing. The (.pdf)provides full information on potential side effects.   Before starting treatment, the FDA recommends that a person’s health care provider assess a recent (within 6 months) blood cell count, and repeat the blood cell count every 6 to 12 months thereafter. Providers should test liver function before starting treatment, and during treatment if clinically indicated. Vumerity is not recommended for people with moderate to severe impairment of kidney function. Before treatment with Vumerity, women should talk to their health care providers if they are pregnant or planning to become pregnant. There are no adequate data on the developmental risk associated with the use of Vumerity in pregnant women.   Taking a disease-modifying therapy is currently the best way to reduce MS disease activity and future deterioration. Selecting an MS therapy should be done by people with MS in collaboration with their MS healthcare provider, taking into account a variety of factors, including the effectiveness of any therapy they are currently using, and weighing potential risks and benefits, costs and lifestyle factors.   For more information about support services provided by Biogen, people can contact the company’s Above MS program at www.AboveMS.com.     (.pdf)  (.pdf) Read more about disease-modifying therapies and other treatments for MS and MS symptoms.   Tecfidera is a registered trademark of Biogen.

What types of MS is Vumerity approved to treat? A. The FDA has approved Vumerity for the treatment of relapsing forms of MS, including  (an initial neurological episode), , and active . People with active secondary progressive MS have had progression of disability but still experience acute relapses or new MRI activity.  A. The capsules are taken orally twice per day. When Vumerity is begun, individuals will be provided with a one-week starter dose, and thereafter a maintenance dose, both taken twice daily.  Q. What are the potential side effects of Vumerity? A. Vumerity may cause serious side effects including: allergic reaction (such as welts, hives, or difficulty breathing); PML (progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy -- a rare brain infection that usually leads to death or severe disability over a period of weeks or months); decreases in white blood cell count, and liver problems. The most common side effects of Vumerity include flushing, redness, itching, or rash; nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach pain, or indigestion. Flushing and stomach problems are the most common reactions, especially at the start of therapy, and may decrease over time. Taking Vumerity with food (avoid high-fat, high-calorie meal or snack) may help reduce flushing. The (.pdf) provides full information on potential side effects.  Q. Why should a person with MS consider taking a disease-modifying therapy? A. Taking a disease-modifying therapy is currently the best way to reduce MS disease activity and future deterioration. Studies comparing people in clinical trials who started therapy earlier than those on inactive placebo suggest that early treatment offered important benefits against the accumulation of disability, which were generally not experienced to the same degree by those who started treatment later.  Selecting an MS therapy should be done by people with MS in collaboration with their MS healthcare provider, taking into account a variety of factors, including the effectiveness of any therapy they are currently using, and weighing potential risks and benefits, costs and lifestyle factors.  Q. Should I switch from my current therapy to Vumerity? A. The decision about whether to take Vumerity should be made in collaboration with your MS doctor, taking into account a variety of factors including the effectiveness of any therapy you are currently using, the potential risks and benefits, as well as costs and lifestyle factors. Important questions to be considered and discussed with your doctor in terms of Vumerity include: What is my tolerance for the risk of known side effects? What is my tolerance for the risk of adverse consequences that might emerge with longer-term use? How will my medication choice affect my ability or plans to become pregnant? What are the comparative costs of my current therapy versus Vumerity?  A. There is no specified time limit for taking Vumerity. Q. Are there any risk factors or medical conditions that would make it inappropriate for an individual to take Vumerity? A. Vumerity is not recommended for people with moderate to severe impairment of kidney function. Before treatment with Vumerity, women should talk to their health care providers if they are pregnant or planning to become pregnant. There are no adequate data on the developmental risk associated with the use of Vumerity in pregnant women. Q. Will a person taking Vumerity have to get any special medical tests or monitoring? A. Before starting treatment, the FDA recommends that a person’s health care provider assess a recent (within 6 months) blood cell count, and repeat the blood cell count every 6 to 12 months thereafter. Providers should test liver function before starting treatment and during treatment if needed.  A.The yearly cost of Vumerity was announced to be $88,000wholesale acquisition cost (WAC). The actual cost to an individual who has MS will depend on the provisions of his or her insurance coverage and the degree to which that individual will be eligible for programs designed to assist with out-of-pocket costs. Q. What is the Society's view of the cost of Vumerity? A. “Vumerity is an efficacious and tolerable treatment option for people with relapsing MS, but being priced only $500 lower than the least expensive oral disease modifying treatment, does not show the commitment to affordable access that we had hoped,” said Bari Talente, Executive Vice President, Advocacy, National MS Society.  “We know that high wholesale acquisition cost (WAC) prices for MS disease modifying treatments put a heavy burden on people with MS. Too many are forced to take on high out-of-pocket costs, navigate through complex systems, and face varied and unpredictable decisions by public and private payers and pharmacy benefit managers.   A.Coverage will depend on individual insurance plans.   A. No.  Q. Where can I get information about the patient support that Biogen plans to provide? A. For more information about support services provided by Biogen, people can contact the company’s Above MS program at www.AboveMS.com.  Q. Is Vumerity being tested in primary progressive MS or non-active secondary-progressive MS? A. Not at this time.   Multiple sclerosis is an unpredictable, often disabling . range from numbness and tingling to blindness and paralysis, and there is currently no cure for MS. The progress, severity and specific symptoms of MS in any one person cannot yet be predicted, but advances in and are leading to better understanding and moving us closer to . An estimated 1 million people live with MS in the United States. Most are diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 50, and it affects women three times more than men. © 2020 The National Multiple Sclerosis Society is a tax exempt 501(c)3 nonprofit organization.

The results of numerous significant studies were reported at the Annual Meeting of the American Academy of Neurology (AAN), held in Los Angeles in April, and the Annual Meeting of the Consortium of Multiple Sclerosis Centers (CMSC), which took place in Nashville in May. We have summarized some of the most interesting findings from those conferences in this update. Disease-Modifying Therapies in the Research Pipeline The treatment options for people with MS are likely to continue to expand in the years just ahead, as several disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) are in late stages of clinical development and/or are under review by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Five noteworthy studies of such “pipeline” medications are summarized here. Cladribine and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) outcomes Cladribine is an oral medication taken for up to 20 days over a period of two years. It selectively targets the immune system’s B cells and T cells, leading to depletion of those cells followed by a distinct pattern of “reconstitution” as new B cells and T cells are produced. It is approved for use in relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) in several countries, but is not yet approved for use in the United States. In the Phase III CLARITY study, cladribine showed efficacy when compared to placebo over the course of two years of use by people with RRMS. A post-hoc analysis of that study’s data examined the impact of cladribine on a subset of individuals who had high disease activity as measured by relapses, MRI findings, and other characteristics. The analysis found that the effectiveness of cladribine versus placebo in this subpopulation was comparable to that seen in the overall CLARITY population in terms of reducing MRI markers of disease activity. This includes reducing such MRI markers as cumulative new T1 gadolinium-enhancing lesions and cumulative combined unique active lesions. This post-hoc analysis did not focus on safety. However, in the CLARITY study from which this analysis’ MRI data were derived, certain adverse events occurred more frequently in the cladribine groups than in participants receiving placebo. These adverse events included lymphocytopenia (21.6 percent in the 3.5-mg cladribine group and 31.5 percent in the 5.25-mg group, versus 1.8 percent in the placebo group), and herpes zoster (eight patients and 12 patients, respectively, versus no patients). As clinicians experience continued progress in treating MS overall, an increasing focus is placed on improving outcomes in people with high disease activity. Studies of this type help provide informed treatment strategies for these individuals. Opicinumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets LINGO-1, a protein in the central nervous system whose role is to halt myelination (repair of the protective covering of the nerves) and prevent the survival of neurons (nerve cells). The SYNERGY trial assessed various doses of opicinumab, given by intravenous infusion, in combination with interferon beta-1a, over the course of 72 weeks in people with relapsing forms of MS (RMS). The results showed a sort of “inverted U” effect with more favorable outcomes in the 10 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg dose groups, indicating that other factors may have been involved in how the participants responded. That finding prompted investigators to explore those factors associated with a better response to opicinumab. Their post-hoc analysis identified three factors associated with better response to the medication: shorter disease duration (less than 20 years); lower baseline magnetization transfer ratio values in T2 lesions, which may signify lower myelin content in those lesions; and lower baseline diffusion tensor imaging-radial diffusivity values in T2 lesions, a characteristic that may be consistent with greater structural integrity. Practicing “precision medicine” involves identifying those factors that enable clinicians to give the right medication to the right patient at the right time. As this study shows, that effort may entail drawing on highly technical, and possibly even less understood, biomedical characteristics and concepts in the service of individualizing care. Ublituximab and central nervous system lesions in relapsing MS Ublituximab is a monoclonal antibody given by infusion. Like Ocrevus, ublituximab targets the CD20 molecule. Researchers evaluated 24-week data from a Phase II trial of the medication in people with relapsing forms of MS. Among 31 individuals who had a total of 73 T1 gadolinium-enhancing (Gd+) lesions on MRI at baseline, no T1 Gd+ lesions were found at Week 24. Additionally, T2-lesion volume decreased by 8.1 percent from baseline to Week 24, prompting the authors to conclude that ublituximab has “robust efficacy” on MRI endpoints. Ozanimod is an oral, once-daily medication being evaluated for use in RRMS. It is a selective modulator of two types of S1P receptors: S1P1 and S1P5. Data from two Phase III studies, SUNBEAM and RADIANCE Part B, show that ozanimod, given at 1 mg/daily and 0.5 mg/daily, had favorable outcomes relative to Avonex (interferon beta-1a) – both in terms of annualized relapse rate (ARR) and MRI findings. Annualized relapse rate, or ARR, refers to how many relapses a person in a particular study group is likely to have, on average, over a one-year period. For example, if the placebo group in a clinical study had an ARR of “1,” the average person in that group could expect to have one relapse per year. Ozanimod, given at doses of either 1.0 mg or 0.5 mg, reduced the ARR by 48 percent and 31 percent respectively, compared to interferon beta-1a in the SUNBEAM trial. In these same doses, it also reduced the ARR by 38 percent and 21 percent respectively, compared to interferon beta-1a in the RADIANCE trial. Meanwhile, the adjusted mean number of new or enlarging T2 lesions was reduced by 25 percent to 48 percent in people taking ozanimod versus those receiving interferon beta-1a. Additionally, the individuals taking ozanimod had fewer adverse events overall and fewer adverse events leading to study discontinuation. Siponimod, relapses, and disability progression in secondary-progressive MS Siponimod is an oral medication being studied for use in secondary-progressive MS (SPMS). Its mechanism of action is similar to that of Gilenya (fingolimod), in that it works at the S1P receptor family to block the movement of lymph cells from lymph nodes; however, siponimod appears to interact with fewer of the receptors than Gilenya does – with its primary actions at the S1P1 and the S1P5 receptors, the same receptors that ozanimod targets. The Phase III EXPAND study showed that siponimod reduced confirmed disability progression (CDP). Investigators analyzed the results of that trial to understand to what extent, if any, this effect was related to a reduction in relapses. This information is important to uncover, because it could have implications for the effectiveness of the medication in people who do not experience relapses or who have very infrequent relapses. Using sophisticated statistical analyses, the researchers concluded that, “Siponimod treatment reduces the risk for CDP in both relapsing and non-relapsing SPMS patients. Our analyses suggest that siponimod’s effect on disability is largely independent from the effect on relapses.” Research into the safety and effectiveness of a DMT does not stop when that medication wins approval from the FDA. Several recently reported studies provide ongoing information on approved DMTs or findings from focused analyses of data from those medications’ major Phase III clinical trials. Highlights from several such studies are reported below. Ocrevus (ocrelimzumab) was approved by the FDA in 2017 for RMS and PPMS. The medication is administered by IV infusion, with 600 mg given every six months. The safety and efficacy of Ocrevus were assessed in two large clinical trials, OPERA I and OPERA II, in which individuals with relapsing MS received either Ocrevus or Rebif (interferon beta-1a). At the end of those trials, study participants were allowed to continue on Ocrevus or switch from Rebif to Ocrevus during a so-called “open-label extension” (OLE) period. A recent analysis found that switching from Rebif to Ocrevus at the start of the OLE period was associated with rapid and significant reductions in disease activity as identified on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Patients who changed therapies in the OLE went from having an adjusted number of 0.48 T1 gadolinium-enhancing lesions per scan prior to switching, to an average 0.00 such lesions per scan after one year and two years on Ocrevus. Tysabri (natalizumab) is a monoclonal antibody that is administered by IV infusion of a 300-mg dose every four weeks. The medication was approved for use in adults with relapsing MS in 2004. However, Tysabri was voluntarily withdrawn from the market the next year after three cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a rare but potentially fatal brain infection caused by the JC virus, were identified in individuals taking the medication. Tysabri became available again in 2006, following implementation of a comprehensive risk-management program, which includes testing potential Tysabri users to see if they have anti-JC virus antibodies. Now, a team of New Zealand researchers have reported favorable results with administering Tysabri every six weeks rather than every four weeks, noting that they pursued extended-interval dosing with a view toward reducing the risk of PML. Those investigators report that after administering Tysabri at six-week intervals to 27 patients for an average of two years, none of the participants had lesions on MRI, and only one reported relapse. No participants were diagnosed with PML. This treatment strategy reflects ongoing efforts across the MS treatment spectrum to balance efficacy and safety to the patient’s maximal advantage. Aubagio (teriflunomide) was approved in 2012 for use in relapsing MS. It is an oral medication administered as 7-mg or 14-mg once daily. An analysis of long-term data on patients with relapsing MS who participated in two Phase III trials of the medication and the extensions of those trials found that 74 percent taking the 14-mg dose had stable or improved Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores over five years. Mean EDSS scores at five years were higher (indicating disease progression) in those who experienced a relapse, compared with those who did not – at 2.70 and 2.43 respectively. A separate study examined 169 pregnancies in women who took Aubagio during pregnancy. Based on findings of teratogenicity – an elevated incidence of birth defects – in animal studies, use of the medication is contraindicated in pregnant women and females of reproductive potential not using effective contraception. Nonetheless, some women have taken the medication shortly before conceiving or while pregnant. In this study, the final dose of Aubagio was administered pre-conception or in the first trimester in all but four cases. Outcomes were known for 67 of the 169 pregnancies. Two structural abnormalities were reported: one case of congenital hydrocephalus in a full-term pregnancy and one cystic hygroma (a fluid-filled sac resulting from a blockage in the lymphatic system) detected on ultrasound during pregnancy (with the outcome of that pregnancy unknown). Researchers concluded that the current data from pregnancies exposed to teriflunomide show no warning signs of a treatment-related increased risk for birth defects. Lemtrada (alemtuzumab) is a monoclonal antibody approved for use in RMS in 2014. It is administered by intravenous infusion over four hours for two multi-day treatment courses 12 months apart. Researchers recently analyzed data on 393 individuals who had participated in clinical trials of Lemtrada and then remained on the medication during a longer-term extension study. The researchers found that after using Lemtrada for six years, 77 percent of the more than 300 patients studied showed stable or improved Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores compared to their baseline scores. Additionally, 43 percent achieved a six-month confirmed disability improvement (CDI), further underscoring the long-term benefits of treatment. Another analysis examined outcomes in extension-study patients who received re-treatment with Lemtrada due to disease activity after the initial two courses of therapy. Among 178 participants who received at least one re-treatment, the annualized relapse rate (ARR) fell from 0.85 (12 months before receiving a third course of Lemtrada) to 0.20 (12 months after the third course). The percentage of individuals with a CDI increased from 4 percent to 14 percent over those two time periods. Researchers concluded, “Patients who were re-treated due to relapse and/or MRI activity after the initial two courses demonstrate continued alemtuzumab [Lemtrada] efficacy after [Course 3] with reduced relapses and stable or improved disability.” Glatiramer acetate is an injectable DMT approved for use in relapsing forms of MS. It is available both as a branded medication (Copaxone) and in generic form from two other companies. In a one-year, placebo-controlled study, administering the medication in a dose of 40 mg/mL three-times weekly reduced the annualized relapse rate (ARR) by 34 percent and MRI disease activity by 34.7 percent relative to placebo. A new analysis shows that those benefits were sustained for up to five years in people participating in the open-label phase of the study, which was supported by Teva. The overall ARR during the entire long-term follow-up period was 0.26 for individuals who started on glatiramer acetate in the placebo-controlled phase of the study, and was 0.32 for those who switched from placebo to glatiramer acetate in the open-label phase. Researchers added that the most common adverse events seen over the long term were generally mild and consistent with the medication’s established safety profile. Interferon beta-1b was the first DMT approved for use in MS, and today is available in branded form as Betaseron and Extavia. A 23-year observational follow-up study was conducted with 87 patients treated at the Henry Ford Health System in Detroit. The study found that 29 percent of individuals used the medication for less than one year, while 18 percent remained on therapy for more than 15 years. Of the individuals who stopped treatment, side effects were the reason cited most often in those who discontinued therapy before five years of use, while lack of efficacy was given as the reason for stopping in those who used the medication for longer periods. A stable disease course on a DMT does not predict continued stability after discontinuing that therapy, regardless of a person’s age. Noting that clinicians sometimes recommend stopping DMT therapy as individuals with MS get older, researchers assessed the advisability of this strategy by examining data from the New York State MS Consortium (NYSMSC) database. Of 135 patients who were considered stable on DMT therapy as determined by minimal change in EDSS score, 35.6 percent saw their EDSS score worsen after stopping their DMT. Age did not affect post-discontinuation course, with 34.1 percent of people age 54 years and younger and 37.7 percent of people age 55 years and older recording unfavorable changes in their EDSS scores after going off a DMT. People with MS and their healthcare providers today face a “welcome dilemma” unimaginable even 20 years ago. With more than a dozen disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) now approved by the FDA for use in adults, patients and clinicians have an opportunity (and challenge) to select the medication likely to best address the each individual’s specific health status and needs. That can be a daunting prospect, particularly because few clinical trials have directly compared one agent with another. Given the scarcity of such studies, investigators often rely on sophisticated analytical methods – such as propensity scoring and other techniques – to assess the merits of one agent relative to others. Those methods, while useful, typically are considered by physicians to be less authoritative than a head-to-head trial of two agents. This section highlights five recently presented studies that compared agents within the same trial or via analysis of data drawn from different trials or large patient databases. In considering various treatments, however, it is critical to not only look at clinical trial data and other analyses, but also for individuals to talk with their clinician about their specific history and circumstances – in order to individualize their care and achieve an optimal effect. DMT impact on cognition in patients at increased risk of progressive disease The OPERA 1 and OPERA 2 trials were identical Phase III studies that compared the effectiveness and safety of Ocrevus (ocrelizumab) to Rebif (interferon beta-1a) in people with relapsing MS. Study participants received either 600 mg of Ocrevus every 24 weeks or 44 ug of Rebif three times a week for 96 weeks. The studies included 186 individuals receiving Ocrevus and 180 receiving Rebif who were considered to be at increased risk of progressive disease based on their Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and pyramidal Kurtzke Functional Systems scores. Participants completed the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) at baseline and during the course of 96 weeks to assess their cognitive function. Over the study period, individuals receiving Ocrevus who were at increased risk for disease progression had a greater mean improvement in SDMT scores than did increased-risk individuals receiving Rebif (6.2 for Ocrevus versus 2.6 for Rebif). Assessing DMTs in terms of annualized relapse rates Annualized relapse rate (ARR) is a measure of a DMT’s impact on disease course in MS. Researchers drew on data from two studies of Plegridy (peginterferon beta-1a) and two studies of Aubagio (teriflunomide) to assess the ARR in newly diagnosed individuals starting one or the other of those medications. The participants had been diagnosed with relapsing MS within one year of study enrollment and had not taken other DMTs. The investigators used individual patient data from the studies to match analyzed subjects by key baseline characteristics. Their analysis showed that at 108 weeks after treatment initiation, the ARR was numerically lower in newly diagnosed individuals receiving Plegridy than in newly diagnosed Aubagio patients. However, this difference was not statistically significant. In a separate study, a German network of more than 130 neurologists drew on its database of roughly 25,000 individuals with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) to assess various DMTs in terms of ARR. The analysis found that Tecfidera (dimethyl fumarate) had a statistically significant reduction in ARR versus interferon medications. Tecfidera also performed better than the other agents in terms of time to first relapse. A third study assessed the ARR in people with highly active RRMS who switched to either Tysabri (natalizumab) or Gilenya (fingolimod) after inadequate response to DMTs that are considered first-line therapies in Europe. Such medications include interferon medications, glatiramer acetate, Aubagio, and Tecfidera. Researchers analyzed data for 897 “patient triplets” or matched sets of individuals who either switched from one first-line therapy to another or from a first-line therapy to Tysabri or Gilenya. The study drew from the MSBase Registry, an international online registry for neurologists studying multiple sclerosis and other neuro-immunological diseases. The analysis found that after switching, individuals moving from a first-line therapy to Tysabri had an ARR of 0.21; those moving to Gilenya had an ARR of 0.30; and those switching from one first-line therapy to another had an ARR of 0.33. The ARR was statistically significantly reduced for Tysabri, with no evidence of difference for Gilenya. Earlier this year, Gilenya (fingolimod) became the first DMT approved to treat relapsing MS in adolescents and children aged 10 years and older. This medication was approved for use in adults with RMS in 2010. The Phase III PARADIGMS study compared use of Gilenya to interferon beta-1a for up to two years in 214 individuals aged 10 to 17 years with pediatric-onset MS. At the end of the study, Gilenya reduced the annualized rate of new or newly enlarging T2 lesions by 52.6 percent and the number of gadolinium-enhancing T1 lesions per scan by 66.0 percent compared with interferon beta-1a. The early recognition of MS and the evidence-based assessment of likely disease course are critical to patients’ and physicians’ ability to engage in shared decision-making on treatment choices and overall wellness strategies. A significant amount of research is being conducted to map the connections between imaging findings or biomarker levels and establishing the diagnosis and predicting the course of MS. Other studies are focused on what measures of physical function may reveal about current and future health status. Several recent studies exploring these issues are highlighted below. 2017 McDonald Criteria apply well to children at MS onset MRI findings play a key role in the diagnosis of MS, but most research on the significance of imaging results has been focused on adults. Now, a study by investigators from The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and other institutions, has found that the 2017 McDonald Criteria are largely applicable to children, as well as adults, when assessing patients at clinical disease onset. The researchers assessed more than 2,800 MRI scans from 331 pediatric patients with MS, acquired demyelinating syndrome, and related conditions, and followed those patients’ course over a median of six years. They found that the presence of ≥one T1-hypointense lesions or ≥one periventricular lesions were the MRI features most predictive of MS outcome. The 2010 McDonald criteria and 2017 version of those criteria had comparable utility in predicting a pediatric patient’s disease course, but the investigators said the 2017 criteria were easier to apply. “Both ‘black holes’ and periventricular lesions at baseline are strong predictors of MS” in children, as they are in adults, the researchers concluded, adding that evidence of new disease activity is required to confirm MS in children who present with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM). Location of brain lesions predictive of walking speed The presence of MRI-detected lesions in the infratentorial/cerebellar region of the brain is associated with slower walking speed in people with MS, according to a retrospective chart review of 82 individuals. A team of Connecticut-based researchers reviewed magnetic resonance images and medical records to determine whether the location of lesions in four areas of the central nervous system – the spinal cord, and the infratentorial/cerebellar, juxtacortical, and periventricular regions of the brain – was associated with mobility and disability in people with MS. No significant relationship was found between number of CNS regions with lesions and Extended Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score or time in performing the Timed 25-Foot Walk test. Similarly, no significant relationship was seen between the presence of lesions in any one region of the CNS and EDSS score. Higher number of oligoclonal bands correlates with relapses and disease progression People with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) who had 10 or more oligoclonal bands (OCBs) in their cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were far more likely to have relapses and disease progression over the ensuing two years than individuals with RRMS who had <10 OCBs in their CSF samples. That was the finding from a retrospective study of 128 people with RRMS on DMT therapy. Researchers from the University of Pennsylvania also found that in addition to having more relapses and more new lesions on MRI, people with ≥10 OCBs were more likely to begin using an assistive device relative to their counterparts with fewer OCBs. “As OCBs may have greater diagnostic weight going forward, the quantity may be important in guiding selection of DMTs,” the study’s authors noted. Tapping into a new means of assessing MS subtype and mobility The number of times a person with MS can tap his or her foot in 10 seconds correlates with MS subtype and with results of mobility measures such as the 25-Foot Walk Test (25FWT). This finding was discovered by researchers from the University of Massachusetts Amherst and related institutions. In a study of 30 people with non-progressive MS, 30 with progressive MS, and 17 age- and sex-matched healthy controls, 10-second tap counts distinguished people with MS from healthy controls, and those with progressive MS from their peers with non-progressive MS. Further, slower foot tapping correlated with slower performance on the 25FWT and Timed Up and Go test (TUG). “The associations between foot tap speed and mobility measures, such as the TUG test and 25FWT, suggest that rapid foot-tapping may be a useful marker for tracking or predicting progression of mobility dysfunction in people with MS, regardless of their ability to ambulate,” the researchers noted. Various Strategies for Wellness and Symptom Management, Physical Activity and Exercise, Vitamin D, and Reproductive-Health Topics People with MS often must contend with a wide range of issues affecting their quality of life, overall health status, and general well-being. As the nature and impact of those issues have become better understood in recent years, an array of healthcare professionals – from psychologists and physical therapists to health educators and epidemiologists – are analyzing databases and devising innovative programs to further define and more effectively address challenges involving everything from insomnia to infertility. To follow are highlights of research in these areas. These were reported earlier this year at the Annual Meetings of the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) and the Consortium of Multiple Sclerosis Centers (CMSC). Well, maybe not the absolute best medicine, but apparently good medicine when it comes to addressing depression in people with MS and other neurologic conditions. Researchers at Evergreen Health in Kirkland, Washington, conducted a prospective, open trial of laughter therapy (LT) for 31 participants: 17 with MS, eight with Parkinson’s disease, two with spinal cord injury, and the remainder with other disorders of the central nervous system. After participating in eight, 60-minute laughter therapy classes taught by a certified LT instructor (yes, there is such a thing), participants who completed the course saw an improvement from baseline in their scores on a measure of depression. Scores on a separate measure of anxiety essentially were unchanged from baseline. “Our findings show that LT may reduce depression and be administered across a variety of neurological deficits, including for people with limited exercise options due to severe disability,” the researchers noted. However, they added that the approximate 50 percent attrition rate – with 14 participants not completing the program – may indicate a potential shortcoming for when the intervention is employed in people with neurological conditions. Comparing strategies for stress reduction in people with MS Both mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and group education on stress reduction can provide short-and long-term benefits to people with MS, according to a randomized study involving 62 adults with MS and Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores of ≤8.0. Compared to their status at the start of the study, people in both groups experienced significant reductions in stress both eight weeks and 12 months after participating in an MBRS program or group education. Both groups also saw improvement on a measure of emotional well-being at eight weeks, but that improvement was no longer statistically significant at 12 months. No significant differences were found between the two groups in terms of degree of stress reduction achieved or improvement in emotional well-being, suggesting that both approaches are viable options for addressing the stress and other emotional issues that can be part of living with MS. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) may improve insomnia symptoms, sleep quality, and fatigue in the roughly 40 percent of people with MS who experience chronic insomnia, according to an ongoing study. Seven people have completed the randomized controlled trial thus far, with five participating in a six-week program of CBT for insomnia and two serving as controls. The CBT group showed a 78 percent improvement from baseline on a measure of insomnia symptoms, compared to a 38 percent improvement in the control group. Similarly, sleep quality improved by 63 percent for people in the CBT group and 32 percent in the control group. Additionally, two measures of fatigue showed improvements of 70 percent and 50 percent, respectively, for people receiving CBT, versus a 37 percent improvement and 20 percent worsening, respectively, for control group members. Can shared medical appointments enhance wellness in MS? So much needs to happen in an MS patient’s regular visit with his or her clinician. As a result, education on wellness, managing co-morbidities, and other important topics can get lost in the time crunch. Two researchers from Cleveland explored whether shared medical appointments, or SMAs, may be a solution to that problem. In the typical SMA model, individual appointments for patients are scheduled around a time set aside for group instruction and discussion. In this case, the Cleveland researchers offered a monthly SMA, with group sessions covering topics such as nutrition, therapeutic yoga, and guided imagery. Thirty-three patients attended at least one SMA, with 45 percent of those participants returning for at least one more SMA, and 36 percent attending three or more sessions. Patient-satisfaction assessments found 75 percent of participants had a favorable view of the value of the information presented and regarding attending future SMAs. Female patients attended preferentially relative to men, noted the researchers, adding that “encouraging wellness interventions at an earlier age and to wider demographics and disability level” may encourage more people with MS to adopt healthy lifestyle practices. Becoming physically active is a challenge for people with MS – and for all people, for that matter. Staying active after completing a formal physical therapy or exercise program can be even more of a challenge. However, two New York City physical therapists have reported success in encouraging ongoing physical activity among seven of eight participants in a six-week wellness exercise class (WEC) they conducted. All eight of the program’s participants recently had been discharged from outpatient physical therapy. The weekly exercise class that they then entered consisted of 60 minutes of progressive aerobic and resistance training, as well as stretching. Upon completing the six-week class, participants showed improvement from baseline on several measures of the physical and psychological impact of MS. And, in keeping with the adage that success begets success, at a follow-up four weeks after completing the class, seven of the eight class members reported being active in an independent gym program. The researchers concluded, “Providers should work with physical therapists to assure that, after rehabilitation, affordable opportunities such as group WEC exist to help those with MS have the opportunity to independently engage in an exercise program. This bridge between therapy and discharge could safely enhance adherence to exercise post rehabilitation, and potentially decrease the need for a future prolonged course of PT.” Research supports maximal strength training for people with MS Properly supervised maximal strength training (MST) is safe for people with MS and can help improve their strength, balance, and walking speed, according to a team of researchers from Hunter College in New York City. Those researchers conducted a pilot study in which nine people with MS (six women and three men) participated in an eight-week program. The twice-weekly sessions involved leg press, knee flexion, and ankle plantarflexion, with weights increased based on participant capability and preference. At the end of the exercise program, the participants showed significant improvement from baseline in the Six Minute Walk Test and Mini-BESTest. Meanwhile, measures of fatigue and spasticity did not change significantly from the study’s start until its end, suggesting that the strength training did not increase fatigue or spasticity. The researchers noted that while the study is ongoing, the results to date suggest that “MST is a safe and effective intervention, and that [people with multiple sclerosis] can benefit from a higher intensity of intervention than might have previously been thought.” Time spent in physical activity correlates with higher Vitamin D concentrations in people with MS, according to a study of 23 women and 15 men with multiple sclerosis and an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of ≤4.0. Researchers used an activity-monitoring device, patient diaries, and measurement of Vitamin D blood levels to follow patients over a one-month period. The participants did not take Vitamin D supplements before or during the study. The fact that study participants who were more physically active had higher levels of Vitamin D than those who were not as active – despite the fact that they were not taking the Vitamin D supplements, is intriguing. This is because many MS patients have lower-than-normal Vitamin D levels, and because physical activity has been shown to improve outcomes in MS. The study’s authors noted that alternative pathways leading to the connection between disease progression and Vitamin D levels need to be considered. Long-term reduction in spasticity seen with intrathecal baclofen therapy Five years after implantation of a pump to deliver intrathecal baclofen therapy, both ambulatory and non-ambulatory people with MS had significant reductions in spasticity, according to researchers from the Cleveland Clinic Mellen Center and related institutions. Those researchers examined the records of 77 individuals (40 ambulatory and 37 non-ambulatory) who had a pump implanted between 2001 and 2014, and for whom at least three years of follow-up data were available. The patient’s mean age at surgery to implant the pump was 47.1 years; 62 percent of the patients were women. For ambulatory patients, spasticity as measured by the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) improved from 14.5 (range 10.8-20.25) at baseline to 2 (range 0-8) after five years on IBT. For non-ambulatory patients, MAS score improved from 24 (range 16.5-26) to 2 (range 0-5) after five years of IBT. Pain scores also improved significantly in both groups. Physical therapy (PT) has been shown to improve gait speed in people with MS. The medication dalfampridine extended-release (DER) also can increase gait speed in those with MS, but only about 38 percent of individuals experience this benefit. Now, the results of a small study support combining the interventions in people with MS who do not see a 20 percent or greater improvement in their Timed 25 Foot Walk test (T25W) after three weeks on the medication. The study involved eight adults with MS. Four of those people had been taking DER for three weeks and did not have a ≥20 percent improvement in T25W at the end of that period. They continued on DER for another six weeks, but also engaged in twice-weekly physical therapy during that period. The other four participants did not receive DER but also engaged in six weeks of twice-weekly PT. Among the DER + PT patients, T25FW results improved by 20.7 percent from Week 3 to Week 9, while the PT-only group had a 6.8 percent improvement in T25W during that period. Infertility and MS – findings from a large database analysis Women with MS are more likely to have a diagnosis of infertility, less likely to use infertility medications, and less likely to have a live birth than their age-matched peers without MS. Those are the main findings from an analysis of United States’ commercial insurance claims for 117,041 women with MS and more than 1.4 million women without MS. The analysis, which spanned the period from 2006 through 2015, found that 8.52 percent of women with MS and 8.02 percent of those without MS had a diagnosis of infertility. While that percentage difference is small, the researchers noted that it is statistically significant. Similarly, a significantly lower proportion of women with MS used any fertility treatment relative to women without MS (1.01 percent versus 1.19 percent). Finally, the rate of live births in women on any infertility treatment was 5.00 percent among women with MS, compared with 6.98 percent among those who did not have MS. Data from the New York State Multiple Sclerosis Consortium (NYSMSC) provide reassuring news regarding both the incidence of relapses during pregnancy and the near-term effect on infants of maternal use of DMTs in pregnancy. Among 109 women who reported a pregnancy after being diagnosed with MS, 48.6 percent had a relapse in the two years before becoming pregnant, but just 11.9 percent reported a relapse during pregnancy. Those relapses were more common in the first and second trimesters than in the third trimester. Meanwhile, 45.8 percent of the women reported a relapse in the first two years after birth, with most of the relapses occurring in the first year after delivery. Women who had experienced a relapse in the 24 months before pregnancy were more likely than others to have a relapse in the 24 months after birth, while relapse during pregnancy was not associated with postpartum relapse. Eleven of the women in the analysis were on disease-modifying therapy (DMT) for at least part of their pregnancy, with six continuing to use their DMT through their entire pregnancy. None of those women reported birth problems, and none of their children had been referred for special medical services at age 1 or 2 years. Hot Topics in MS: Stem Cells, Lipoic Acid, Diet and MS, Obesity and MS, Gut Microbiome, and Medical Marijuana Research into interventions for MS extends far beyond the important efforts to develop new pharmacologic treatments and to better understand the efficacy and safety profile of currently approved medications. Increasingly, investigators are assessing the impact of diet, the gut microbiome – a key component of the immune system – and various substances as they look for ways to manage symptoms and improve outcomes. Studies also are exploring the role of two very different types of interventions long used to treat other conditions — medical marijuana and stem-cell transplantation – in MS. This section reviews pertinent findings in these and other areas reported at the 2018 Annual Meetings of the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) and the Consortium of Multiple Sclerosis Centers (CMSC). When relapses continue while taking a DMT – a role for stem-cell therapy? An international team of researchers is assessing the role of stem-cell transplantation for individuals with highly active RRMS who continue to have relapses despite taking a DMT. At the AAN’s annual meeting, those scientists reported interim results from their Multiple Sclerosis International Stem cell Transplant (MIST) trial. The study involves 110 individuals with RRMS on a DMT who have had two or more relapses in the past 12 months. Fifty-five patients were randomly assigned to receive stem-cell transplantation, while the other 55 continue to receive the DMT that their treating neurologist deemed best for them. Importantly, the study is employing “non-myeloablative” stem-cell transplantation, meaning that patients can go through a less-demanding pre-treatment regimen than what was first used in stem-cell transplantation and still often used in treating certain types of cancer. The study’s main endpoint is treatment failure, defined as a 1.0 increase in EDSS sustained for six months or more. After a mean follow-up of three years, 60 percent of patients in the DMT arm had experienced a treatment failure, compared to just 6 percent of those in the stem-cell transplant group. During the first year after transplant, those receiving stem cells saw their EDDS score improve from 3.5 to 2.4, while it worsened in the DMT group from 3.3 to 3.9. Both of those findings were statistically significant. No deaths occurred in the stem-cell transplant group. These results led the researchers to conclude that in people with RRMS who have more than two relapses in a year while on a DMT, stem-cell transplantation is superior to continued use of a disease-modifying therapy. Meanwhile, a separate, smaller study from a single center suggests that stem-cell transplantation may be a first-line option for the minority of MS patients who have rapidly evolving severe multiple sclerosis (RESMS), also known as highly active relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). British investigators performed stem-cell transplantation on five men and two women who had not received a disease-modifying therapy (DMT), and who had experienced two or more severe relapses in the 12 months before the procedure. These individuals all had clinical or imaging findings that suggested that their MS would continue to worsen, and all had at least one gadolinium-enhancing lesion seen on MRI associated with their relapses. They ranged in age from 27 to 52 years old, and their median time between symptom onset and treatment was nine months. The investigators used each patient’s own stem cells for the procedure. After a median follow-up period of 18 months, none of the participants had experienced a relapse following the transplantation, although one had a single new gadolinium-enhancing lesion six months after treatment. The median Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score for these individuals improved from a median 5.5 before treatment to 3 at the last follow-up. No serious adverse effects were observed. The investigators concluded that autologous (using the patient’s own cells) hematopoietic (blood-cell producing) stem-cell transplantation is safe and effective for previously untreated patients with rapidly evolving, severe MS. Lipoic acid is a naturally occurring compound that exhibits antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Its potential role as a dietary supplement for people with MS has been the focus of recent research, including a study by investigators from the Oregon Health & Science University and VA Portland Health Care System. Those researchers administered 1,200 mg of oral lipoic acid to people with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), secondary-progressive MS (SPMS), and healthy controls. They then drew blood samples to measure the amount of lipoic acid found in the plasma of all three groups, as well as levels of substances involved in immune system responses. In particular, the investigators wanted to see if taking lipoic acid would stimulate the body’s production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), which plays a role in modulating the immune system. They found that two hours and four hours after ingesting lipoic acid, the health controls and people with SPMS had increased cAMP levels relative to baseline, while those with RRMS had decreases in cAMP. Also, women with RRMS had lower plasma concentrations of prostaglandin E2, which stimulates cAMP, compared to women with SPMS and women without MS four hours after taking lipoic acid. These findings prompted the investigators to conclude that the differences in the way people with RRMS responded to lipoic acid relative to those without MS or with SPMS may have implications for the efficacy of immunomodulatory agents in RRMS. Following a paleolithic diet can help decrease fatigue in MS through changes in people’s lipid profiles, according to a study reported at the AAN annual meeting. The paleolithic – or so-called “caveman” diet – focuses on eating meat, fish, nuts, and vegetables available before the advent of processed food. A one-year study of 18 people with progressive MS found that a comprehensive intervention that included following a paleolithic diet, neuromuscular stimulation, and stress reduction reduced participants’ mean Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) score from 5.51 at baseline to 3.03 at 12 months. During that time, participants saw their HDL-C (“good cholesterol”) levels increase, their total cholesterol levels decrease, and their body mass index (BMI) fall (BMI is a measure of healthy or unhealthy weight). The researchers concluded, “Lipid profile variables are associated with the improvements in fatigue in progressive MS patients on a modified Paleolithic diet-based multimodal intervention.” Meanwhile, researchers from Johns Hopkins reported on people with MS who follow a Mediterranean-style diet high in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, seafood and polyunsaturated fats while eating little red meat and drinking in moderation. The researchers found that these individuals appear to have less severe depressive and cognitive symptoms than people with MS who follow a more-traditional American diet. The researchers had 34 people with MS complete dietary recall surveys and then assessed those people for depression, cognitive impairment, and other known symptoms of MS. The investigators noted that the results of this cross-sectional survey need to be validated by interventional studies that could better examine the nature of the relationship seen between diet and the MS symptoms studied. Other research being conducted at Johns Hopkins is examining how caloric restriction affects the metabolite profiles of people with MS. In a six-month study, 19 people with MS who were receiving monthly injections of Tysabri and who had a higher body mass index (BMI) of ≥25 kg/m (indicating that they are overweight) chose from one of two calorie-restriction strategies. The first strategy, chosen by 11 individuals, involved continuous calorie restriction (CCR), with participants consuming 78.6 percent of their daily caloric needs each day. The other approach, chosen by eight participants, entailed intermittent calorie restriction (ICR), with people consuming only 25 percent of their daily caloric needs two days per week, and consuming their full caloric needs on the other days of the week. Nine of the 11 people in the CCR group and six of the eight in the ICR group completed the study. Researchers are assessing blood samples collected at baseline, three months, and six months to see how the two calorie-restriction approaches influenced the production of metabolites. They note that the results of their analysis may provide new information on how dietary changes affect clinical outcomes in MS. People who are obese at the onset of MS are likely to experience greater functional impairment and higher risk of relapses in the first two years after onset than people with a healthy weight, according to a study of more than 1,500 people with MS. Drawing on data for 1,524 participants in the Accelerated Cure Project’s study, researchers found that obesity was associated with a 15-percent increase in the number of impaired functional domains and a 30-percent increase in early relapse activity. People who were obese also were on average 8-percent older than non-obese patients at the onset of MS. The investigators explain, “These results warrant further investigation into the impact of this proinflammatory phenotype [obesity] in MS.” Gut reaction? Exploring potential ties between MS and the digestive tract’s microbiome The mix of bacteria found in the digestive tracts of people with MS or clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) differ from the bacterial milieu found in the gastrointestinal systems of people who don’t have those conditions, two recent studies found. Those studies reflect a growing research focus on potential links between MS and the “gut microbiome,” the digestive tract’s bacterial environment, which is known to play a major role in immune-system function. In the first study, American researchers used sophisticated genetic testing to analyze 42 stool samples from individuals with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) or secondary-progressive MS (SPMS), as well as stool samples from 28 healthy donors. Compared to the samples from healthy volunteers, stool samples from people with RRMS had a statistically significant greater abundance of several types of bacteria, including Ruminococcus torques, Ruminococcus obeum, and Lactospiraces. Escherichia coli and Oscillibacter also were found more often in people with RRMS than in healthy controls. Conversely, people who did not have MS had a higher concentration of other bacteria – including bacteroides fragilis and Roseburia – than did study participants with MS. The researchers noted that further, larger studies are needed to determine whether these findings can help pave the way for markers of disease activity or even therapies that target the composition of the gut microbiome. Meanwhile, Italian investigators found differences in both the stool and blood samples of individuals with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) – referring to individuals experiencing a symptom of MS, but who have not yet been diagnosed – relative to healthy volunteers. They found that butyrate-producing bacteria were more abundant in the healthy volunteers compared to those with CIS. Additionally, the blood of people with CIS had an increased level of a type of white blood cell involved in immune function – T helper (Th) 17 – and fewer T regulatory (Treg) cells producing Interleukin 10, compared to healthy volunteers. The researchers said that both findings indicate that gut microbiome dysfunction or imbalance exists at the earliest stages of MS. Most people with MS who use medical marijuana (MM), find that the medication helps manage their pain, spasticity, and other symptoms. This is according to two recent small-scale studies. In the first study, 14 individuals at the University of Rochester MS Center (13 with MS and one with transverse myelitis) enrolled in the New York State Medical Marijuana Program and completed a survey on their experience with MM. Ninety-three percent of these individuals who were certified by the state program to use medical marijuana actually had tried the medication at least once, with 77 percent reporting ongoing use, and 62 percent saying they used MM at least daily. Seventy-seven percent of participants said MM was helpful in managing their symptoms, 70 percent said that their quality of life improved with marijuana use, and most respondents reported no side effects. Most subjects estimated that they spent between $100 and $300 per month on MM, and cost was cited as a factor in stopping use of MM or using the agent less frequently.   The second study is being conducted in Colorado, where cannabis use – for any purpose, not just medical reasons – is legal. The experience and beliefs of 25 patients from the Rocky Mountain Multiple Sclerosis Center at the University of Colorado were reported in preliminary findings from the research. Fifty-six percent of those participants believe cannabis has a beneficial effect on MS symptoms, while 8 percent think marijuana could entail harm in terms of MS symptoms. Seventy-six percent said they would consider cannabis use to ease their symptoms. Pain was the reason most frequently cited for using cannabis (by 57 percent of respondents), followed by spasticity/muscle tightness (29 percent), and muscle spasms (14 percent). Slowed thinking was the most commonly reported side effect, cited by 29 percent of participants. Forty-eight percent of survey respondents said that they were not currently using cannabis, with half of those people saying their non-usage was because they did not know enough about the medication. The authors of the second study noted, “As cannabis becomes more available under the laws of individual states, the results of this ongoing study may have important implications in the future landscape of MS symptom treatment and research exploring the efficacy of cannabis for MS symptom management.” For general information or to speak with a trained Client Services Specialist, please call MSAA’s Helpline at .

SPMS with active disease refers to those patients who are in a progressive phase of the disease and continue to have clinical relapses. In the clinical trials, siponimod appeared to have the most benefit for patients who were younger, had gadolinium-enhancing lesions, lower disability, and shorter disease duration. The benefit of siponimod in patients with SPMS without relapses is less clear. Siponimod is a sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor (S1P) modulator that selectively binds the S1P subtypes 1 and 5. It acts as a functional antagonist, as binding to S1P1 induces receptor internalization and degradation in T and B cells. The ultimate result is prevention of lymphocyte egress from the lymphoid tissue into the central nervous system (CNS). Additionally, preclinical studies have shown that siponimod inhibits demyelination, and attenuates the production of TNFα, IL-6, and IL-17 by astrocytes and microglia. This suggests that siponimod may act directly on the CNS in addition to its role in decreasing circulating lymphocytes. Siponimod has a rapid onset of action, and reduces circulating T and B cells within 4-6 hours. Its half-life is approximately 30 hours. Circulating lymphocytes counts recover within a week after treatment discontinuation. Complete elimination of siponimod from the body takes approximately 10 days. Siponimod is metabolized in the liver through the Cytochrome P450 system (primarily through CYP2C9, subsequently by CYP3A4). Genetic variants to the CYP2C9 enzyme can slow siponimod metabolism. This is important in determining the correct dose and titration schedule for a given patient, as patients with the *3 variant of CYP2C9 demonstrated slower rates of drug metabolism. Specifically, heterozygotes with CYP2C9 *3 have moderately slowed metabolism, and homozygotes with CYP2C9 *3/*3 have severely impaired metabolism. As a result, CYP2C9 *3 heterozygotes should follow a lower dose titration and lower final dose; CYP2C9 *3/*3 genotype is a contraindication to siponimod. Does siponimod have any significant drug interactions? While siponimod does not induce nor inhibit the CYP450 system, its metabolism can be affected by medications that are CYP2C9 inhibitors or inducers. For example, a patient who takes warfarin, a CYP2C9 inhibitor, may have increased levels of siponimod. We recommend a careful review of a patient’s medication list, and would use siponimod cautiously in patients who take CYP450 modulators. What did the clinical trials of siponimod for MS show? Siponimod was approved for treatment of MS based on the results of two clinical trials. The first was , which was a phase II randomized, double-blind, dose-finding, placebo comparison trial for patients with RRMS. This showed that siponimod at a dose of 2mg approached peak efficacy as measured by a reduction in the number of new or enlarging T2 lesions or new enhancing lesions. It also showed that the medication had favorable tolerability and safety. While there were two significant cardiovascular adverse events, both of these patients had preexisting cardiac risk factors, and both of these events occurred after drug discontinuation and washout. The safety 24-month extension study did not identify any new serious safety signals compared to the original study. The second study was EXPAND, which was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III trial of patients with SPMS. EXPAND demonstrated that siponimod reduced the risk of confirmed disability worsening in patients with SPMS by 21%, reduced the risk of relapses compared to placebo by 55%, and slowed the rate of radiographic disease activity and brain atrophy. The side effects of siponimod that occurred in greater than 10% of patients in clinical trials are as follows: Siponimod, similar to other S1P modulators, can lead to temporarily bradycardia immediately following the first dose, although a five-day titration appears to mitigate first-dose bradycardia. There were no symptomatic bradycardic events or adverse reactions, nor clinically significant changes in baseline blood pressure observed in the trials. Siponimod also induced cardiac conduction abnormalities in 3% of patients in clinical trials, including first- and second-degree AV block. Approximately 1% of patients in clinical trials experienced increases in alanine aminotransferase (ALT). 2% of siponimod patients developed macular edema, compared to less than 1% of placebo patients. In the clinical trial EXPAND, macular edema was seen in 2% of siponimod patients compared to <1% of placebo patients. Patients with a prior history of uveitis and patients with diabetes mellitus are at increased risk of macular edema when taking siponimod. While this is not an absolute contraindication, we recommend obtaining a baseline ophthalmologic evaluation. We typically complete this using optical coherence tomography (OCT). OCT monitoring for macular edema is only done if symptoms suggestive possible macular edema. OCT monitoring for macular edema is only done if symptoms suggestive possible macular edema. Is siponimod associated with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)? There have been no cases of PML reported in patients treated with siponimod, although PML has been associated with another S1P modulator fingolimod. Infingolimod the rate of PML is very low. . Accordingly, a risk of PML during siponimod treatment cannot be excluded. We believe that if PML is to develop in patients taking siponimod, it will occur at the same low rate as was seen in fingolimod. Currently, we do not feel that positive JC virus serology should preclude treatment with siponimod. Clinical trials showed that the overall rate of infections was comparable between siponimod and placebo group (49.0% vs 49.1%, respectively), and the rate of serious infection was slightly increased for the siponimod group compared to placebo (2.9% vs 2.5%). The siponimod group had a higher rate of herpetic infections (including VZV), , upper respiratory infection, and fungal skin infection. While not reported for siponimod, rare cases of cryptococcal meningitis have been reported in patients taking fingolimod, another S1P modulator. Siponimod reduces the circulating absolute lymphocyte count (ALC), which is its intended pharmacodynamics effect. The magnitude of reduction is dose-dependent, and is approximately 20-30%. Lymphopenia (defined as ALC < 200/µL) occurred in 1% of patients, however there is no correlation between lymphopenia and an increased risk of infections, including PML. Contraindications to siponimod include patients homozygous for the CYP2C9*3/*3 genotype; significant heart rhythm or conduction abnormalities (unless the patient has a functioning pacemaker); or in the past six months has had myocardial infarction, unstable angina, stroke, TIA, decompensated heart failure, or Class III or IV heart failure.   Siponimod is a once-daily oral medication that follows an initial titration. Prior to starting the medication, CYP2C9 genotype must be tested in order to determine how the drug will be metabolized for a specific patient. This determines the titration strategy and target dosage. If a titration dose is missed for more than 24 hours, treatment should be restarted with Day 1 of the titration schedule. If treatment is interrupted for more than 4 days, patients should repeat the titration. For patients with CYP2C9 Genotypes *1/*1, *1/*2, or *2/*2: initiate siponimod therapy with the standard 5-day titration, followed by the maintenance dose of 2 mg taken once daily beginning on day 6. This standard titration should be prescribed using the starter pack (which includes 12 pills of 0.25mg), followed by a separate prescription for the 2mg maintenance pills. Titration for wild-type CYP2C9 Genotypes (*1/*1, *1/*2, or *2/*2) For patients with CYP2C9 Genotypes *1/*3, or *2/*3: initiate siponimod therapy with an altered 4-day titration, followed by the maintenance dose of 1 mg taken once daily beginning on day 5. The titration should be given as a prescription for siponimod 0.25 mg x 7 pills, followed by a separate prescription for the 1mg maintenance dose. Titration for heterozygote CYP2C9 Genotypes (*1/*3, or *2/*3) Siponimod is contraindicated for patients with the *3/*3 CYP2C9 genotype due to dangerously prolonged siponimod metabolism. Prior to starting treatment with siponimod, we recommend the following tests: this can be done in a patient’s home at no cost to the patient through the pharmaceutical company Virus IgG antibodies (VZV), and we recommend vaccinating VZV antibody-negative patients prior to starting treatment OCT to screen for macular edema, can also consider ophthalmologic examination to screen for asymptomatic uveitis It is also recommended that patients not have active infections when starting siponimod Is monitoring required during the first dose like with fingolimod? For the majority of patients, first dose observation is not necessary. First-dose 6 hour monitoring is recommended for patients who have a history of myocardial infarction, heart failure, sinus bradycardia (HR < 55 bpm), or first- or second-degree AV block as detected on baseline EKG. This monitoring should include hourly measurements of pulse and blood pressure, as well as an EKG at the end of the observation period. What monitoring is done during siponimod treatment? Although routine monitoring is not stipulated in the prescribing information, we at the Mellen Center recommend measuring blood pressure during office visits, and checking CBC with differential and LFTs 3-6 months after starting treatment, then every 6-12 months while on the medication. On these labs, we expect to see a 20-30% reduction in ALC, but we monitor for lymphopenia (ALC < 200/µL) and elevated ALT. For any significant abnormalities, more frequent monitoring is reasonable. Currently, there are no data to suggest that the lymphopenia produced by siponimod leads to a higher risk of infection. We recommend routine clinical monitoring for infections for all siponimod patients, especially for those who develop ALC < 200/µL with concomitant leukopenia, or for patients with a history of frequent infections. For other S1P modulators such as fingolimod, rebound disease activity may occur after drug discontinuation. While this phenomenon was not seen in the siponimod clinical trials, we consider it a potential risk, and therefore patients should be monitored closely for relapses, MRI lesion activity, or disability worsening after stopping the drug. Additionally, rare cases of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) have occurred in patients receiving other S1P modulators, though this has not yet been reported in siponimod patients. It is therefore considered a potential risk, and should be considered in the differential diagnosis for any patient who develops a new neurologic symptom or deficit. Although there are no data on the safety of siponimod in pregnant woman, siponimod has been shown to cause teratogenicity in various animal models. Therefore, female patients of childbearing potential should use effective contraceptive methods while on siponimod, and wait at least 2 months (based on the half-life of the drug) after the last siponimod dose before attempting to conceive. There are currently no data on the safety of siponimod on the breastfed infant, however animal studies have shown that the medication is secreted into breast milk. A discussion of the risks and benefits of breastfeeding while on siponimod should occur with each patient individually. Which vaccines should a patient receive while on siponimod? Prior to starting siponimod therapy, VZV antibodies should be checked, and patients who are antibody-negative should receive VZV vaccination. After starting siponimod, patients should receive all age-appropriate vaccines, including the annual flu vaccine, though we recommend avoiding any live vaccines. Killed or inactivated vaccines are considered to be relatively safe.

Deutschland zählt mit bis zu 127 Betroffenen pro 100.000 Einwohnern zu den Ländern mit hoher Prävalenz (2;3). Der Erkrankungsgipfel liegt um das 30. Lebensjahr (), Frauen sind häufiger betroffen als Männer (). Je nach Verlauf wird die MS in vier Formen eingeteilt: klinisch isolierte Syndrome, schubförmig-remittierende MS (relapsing remitting MS, RRMS), sekundär progrediente MS und primär progrediente MS. Darüber hinaus werden milde/moderate und (hoch)aktive Verlaufsformen unterschieden, für die unterschiedliche Therapieempfehlungen gelten (1;5;6). Zur Behandlung der schubförmig verlaufenden MS stehen unter anderem Interferon beta und Glatirameracetat zur Verfügung (1;4–6). Der Sphingosin-1-Phosphat(S1P)-Rezeptor-Modulator Fingolimod ist zugelassen zur krankheitsmodifizierenden Monotherapie der hochaktiven schubförmig-remittierenden MS bei Erwachsenen (). Fingolimod wird somit von wenigen Ausnahmen abgesehen als Sekundärtherapie bzw. Eskalationstherapie und nur in seltenen Fällen als Erstlinientherapie angewandt, z. B. bei von Anfang an hochaktivem Krankheitsverlauf. Fingolimod entfaltet seine Wirkung über den aktiven Metaboliten Fingolimodphosphat, das als funktioneller Antagonist an den S1P-Rezeptor auf Lymphozyten bindet und so deren Migration aus den Lymphknoten verhindert. Dadurch werden die Infiltration pathogener Lymphozyten in das ZNS und somit die Entzündungsreaktion und Zerstörung von Nervengewebe vermindert. Fingolimodphosphat bindet darüber hinaus an S1P-Rezeptoren auf den Nervenzellen im ZNS (5;7). Der AkdÄ wurde der Fall eines 37-jährigen, nicht rauchenden Patienten gemeldet, der seit seinem 25. Lebensjahr an einer schubförmig verlaufenden MS erkrankt war. Der Patient war zunächst mit Interferon beta behandelt worden, das bei Schubaktivität und Nachweis neutralisierender Antikörper nach vier Jahren beendet wurde. Unter einer Therapie mit Glatirameracetat trat ein hochaktiver Verlauf auf mit klinischer Schubaktivität und mehreren kontrastmittelaufnehmenden Läsionen im MRT, sodass der Patient schließlich vor einigen Jahren auf Fingolimod (0,5 mg/d) eingestellt wurde. Hierunter war er hinsichtlich der Multiplen Sklerose anhaltend beschwerdefrei. Begleitend litt der Patient an einer Psoriasis vulgaris. In diesem Zusammenhang waren seit langer Zeit Hautveränderungen am Penis bekannt. Über die Vorbehandlung der Psoriasis liegen keine genauen Angaben vor. Nach Recherchen der meldenden Klinik scheint es jedoch so zu sein, dass der Patient auch früher nicht mit PUVA (Psoralen plus UV-A) oder einer systemischen immunsuppressiven Therapie behandelt worden war. Fünf Jahre nach Beginn der Fingolimod-Behandlung stellte sich der Patient mit seit 18 Monaten bestehenden Hautveränderungen des Penis ärztlich vor. Primär habe eine Schuppung bestanden, im Verlauf hätten sich Risse und Krusten an der Glans penis gebildet. Zunächst wurden die Veränderungen nach einer Probeexzision im Rahmen der Psoriasis interpretiert und lokal behandelt. Bei ausbleibendem Effekt wurde unter dem Verdacht eines Granuloma inguinale stationär eine antibiotische Behandlung durchgeführt, welche ebenfalls keine Besserung erbrachte. In einer erneuten Probeexzision wurde die Diagnose eines Plattenepithelkarzinoms der Glans penis gestellt (pT1, G2, pN3 (4/21; ECE+)). HPV oder HSV wurden nicht nachgewiesen. Trotz chirurgischer Intervention (Penisamputation, Lymphadenektomie) und chemotherapeutischer Behandlung (zunächst adjuvant mit Cisplatin/5-FU/Paclitaxel, später – vermutlich wegen Metastasierung – 12 Zyklen Cisplatin/Etoposid/Bleomycin) sowie bei ossären Metastasen Bestrahlung von Thorax und Wirbelsäule kam es rasch zu einer multilokulären Metastasierung. Es konnte keine Tumorkontrolle erreicht werden und der Patient verstarb zehn Monate nach Diagnosestellung des Karzinoms. Die meisten Karzinome des Penis sind Plattenepithelkarzinome (). An Plattenepithelkarzinomen der Haut in unterschiedlicher Lokalisation erkrankten im Jahr 2012 in Deutschland über 44.000 Menschen (26.400 Männer, 17.900 Frauen). In der Regel treten diese Karzinome im höheren Lebensalter auf (mittleres Erkrankungsalter: Männer 76 Jahre, Frauen 79 Jahre). Ein wichtiger Risikofaktor ist der ultraviolette Anteil der Sonnenstrahlung, weswegen Plattenepithelkarzinome häufig an lichtexponierten Hautarealen auftreten (). Plattenepithelkarzinome des Penis sind in entwickelten Ländern selten. Für Europa und Nordamerika wird die Inzidenz auf unter 1 Mann pro 100.000 geschätzt mit einem Erkrankungsgipfel im 6. Lebensjahrzehnt (). Ein Drittel der Peniskarzinome wird auf das Humane Papilloma Virus (HPV) zurückgeführt. Weitere Risikofaktoren sind Phimosen und Rauchen (). Aber auch Immunsuppression, z. B. durch Medikamente, kann das Auftreten von Plattenepithelkarzinomen begünstigen (). Die Behandlung hängt ab von der Tumorgröße, der Histologie sowie vom Stadium und vom Differenzierungsgrad. Neben (möglichst organerhaltenden) chirurgischen Eingriffen und verschiedenen Möglichkeiten der Bestrahlung kommen unterschiedliche Chemotherapiestrategien zum Einsatz (). Etwa 80 Prozent der Patienten mit Peniskarzinom können heute geheilt werden (). Publizierte Fallberichte über Plattenepithelkarzinome der Haut (vor allem penile Plattenepithelkarzinome) im Zusammenhang mit Fingolimod liegen nach unserer Kenntnis bislang nicht vor. In der Europäischen Datenbank gemeldeter Verdachtsfälle von Nebenwirkungen finden sich bei insgesamt über 15.000 Fallberichten zu Fingolimod einzelne weitere Fälle von Plattenepithelkarzinom der Haut bzw. im Anogenitalbereich. Weitere Fälle von penilen Plattenepithelkarzinomen finden sich nicht (). Allerdings wurde im Zusammenhang mit Fingolimod über verschiedene Neoplasien berichtet: Insbesondere wurden Neoplasien der Haut (M. Bowen, Basalzellkarzinom, malignes Melanom, Kaposi-Sarkom) beschrieben (–), aber auch über Brustkrebs, Lymphome () und Glioblastom wurde berichtet (). In der Fachinformation zu Fingolimod werden Basalzellkarzinom (häufig), Lymphom (selten) sowie Kaposi-Sarkom (Häufigkeit nicht bekannt) als Risiken von Fingolimod aufgeführt (). Fingolimod wirkt immunsuppressiv, insbesondere auf T-Zellen. Dadurch kann das Auftreten von Infektionen, wie beispielsweise die progressive multifokale Leukenzephalopathie (PML), aber auch bestimmter Krebsarten, wie das Basalzellkarzinom, begünstigt werden (). Im Rahmen der Zulassung von Fingolimod wurden Hautkrebs (und andere Malignome) als potenzielles Risiko bewertet; diese sollen entsprechend dem Risk Management Plan weiter überwacht werden (). Der Patient aus dem Fallbeispiel ist für ein Plattenepithelkarzinom ungewöhnlich jung und auch die Lokalisation des Karzinoms an einer selten sonnenexponierten Stelle ist untypisch. Soweit bekannt ist, war der Patient wegen der Psoriasis nicht mit einer systemischen, immunsuppressiv wirkenden Therapie vorbehandelt worden und hatte in der Vergangenheit keine PUVA -Behandlung erhalten. Ein Zusammenhang von MS mit einer Karzinomentstehung (einschließlich Hautkrebs) wird kontrovers diskutiert. Eindeutige Hinweise auf eine erhöhte Karzinominzidenz liegen nicht vor (). Aufgrund des Wirkmechanismus von Fingolimod ist deshalb eine (Mit-)Verursachung durch Fingolimod denkbar. Bei Behandlung mit Fingolimod ist die regelmäßige Überwachung der Haut (auch der nicht lichtexponierten Areale) notwendig. Dies wird wegen des bekannten Risikos von Basalzellkarzinomen in der Fachinformation empfohlen: Eine medizinische Beurteilung der Haut sollte bei Behandlungsbeginn, nach mindestens einem Jahr und danach mindestens jährlich erfolgen. Wenn verdächtige Läsionen entdeckt werden, sollte der Patient an einen Dermatologen überwiesen werden (). Der Patient aus dem obigen Fallbeispiel kannte bei vorbestehender Psoriasis Hautveränderungen am Penis und stellte sich vermutlich deshalb erst 18 Monate nach neu aufgetretener Veränderung des Hautbildes am Penis ärztlich vor. Präkanzeröse Vorstufen konnten daher nicht adäquat behandelt werden. Gerade bei einer möglicherweise bösartigen Hautveränderung sollte jedoch ein Zeitverlust vermieden werden. Patienten sollten daher aufgefordert werden, sich umgehend ärztlich vorzustellen, wenn sie verdächtige Läsionen (auch Veränderungen vorbestehender Auffälligkeiten) bemerken. Im Zusammenhang mit Fingolimod sind bösartige Neubildungen an der Haut (vor allem Basalzellkarzinome) als Nebenwirkung bekannt. Deshalb sollte gemäß Fachinformation unter der Behandlung eine regelmäßige Inspektion der Haut (auch der nicht lichtexponierten Areale) und ggf. die Überweisung an einen Dermatologen erfolgen (). Patienten sollten über das Risiko von Hautveränderungen informiert und aufgefordert werden, alle verdächtigen Hautläsionen umgehend ihren behandelnden Ärzten zu berichten.

This means people who have had progression of disability but still experience acute relapses or new MRI activity. In a large clinical trial of 1651 people with secondary-progressive MS, fewer people taking Mayzent had confirmed worsening of disability progression compared to those on placebo. Mayzent also decreased the number of relapses. According to the prescribing information, the participants with non-active secondary progressive MS did not show significant benefits. Mayzent is an FDA-approved immune system-modulating therapy, taken by mouth once daily, which was designed to be more selective than Gilenya (fingolimod, Novartis International AG International AG) and potentially have fewer risks. Mayzent is thought to act by retaining certain white blood cells in the body’s lymph nodes, keeping them out of circulation and out of the the central nervous system. Mayzent also enters the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) where it may have direct anti-inflammatory and/or other effects. This approval provides another treatment option for people living with relapsing forms of MS and specifically includes people with secondary progressive MS who are continuing to experience active disease. The most common adverse reactions reported during clinical trials included headache, high blood pressure, and increases in liver function tests. Mayzent may increase the risk of infections, may cause macular edema (swelling in the back of the eye), and may cause transient decreases in heart rate and a decline in lung function. The prescription label will have advice about tests people should undergo before beginning to take Mayzent.  “This is an important breakthrough for people with secondary progressive MS, a type of MS that follows relapsing-remitting MS and is characterized by a worsening of symptoms and disability over time,” said Kathy Costello, MS, ANP-BC, MSCN, Associate Vice President of Healthcare Access at the National MS Society. “We are grateful that there is a new treatment option for people with active secondary progressive MS, and we are hopeful that this approval will stimulate development of more treatments for progressive MS.”   Download the full prescribing information and Medication Guide (.pdf)   The FDA has approved Mayzent (siponimod - Novartis International AG) for use in the treatment of adults with relapsing forms of MS, including (an initial neurological episode), , and active secondary MS. People with active secondary progressive MS have had progression of disability but still experience acute relapses or new MRI activity. In the clinical trial, people who had secondary progressive MS and who had experienced at least one relapse within two years before entering the study were considered “active.” Mayzent will be available as a first-line treatment, which means that there are no recommendations in the approved labeling for people to try other MS therapies before taking it. There is no requirement for first-dose monitoring in a health facility except for individuals with pre-existing heart conditions. There are recommendations for several lab and clinical tests prior to the first dose, Mayzent was approved for use in adults, and has not been tested in children with MS.   Secondary progressive MS follows an initial relapsing-remitting course. Many people who are initially diagnosed with relapsing-remitting MS eventually transition to a secondary progressive course in which there is a progressive worsening of neurologic function over time. Some people with secondary progressive MS can be characterized as either active (with relapses and/or evidence of new MRI activity) or not active, as well as with progression or without progression. The reason for these distinctions in disease course is that in the U.S., there are many disease-modifying therapies approved by the FDA for use in “relapsing forms” of MS, which includes those individuals who have secondary progressive MS and continue to have relapses and/or evidence of disease activity on MRI.   Mayzent is an FDA-approved immune system-modulating therapy that was designed to be more selective than Gilenya (fingolimod, Novartis International AG International AG). Gilenya is approved for adults and children aged 10 years or older with relapsing forms of MS to reduce the frequency of clinical relapses and to delay the accumulation of physical disability. Mayzent is thought to act by retaining certain white blood cells in the body’s lymph nodes, keeping them out of circulation and from entering the central nervous system. Mayzent also enters the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) where it may have direct anti-inflammatory and/or other effects.   Results of a 60-month, phase III clinical trial of Mayzent, involving 1,651 people with secondary progressive MS, were published in The trial met its primary endpoint of reducing the risk of disability progression compared with inactive placebo. Overall, those taking Mayzent had a 21% reduced risk of disability progression compared to those on placebo. According to the prescribing information, Mayzent significantly reduced the risk of progression in those with active secondary progressive MS, but not in those who had non-active secondary progressive MS. Secondary endpoints suggested that those on active therapy had 23% lower average change in brain volume, reduced relapse rates, and reduced MRI-detected lesion volume.   The most common adverse reactions reported during clinical trials included headache, high blood pressure, and increases in liver function tests. The serious adverse events reported to be more likely for those taking Mayzent included nervous system disorders and infections. Mayzent is not recommended for people with certain types of heart conditions.   includes several warnings and precautions, including the following. Mayzent: reduces white blood counts, and so may increase the risk of infections, including serious infections may cause macular edema (swelling in the back of the eye) may cause harm to a fetus, so women of childbearing potential should use contraception during and for 10 days after stopping Mayzent.  The Mayzent (pages 22-25 of the document) provides advice about symptoms to be alert to and about which individuals taking Mayzent should inform their healthcare providers.   The prescribing information contains advice to health care providers about tests people should undergo before beginning to take Mayzent. These include: Genetic blood test to determine the person’s CYP2C9 genotype, because people with some variants of these genes would need a different dose of Mayzent or should not take it at all. Other blood tests including a complete blood count and liver function tests, Blood test for antibodies to varicella zoster virus (Shingles virus). In those who are negative, VZV vaccination is recommended. History of current or prior immune-suppressing medications, which may cause Mayzent to further reduce the ability to fight infections.  Most people without pre-existing heart conditions will receive a starter pack of tablets that gradually increases the daily dose over 5 days, before taking the full recommended daily dose. People with certain pre-existing heart conditions will need 6-hour or possibly longer heart monitoring when receiving their first dose of Mayzent.   For people who qualify, Novartis plans to offer patient assistance programs through The Novartis Patient Assistance Foundation: 1-800-277-2254 or https://www.pharma.us.novartis.com/our-products/patient-assistance/patient-assistance-foundation-enrollment.   Download the full prescribing information and Medication Guide (.pdf)   Mayzent is a registered trademark of Novartis International AG. Gilenya is a registered trademark of Novartis International AG     A. The FDA has approved Mayzent for the treatment of adults with (an initial neurological episode), and relapsing forms of MS, including and active secondary MS. People with active secondary progressive MS have had progression of disability but still experience acute relapses or new MRI activity. In the clinical trial, people who had secondary progressive MS and who had experienced at least one relapse within two years before entering the study were considered “active.”   A. The approval includes clinically isolated syndrome and relapsing forms of MS, including relapsing remitting MS and active secondary progressive MS. According to the prescribing information, Mayzent significantly reduced the risk of progression in those with active secondary progressive MS, but not in those who had non-active (without relapses) secondary progressive MS.   Like all clinical trials, the trial of Mayzent in secondary progressive MS limited the characteristics of people who could participate. The trial only included people who were aged 18 to 60, who had an EDSS (Expanded Disability Status Scale – a scale to assess neurological functioning used in clinical trials) score of 3.0 (meaning they were fully ambulatory but had  other functional limitations) up to 6.5 (meaning they were able to walk with the help of a walker or bilateral crutches or other devices on both sides). It is not possible to predict how a specific individual will respond to treatment. The use of Mayzent in clinical practice will help determine who is likely to benefit.   A. Mayzent is a tablet administered by mouth once daily.   Q. When will Mayzent be available by prescription? A. According to Novartis, people may talk to their MS healthcare providers now about taking Mayzent. The company expects supplies of the therapy to be available within a week of the approval. Accessing the medication also depends on issues related to an individual’s health insurance.   Q. Are there other therapies available for people with secondary progressive MS? A. Yes, depending on the type of secondary progressive MS they have. Secondary progressive MS follows an initial relapsing-remitting course. Many people who are initially diagnosed with relapsing-remitting MS eventually transition to a secondary progressive course in which there is a progressive worsening of neurologic function over time. Some people with secondary progressive MS can be characterized as either active (with relapses and/or evidence of new MRI activity) or not active, as well as with progression or without progression. Many available disease-modifying therapies are approved for use in “relapsing forms” of MS, which includes those individuals who have secondary progressive MS and who continue to have relapses and/or evidence of disease activity on MRI.   Q. Should individuals with relapsing forms of MS switch from their current therapy to Mayzent? A. The decision about whether to take Mayzent should be made in collaboration with the healthcare provider treating your MS, taking into account a variety of factors including the effectiveness of any therapy you are currently using, the potential risks and benefits, as well as costs and lifestyle factors. Important questions to be considered and discussed with your healthcare provider in terms of Mayzent include: What health conditions do I have that might discourage the switch to Mayzent? What is my tolerance for the risk of known side effects? What is my tolerance for the risk of adverse consequences that might emerge with longer-term use? How will my medication choice affect my ability or plans to become pregnant?   Q. If I have been taking another disease-modifying therapy for MS, how long will I have to wait before starting ? A.  Mayzent clears out of the system 10 days after the last dose. A decision to wait or proceed after that time needs to be made in collaboration with your MS healthcare provider   Q. Has Mayzent been proven to be more effective than other disease-modifying therapies? A. There is no evidence yet to answer this question, since Mayzent has only been compared to inactive placebo in clinical trials.   A. There is no specified time limit for taking Mayzent. As with other disease-modifying medications, Mayzent would likely be continued if the person’s MS is stable, and she/he is experiencing no adverse events or new safety issues that could be ascribed to the medication.   Q. Will people taking have to get any special medical tests or monitoring? A. Yes. The prescribing information contains advice to health care providers about tests people should undergo before beginning to take Mayzent. These include: Blood test for genetic testing to determine the person’s CYP2C9 genotype, because people with some variants of these genes would need a different dose of Mayzent or should not take it at all. Blood test for complete blood count and liver enzymes Blood test for antibodies to varicella zoster virus. In those who are negative, VZV vaccination is recommended. History of current or prior immune-suppressing medications, which may cause Mayzent to further reduce the ability to fight infections.  Most people without pre-existing heart conditions will receive a starter pack of tablets that gradually increases the daily dose over 5 days, before taking the full recommended daily dose. People with certain pre-existing heart conditions will need 6-hour or possibly longer heart monitoring when receiving their first dose of Mayzent.   Q. Will Mayzent help my mobility, prevent me from getting worse or reverse my progressive disability? A. Based on results from the clinical trials, Mayzent is likely to help stabilize a person’s disability progression. We do not know if will reverse an individual’s disability. In the phase 3 trial for secondary progressive MS, treatment with Mayzent significantly reduced the risk of progression of clinical disability. This reduced risk of progression means that as a group, people taking Mayzent were 21% less likely to demonstrate worsening of disability than people taking placebo. However, it is not possible to predict how any one individual will respond to this or any other therapy.   A. The wholesale acquisition cost (WAC) of Mayzent is $88,500 per year. However, the price to an individual who has MS will depend on the provisions of his or her insurance coverage and the degree to which that individual will be eligible for programs designed to assist with out-of-pocket costs. Coverage will depend on individual insurance plans. For people who qualify, Novartis plans to offer patient assistance programs through The Novartis Patient Assistance Foundation: 1-800-277-2254 or https://www.pharma.us.novartis.com/our-products/patient-assistance/patient-assistance-foundation-enrollment.     Q. Are there other therapies in development for progressive MS? A. Yes. The National MS Society is closely watching experimental treatments in development for people with progressive forms of MS. In addition, other studies include: Investigators at Oregon Health & Science University are conducting a Phase 2 clinical trial to determine if the oral supplement, lipoic acid, is an effective treatment for progressive forms of MS. The trial is co-funded by the Veteran’s Administration and the National MS Society. The SPRINT-MS trial of Ibudilast, an oral anti-inflammatory agent, demonstrated that it was well tolerated and significantly slowed the rate of brain atrophy compared to placebo in people with secondary progressive and primary progressive MS. This trial was a unique collaboration between NIH's NeuroNEXT Network, MediciNova, and the National MS Society. The MS-STAT2 study is underway at University College London, a multicenter trial testing whether a repurposed cholesterol-lowering therapy can slow the course of secondary progressive MS; the Society is providing funding.  The Society is also very interested in wellness research to identify exercise, dietary and other approaches that will help people who have MS live their best lives. The Society supports several clinical trials that are investigating dietary interventions for symptom management and for their potential to modify the disease process.    Based on these trial results, is there still a need to invest in additional research on progressive MS? A: Yes. We need to continue our investment in research to find solutions for progressive MS.  We welcome this development, but we must remain focused on finding more and better solutions for treating progressive MS. We will do this by our continued leadership in the International  and by funding research on progressive MS through our own research programs, and by encouraging other companies to commit to developing treatments for progressive forms of MS.   Multiple sclerosis is an unpredictable, often disabling . range from numbness and tingling to blindness and paralysis, and there is currently no cure for MS. The progress, severity and specific symptoms of MS in any one person cannot yet be predicted, but advances in and are leading to better understanding and moving us closer to . An estimated 1 million people live with MS in the United States. Most are diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 50, and it affects women three times more than men. © 2020 The National Multiple Sclerosis Society is a tax exempt 501(c)3 nonprofit organization.

8ae5757c-45d8-4f3f-a080-d480d9d358ad,"Reviewed by MSAA Chief Medical Officer Experimental and Approved Disease-Modifying Therapies This edition of MSAA’s “What’s New in MS Research” provides highlights from this year’s European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS) annual meeting. Experts from throughout the world gathered in Stockholm, Sweden in mid-September to share and discuss the latest research into the causes, diagnosis, course, and treatment of multiple sclerosis. Those investigators and clinicians were gathered for the 35th annual Congress of ECTRIMS, a key forum for presenting the findings that help advance evidence-based management of MS. This article focuses on more than a dozen studies with significance for people living with MS. The studies featured obviously constitute a very small sampling of the research unveiled in Stockholm. However, they provide a good sense of the depth, breadth, and innovation that mark the current state of research into multiple sclerosis. Experimental and Approved Disease-Modifying Therapies Ofatumumab: Favorable Phase III results set stage for seeking FDA approval Ofatumumab is a monoclonal antibody that people with relapsing-remitting MS could inject at home once a month. This experimental medication demonstrated positive Phase III study results, which were announced at the ECTRIMS 2019 meeting. Based on those results, the pharmaceutical company Novartis said it will file paperwork with the FDA by the end of this year seeking approval for use of ofatumumab in relapsing-remitting MS. The medication is already approved for the treatment of certain forms of leukemia under the brand name Arzerra. Two identically designed Phase III trials, ASCLEPIOS I and ASCEPLIOS II, compared ofatumumab to Aubagio (teriflunomide). More than 1,800 patients from 37 countries were enrolled in the trials. Those people were randomized on a 1:1 basis to receive either 20 mg of ofatumumab injected subcutaneously every four weeks, or daily, oral doses of 14 mg of Aubagio, for up to 30 months. The primary endpoint of both trials was impact on the annualized relapse rate, or ARR. In both studies, the ARR for patients receiving ofatumumab was less than half that of those receiving Aubagio. Ofatumumab also demonstrated greater suppression of gadolinium-enhancing T1 lesions on MRI – an indication of inflammatory activity – compared with Aubagio, and reduced the risk of three-month and six-month confirmed disability progression by roughly one-third relative to Aubagio. Meanwhile, safety data in the trial were comparable with that seen in earlier studies of the agent. Mayzent and delay in time to disability progression in secondary-progressive MS Mayzent (siponimod) helps patients with secondary-progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) delay the time until they need to use a wheelchair, according to a team of international researchers. In March 2019, the FDA approved Mayzent as the first oral drug to treat SPMS with active disease. The FDA’s approval was based on results of the Phase III EXPAND trial. Researchers drew on data from that trial to assess the impact that Mayzent had on people reaching an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 7.0, which reflects an inability to walk beyond a few steps and the need for wheelchair use. Analysis of data on more than 1,100 study participants found that, compared to placebo, Mayzent lengthened the median time to reaching an EDSS score of 7 or greater by 4.3 years (12.0 years for placebo vs 16.3 years for Mayzent). The reduction in risk of need for a wheelchair was greatest in people with more significant disability. In more than 400 study participants with an EDSS score of 6.5 at the study’s start, Mayzent cut the risk of needing a wheelchair by 28% to 36%, depending on the type of analysis employed. Impact of extending Tysabri dosing interval on relapse rates Tysabri (natalizumab) has demonstrated its efficacy in treating relapsing-remitting MS, but the standard dosing schedule of a 300-mg infusion every four weeks is associated with increased risk for progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a serious and potentially life-threatening disease. In an effort to continue providing people with MS with the benefits of Tysabri while reducing their risk for PML, researchers have explored whether extending the period between infusions can preserve the disease-modifying effects of the drug while diminishing the chances of developing PML. With earlier research showing that extended interval dosing (EID) lowers the risk of PML compared to standard interval dosing (SID), a large, long-term observational study presented at ECTRIMS 2019 examined the differences in effectiveness when extending the time between treatments. Investigators drew on data from the Tysabri Observational Program (TOP) to compare 135 pairs of patients. One patient in each pair had received Tysabri on the standard-interval schedule, while the other had extended-interval dosing. The researchers found no significant difference in annualized relapse rate (ARR) or risk of relapse between the two groups. They added that a randomized, prospective study comparing the two treatment approaches is needed to provide more-definitive evidence. What’s the risk of “rebound” disease activity after stopping Gilenya? People with MS may decide to stop a disease-modifying therapy (DMT) for any number of reasons, ranging from side effects or a perceived lack of effectiveness to a desire to switch to another agent or to be “treatment-free” for a period of time. The importance of consulting with a clinician before stopping treatment is underscored by the risk for rebound disease activity, or RDA, which can occur once a medication that is taken to control MS is discontinued. Investigators recently examined the records of 117 patients to determine the risk for RDA after stopping Gilenya, and to see if any factors made people more prone to experiencing “rebound.” The group included 86 women and 31 men. Nine of the 117 patients, or 7.7%, had RDA after stopping Gilenya, with the rebound activity marked by severe clinical relapses with exaggerated MRI lesions compared to their level of disease activity before starting the DMT. Compared to patients who did not experience RDA upon stopping treatment, those who did have rebound activity had a higher annualized relapse rate (ARR) before initiating Gilenya, and also had a shorter interval between their last relapse and their first dose of the medication. The duration of Gilenya treatment did not appear to affect the likelihood of rebound. The researchers added that eight of the nine people experiencing RDA had stopped treatment abruptly. In an observation that again reinforces the importance of working closely with a clinician when considering any change to treatment approach, the investigators concluded, “Our results indicate that [a] fingolimod every-other-day cessation strategy may help to prevent RDA.” Patients at the Cleveland Clinic’s Mellen Center for Multiple Sclerosis had lower rates of adverse events (AEs) with Ocrevus (ocrelizumab) than did patients in the Phase III clinical trials that led to the disease-modifying therapy’s approval in March 2017, according to Mellen Center researchers. In the Mellen Center cohort, 3.3% had a serious adverse event, while 21% had an infection – typically a urinary tract infection or upper respiratory infection – and 18% had an infusion-related reaction. By contrast, in the OPERA I and OPERA II trials of Ocrevus in RRMS, 6.9% and 7.0%, respectively, of patients receiving Ocrevus had a serious adverse event, 56.9% and 60.2% had an infection, and 30.9% and 37.6% had at least one infusion-related reaction. Similarly, in the ORATORIO trial of Ocrevus in PPMS, 20.4% of Ocrevus patients had a serious adverse event, and 39.9% had one or more infusion-related reactions. The Mellen Center researchers noted that the lower rates of adverse events that they recorded may have been due to differences in reporting. They also observed that patients at their institution had longer average disease duration and fewer enhancing lesions at baseline than clinical trial participants. The real-world findings are, nonetheless, welcome and reassuring. FDA approves Vumerity™, a fumarate medication designed to address GI tolerability Clinicians know that the medications that work best are those that patients take regularly. For this reason, the tolerability of an agent can be as important as its effectiveness. In a nod to this reality, Biogen and Alkermes developed Vumerity™ (diroximel fumarate) to provide the efficacy already demonstrated by Biogen’s disease-modifying therapy Tecfidera (dimethyl fumarate), but with fewer of the gastrointestinal (GI) side effects reported with the latter medication. In late October, a few weeks after MS researchers returned from ECTRIMS 2019, the FDA announced that it had approved Vumerity for use in relapsing forms of MS, including clinically isolated syndrome and relapsing-remitting MS. In pursuing FDA approval for Vumerity, Biogen provided data from the EVOLVE-MS-1 study, an ongoing, Phase III, single-arm, open-label, two-year safety study enrolling patients with relapsing-remitting MS. Interim results from the study submitted to the FDA showed that 6.3% of patients had stopped Vumerity due to adverse events, with fewer than 1% stopping because of gastrointestinal events. In the clinical trials leading to approval of Tecfidera, 18% of patients reported abdominal pain, 14% reported diarrhea, 12% cited nausea, and 9% reported vomiting. A tilt toward monoclonal antibody therapy as first-line MS treatment Neurologists’ top choice of an initial multiple sclerosis (MS) treatment has shifted from interferon-based medications to monoclonal antibodies. That was the main finding of an analysis of data on more than 1,000 people with MS who began their first disease-modifying therapy (DMT) in late 2018 or early 2019. In December 2018 and January 2019, investigators drew on records from 213 U.S. neurologists to examine those physicians’ prescribing of MS medications over the prior three months. They then compared that 2018-2019 information with comparable data on the first medications prescribed to more than 1,000 “treatment-naïve” patients (individuals who had never taken a DMT previously) in early 2018, and another 1,020 patients who received their first DMT in 2017. Researchers found that in late 2018-early 2019, 18% of treatment-naïve patients started a monoclonal antibody medication as their first DMT, compared with 8% in 2017. Conversely, the proportion of newly treated patients receiving an interferon-based medication declined from 26% in 2017 to 17% in 2019. The investigators noted that greater prescribing of Ocrevus (ocrelizumab) drove much of the increase in monoclonal antibody use, and was accompanied by a quantitatively measured increase in neurologists’ comfort level with using Ocrevus for relapsing-remitting forms of MS. They added that the 2017 approval of a generic version of Copaxone (glatiramer acetate, or GA) also had significantly affected neurologists’ choice of a first-line DMT, with branded GA seeing its share of first-line prescriptions declining from 27% in 2017 to 18% in 2019, while generic GA went from accounting for 4% of first-line prescriptions in 2017 to 13% in 2019. Further evidence supporting early initiation of disease-modifying therapy Increasing age, duration of multiple sclerosis (MS), and greater disability detract from the effectiveness of disease-modifying therapies, according to an analysis of data on more than 14,000 patients. While those findings may seem intuitive, the researchers went further and quantified the extent to which medication therapy was diminished per year, per 1-point change in Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score, and other measures. The study drew on the MSBase Registry, examining data for 14,717 people who had been followed for at least one year. Seventy-two percent of the patients were female. The mean age at first visit was 36 years, and the patients had a mean duration of disease of 5.7 years and a median EDSS score of 2. Roughly three-quarters had clinically definite MS, while 20% had a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). The researchers found that patients receiving treatment were 39% more likely to experience confirmed improvement of disability than their untreated counterparts. However, this effect of therapy declined with age (-2% per year), disease duration (-6% per year), and disability (-8% per EDSS step). In an observation that reinforces the value of early initiation of treatment, the investigators concluded, “Immunotherapies exert their maximum effect in young patients with shorter disease course, mild disability and a previous stability on treatment.” Tracking changes in use of DMTs as well as complementary and alternative interventions People with MS are drawing on both disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) and complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) interventions in managing their health, according to a recent survey of more than 1,100 patients in Oregon and southwest Washington. Fielded from September 2018 to April 2019, the survey identified respondents’ use of both prescription medications for MS and interventions such as herbs and supplements, cannabis, dietary plans, and yoga. In addition to assessing current approaches to MS, researchers compared results from the 2018-2019 questionnaire with answers to a similar survey conducted in 2001. Those investigators found that the proportion of people taking a DMT at the time they were surveyed increased from 47% in 2001 to 69% now. Use of CAM at time of survey response also increased during that period, from 68% to 93%. Eighty-six percent of respondents to the 2018-2019 survey reported having employed exercise in managing their MS, with the proportion of people who have tried yoga increasing from 23% in 2001 to 46% in the recent survey. The proportion of people reporting having used meditation also increased, 16% to 39%. A majority of respondents to both surveys reported having used diet to manage their MS, with a slight increase from 59% in 2001 to 66% more recently. Low-carbohydrate and anti-inflammatory diets were the most commonly followed approaches in both surveys. Researchers noted that they will further analyze their data to explore differences in perceived benefit of DMTs between CAM users and nonusers. Three key take-aways emerge from this research. First, more people are doing more than ever before to take a pro-active approach to dealing with their MS. Second, many people have rejected the false dichotomy of either using only a prescription medication or rejecting such agents in favor of exclusive reliance on alternative approaches. Third, as use of alternative approaches grows, it is important for patients to talk openly with their clinicians about all interventions they are employing or considering, particularly given the potential for interaction between herbs and some supplements and prescription medications. Ninety-three percent of the 81 MS patients to undergo stem-cell transplantation at a Swedish center between 2004 and February 2019 remained progression free over an average follow-up period of 3.9 years, and none have died since undergoing the procedure. The investigators presenting that heartening news at the 2019 ECTRIMS meeting added that 87% of the patients had not experienced a relapse since transplantation, and that the annualized relapse rate (ARR) for the entire group was 0.022. By comparison, the group’s mean ARR for the year prior to the procedure was 2.2. The patients consisted of 56 women and 25 men. Their median age was 29 years, and 95% had relapsing-remitting MS. Conversely, stem-cell transplantation did not reduce the number of active lesions seen on MRI after 24 weeks of treatment in a major international study, but did show promise in reducing the relapse rate, one of the investigation’s lead researchers told the press in discussing preliminary results presented at the 2019 ECTRIMS meeting. The MESEMS trial (MEsenchymal StEm cells for Multiple Sclerosis) was a randomized, double-blind, cross-over phase II trial examining the impact of autologous mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). Most of the 144 patients randomized for treatment had relapsing-remitting MS, while roughly 20% had secondary-progressive MS, and a little over 10% had primary-progressive MS. The study’s authors noted that the results presented at ECTRIMS were preliminary, and that further analysis is needed. Assessing the impact of plasma exchange when steroids don’t help with relapses Therapeutic plasma exchange – or plasmapheresis – is a technique clinicians sometimes employ when steroids aren’t helping to resolve an MS relapse. The process involves withdrawing whole blood from a vein, separating the plasma – or liquid portion of the blood – from the red and white blood cells, and then transfusing the red and white blood cells back into the patient, along with plasma replacement fluid. This “blood cleansing” approach is fairly uncommon, so Austrian and German researchers recently analyzed 14 years’ worth of data on 133 patients at their MS clinics to better understand its effectiveness. The investigators assessed clinical response to plasma exchange, with a marked clinical response defined as ≥1 step improvement in the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and mild clinical improvement – which was characterized by improvement in neurological examination with change of EDSS <1 step. They also identified patients who had no improvement. Seventy-six percent of patients undergoing therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) saw improvement, with 36% having marked improvement and 40% experiencing mild improvement. In general, TPE was more effective in younger patients, those with a shorter duration of disease, and with a shorter interval between relapse and receiving TPE. By exploring how often and to what extent TPE helps patients who have not benefited sufficiently from steroids during relapses – and by identifying which patients are likely to have the best response to the treatment – the researchers have provided clinicians with valuable insights on a less commonly employed treatment option. A team of Canadian researchers showed in a small study that blood levels of a protein called serum neurofilament light chain (NfL) measured in the first five years after onset of symptoms can provide important insights on a patient’s likely course over the next 15 years. In analyzing data on 64 people with MS, they found that patients with a serum NfL level greater than 7.62 pg/mL had a nine-times greater risk of developing secondary-progressive MS over the following several years than people with lower blood levels of the protein. Similarly, when they divided patients into three groups, based on whether they had low, medium, or high NfL levels, they found that those with the highest level had more aggressive disease progression, with their Expanded Disability Stats Scale (EDSS) score increasing by 0.16 per year, reflecting greater impairment. Similarly, patients in the lowest NfL levels were 5.3-times less likely than others to reach an EDSS of 4.0 or greater. The researchers noted that their findings were consistent across the adult age range and in both men and women. They concluded that their study “demonstrates an association between early disease serum NfL and long term clinical outcomes over the longest follow-up to-date. Whether the course of such patients can be altered by earlier treatment will require further study.” In another study, a Spanish investigator has developed evidence indicating that the presence and prevalence of certain types of bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract can serve as predictive factors in assessing the long-term course of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). The gut microbiome – the milieu of bacteria and other molecules found in the gastrointestinal tract – is a major component of the body’s immune system, and in recent years has emerged as a focus of intense study in MS. Earlier research indicates that people with MS or at heightened risk for MS have imbalances in the mix of bacteria normally found in the GI tract of healthy people. The study reported at the 2019 ECTRIMS meeting involved using molecular sequencing of stool samples to study the gut microbiota – or composition of bacterial species – of 16 people with RRMS and 15 healthy controls. The investigators then followed the people with MS over 24 months. They found that levels of family of bacteria, and particularly two types of bacteria within that family known as and were associated with an increased risk of relapses and new lesions appearing on MRI. While this was a small study whose findings need to be explored on a larger scale, it points to the many ways researchers are homing in on factors that help chart the likely course of disease – and that eventually will help patients and their clinicians formulate treatment plans accordingly. People with MS have elevated risk for other conditions even before their MS diagnosis Even before they are diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, people with MS are more likely than others to have bladder problems, eye issues, and other conditions, according to a Swedish study involving more than 6,600 people with MS and almost 62,000 healthy controls. The people ultimately identified as having MS had a higher pre-diagnosis incidence of epilepsy (1.5% vs. 0.8%), autoimmune disease (1.3% vs 0.7%), bladder dysfunction (1.2% vs 0.2%), and retinal disorders (2.4% vs 1.2%) compared with controls. After MS diagnosis, the patients continued to have considerably higher rates of epilepsy, autoimmune diseases, and bladder dysfunction, as well as of toxic liver disease. The research team concluded, “Before a diagnosis of MS, patients already displayed an increased rate of comorbidity compared with MS-free controls. After diagnosis, patients with MS continued to display increased risk of several comorbidities, some of which may be explained by surveillance bias due to more frequent contact with healthcare.” Measuring the toll of MS on women’s physical, mental function Multiple sclerosis accelerates age-related physiologic decline in physical and mental function by 10-20 years in women with MS compared to their same-age counterparts. That is the unwelcome but important conclusion of researchers who drew on data from the large-scale Nurses Health Study and Nurses Health Study II and compared participants’ physical function and cognitive function scores with those of 582 women with confirmed MS. They found that women with MS who were ages 36 to 41 years had, on average, physical function comparable to that of unaffected women aged 58 to 62 years. Middle-aged women with MS were about three-times more likely than their age peers to report a slower walking pace and more than twice as likely to report almost daily urine leaks. At higher ages, women with MS were five-times more likely than unaffected peers to report problems with balance. Among women over age 75 years, women with MS were less likely to report good cognitive function than women without MS. The results, while not encouraging, are not entirely surprising either, and underscore the importance of pursuing overall good health through clinician-approved diet and exercise programs in order to optimize well-being. Recurrent demyelinating events in children: Identifying frequency and risk factors Two-thirds of children who have a first demyelinating event (FDE) will go on to have at least one more such event, with older age at FDE, presence of more than five lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and symptoms suggestive of a brainstem syndrome being among several risk factors for further events. Those were the key findings to emerge from an observational cohort study involving 75 children who had an FDE between 1999 and 2018. The children included 46 girls and 29 boys; their median age was 12 years. In 80% of cases, the FDE involved a single neurological symptom. Thirty-six had optic neuritis, while 15 had transverse myelitis, and 14 had symptoms indicative of a brainstem syndrome. Final diagnoses included multiple sclerosis (32 children), relapsing optic neuritis (7), and syndromes including polyphasic acute disseminated encephalomyelitis and neuromyelitis optica. Fifty-six percent of the children experienced a relapse within 60 months of their FDE, and the overall risk of relapse was calculated at 65%. A clinical presentation indicating a brainstem syndrome was associated with a 10-fold higher risk for a second demyelinating event compared with other clinical presentations, while being age 11 years or older at the time of the FDE more than doubled the risk of recurrence compared to younger children. MRI findings of periventricular, subcortical, brainstem, and lateral spinal lesions also were associated with increased risk. As investigators better understand the risks of – and risk factors for – recurrent demyelinating events in young people, clinicians can formulate their counseling approaches, diagnostic strategies, and treatment decisions accordingly to enhance care and help children and their families know what to anticipate.

77861db6-a8f0-4a6b-9ded-df166d22724f,"Highlights from The American Academy of Neurology’s Annual Meeting Highlights from The American Academy of Neurology’s Annual Meeting : For easier reading, certain definitions have been included within the text and are often repeated throughout the article. Additionally, for easier reading, a brand name of an approved drug is used versus the generic name wherever possible. This year’s American Academy of Neurology (AAN) meeting was especially exciting for multiple sclerosis (MS) clinicians and researchers. Results were presented from clinical trials that have been ongoing for the past three-to-four years, many of which focus on the ""new generation"" of oral drugs for managing MS progression. Studies have looked at the effectiveness and safety of the new agents, particularly as compared to the standard injectible drugs that became available starting in the early 1990’s. Data on these new agents have been released gradually as the studies progressed through the clinical trials process, and anticipation of the details from completed studies has been building. In the DEFINE Phase III study, BG-12 previously demonstrated significant reductions in the proportion of patients who experienced a relapse, in annualized relapse rate (ARR), and in disability progression, when compared to placebo in patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). These data were presented in late 2011 at the ECTRIMS/ACTRIMS meeting. (Please refer to MSAA’s for an overview of the ECTRIMS/ACTRIMS joint meeting highlights.) MRI results from the DEFINE study were presented at this year’s AAN meeting and focused on brain atrophy (shrinkage) as well as lesion volume as seen on MRI. After two years, brain atrophy, as measured by a decrease in the volume of brain tissue, was much less extensive in the groups receiving BG-12 twice or three times per day (""BID"" and ""TID""), with reductions in brain atrophy of 30 percent and 17 percent versus placebo. There was also a significant reduction in MS-related lesion activity in the treated groups. Clinical results were presented for the CONFIRM two-year Phase III study of 1,417 patients. The study compared BG-12 (given either twice per day or three times per day) against placebo and Copaxone (glatiramer acetate) against placebo. The primary endpoint was the a ARR (relapse rate) at two years; secondary clinical endpoints included the proportion of patients who experienced a relapse, and disability progression as measured by the Expanded Disability Status Scale ( EDSS). Both dosing regimens of BG-12 significantly reduced the ARR compared to individuals taking a placebo, by 44 percent and 51 percent, respectively. BG-12 reduced the risk of relapse by 34 percent (when taken twice per day) and 45 percent (when taken three times per day) versus placebo, while Copaxone reduced the risk of relapse by 29 percent versus placebo. BG-12’s side effects were generally mild. These included skin flushing, stomach cramps, diarrhea, and vomiting, mostly during the first few weeks of treatment. These clinical and MRI data further support the earlier clinical data from the DEFINE study. They suggest that BG-12 has the potential to be a valuable treatment option for people with RRMS. The much-awaited full results of the Phase III CARE-MS 1 and CARE-MS 2 studies were presented at the AAN. Early results were first released in the fall of 2011 at the ECTRIMS/ACTRIMS joint meeting. : The CARE-MS I study compared the clinical and MRI results of treatment with alemtuzumab, to treatment with subcutaneous interferon beta-1a (Rebif) in patients with RRMS who had not received prior treatment with any disease-modifying therapies. Rebif was given according to the regular dosing of three times per week, while alemtuzumab was given intravenously for five days, and then a second time one year later for three days. CARE-MS I was a multicenter international trial. Data were collected for each patient during a two-year period from the time of the first infusion. Clinical Results: The ARR (relapse rate) was 0.18 (or slightly less than one relapse every five years) for alemtuzumab-treated patients. This was as compared with 0.39 (or slightly less than one relapse every two-and-a-half years) for Rebif-treated patients. This means that alemtuzumab reduced the ARR 55-percent more than Rebif. The proportion of patients who were relapse-free was 77.6 percent with alemtuzumab compared to 58.7 percent with Rebif. Alemtuzumab’s relapse reduction was significantly greater beginning the first year of study, with a relapse rate of 22 percent among alemtuzumab patients compared with 46 percent among individuals receiving Rebif. This relapse reduction further increased during the second year of study. Supportive analyses of the risk of severe relapses found that the risk was lower with alemtuzumab. Individuals taking alemtuzumab had a 64-percent reduction in severe relapses, and a 59-percent reduction in relapses requiring steroid treatment. The significant reduction in relapses with alemtuzumab compared with high-dose, high-frequency Rebif suggest that there is potential for alemtuzumab to be a meaningful addition to treatment options for RRMS. MRI Results: These clinical data were supported by MRI outcomes. Through Year 2, fewer alemtuzumab patients developed new gadolinium-enhancing lesions (areas of active inflammation and myelin damage in the brain) than Rebif-treated patients (15.2 percent versus 27.2 percent). Additional positive MRI data favoriting alemtuzumab include the finding that alemtuzumab reduced median T1-hypointense lesion volume (lesions with lower intensity) more than Rebif from baseline to Year 2. The volume of lesions with lower intensity was reduced by 21.6 percent with alemtuzumab, versus 1 percent with Rebif. This MRI data supports the clinical benefits of alemtuzumab over Rebif seen in previous comparative studies. CARE-MS II is the third study to compare alemtuzumab with Rebif (interferon beta-1a given subcutaneously). It was designed to evaluate the effect of alemtuzumab on relapse and disability as compared to Rebif in people with RRMS who had relapsed on prior therapy. The study design was the same as that in CARE-MS I. The co-primary efficacy endpoints were the ARR and time to six-month sustained accumulation of disability as measured by the EDSS disability scale. The group treated with alemtuzumab showed a decrease in the mean EDSS score, versus a slight worsening of disability in those treated with Rebif. Approximately 29 percent of patients treated with alemtuzumab experienced a six-month sustained reduction in disability, as compared to 13 percent with Rebif. Relapse data showed that 65 percent of patients treated with alemtuzumab were relapse-free at two years, as compared to 47 percent with Rebif. These data also showed a 49-percent reduction in relapse rate as compared to Rebif. The adverse event profile was consistent with previous studies. A program to monitor for development of thyroid issues and immune thrombocytopenia was successful in early detection of these known complications from alemtuzumab. (Immune thrombocytopenia is a condition where the number of circulating platelets in the blood is reduced; symptoms include a tendency for bleeding and bruising.) Based on the data from these studies, it is expected that alemtuzumab will be submitted to the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as well as the EMA (the European equivalent of the FDA) to approve its use in treating RRMS. [Update: On June 12, 2012, the parent company announced that alemtuzumab had been submitted to both the FDA and the EMA for approval in treating relapsing forms of MS.] The Phase III TRANSFORMS study of 1,153 patients with RRMS compared Gilenya to interferon beta-1a. Clinically, 83 percent of those on Gilenya were free of relapses as compared to 69 percent of the interferon beta-1a patients. There was no statistical difference between the groups in terms of disability progression. MRI measures showed 56 percent versus 49 percent to be free of new/enlarging T2 (more intense) lesions, and 90 percent versus 81 percent were free of Gd-enhancing T1 (less intense) lesions. As has been the case for the interferons and Copaxone, a pregnancy registry is ongoing to determine the effects of Gilenya treatment on maternal, fetal, and infant health. This six-year multinational study will include up to 500 women who were exposed to Gilenya shortly before or at any time during pregnancy. Based on data about cardiovascular risks, the United States prescribing information for Gilenya has been updated, adding new contraindications to treatment. These include a history or presence of cardiac conditions (such as myocardial infarction or stroke in the previous six months, second-and third-degree atrioventricular block, or other serious cardiac rhythm disturbances) or in patients treated with certain antiarrhythmic drugs. The updated prescribing information recommends that all patients starting treatment should undergo electrocardiography immediately before the first dose and at the end of the initial six-hour observation period, along with hourly measurement of blood pressure and heart rate. (For more information on Gilenya, please refer to MSAA’s online news article, """") Data were presented on two new investigational oral agents now in Phase II trials that have a mechanism similar to that of Gilenya (fingolimod). Both drugs were well tolerated and reduced lesions related to RRMS. It is hoped that these agents, ONO-4641 and siponimod (BAF312), will maintain or improve on the efficacy and safety of Gilenya. However, both were still associated with cardiovascular effects, such as bradycardia (slowed heart rate). No direct comparison to Gilenya has been reported as yet for these new agents. In the Phase 2 DreaMS trial, led by the University of Colorado in Denver, 407 patients with RRMS were randomly assigned to placebo or one of three different doses of ONO-4641 (0.05 mg, 0.10 mg, or 0.15 mg once daily for 26 weeks). Patients were included if they had EDSS disability scores of up to 5.5, had two or more relapses during the two years before the trial, or one or more in the previous year, or one or more gadolinium-enhancing (active) lesions within the previous three months. The primary endpoint was the number of T1 (less intense) gadolinium-enhancing lesions on MRI; secondary endpoints included new and enlarging T2 (more intense) lesions. All three treatment groups showed a substantial decrease in MRI disease activity as measured both by gadolinium-enhancing lesion numbers and new or enlarging T2 lesions. A reduction in the number of cumulative T1 lesions was seen from weeks 10 to 26 with each of the three drug doses relative to placebo. Compared to placebo, lesion counts were reduced by 82 percent in the 0.05 mg/day group; 92 percent in the 0.10 mg/day group, and 77 percent in the 0.15 mg/day group. The study was not designed to evaluate relapse rates or disability progression, but there was a statistically significant decrease in relapse rate with the 0.10-mg dose. Most of the patients have gone on to an open-label safety extension phase (where everyone is taking the active drug and no one is on a placebo). More safety data will be gathered and the drug is expected to advance to a Phase III study. Adverse events were similar to those seen with Gilenya, including bradycardia and lymphopenia (a reduction in circulating lymphocytes) in some patients. These were dose-related. Researchers at the University of Texas Southwestern in Dallas reported data from a Phase II dose-finding study of siponimod in patients with RRMS. Siponimod has a relatively short half-life compared to Gilenya, which means that the drug does not stay in the body as long. Researchers hope that this will minimize cardiac issues. The trial had a complex design whose goal was to determine the most appropriate dosing regimen. One group of 188 patients received placebo or once-daily siponimod in doses of 10 mg, 2 mg, or 0.5 mg for six months. A second group of 109 patients were given one of two additional intermediate doses of 1.25 mg or 0.25 mg for three months. Patients completing the core study were eligible for a three-month extension. At six months, the proportion of relapse-free patients as compared to placebo was 84 percent for the 10-mg group, 92 percent for the 2-mg group, and 77 percent for the 0.5-mg group. In the placebo group, 72 percent were relapse-free. After six months, the ARR (relapse rate) was lower with the three higher doses than the two lower doses and placebo. Additionally, MRI findings indicated that treatment with siponimod was associated with a reduction in active lesions on MRI. The 2-mg dose reached statistical significance versus placebo, with a reduction in active lesions of approximately 80 percent. Tysabri is one of the eight FDA-approved disease-modifying therapies for relapsing forms of MS. A very small percentage of patients (approximately one in one thousand) taking this drug may develop progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a serious and potentially fatal condition. PML is caused by the activation of the JC virus (JCV), which typically remains dormant in those exposed to the virus, but may become active when the immune system is weakened (such as when taking a medication that suppresses the immune system). A blood test is now available to see if an individual has been exposed to the JC virus. Three risk factors have been identified for developing PML. The risk factors (now added to Tysabri’s label) are: The presence of anti-JCV antibodies, which identifies a previous exposure to the JC virus Longer duration of Tysabri treatment, especially for more than two years Prior treatment with an immunosuppressant medication, such as mitoxantrone (Novantrone), azathioprine (Imuran), methotrexate, cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan), or mycophenolate. In a study of nine patients who discontinued the drug after testing positive for the JC virus, five experienced relapses within six months. Of those, three who returned to Tysabri and one who used an alternative therapy failed to return to the functional level they had while taking Tysabri. (For more information on these risk factors and the test for JCV antibodies, please refer to MSAA’s online news article, ""."") Rituximab has previously been shown to be effective in treating RRMS. A small German study of 15 patients (11 with SPMS, one with PPMS, and three with neuromyelitis optica) tested this monoclonal antibody, which selectively depletes a specific subpopulation of B cells (a type of lymphocyte, which are immune-system cells produced to fight infection and disease) . Primary endpoints were confirmed disease progression as measured by an increase in score on the EDSS disability scale and MRI indicators of progression. Secondary endpoints were ARR (relapse rate) and safety parameters. In all 15 patients, Rituximab reduced inflammatory brain lesions and clinical relapses. It also showed a stabilizing of EDSS and progression as indicated by MRI. This study was too small to provide statistical data, but testing in larger numbers of patients – especially those with PPMS rather than a mixture of diagnoses – would be of interest. The Results of the CombiRx Trial Show No Added Benefit Over Treatment with the Individual Drugs The CombiRx trial of Copaxone (glatiramer acetate) and Avonex (interferon-beta-1a given via intermuscular injection) combination therapy in RRMS has been ongoing since 2005, involved 1,008 patients with RRMS, and many have been waiting with much anticipation for the results to be announced. Since the two drugs have quite different mechanisms of action, it was hoped that combining them might yield a significant improvement in clinical response. For the combination to be considered more effective, it had to be significantly superior to the more effective of the two monotherapy treatments (Copaxone and Avonex), and that was mostly not the case. Clinically, the combination did not outperform the individual drugs in rates of disability progression and time to first relapse. Changes on the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC) did not differ between groups. (The MSFC is a scale that measures both lower and upper extremity function, as well as cognitive function.) No differences were seen in the percentage of patients experiencing a relapse over the course of three years, or the time to first relapse, in patients treated with either drug alone or with the combination. In addition, the combination did not show an advantage over either drug alone in several key radiologic (MRI) measures, including brain atrophy, the volume of normal-appearing grey and white matter, and T2 lesions. The only area in which the combination was slightly more effective compared to either drug alone was in terms of new lesion activity visible on MRI and the accumulation of total lesion volume. Ampyra™ (dalfampridine) is an oral, timed-release medication developed to improve the conduction of impulses between damaged nerves of the central nervous system (CNS). Ampyra was approved by the FDA in January 2010, after Phase III clinical trials showed that a greater number of individuals with MS experienced improvement in walking speed when taking Ampyra, compared to when taking a placebo. Ampyra is the first drug to be approved to increase walking speed in individuals with MS. Its benefits continue to be observed in clinical trials for up to five years in an extension study. This study has 483 patients, all of whom participated in a late-stage clinical trial with Ampyra. (For more information on Ampyra, please refer to MSAA’s online news article, ""Ampyra™ Approved to Improve Walking for Individuals with MS."") CCSVI (chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency) The evidence continues to increase that occlusions (obstructions) of the vascular system (CCSVI) in cerebrospinal veins (certain veins located in the head and neck) imaged with ultrasound and magnetic resonance venography do not appear to be related to multiple sclerosis. Reports from an ongoing study at the University of Texas Health Sciences Center in Houston showed that people with and without MS had abnormalities consistent with CCSVI, and that this abnormality was not more common in people with MS. The group used strict ultrasound criteria definitions, and concluded that their tests – neurosonography and magnetic resonance venography – did not support the concept that CCSVI is causally involved in MS. Shortly after the AAN meeting, the FDA issued an alert about risks, including death, associated with the surgical treatment of CCSVI. Further tests must be approved by the FDA for patient safety monitoring as well as rigorous measurement of any potential treatment effects. Further clinical trials are planned.

Systematic screening of generic drugs for progressive multiple sclerosis identifies clomipramine as a promising therapeutic Systematic screening of generic drugs for progressive multiple sclerosis identifies clomipramine as a promising therapeutic , Article number:  () The treatment of progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) is unsatisfactory. One reason is that the drivers of disease, which include iron-mediated neurotoxicity, lymphocyte activity, and oxidative stress, are not simultaneously targeted. Here we present a systematic screen to identify generic, orally available medications that target features of progressive MS. Of 249 medications that cross the blood–brain barrier, 35 prevent iron-mediated neurotoxicity in culture. Of these, several antipsychotics and antidepressants strongly reduce T-cell proliferation and oxidative stress. We focus on the antidepressant clomipramine and found that it additionally inhibits B-lymphocyte activity. In mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a model of MS, clomipramine ameliorates clinical signs of acute and chronic phases. Histologically, clomipramine reduces inflammation and microglial activation, and preserves axonal integrity. In summary, we present a systematic approach to identify generic medications for progressive multiple sclerosis with the potential to advance rapidly into clinical trials, and we highlight clomipramine for further development. Multiple sclerosis is a multifactorial inflammatory condition of the CNS leading to damage of the myelin sheath and axons/neurons followed by neurological symptoms. Approximately 85% of multiple sclerosis patients present with a relapsing-remitting phenotype and the majority of these evolve to a secondary-progressive disease course after 15–20 years. 10–15% of the patients experience a primary progressive disease course with slow and continuous deterioration without definable relapses. While there have been tremendous successes in the development of medications for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis during the last decade, nearly all studies conducted in progressive multiple sclerosis have failed such as the recently published INFORMS study on the sphingosine-1-phosphate inhibitor fingolimod. However, the results of two Phase 3 trials of ocrelizumab in primary progressive and siponimod in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis were announced recently to have met their primary outcomes. Orcelizumab has since been approved for use in primary progressive MS. The reasons for the general lack of medications in progressive multiple sclerosis are manifold. One explanation is that the underlying pathology of progressive multiple sclerosis has profound differences to the relapsing-remitting form. Examples include the more pronounced neurodegenerative aspects of the progressive disease in conjunction with significant mitochondrial damage, iron accumulation which contributes to the elevated oxidative stress from several sources, and the more common representation of B-cell follicular structures underneath the meninges in progressive cases. Moreover, the blood–brain barrier in progressive multiple sclerosis appears to be repaired compared to the breach in relapsing-remitting disease, so medications will require the capacity to enter the CNS. Another pathologic feature seen in all types of multiple sclerosis but appears exacerbated in progressive cases is intense focal microglia activation. We previously conducted a systematic screen on microglia inhibition using the drug library of the NINDS Custom collection II (US Drug Collection); the majority of compounds in this library are generic medications. Out of 1040 compounds, 123 reduced tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) production by activated microglia by over 50%. Based on this research, we expanded our screen to investigate other features relevant to progressive multiple sclerosis, including the potential of generic compounds to affect iron-mediated neurotoxicity, maintain mitochondria integrity, and scavenge free radicals. We sought also to shortlist a compound for further activity against T-lymphocytes and B-lymphocytes, given that the adaptive immune response continues to be active within the CNS compartment in progressive multiple sclerosis, and we sought to interrogate whether the compound affects experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model of MS. Out of 249 investigated medications, 35 prevented iron-mediated neurotoxicity in culture. Out of these, several reduced the proliferation of T-lymphocytes and had antioxidative potential. The tricyclic antidepressant clomipramine also affected B-lymphocyte proliferation, reduced clinical signs in acute EAE concomitant with improved histology, and improved the chronic phase in two EAE models. Generics protect against iron and rotenone neurotoxicity Of the 1040 compounds available in the NINDS Custom Collection II, we first conducted a search of available information to exclude those that were either experimental, agricultural, not available as oral drug, not listed at Health Canada, steroid hormones or veterinary medications. Moreover, we omitted those that were not known to cross the blood–brain barrier. We note that while we selected drugs that are orally available, for ease of use, this does not imply that injectable medications would not be effective medications in progressive multiple sclerosis, as illustrated by ocrelizumab recently. Out of the original list, 791 compounds were thus excluded and 249 were selected for further testing. The detailed information of each of the 249 compounds is provided in Supplementary Dataset . The 249 compounds were first tested against iron toxicity to human neurons in culture. Neurons were pre-incubated with each compound for 1 h followed by application of FeSO. Ferrous iron (25 and 50 μM) is very toxic to neurons, with >80% loss of microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP-2)-labeled neurons by 24 h in most experiments compared to the control condition (Supplementary Figs. –, Supplementary Data set ). An example of iron toxicity and a drug screen is shown in Fig. . Of all drugs tested, 35 compounds showed statistically significant protection from FeSO-mediated neurotoxicity (Fig. ). Of these, antipsychotics, such as clozapine or periciazine, and tricyclic antidepressants, such as clomipramine or desipramine, exhibited strong protection, as shown after normalization across at least 2–4 experiments ( of four wells of cells per experiment per test condition) to the number of neurons of the respective control conditions (Fig. ). For example, while the average loss of neurons over 24 h in response to FeSO was 85.5% (i.e., 14.5% of surviving neurons compared to 100% of controls), clomipramine at 10 μM completely prevented neuronal loss (107.3% of controls). Other categories of medications with neuroprotective actions against iron included antihypertensives and some antibiotics. We note that minocycline, an antibiotic that reduces the conversion of a first demyelinating event to clinically definite multiple sclerosis in a Phase 3 clinical trial, was not included in the 1040 compounds; in a separate study, we find minocycline to completely prevent iron neurotoxicity as well. Live-cell imaging over 12 h supported the neuroprotective effects of drugs. We selected indapamide and desipramine for live imaging studies. Figure  and Supplementary Video  show that while the number of neurons with intracellular propidium iodide (PI), a dye that leaks across a compromised plasma membrane, in response to FeSO exposure increases progressively over 12 h, this was significantly attenuated by indapamide and desipramine. The 35 hits were further narrowed concerning their ability to cross the blood–brain barrier according to drugbank.ca, their side effect profile and tolerability. Although antipsychotics are not well tolerated they were further included in the screening due to their good blood–brain barrier penetrance. Out of these, a group of 23 compounds was chosen for their ability to prevent mitochondrial damage using rotenone, which inhibits the electron transfer from complex I of the respiratory chain to ubiquinone. Rotenone induced strong neurotoxicity to neurons (Fig. ). The tricyclic antidepressant trimipramine, the antipsychotics clozapine and periciazine, promethazine and the antihypertensives labetalol, methyldopa and indapamide reduced neurotoxicity, while clomipramine trended toward a protective activity (Fig. ). The effect size of rescue by medications was, however, small. Of note, rotenone induced marked morphological neuronal changes with retraction of neurites (Fig. ). Hydroxyl radical scavenging capacity of medications The biochemical cell-free hydroxyl radical antioxidant capacity (HORAC) assay investigates the prevention of hydroxyl radical-mediated oxidation of fluorescein in comparison to the strong antioxidant gallic acid. The generation of hydroxyl radicals by a cobalt-driven Fenton-like reaction oxidizes fluorescein with progressive loss of fluorescence. The presence of an antioxidant reduces the loss of fluorescence over time. As noted in Fig. , gallic acid reduced the loss of fluorescence (upward shift) compared to a blank Fenton-driven reaction that is without antioxidant, while indapamide has an even higher activity. We compared the area under the curve of test compounds to that elicited by gallic acid to obtain the gallic acid equivalent (GAE). A GAE of 1 represents hydroxyl radical scavenging capacity similar to that of gallic acid, while a compound without antioxidant activity would produce a GAE close to 0. Some of the compounds tested exhibited stronger antioxidative properties than gallic acid with HORAC-GAEs >1 (Fig. ). These included indapamide (mean HORAC-GAE 4.1;  < 0.05; one-way ANOVA with Dunnett's multiple comparisons test as post hoc analysis vs. gallic acid), mitoxantrone (5.6;  < 0.001), chlorpromazine (5.9;  < 0.001), clozapine (4.6;  < 0.05), and trimipramine (4.2;  < 0.05). Although not statistically significant compared to gallic acid, clomipramine had a HORAC-GAE of 2.1. Regarding the comparison to the blank condition (i.e., no antioxidant present), there was a significant upward shift by clomipramine of the slope over 60 min ( < 0.0001; two-way ANOVA with Dunnett's multiple comparisons test as post hoc analysis) (Fig. ). Thus, although clomipramine lacked significance against the strong antioxidative gallic acid, the compound exhibited strong antioxidative effects against the blank situation (in the absence of any antioxidant). Interestingly, the tricyclic antidepressant desipramine had strong oxidative effects (HORAC-GAE −5.00;  < 0.0001). Proliferation of T-lymphocytes is reduced by antidepressants We tested the capacity of compounds to affect T-cell proliferation (Fig. ). Splenocytes activated by anti-CD3/anti-CD28 to trigger the proliferation of T-cells had reduced incorporation of [H]-thymidine upon treatment with dipyridamole (mean reduction 89.3%;  < 0.0001; one-way ANOVA with Dunnett's multiple comparisons test as post hoc analysis compared to activated splenocytes), cefaclor (23%;  < 0.01), labetalol (26.8%,  < 0.0001 for this and subsequent compounds listed here), mefloquine (62.3%), mitoxantrone (99.7%), trimeprazine (43.3%), chlorpromazine (99.4%), periciazine (28%), promethazine (74.6%), clomipramine (68.2%), desipramine (92.2%), imipramine (66.4%), trimipramine (54%), and doxepin (85.3%, all  < 0.0001). Of note, methyldopa and memantine increased proliferation (methyldopa 41.4%,  < 0.0001; memantine 17.5%,  < 0.05). Mitoxantrone and chlorpromazine, however, had toxic effects (data not shown). As indapamide did not reduce T-cell proliferation, we did not pursue it further in the T-cell prominent disease, EAE. Focus on clomipramine in vitro and in acute and chronic EAE We selected clomipramine for further study as it is a well-tolerated antidepressant and crosses the blood–brain barrier very well (drugbank.ca). Moreover, in our assays, clomipramine showed strong effects against iron-mediated neurotoxicity (mean % anti-MAP-2-positive cells normalized to control of 107.3%, representing complete protection against iron toxicity) (Fig. ), had antioxidative properties (HORAC-GAE 2.1 where the effect of the antioxidant gallic acid is normalized at 1) (Fig. ), and reduced T-lymphocyte proliferation (by 68.2%) (Fig. ). We began with a concentration response with the intent of investigating lower concentrations since plasma concentration in human of clomipramine as an antidepressant average 122 ng/ml (387 nM), but can peak to more than 600 nM in some individuals. Figure  shows that clomipramine had a progressive significant increase in neuroprotection against iron toxicity from 100 nM. The effect was mediated in part by chelation with iron, as washing away clomipramine from neurons led to cell death, while pre-incubation with iron before application to neurons totally preserved neuronal viability (Fig. ). We were able to observe the protection by clomipramine in a live-cell imaging study, in which the increasing number of PI-positive neurons over time in response to iron was attenuated by clomipramine (Fig. , Supplementary Video ). T-lymphocyte proliferation was reduced in a concentration-dependent manner by clomipramine but significant reduction occurred only from 5 µM ( < 0.01; one-way ANOVA with Dunnett's multiple comparisons test as post hoc analysis compared to activated T-lymphocytes) (Fig. ). This was reflected by a cell cycle arrest with more cells in G1 ( < 0.05) and less in the S-phase ( < 0.05) from 2 µM (Fig. ). Due to the growing knowledge about the importance of B-cell follicular structures for progressive multiple sclerosis, we sought to evaluate the effect of clomipramine on B-cell activation. BCR/anti-CD40L/IL-4 activation of B-cells increased their proliferation and production of TNF-α (Fig. ) and these were reduced in a concentration-dependent manner by clomipramine from 2 µM. We then investigated clomipramine in acute EAE. Therapy with clomipramine from day 5 after induction of MOG-EAE delayed onset of clinical signs by 2 days with a significantly better early disease course between days 11 and 18 (Fig. ), which was reflected in an overall lower burden of disability (Fig. ). However, eventually, clomipramine-treated animals succumbed to EAE and increased disability (Fig. ). We then sought to investigate whether initiation of treatment from the day of MOG-induction could improve the outcome of EAE. Remarkably, early treatment initiation completely suppressed the manifestation of clinical signs (Fig. ). While most animals in the vehicle group had a high disease burden, as shown by the sum of scores for each individual animal (Fig. ) and weight loss (Fig. ), this was profoundly ameliorated in treated mice over the course of study. PCR analyses of the spinal cord revealed that the significant elevation in vehicle-EAE mice of transcripts encoding ,,, and were abrogated in clomipramine-EAE mice (Fig. ). Investigation of serum levels of clomipramine and its active metabolite, desmethylclomipramine (DMCL), in mice sacrificed 1 h after the last of 16 daily clomipramine injections showed mean concentrations of 751 and 101 nM, respectively (Fig. ). Incredibly, the corresponding mean spinal cord levels were 28 and 1.5 μM; a similar high brain to plasma ratio of clomipramine was reported by Marty et al. in mice injected with a single 8 mg/kg clomipramine IP. There was a strong correlation of serum and spinal cord levels for both clomipramine and DMCL across mice (Fig. ). Histological analysis of the spinal cord showed profound parenchymal inflammation in vehicle-treated animals with a histological score of 4.3, whereas clomipramine-treated animals only had few inflammatory cells in the meninges (score 1.7;  < 0.001; non-parametric two-tailed Mann–Whitney test) (Fig. ) that were inadequate to produce clinical manifestations as noted in Fig. . Infiltration in vehicle-treated animals was accompanied by massive microglial activation, whereas clomipramine treatment prevented microglial activation, as assessed by Iba1 staining ( < 0.01) (Fig. ). Furthermore, clomipramine-treated animals had significantly less axonal damage ( < 0.01) (Fig. ). Infiltration and microglial activation correlated with axonal injury (Spearman  = 0.7599,  < 0.01; Spearman  = 0.774,  < 0.01, respectively; non-parametric two-tailed Spearman correlation with 95% confidence interval) (Fig. ). We next set out to investigate the effect of clomipramine in chronic EAE. We first evaluated clomipramine initiated only after the first relapse when mice were in remission (day 31). In our hands, using the more sensitive 15-point EAE scoring system (rather than the conventional 5-point scale), MOG-EAE mice can be documented to undergo a second relapse after a remission period. Clomipramine did not affect the severity of the second relapse when initiated in mice at remission (Fig. ), likely because substantial neural injury had already occurred from a prolonged EAE course. In another experiment, we treated MOG-immunized C57BL/6 mice from the first onset of clinical signs (day 13, Fig. ). Treatment with clomipramine attenuated the marked rise in clinical disability and had a significant positive effect during days 14–20 ( = 0.0175; non-parametric two-tailed Mann–Whitney test). During remission, likely because the severity of disability was low, the vehicle and clomipramine-treated groups did not differ. Disease was then followed by a second increase in clinical scores in vehicle-treated mice, which was prevented by clomipramine (days 42–50;  = 0.0007). Another model of chronic EAE, thought to model secondary progressive multiple sclerosis, is immunization with spinal cord homogenate (SCH) in the Biozzi ABH mouse. Clomipramine treatment was started at the onset of clinical signs where it reduced clinical severity throughout the period of treatment ( = 0.0062) (Fig. ). In summary, clomipramine reduced clinical severity in acute and chronic EAE in two different mouse models. Figure  schematizes that the initiation of clomipramine treatment from onset of clinical signs of EAE attenuates the clinical disability observed during relapses or in chronic disease. Unlike relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, trials in progressive multiple sclerosis have largely failed so far. One important explanation is the lack of directed actions of medications against features that drive the pathophysiology of progressive multiple sclerosis, and the lack of consideration of penetration of agents into the CNS. The latter is important as the blood–brain barrier appears relatively intact in progressive compared to the relapsing-remitting form, and pathogenic processes ongoing within the CNS may not be amendable to periphery-acting medications. To circumvent these challenges, we have employed bioassay screens that model aspects of progressive multiple sclerosis. Moreover, we have opted to test generic medications that have data of good access into the CNS. One pathogenic hallmark important for the progression of multiple sclerosis is iron-mediated neurotoxicity. Iron accumulates in the CNS age dependently and iron deposition concomitant with T-cell infiltration and the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase in microglia in the deep gray matter correlates with progression and is associated with neurodegeneration. The deposition of iron amplifies inflammation and exacerbates mitochondrial dysfunction through oxidative stress, eventually leading to neurodegeneration. Targeting iron is thus considered a promising therapeutic approach in progressive multiple sclerosis. Based on a screen of potential microglial inhibitors performed by our group, we investigated the potential of promising generic compounds to prevent iron-mediated neurotoxicity. Out of 249 compounds screened, 35 medications which prevented against iron-mediated neurotoxicity were in the drug classes of antidepressants ( = 5), antibiotics ( = 4), antipsychotics ( = 3), antimalarials ( = 2), and others. Some of the drugs had consistent outstanding neuroprotective effects, and these included antipsychotics and tricyclic antidepressants. The high number of antipsychotics and antidepressants as positive hits in the screening was striking. In addition to the rescue effect against iron-mediated neurotoxicity, several drugs showed promising results in other modes of toxicity; these were desipramine, clozapine, indapamide, and labetalol which were active against damage to the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Data were corroborated by the investigation of antioxidative potential and the influence on splenocyte proliferation. Clomipramine showed outstanding effects in several in vitro settings such as against iron-mediated neurotoxicity, hydroxyl scavenging capacity, and inhibition of T-cell and B-cell proliferation; in mice, clomipramine treatment suppressed occurrence of disease in EAE completely, concomitant with reduced transcripts of chemotactic and inflammatory cytokines in the spinal cord, reduced inflammation, microglial activation, and preservation of axons. Moreover, clomipramine ameliorated clinical signs in chronic EAE in two different EAE models, C57BL/6 and Biozzi ABH mice. The work presented here constitutes a systematic approach to identify generic compounds that could be useful for the treatment of progressive multiple sclerosis. First, we focused on ameliorating major hallmarks of progressive multiple sclerosis such as iron-mediated neurotoxicity, oxidative stress, and immune cell proliferation. Second, we chose generic drugs which are available as oral formulations. The drugs have a well-known safety profile, as there exists long-lasting experience in research and clinical use. Third, safety studies in patients with multiple sclerosis for these generic compounds will have to be conducted but they do not have to be exhaustive; thus, their translation into phase II and III clinical trials can be expedited. The screening approach herein has limitations, which should be addressed. First, the screening was limited to a circumscribed number of generic medications contained within the NINDS library; it was fortunate that we found several hits to pursue. A second limitation is that due to the high number of compounds tested, only one concentration (10 µM) was investigated for the majority of compounds. This may lead to misses, as higher or lower concentrations of a particular drug may have to be administered in humans to reach effectiveness. A third limitation is the lack of a well-accepted animal model of progressive multiple sclerosis to test the promising drugs identified from the tissue culture studies. We utilized the acute EAE model as proof of concept for a drug’s effectiveness in vivo followed by investigation in chronic EAE in C57BL/6 mice and Biozzi ABH EAE. While treatment from remission after the first relapse might not have been successful due to marked damage induced during the early phase of EAE, positive effects with early treatment during chronic disease in two models support potential effectiveness in human. Another limitation was the statistical analysis of the chronic experiments. Due to spontaneous remission of vehicle-treated animals, statistical significance would have been masked had the whole experiment been analyzed as a group, since vehicle-treated animals along with clomipramine-treated mice remitted to a very low disease score between days 25 and 42 (Fig. ). Hence, for statistical analyses, we focused on the differences of the acute and chronic relapse phases outside of the period of remission (Fig. ), as this would be more meaningful for a drug’s utility in MS. As no models of EAE are strongly suited for all aspects of progressive multiple sclerosis, we hope that the results of the current study will lead to a clinical trial in the ultimate test subjects: patients with progressive multiple sclerosis. Another limitation of the screening approach was the sequence of the tests employed, beginning with amelioration of iron-induced neurotoxicity to effects on T-cells. This sequence is not a reflection of which pathophysiology is most important for progressive multiple sclerosis, but simply because the protection of neurons against death in culture was an easily observed (through microscopy of living neurons) and therefore obvious outcome. Had the screen been sequenced in a different manner, other lead candidates might have emerged. Nonetheless, through the sequence that we employed, a testable medication in patients with multiple sclerosis, clomipramine, has emerged. Moreover, although a larger library could have been used, the NINDS collection was the largest grouping of generic medications available at the time of our study. We reiterate our focus on generics as their potential to advance faster into clinical studies is much higher, given that there would be knowledge of their spectrum of side effects in human use. Some of the compounds that prevented iron-mediated neurotoxicity in our screen have been described previously to have neuroprotective properties and will be highlighted here, as they may be of interest not only to progressive multiple sclerosis but also other CNS disorders with neurodegenerative features. Strong neuroprotective effects were induced by tricyclic antidepressants. The antidepressant desipramine has been used in a Huntington's disease model where it inhibited glutamate-induced mitochondrial permeability at the concentration of 2 µM and led to reduced apoptosis of primary murine neurons. Furthermore, desipramine induces the antioxidative enzyme heme-oxygenase 1 in Mes23.5 dopaminergic cells and increases Nrf2 accumulation in the nucleus, thus preventing neuronal cell death mediated by rotenone and 6-hydroxydopamine. We could not confirm the inhibition of rotenone-mediated cell death in our study of primary human neurons and we did not choose to pursue desipramine further as it promoted the formation of hydroxyl radicals in the HORAC assay. In murine EAE, desipramine reduces CCL5 in cortical homogenates and positively affects anxiety-related behavior but not clinical signs. Of interest, efficacy of desipramine in depression in multiple sclerosis has been shown in a Cochrane analysis and was associated with fewer adverse effects than paroxetine. Besides desipramine, other tricyclic antidepressants had strong effects against splenocyte proliferation. Imipramine, which showed good neuroprotective properties, enhances PEP-1-catalase in astrocytes, leading to neuroprotection in the hippocampal CA1 region in an ischemia model. Additionally, it prevents apoptosis of neural stem cells by lipopolysaccharide, mediated by the brain-derived neurotrophic factor and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. Another novel compound recently developed, quinpramine, which is a fusion of imipramine and the antimalarial quinacrine, decreased the number of inflammatory CNS lesions, antigen-specific T-cell proliferation and pro-inflammatory cytokines in EAE. Due to structural similarities between clomipramine, imipramine, and trimipramine it may be speculated that these compounds may be relevant for trials in progressive multiple sclerosis. Furthermore, we showed previously that doxepin reduces microglial activation to 46% without inducing toxicity; clomipramine, however, did not have microglia inhibitory activity. In the synopsis of effects contributing to progressive multiple sclerosis, tricyclic antidepressants are interesting for further development and might even be suitable as combination therapy with other compounds targeting features of progressive multiple sclerosis. Some antipsychotics also displayed strong protection against iron and oxidative stress. Clozapine has been described to reduce microglial activation through inhibition of phagocytic oxidase-generated reactive oxygen species production, mediating neuroprotection. The strong antioxidative properties of clozapine in the HORAC assay support these results. Due to the side effect profile with enhanced risk of agranulocytosis, we refrained from usage in EAE; nevertheless, in multiple sclerosis patients with psychiatric comorbidities and eligible for antipsychotic treatment, it may be reasonable to use clozapine. With regard to liothyronine, atenolol or carvedilol that prevented iron-mediated neurotoxicity beyond levels of controls, these do not penetrate the CNS (probability of 68% for all three, drugbank.ca) as well as clomipramine (97.9% chance for entering the CNS according to drugbank.ca). Thus, we did not explore their utility in EAE. Mitoxantrone is used in some countries as a treatment for progressive multiple sclerosis, but has so far not yet been described as being neuroprotective. Although the blood–brain barrier permeability probability is poor (0.7979), it may be postulated that the effect in progressive multiple sclerosis, in addition to its toxic effects on T-lymphocytes, is induced by its capacity to limit iron-mediated neurotoxicity. Indapamide exhibited strong neuroprotective effects against iron toxicity in culture, which has not yet been described previously. More interestingly, indapamide also overcomes mitochondrial damage. As indapamide has no effect on T-lymphocyte proliferation, the drug may not overcome acute-EAE, but may be interesting in longer-term multiple sclerosis models such as the Biozzi ABH mouse model, which shows immune cell-independent neurodegeneration and a chronic disease course. We opted to test clomipramine in the acute-EAE model due to its strong effects on immune cells, its antioxidative properties and its prevention against iron-mediated neurotoxicity. Clomipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant which is used to treat depression, obsessive compulsive disorder and panic disorders, usually in a dosage of 100–150 mg/d, sometimes up to 300 mg/d. It inhibits serotonin and norepinephrine uptake. Clomipramine reduces the seizure threshold and overdose can lead to cardiac dysrhythmias, hypotension, and coma (drugbank.ca). Usually, clomipramine is well tolerated, but side effects include among others increase in weight, sexual dysfunctions, sedation, hypotension and anticholinergic effects such as dry mouth, sweating, obstipation, blurred vision, and micturition disorder (according to the manufacturer leaflet). Clomipramine crosses readily into the CNS with a probability to cross the blood–brain barrier of 0.979 according to predicted ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, toxicity) features (drugbank.ca). Clomipramine reduces the production of nitric oxide and TNF-α in microglia and astrocytes; the authors reported neuroprotective properties in a co-culture model of neuroblastoma cells and microglia. Clomipramine increases the uptake of cortisol in primary rat neurons and promotes the release of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor in glioblastoma cells, suggesting a protective effect on neurons. The drug has been also studied in experimental autoimmune neuritis, where it decreases the number of IFN-γ secreting Th1 cells and ameliorated the clinical course. Clomipramine has been used previously in mice in different dosages to study conditions such as antinociception (0.5 mg/kg), Chagas disease (7.5 mg/kg), and neurotransmitter and histone deacetylase expression (50 mg/kg). In humans taking clomipramine as an antidepressant, mean serum levels after a mean daily intake of 127 ± 91 mg/d have been reported to be 122 ng/ml (387 nM, considering a molecular weight of 314.9). Of note, clomipramine levels after oral intake in humans have a wide range, leading to plasma concentrations of more than 600 nM in some individuals, which is in the range of neuroprotection against iron in our in vitro experiments. The injection of 20 mg/kg IP in CD1 mice leads to peak plasma concentrations of 438 ng/ml (1.4 μM) with a half-life of 165 min and in our experiments animals (sacrificed 1 h after the last injection) had mean serum clomipramine concentrations of 236.5 ng/ml (751 nM). These plasma levels are close to the ones measured in humans (average of 387 nM, and up to 600 nM), especially keeping in mind that plasma levels drop faster in mice due to the relatively bigger liver:body mass and that the half-life of clomipramine in humans is between 17.7 and 84 h compared to about 2.5 h in mice. We found that clomipramine levels in the spinal cord of the EAE-afflicted mice averaged an incredibly high 28 µM; levels achieved in the brains of humans are not known. Thus, the dosage of 25 mg/kg clomipramine tested in our EAE study reflects standard doses used in humans in that both attain similar plasma levels. In summary, we discovered several generic compounds in this systematic screening approach that exhibit neuroprotective properties against iron-mediated neurotoxicity. Additionally, some of those compounds prevent mitochondrial damage to neurons, inhibit immune cell proliferation, and show antioxidative capacities. They may thus be interesting for further development in progressive multiple sclerosis, and other neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's dementia, Huntington's and Parkinson's disease. Tricyclic antidepressants, antipsychotics, and indapamide may be useful for further development in progressive multiple sclerosis due to their manifold properties. Clomipramine showed particular promise due to its capacity to reduce iron-mediated neurotoxicity and T-cell and B-cell proliferation, its antioxidative effect, and its complete suppression of disease in acute-EAE and positive effects in chronic EAE. As these features are relevant in progressive multiple sclerosis, we propose clomipramine for a trial in the unmet need of progressive multiple sclerosis. Human neurons were isolated from brain tissues of therapeutically aborted 15–20-week-old fetuses, in accordance with ethics approval of the University of Calgary ethics committee, after written informed consent of the pregnant donors. Neurons were isolated as follows in brief: brain specimens were washed in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) to remove blood, followed by removal of meninges. Tissue was mechanically dissected, followed by digestion in DNase (6–8 ml of 1 mg/ml; Roche), 4 ml 2.5% trypsin and 40 ml PBS (37 °C, 25 min). Thereafter, the digestion was stopped by addition of 4 ml fetal calf serum. The solution was filtered through a 132 µm filter and centrifuged (three times, 1200 rpm, 10 min). Cells were cultured in feeding medium of minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1 µM sodium pyruvate, 10 µM glutamine, 1× non-essential amino acids, 0.1% dextrose, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (all culture supplements from Invitrogen, Burlington, Canada). The initial isolates of mixed CNS cell types were plated in poly-L-ornithine-coated (10 µg/ml) T75 flasks and cultured for at least two cycles in medium containing 25 µM cytosine arabinoside (Sigma-Aldrich, Oakville, Canada) to inhibit astrocyte proliferation and to deplete this major contaminating cell type. For experiments, the neuron-enriched cultures were re-trypsinized and cells were plated in poly-L-ornithine pre-coated 96-well plates at a density of 100,000 cells/well in 100 µl of the complete medium supplemented with cytosine arabinoside. Medium was changed to AIM V Serum Free Medium (Invitrogen) after 24 h. After a period of 1 h, respective drugs were added in a concentration of 10 µM, followed by application of FeSO or rotenone after 1 h. All conditions were performed in quadruplicates. A day later cells were fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde and stored in PBS at 4 °C. We note that in tissue culture, the toxicity of iron to neurons begins immediately. Thus, it has been our experience that pretreatment with test protective agents is necessary. With the continuous insult that occurs in multiple sclerosis, a pretreatment paradigm with test compounds against iron neurotoxicity in our experiments can be justified as that simulates the protection against the next injury in the disease. Drugs tested were contained within the 1040-compound NINDS Custom Collection II, which was purchased from Microsource Discovery (Gaylordsville, CT, USA) and used as previously described. Briefly, there were 80 compounds located in specific wells on each plate (e.g., B07). 3B07 would thus refer to position B07 of plate 3. Each compound was supplied at a concentration of 10 mM dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The iron stock solution was prepared using 27.8 mg iron(II) sulfate heptahydrate (FeSO) (Sigma-Aldrich, Oakville, Canada), 10 μl of 17.8 M sulfuric acid, and 10 ml deionized distilled water. After filtering with a 0.2 µm filter, FeSO was added to cells in a final concentration of 25–50 µM in a volume of 50 µl medium to the cells. Rotenone was dissolved in DMSO and used in a final concentration of 10 µM. Selected compounds that prevented iron-mediated neurotoxicity were analyzed for their antioxidative properties using the HORAC assay, in accordance with the procedure outlined in Číž et al. In this assay, hydroxyl radicals generated by a Co(II)-mediated Fenton-like reaction oxidize fluorescein causing loss of fluorescence. The presence of an antioxidant reduces the loss of fluorescence and this can be monitored every 5 min over a period of 60 min with a Spectra Max Gemini XS plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) and the software SoftMax Pro version 5. For monitoring fluorescence, we used an excitation wavelength of  = 485 nm and an emission wavelength of  = 520 nm. A previously published protocol was used for isolating and activating T-cells. Spleens from female C57BL/6 mice were harvested and after mechanical dissociation the cell suspension was passed through a 70 µm cell strainer and separated by Ficoll gradient (1800 RPM, 30 min). Splenocytes were plated (2.5 × 10 cells in 100 µl/well) in anti-CD3 antibody-coated 96-well plates (1000 ng ml plate-bound anti-CD3 and 1000 ng ml anti-CD28 suspended in media) to activate T-cells. Directly before plating, wells were treated with respective drugs in a final concentration of 10 µM. Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium, supplemented with 10% FBS, 1 µM sodium pyruvate, 2 mM L-alanyl-L-glutamine, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 1% HEPES, and 0.05 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (all supplements were from Invitrogen). After 48 h, H-thymidine was added in a concentration of 1 µCi per well, and cells were harvested after 24 h on filter mats. Mats were then evaluated for radioactivity (counts per minute, cpm) using a liquid scintillation counter. Venous blood from healthy volunteers was obtained and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated by Ficoll gradient centrifugation (1800 RPM, 30 min). From PBMCs, B-cells were isolated by positive selection with CD19-directed microbeads (Stemcell Technologies). Purity was assessed by FACS after staining for CD19 (Stemcell Technologies). Cells were plated at a concentration of 2.5 × 10 cells/well in X-VIVO™ medium (Lonza) supplemented with 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 1% Glutamax and treated with drugs for 1 h. Cells were then activated with 10 µg/ml IgM BCR cross-linking antibody (XAb) (Jackson ImmunoResearch), 1 µg/ml anti-CD40L and IL-4 20 ng/ml for 24 h as described previously. Conditioned media were harvested after 24 h for ELISA. Medium as well as respective drugs were re-added followed by application of H-thymidine in a concentration of 1 µCi per well to investigate proliferation. After 24 h, cells were harvested on filter mats and after drying cpm were measured using a liquid scintillation counter. Two days after activation and drug treatment splenocytes were harvested, washed with PBS followed by resuspension in PBS with 2% FBS. Cell cycle analysis was performed taking advantage of PI staining using an established protocol. Cells were washed in cold PBS and resuspended in PI/Triton X-100 staining solution (10 ml 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS with 2 mg DNAse-free RNAse A and 0.4 ml of 500 µg/ml PI), followed by incubation at 4 °C for 30 min. Stained cells were analyzed on a FACSCalibur™ with the software CellQuest™ (BD Biosciences). Cell cycle analysis was conducted using the software ModFit LT, version 3.3 (Verity Software House Inc.). Cells were identified by gating into the lymphocyte population, followed by single cell gating to exclude doublets and aggregates. This was followed by identification of the G0/G1 population and processing with the software ModFit LT, version 3.3 (Verity Software House Inc.) to calculate the percentage of cells in different cell cycles. Staining was performed at room temperature. A blocking buffer was first introduced for 1 h followed by incubation with primary antibody overnight in 4 °C. Neurons were stained using mouse anti-MAP-2 antibody, clone HM-2 (dilution 1:1000; Sigma-Aldrich, catalog number M4403, species mouse). Primary antibody was visualized with Alexa Fluor 488 or 546-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (dilution 1:250, Invitrogen, Burlington, Canada). Cell nuclei were stained with Hoechst S769121 (nuclear yellow). Cells were stored in 4 °C in the dark before imaging. Images were taken using the automated ImageXpress imaging system (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) through a 10× objective microscope lens, displaying 4 or 9 sites per well. Images were analyzed with the software MetaXpress (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) using the algorithm “multiwavelength cell scoring”. Cells were defined according to fluorescence intensity and size at different wavelengths. Data from all sites per well were averaged to one data point. Neurons were prepared as described above. Directly after the addition of FeSO to healthy neurons, the live cell-permeant Hoechst 33342 (1:2 diluted in AIM-V medium, nuclear blue; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Grand Island, NY, USA) and the live cell-impermeable PI (1:20 diluted in AIM-V medium) were added in a volume of 20 µl (Sigma-Aldrich). In compromised cells, PI could now diffuse across the plasma membrane. Live-cell imaging was performed using the automated ImageXpress imaging system under controlled environmental conditions (37 °C and 5% CO). Images were taken from nine sites per well at baseline and then every 30 min for 12 h. After export with MetaXpress, videos were edited with ImageJ (NIH) in a uniform manner. Nuclei were pseudo colored in cyan, PI-positive cells in red. EAE was induced in 8–10-week-old female C57BL/6 mice (Charles River, Montreal, Canada). Mice were injected with 50 µg of MOG (synthesized by the Peptide Facility of the University of Calgary) in Complete Freund's Adjuvant (Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 10 mg/ml Mycobacterium tuberculosis subcutaneously on both hind flanks on day 0. In addition, pertussis toxin (300 ng/200 µl; List Biological Laboratories, Hornby, Canada) was injected intraperitoneal (IP) on days 0 and 2. Animals were treated with clomipramine (25 mg/kg; 100 µl of 5 mg/ml solution) by IP injection from day 0 or day 5 (Figs. , ), from day 30 at remission (Fig. ), or from 13 at onset of clinical signs (Fig. ). The solution of clomipramine was prepared daily in PBS. The Biozzi ABH mouse model was used as a model of progression. EAE was induced in Biozzi ABH mice aged 8–10 weeks by the subcutaneous application of 150 µl emulsion in both sides of the hind flanks. The emulsion was prepared as follows: Stock A consisted of 4 ml of incomplete Freund's adjuvant mixed with 16 mg M. tuberculosis and 2 mg M. butyricum. 1 ml of stock A was mixed with 11.5 ml incomplete Freund's adjuvant to become stock B. Stock B was mixed in equal volume with SCH in PBS before injection. SCH was used in a concentration of 6.6 mg/ml emulsion each for 2 injections (days 0 and 7). The number of animals was chosen according to experience with previous experiments (Fig. : 8/8 (vehicle/clomipramine); Fig. : 8/7; Fig.  10/10; b 5/6; c 5/5), and animals were randomized after induction of EAE. Animals were handled according to the Canadian Council for Animal Care and the guidelines of the animal facility of the University of Calgary. All animal experiments received ethics approval (AC12–0181) from the University of Calgary’s Animal Ethics Committee. Mice were scored daily using a 15-point scoring system, the investigator was not blinded. 1 h after the last administration of clomipramine animals were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine, blood was taken by an intracardiac puncture for serum, and animals were then subjected to PBS-perfusion. Spinal cords and cerebella were removed. The thoracic cords were fixed in 10% buffered formalin, followed by embedding in paraffin. Cervical and lumbar cords were snap frozen. Tissue was further processed as previously described. Briefly, the thoracic spinal cord was cut longitudinally from the ventral to the dorsal side with sections of 6 µm thickness. Sections were stained with hematoxylin/eosin, Iba1 (dilution 1:250; Wako, catalog number 019-18741, species rabbit) to visualize microglia and Bielschowsky’s silver stain to visualize axons. Sections for Iba1 and Bielschowsky's silver stain were blinded, before images depicting area of maximal microglial activation or axonal damage were chosen for blinded rank order analysis by a second investigator. Lumbar spinal cords were harvested, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored in −80 °C. Samples were homogenized in 1 ml Trizol followed by the addition of 200 µl chloroform. The suspension was shaken, centrifuged (11,500 RPM for 15 min at 4 °C) and the RNA-containing upper phase was transferred into a new tube and precipitated with equal amounts of 70% ethanol. RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit according to the manufacturer's instruction (Qiagen). RNA concentrations were measured using a Nanodrop (Thermo Fisher Scientific). cDNA preparation was performed using the RT First Strand kit (Qiagen) with 1 µg of RNA according to the manufacturer's instructions. Real-time PCR was performed using the QuantStudio 6 Flex (Applied Biosystems by Life Technologies) with FAST SYBR Green and primers for (Qiagen) as housekeeping gene, (Qiagen, QT01038821), (Qiagen, QT00104006), (SABiosciences, PPM03023A-200), and (Qiagen, QT00167832). Relative expression was calculated using the ΔΔCT method with as housekeeping gene. Data were normalized to gene expression in naïve mice. The assay is a modification of the LC-MS assay of Shinokuzack et al. For preparation of samples, 100 μl of ice cold methanol were added to 100 μl of serum in each sample after addition of the internal standard maprotiline. The tubes were vortexed and left on ice for 10 min followed by centrifugation at 10,000 x  for 4 min. An equal amount of distilled water was added to each supernatant. Spinal cord samples were each homogenized in 10 volumes of ice-cold 80% methanol. 20 μl of o-phosphoric acid were added to all samples after addition of internal standard (maprotiline). The tubes were vortexed and left on ice for 10 min, followed by centrifugation at 10,000 x  for 4 min and an equal volume of distilled water was added to each supernatant. An HLB Prime μelution plate was employed for sample cleanup for both serum and spinal cord samples. After running the supernatants described above through the wells, all wells were washed with 5% methanol in water and allowed to dry completely before elution with 100 μl 0.05% formic acid in methanol:acetonitrile (1:1). The eluents were transferred to low volume μl glass inserts (Waters, Milford, MA, USA) and 10 µl from each eluent were injected into the LC-MS system. Analyses were conducted with a ZQ Mass detector - 2695 Separations module from Waters. The control of instrument, and the acquisition and processing of results were enabled by Mass Lynx 4.0 software. HPLC runs were processed by a 3 μm, 3.0 × 100 mm Atlantis dC18 column with similar material for the guard column. The mobile phases A and B were 0.05% formic acid constituted in water and acetonitrile respectively. The procedure started with a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min comprising of 80% of A and 20% of B. This was elevated in 15 min to 80% B and then restituted to starting conditions. The sample cooler and column heater were maintained at 4 and 30 °C, respectively. The optimized positive electrospray parameters had specifications of 1.2V Rf lens voltage; 3.77 kV capillary voltage; 110 °C source; 300 °C desolvation temperature; 80 L/h cone gas flow (nitrogen) and 300 L/h of desolvation nitrogen gas flow. Cone voltage was varied for each compound: clomipramine 25 V; N-desmethylclomipramine 22 V; and maprotiline 25 V. The / ratios for clomipramine, N-desmethylclomipramine, and maprotiline (internal standard) were 315, 301, and 278, respectively. Calibration curves consisting of varying amounts of authentic clomipramine and N-desmethylclomipramine and the same fixed amount of maprotiline as added to the samples being analyzed were run in parallel through the procedure described above and the ratios of clomipramine and N-desmethylclomipramine to maprotiline were used to determine the amount of drug and metabolite in the serum and spinal cord samples. Statistical analysis was performed using the Graphpad Prism software version 7 (La Jolla, CA, USA). For cell culture experiments, one-way ANOVA with different post hoc analyses was applied, as stated in the respective figure legends. EAE scores were analyzed using two-way ANOVA with Sidak's multiple comparison as post hoc analysis or non-parametric two-tailed Mann–Whitney test. Sum of scores and rank order analysis were analyzed with the non-parametric two-tailed Mann–Whitney test. Animal weight and drug levels were analyzed with an unpaired two-tailed -test. Correlations of drug levels were calculated using a linear regression model. Correlations of rank order analyses were performed using non-parametric two-tailed Spearman correlation. Statistical significance was considered as  < 0.05 (*),  < 0.01 (**),  < 0.001 (***), and  < 0.0001 (****). All experiments were performed in quadruplicates, if not otherwise specified.

MS lasts a lifetime. In relapsing-remitting forms of MS, come and go but may lead to accumulation of disability. People with experience steady deterioration and permanent disability. You can develop either condition at any age. However, ADEM is more likely to affect children, while MS is more likely to affect young adults. According to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, over of childhood ADEM cases occur in children younger than 10 years old. Most other cases occur in people between 10 and 20 years old. ADEM is rarely diagnosed in adults. Experts believe ADEM affects in the United States annually. It’s more common in boys than girls, affecting boys of the time. It’s seen in all ethnic groups across the world. It’s more likely to appear in the winter and springtime than in the summer and fall. ADEM often develops within months of an infection. In of cases, it may be triggered by an immunization. However, doctors aren’t always able to identify the triggering event. MS is usually diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 50. Most people receive a diagnosis while in their 20s or 30s. MS affects women more than men. The most common type of MS, RRMS, affects women at a rate that is than it is for men. Disease incidence is higher in Caucasians than in people of other ethnic backgrounds. It becomes more prevalent the farther away a person is from the equator.

ADEM generally consists of a single attack, while MS involves multiple attacks. In this instance, an can help. can differentiate between older and newer lesions. The presence of multiple older lesions on the brain is more consistent with MS. The absence of older lesions could indicate either condition.

In very rare cases, symptoms develop after a vaccination. However, in some instances, no causal event is known. ADEM is probably caused by the immune system overreacting to an infection or vaccine. The immune system becomes confused and identifies and attacks healthy tissues such as myelin. Most researchers believe that MS is by a genetic predisposition to developing the disease combined with a viral or environmental trigger.

22384df7-c9b5-493e-bf9d-95efc12f7456,"Are you sure your patient has Multiple Sclerosis? What are the typical findings for this disease? A first attack of neurological symptoms in children with central nervous system (CNS) demyelination may represent a monophasic illness or be the first presentation of a chronic relapsing disorder such as multiple sclerosis (MS), a condition that is increasingly being recognized and diagnosed in childhood. Cranial, and possible spinal imaging, and lumbar puncture are key diagnostic tests. Acute management of demyelination usually involves initiation of corticosteroid therapy with IVIG, with plasma exchange required in severe cases. Once the diagnosis of MS is confirmed, immunomodulatory treatment should be initiated with the goal of reducing relapse rates and disability accrual. Safety and tolerability data support the use of these MS immunomodulatory therapies in pediatric MS. Neurological symptoms attributable to demyelination commonly include the following: Unilateral or bilateral visual loss (optic neuritis) Motor, sensory or urological deficits localizing to the spinal cord (transverse myelitis) Brainstem deficits (typically internuclear ophthalmoplegia or INO) Other monofocal or polyfocal neurological deficits Polyfocal neurological deficits with encephalopathy (acute disseminated encephalomyelitis or ADEM) Optic neuritis should be considered in any child presenting with subacute monocular or binocular visual loss (see Figure 1). Ophthalmological features of optic neuritis typically include: Optic disc edema is sometimes seen, but may be absent in retrobulbar optic neuritis. Neurological abnormalities outside of the optic nerve may also be present. Neuroimaging, usually brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast, reveals optic nerve thickening and/or enhancement in approximately 55% of children (see Figure 2) and visual evoked potentials are abnormal in up to 88% of children. Optical coherence tomography (OCT), a non-invasive technique for measuring retinal nerve fiber thickness, may aid in diagnosis. Transverse myelitis should be considered in any child presenting with subacute onset of weakness and sensory deficits localizing to the spinal cord (see Figure 3). Typical symptoms of transverse myelitis include: Bilateral (may be asymmetric) lower extremity weakness Sensory paresthesias or hyperesthesias with a spinal sensory level L’Hermitte’s symptom (pain with forward neck flexion) indicating cervical spinal involvement Bowel or bladder dysfunction (lesions above the sacral cord cause urinary retention and constipation) While many children will experience partial TM, others may have complete cross-sectional cord involvement with clinical features of flaccid paresis with hyporeflexia and later hyperreflexia. Longitudinally-extensive transverse myelitis (spanning > 3 spinal segments) or transverse myelitis with concurrent or rapidly sequential optic neuritis should prompt consideration of neuromyelitis optica (see Figure 2). Of note, approximately 10% of children with MS have longitudinally-extensive spinal cord lesions. Somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) may be useful to confirm a spinal cord localization. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is defined by the presence of polyfocal neurological symptoms and signs with encephalopathy (either behavioral change or alteration in consciousness). Symptoms of ADEM are often preceded by a febrile illness or viral prodrome. ADEM may be the clinical manifestation of age-dependent demyelination as the majority of individuals with ADEM are under the age of 10 years. While ADEM is most commonly a monophasic illness, relapsing and multiphasic forms have been described. International consensus definitions for monophasic and relapsing forms of ADEM describe the clinical features and time course in detail. Typical brain MRI findings of ADEM are shown in Figure 4. Other presentations of acute demyelination include: Polyfocal neurological deficits without encephalopathy The cornerstone of MS diagnosis is demonstration of demyelination that is disseminated in both space and time. Specific consensus definitions have been proposed for childhood-onset MS requiring either (i) two discrete demyelinating attacks separated by at least 30 days and involving two separate areas of the CNS; (ii) one attack consistent with demyelination and MRI evidence of new lesions meeting criteria for dissemination in time (see below); or (iii) two non-ADEM attacks in a child with an initial ADEM presentation. As in adult-onset MS, MRI may be used as a surrogate marker for dissemination in space and time, facilitating earlier disease diagnosis. Specifically, new criteria proposed by Polman et al (2010) require that dissemination in space on MRI be defined as involvement of greater than or equal to one T2 lesion in at least two of the following four areas: i. periventricular ii. juxtacortical iii. infratentorial and iv. spinal cord with symptomatic brainstem or spinal cord symptoms not contributing towards the total lesion count. Dissemination in time may be fulfilled by demonstration of either: i. new T2 and/or gadolinium-enhancing spinal cord lesion(s) on follow-up MRI (irrespective of timing of baseline MRI) or ii. simultaneous presence of gadolinium-enhancing and non-enhancing lesions. More than 95% of children with multiple sclerosis initially experience a relapsing-remitting disease course with reported relapse rates between 0.38 and 1.2 per year. Primary progressive disease (neurological deterioration in the absence of discrete relapses) is rare in the pediatric age group. Children with MS appear to experience more frequent relapses as compared to adult-onset MS patients in the first several years following diagnosis. The time from a first attack to a second neurological event is highly variable and may be greater in younger children. Childhood-onset MS patients may enter a secondary progressive phase, defined by disability progression in the absence of clear relapses, between 15 to 20 years following first attack. What other disease/condition shares some of these symptoms? Acutely, it is important to exclude central nervous system infection especially if neurological symptoms are accompanied by fever, encephalopathy, meningismus or other systemic signs. The combination of brain and/or spinal cord white matter abnormalities with multiple cranial neuropathies should raise suspicion of central nervous system Lyme disease (neuroborreliosis), especially if there has been recent travel to an endemic area or if a tick bite is recalled. While rare, malignancy, such as central nervous system lymphoma, should also be considered, particularly if MRI features are atypical for demyelination, or if spinal fluid examination reveals atypical cells. A history of persistent or increasingly frequent headache, seizures, or lumbar puncture evidence of an elevated opening pressure should prompt consideration of isolated CNS vasculitis or CNS vasculitis associated with systemic disease (such as systemic lupus erythematosus). Children with CNS vaculitis usually respond to steroid therapy and experience an exacerbation of symptoms as steroids are tapered. Distinguishing vasculitis from MS has important therapeutic implications as vasculitis management requires long-term immunosuppression with medications such as cyclophosphamide. Neurological symptoms associated with renal or liver impairment, fever, lymphadenopathy and disseminated intravascular coagulation should prompt consideration of macrophage activation syndrome. High serum ferritin and fasting triglycerides, unexpectedly low ESR, and the presence of hemophaocytic cells in a bone marrow aspirate or CSF are diagnostic. Repeated attacks of optic neuritis and transverse myelitis should raise suspicion of the diagnosis of neuromyelitis optica (NMO). The diagnosis of NMO is aided by testing for antibodies directed against Aquaporin 4. NMO is important to consider as the disease often has an aggressive course with rapid disability progression, requiring potent immunosuppressive agents to maintain disease control. See Figure 6. MS is thought to be a disease influenced by both genetic predisposing factors and environmental triggers of aberrant CNS directed autoimmunity. It is increasingly believed that MS predisposition is established during childhood, as evidenced by studies of immigrants to areas of high MS prevalence who acquire the MS risk of their new community only if they immigrated prior to age 15 years. What laboratory studies should you request to help confirm the diagnosis? How should you interpret the results? There is no laboratory test that can confirm MS diagnosis. The majority of laboratory evaluations are performed to exclude other conditions – a requirement prior to considering MS as the etiology of a patient’s clinical symptoms. However, several investigations are helpful in supporting an MS diagnosis. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination is important in confirming the presence of CNS demyelination and for excluding other diagnoses. At first presentation, more that 50% of children with MS will have an elevated CSF leukocyte count, typically below 30 cells/microliter with a lymphocytic predominance. A higher leukocyte count or neutrophilic predominance should prompt consideration of CNS vasculitis, CNS infection, or NMO. CNS vasculitis is also often associated with an elevated opening pressure. CSF oligoclonal bands (OCBs) in CSF, but not detected in serum, may be found in up to 90% of childhood-onset MS patients at first presentation as compared to approximately 10% of children with ADEM or NMO. Isoelectric focusing methods have the highest diagnostic yield. It should be noted that MS patients may initially have undetectable CSF OCBs, but may develop them later in the disease course. Testing of visual, brainstem auditory, and visual evoked potentials is often useful for confirming the clinical demyelinating syndrome and for documenting subclinical disease. Almost 50% of children with MS in one study demonstrated subclinical abnormalities in at least one of these evoked potential pathways, most commonly visual. Visual evoked potentials are abnormal in over 85% of children with clinical optic neuritis. Would imaging studies be helpful? If so, which ones? Neuroimaging, especially brain and/or spinal MRI with contrast, is valuable in confirming the presence of inflammatory CNS lesions and in excluding other possible diagnoses. Lesion characteristics of younger children may differ from older children, with younger MS patients being more likely to have ill-defined brain MRI lesions and grey matter involvement. Large lesions with indistinct borders are typical for ADEM. One recent study suggested that the presence of two of the following MRI features may aid in distinguishing children with MS from those with ADEM with 81% sensitivity and 95% specificity: i. presence of T1 black holes ii. absence of diffuse bilateral pattern iii. presence of two or more periventricular lesions. MRI has now been incorporated into the diagnostic criteria for MS in children and adults and allows a diagnosis of MS even at first presentation if there is the simultaneous presence of gadolinium-enhancing and non-enhancing lesions suggesting disease dissemination in time. Classification of Childhood Demyelinating Syndromes An algorithmic approach to the classification of childhood demyelination has been published (Banwell, Lancet Neurol 2007) and Yeh (Nature Reviews Neurol 2009 ). If you are able to confirm that the patient has Multiple Sclerosis, what treatment should be initiated? The care of children with MS revolves around management of acute relapses and longer-term immunomodulation with the goal of reducing relapse rates and disability accrual. The acute management of a first attack of demyelination or MS relapse usually relies on initiation of corticosteroid therapy. Doses in the range of 20-30 mg/kg IV per day (maximum 1 g per dose) for 3 to 5 days are typically used. Mild relapses that are not distressing to the patient and do not impair functioning may require supportive management, but not pharmacological therapy. Serum glucose, urine glucose, and blood pressure should be monitored during corticosteroid treatment. If children improve, with this initial course but have an incomplete resolution of symptoms, an oral prednisone taper starting at 1 mg/kg/day for 2-3 weeks could be considered. If children do not significantly improve or clinically worsen during the course of steroid therapy, evidence from published case series suggest that IVIG may be of benefit with a typical dose of 2 g/kg administered over 2 to 5 days. If symptoms of demyelination are severe and potentially life-threatening (for example, severe encephalopathy or respiratory depression), there is class I evidence in adult MS patients for the use of plasma exchange (PLEX), which is typically administered as 5 to 8 exchanges over 10 days. Class I evidence in adult-onset MS exists for the following therapies: interferon beta 1a, interferon beta 1b, and glatiramer acetate. Route of administration, doses, potential adverse effects, and associated laboratory abnormalities are summarized in Figure 5. While there have been no formal randomized-controlled trials of interferons or glatiramer acetate in children with MS, available case-series level evidence suggest that these treatments are safe and well-tolerated in childhood. Children who are receiving interferon treatments should have serum white blood cell counts and liver enzymes monitored monthly for the first 6 months and every 3 months thereafter. Thyroid function should be monitored yearly. Sexually active patients should be counselled regarding contraceptive use due to potential teratogenicity of some of these agents. Second-line therapies are offered to families if frequent relapses occur despite treatment with one of the first-line agents, or if treatment with these agents causes intolerable side effects. Cyclophosphamide, mitoxantrone, azahtioprine all have case-series level evidence to support their use in childhood MS. Case series have also recently been published reporting natalizumab use in pediatric MS patients. Fingolimod (FTY 720) has recently been licensed for use in adult-onset MS patients and increased efficacy and convenience of oral administration may make this an attractive therapeutic option for pediatric MS patients. The safety of this medication in children for whom the immune system is still maturing has not yet been definitively established and fingolimod does not have regulatory approval for use in children. Emerging therapies including cladribine, rituximab, alemtuzumab, dacluzumab, laquinimod and ocrelizumab also have the potential for improved efficacy and tolerabiltiy as compared to interferons or glatiramer acetate but the risks of life-threatening infection and malignancy must be carefully considered, especially for pediatric MS patients. What are the adverse effects associated with each treatment option? Corticosteroid therapy may be associated with the development of hypertension and hyperglycemia. Many children experience gastrointestinal irritation that can be reduced with use of H2 blocking agents. Agitation, mood disturbances, sleep disruption and personality changes are common in patients on high doses of corticosteroids, but typically resolve as doses are reduced. Longer-term use may be associated with osteopenia, weight gain, and adrenal suppression. Given that long-term (ie: more than 3 weeks) of corticosteroid therapy is not recommended and repeated monthly intravenous corticosteroids failed as a model for MS disease modulation, corticosteroids are reserved for acute relapse therapy. IVIG infusion may be associated with headache, nausea, flushing, back pain, and hyptotension. If any of these occurs during an infusion, the infusion rate may be slowed or the medication discontinued. Premedication with antihistamines or corticosteroids may be useful in preventing these symptoms. Rarely, IVIG may be associated with acute renal failure, cardiac failure, or thrombosis. Severe anaphylactic reactions have been described in patients with IgA deficiency. Aseptic meningitis is a well-described complication of IVIG administration. As in treatment with other blood products, transmission of infectious agents is possible. Treatment with PLEX may be associated with hypotension, pulmonary edema, metabolic alkalosis and electrolyte abnormalities (ex: hypocalcemia or hypokalemia) and therefore requires administration by a trained team of individuals and close monitoring. Anaphalaxis is rare but can occur as can significant hemorrhage (from heparin-induced thrombocytopenia) and infection. Side effects of commonly used first-line immunomodulatory therapies are summarized in Figure 5. What are the possible outcomes of Multiple Sclerosis? Almost 95% of children with MS experience a relapsing remitting course with attacks consisting of subacute onset of neurological symptoms separated by periods of relative disease quiescence. While recovery after an acute relapse is expected, residual deficits often perist. Persistent neurological deficits may significantly affect daily functioning. After a period of between 15 to 20 years, childhood-onset MS patients may enter a secondary progressive phase where there is disability accrual in the absence of discrete relapses. The goal of immunomodulatory treatment is to reduce relapse rate and long-term disabilty. The available first-line therapeutic agents have a similar efficacy in reducing relapse rates by approximately 18-30%. Medications differ in terms of route of administration, frequency of administration, and side effect profiles and therefore treatment choice must be individualized. Fatigue significant enough to limit daily activities and to affect school performance is experienced by up to 40% of children with MS. Non-pharmacological measures such as scheduling key activities for early in the day, and brief daytime napping may be sufficient for some MS patients, but pharmacological therapy is often required. Modafinil prescribed at a starting dose of 50 mg once daily and increased as needed up to 100 mg twice daily is often an effective pharmacological therapy. Childhood MS occurs during key academic years and ongoing CNS inflammation may interfere with learning and memory. Between 50- 70% of children with MS demonstrate evidence of cognitive impairment with formal testing. Cognitive impairment has been associated with younger age at first attack and longer disease duration. Impaired learning and scholastic difficulties have longer-term implications for global functioning and vocational choices. Children with MS may experience bowel and/or bladder dysfunction as well as sexual dysfunction. Mood disorders, most commonly depression, are often identified in pediatric MS patients. Health care practioners should be comfortable discussing these issues with adolescent patients. Childhood MS is being increasingly recognized and diagnosed. While the true incidence of pediatric MS remains to be precisely defined, it is estimated that 3-10% of all MS patients experience their first symptoms prior to the age of 18 years. Multiple sclerosis in both children and adults has been reported in many countries worldwide, but there is marked regional variation in MS prevalence. There is a well-described latitude gradient in MS, with greatest MS prevalence reported in countries further away (in either direction) from the equator. Early life place of residence appears to correlate with MS risk. A study of adult-onset MS patients demonstrated that immigration from areas of low reported MS prevalence (India and Pakistan) prior to the age of 15 years was associated with higher risk of being later diagnosed with MS as compared to immigration after age 15. A single center Canadian study of adult and childhood-onset MS patients showed that the two groups shared the common experience of having spent most of the childhood years in Canada, irrespective of self-reported familial ancestry. One of the factors that may explain regional variations in MS risk and especially the latitude gradient is sunlight exposure and consequent serum vitamin D status. Studies in adults have shown that MS risk is inversely related to daily oral vitamin D intake and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels. A study of twins discordant for MS diagnosis showed that co-twins who reported higher sunlight exposure were less likely to subsequently develop MS. Risk of adult-onset MS is higher for individuals born in the spring as compared to the fall, suggesting that maternal vitamin D status during pregnancy may be an important determinant of MS risk. Both retrospective and prospective studies in children have shown that low serum 25(OH)D levels at first presentation are correlated with increased risk of MS diagnosis. Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) infection has been implicated as a contributing factor to MS development in both children and adults. Three case-control studies in children have shown that children with MS more commonly demonstrate remote EBV seropositivity as compared to matched controls. One prospective Canadian study has shown EBV seropositivity at first attack of CNS demyelination to be more common in children later diagnosed with MS as compared to those individuals remaining monophasic. In seropositive individuals, antibody titres are also higher in children with MS as compared to controls. MS is more common in first-degree relatives of MS patients, as compared to the general population, and MS has a higher prevalence in monozygotic as opposed to dizygotic twins, suggesting that there may a genetic contribution to MS risk. The HLA DRB1 allele has been associated with increased risk of adult-onset MS in numerous studies. A recent prospective study in Canadian children with a first attack of central nervous system demyelination demonstrated that the HLA DRB1*15 allele was more common in those children later diagnosed with MS as opposed to children who remained monophasic. Several genome-wide studies have implicated other immune-related genes in MS, but all are felt to have a very low contribution to individual MS risk. What complications might you expect from the disease or treatment of the disease? Fatigue, cognitive impairment, and persistent neurological disability are all possible complications of MS in children (see above). Treatment-related side effects are discussed in the section describing therapies. Are additional laboratory studies available; even some that are not widely available? Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a new non-invasive technique that enables measurement of retinal nerve fibre thickness. As significant numbers of axons are found in the retina, OCT is emerging as a potentially valuable tool in measuring the degree of axonal degeneration in MS. Applications of OCT in MS include estimation of visual prognosis after optic neuritis, demonstration of degree of axonal degeneration in MS patients without optic neuritis, and use as a surrogate outcome marker in MS treatment trials. To date, there is no known intervention that will prevent MS development. There is increasing evidence that vitamin D deficiency at first presentation of neurological symptoms increases risk of subsequent attacks and is associated with relapse rate in individuals with established MS. Future studies exploring the role of vitamin D supplementation are of considerable interest.

Resources:MS Society of Canada: National MS Society: . Ongoing controversies regarding etiology, diagnosis, treatment There is still considerable debate about definitions for many childhood demyelinating syndromes, especially recurrent and multiphasic forms of ADEM. It remains unclear whether these forms of ADEM represent discrete diagnostic entities with a favourable prognosis, or if these forms of ADEM represent an age-related early manifestation of MS. Treatment algorithms for childhood MS are largely derived from randomized controlled trials conducted in adults. There is a paucity of clinical trials that include pediatric participants. Inclusion of children with MS in large scale therapy trials will be increasingly important in the near future with the introduction of new potent immunosuppressive/immunomodulatory treatments for whom the effects on the developing immune system have yet to be defined.

20541b8e-1c50-48af-9b22-72a0ef0e6e4e,"Highlights from the American Academy of Neurology’s 2015 Annual Meeting Highlights from the American Academy of Neurology’s 2015 Annual Meeting The American Academy of Neurology’s (AAN’s) 67th Annual Meeting took place in Washington, DC April 18th-25th. The AAN is an association of more than 27,000 neurologists and neuroscience professionals dedicated to advancing the care of individuals with neurologic disease. Every year, these professionals gather to hear the latest findings in research and treatments for neurological conditions, including multiple sclerosis (MS). To follow are some important highlights. Daclizumab high-yield process (HYP) is a new therapy that has been studied in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). It is a humanized monoclonal antibody against CD25, a receptor on T cells that is thought to become activated in MS. Daclizumab is believed to work by selectively targeting these activated T cells without causing general T-cell depletion. This therapy results in a “reversible modulation” of the immune system. This means that while the medication alters the immune-system response to slow the attack caused by MS on myelin and nerves (axons) of the brain and spinal cord, it does so without causing permanent changes to immune system function. DECIDE was a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled study (“active-controlled” denotes that the control group was given an existing treatment that has already been shown to be effective, versus a placebo, which has no active ingredients). This study compares DAC HYP 150mg injected subcutaneously once every four weeks, to intramuscular interferon once weekly. The primary endpoint was the annualized relapse rate (ARR). A total of 1,841 patients were randomized into the study. Treatment with DAC HYP versus interferon resulted in a 45-percent reduction in the ARR and a 41-percent reduction in the proportion of patients who relapsed. MRI outcomes were also positive favoring DAC HYP as this agent brought about a 54-percent reduction in the number of new/enlarging T2 lesions (more intense lesions, which are areas of inflammation). Furthermore, DAC HYP reduced the risk of confirmed disability by 16 percent. The benefits of this drug compared to interferon were seen in many subgroups of patients – men, women, both older and younger than 35, and irrespective of prior treatment with interferon. The authors concluded that DAC HYP demonstrated superior efficacy compared with weekly interferon across key clinical, radiographic, and patient-reported MS outcome measures in relapsing MS patients. A variety of side effects and adverse events were seen with this agent. Infections, significant skin reactions, and liver effects were observed. The side-effect profile and safety issues will warrant careful monitoring if this medication is approved. Immediately following the AAN meeting, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) accepted for review the Biologics License Application (BLA) requesting marketing approval of Daclizumab HYP for relapsing forms of MS. If approved, this will be marketed under the brand name Zinbryta™. Gilenya is an FDA-approved oral treatment for MS that blocks lymphocytes from exiting lymph nodes and reaching the nervous system. It is approved for RRMS, and was studied in a large, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial called INFORMS, to assess efficacy in patients with primary-progressive MS (PPMS). A novel primary composite endpoint was used, based on increase in disability as measured by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), the 25-Foot Timed-Walk Test (T25FW), and the 9-Hole Peg Test (9-HPT). Other key endpoints were the formation of new lesions and percent brain volume change (PBVC), or brain atrophy (the shrinking or reduction of brain volume). INFORMS was a three-year trial that randomized 970 patients, and was adequately powered (that is, enough patients were included and enough measurements were made) to assess the primary endpoint. Unfortunately, none of the endpoints were met. Gilenya did not prevent the accumulation of disability in patients with PPMS any greater than placebo. Furthermore, PBVC did not differ between the Gilenya and placebo groups. Unsurprisingly, given this agent’s success in preventing relapses and new MRI lesions in RRMS patients, there were fewer new MRI lesions seen in the Gilenya-treated patients. The safety results were generally consistent with fingolimod in prior MS trials. It is disappointing that Gilenya did not significantly slow disease progression in PPMS. These findings have important implications for the understanding of PPMS, and will no doubt allow researchers to refine how PPMS is studied moving forward. Biotin is a vitamin involved in key steps of energy metabolism and fatty acid synthesis, though most people think of it as being “good for hair and nails.” Among other actions, biotin activates an enzyme in myelin synthesis. Using this hypothesis and building upon data from a small, open-label pilot study, MD1003, a high-dose biotin preparation of 300 mg/day, was studied in a Phase III trial of patients diagnosed with secondary-progressive MS (SPMS) or PPMS. (This dose is hundreds of times higher than what can typically be purchased as a supplement of this vitamin.) In a relatively small study, 154 patients were randomized to high-dose biotin or placebo. The primary endpoint of the study was defined as the proportion of patients who improved at nine months, with a confirmation of the improvement at 12 months. Improvement was defined as either a decrease in EDSS (Expanded Disability Status Scale) or an improvement in T25FW (timed 25-foot walk) of at least 20 percent. The primary endpoint was met, with 12.6 percent of patients in the MD1003 arm showing an improvement of EDSS or T25FW at nine months and confirmed at 12 months, compared to none of the patients in the placebo arm. The primary endpoint was supported by secondary analyses showing evidence for a decrease in the risk of disease progression. These numbers are encouraging, although it is important to note that the decrease in disability experienced by the MD1003 group, and the disease progression seen in the placebo group, were both so small, they would be virtually undetectable in clinical practice. MD1003 was well tolerated. The overall incidence of adverse events was similar across the two groups. One patient treated with MD1003 died from suicide; however, this event was not considered to be related to the drug. These results suggest a possible therapeutic effect of high-dose biotin in progressive MS, and merit further study. Though this trial gives initial support for its potential use, a larger trial will need to be done to truly understand whether biotin is an effective treatment in progressive MS. Noting that the dose of biotin studied would require taking hundreds of commercially-available pills of this vitamin, it is certainly not recommended that patients begin such a regimen at the present time. Studies also need to determine if any toxic effects could result from taking such high doses of this vitamin. Anti-LINGO-1 is an agent under investigation for its potential remyelinative properties, after animal studies showed that it blocks this protein responsible for stopping the growth of myelin. Agents aimed at remyelination would repair or regrow myelin, the protective covering of the nerves, which is damaged by MS. RENEW was a Phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, study of Anti-LINGO-1 in subjects experiencing their first episode of acute optic neuritis (AON). An equal number of subjects were randomized to receive either a placebo or anti-LINGO-1 (100 mg/kg) once every four weeks for six total doses. Follow-up extended 12 weeks after the last dose. The primary outcome of RENEW was an assessment of recovery of optic-nerve function measured by the speed at which the nerve conducts visual signals. This was studied by evaluating a test called Full Field Visual Evoked Potential (FF-VEP) in participants treated with anti-LINGO-1, compared with placebo. Patients who were treated with at least five of the six doses of anti-LINGO-1 showed a 34-percent improvement in optic-nerve conduction latency (delay in the speed of the visual signal) at week 24, compared with placebo. Further recovery in optic-nerve conduction was observed at the last study visit (week 32), with a statistically significant 41-percent improvement. Together, the data demonstrate evidence of treatment effect with continuous improvement observed 12 weeks following the last study dose. There was no effect on key secondary endpoints, including actual recovery of visual function. These data are the first evidence of functional remyelination in patients treated with anti-LINGO-1, and justify further study in the ongoing SYNERGY trial, in which 396 subjects with active RRMS or SPMS will be randomized to intravenous (IV) infusions of this experimental medication or placebo. All subjects will also receive once-weekly injections of Avonex. Results will provide clinical information about this drug’s efficacy for neuroprotection or repair within the central nervous system (CNS), which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves. The results will also address two fundamental questions: 1) Are the effects seen in the optic neuritis study replicable in other areas of the nervous system? And 2) Does this translate to improved function in patients with MS either in the short or long term? Phenytoin is an anti-epileptic medication that has been available for decades. It has also been shown to be neuroprotective in experimental models of inflammatory demyelination. A Phase II clinical trial assessed whether phenytoin could be neuroprotective in acute optic neuritis (AON). The study was comprised of 86 people with AON randomized within two weeks of symptom onset to receive either phenytoin (4 mg/kg/day) or placebo for three months. The primary outcome of this AON study was an evaluation of the structure of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and macular volume (MV) at six months. Visual function, optic-nerve imaging, and visual evoked potentials were also measured. Of the original 86 participants, 81 were followed to study end. In these patients, the average adjusted affected eye RNFL thickness at six months was higher in the active group versus placebo, resulting in a 30-percent protective-treatment effect. Adjusted MV (macular volume) showed a 34-percent protective-treatment effect. Vision generally recovered well, with no significant difference in visual outcomes between the treatment groups. This is an intriguing study that may have broad implications, as it found that the administration of a well-known, relatively safe drug seemed to be neuro-protective in the period directly following optic neuritis. Similar to anti-LINGO-1, further studies will need to be done to clarify whether this effect is translatable to other areas of the nervous system and whether this will, in turn, lead to preservation of neurologic function. Lemtrada® (alemtuzumab) – Update from the Care MS II Extension for RRMS Lemtrada is a monoclonal antibody given by IV infusion that was approved by the FDA in 2014 for the treatment of relapsing MS. In the CARE-MS II trial, Lemtrada had superior benefit versus subcutaneous interferon beta-1a, including improved MRI outcomes over two years, in RRMS patients who had relapsed on prior therapy. A total of 393 (92.9 percent) CARE-MS II Lemtrada-treated patients entered the extension study; data are available through four years from the first treatment, and follow-up is ongoing. Through four years, 67.7 percent of patients received only the initial two courses of treatment, 24.2 percent received the initial two treatments plus one additional course, and 7.4 percent received the initial two treatments plus two additional courses. In Year 3 and Year 4, almost 90 percent of patients were free of new gadolinium-enhancing lesions, and two-thirds of patients did not have new T2 lesions. Aubagio®’s (teriflunomide) 14-Year Extension Study for RRMS Aubagio is a once-daily oral immunomodulator approved for the treatment of RRMS. In the core Phase II study, patients with relapsing MS were randomized equally to Aubagio 14mg, Aubagio 7mg, or placebo. After completing the 36-week core study, patients could enter the long-term open-label extension. In the extension, patients who were taking one of the two doses of Aubagio continued on their same therapy; those previously treated with placebo were reallocated in equal numbers to Aubagio 14mg or 7mg. Of the 179 patients originally randomized, 147 entered the extension study. Including treatment in the core and extension studies, patients received Aubagio for up to 576 weeks (11 years). During the study, annualized relapse rates (ARR) remained low in both groups, and the percentage of patients free from relapse during the extension was greater in the 14-mg group (51.5 percent) versus the 7-mg group (39.5 percent). Patients had minimal increases in EDSS score following up to 528 weeks (more than 10 years) of treatment. No new/unexpected adverse events were identified following long-term Aubagio treatment, and the safety and tolerability profile was consistent with other clinical studies. Although long-term extension trials are always limited by the fact that patients who are doing well on a particular treatment are more apt to stay on it, this study provides support for the use of Aubagio — one of the more recently approved therapies — over the long term. Relapse rates remained low in both treatment groups that were followed up to 12 years, and patients in both groups had minimal progression, similar to what was seen in the Phase III trials. Anti-JCV Antibody Index in Tysabri® (natalizumab)-Treated Patients Multiple risk factors are now known for developing Tysabri-associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a viral brain infection caused by the JC virus. These risk factors include the presence of anti-JCV antibodies, prior immunosuppressant use, and duration of Tysabri treatment — especially beyond two years. In previous analyses, the anti-JCV antibody index was able to differentiate the risk of PML in patients who were positive for the anti-JCV antibody, but without a history of immunosuppressant use. This current analyses involved data from clinical studies and post-marketing sources as of March 2014. Data were available for 101 Tysabri-treated PML patients with blood samples collected six months prior to PML diagnosis. For patients with no history of immunosuppressant use, with anti-JCV antibody index at or below thresholds of 0.9 to 1.5, PML risk was approximately 0.1 to 0.2 per 1,000 patients during the first two years of Tysabri treatment; it ranged from 0.5 to 1.1 per 1,000 patients who had taken Tysabri for more than two years and up to four years; and from 0.6 to 1.4 per 1,000 patients who had taken Tysabri for more than four years and up to six years. For patients with no history of immunosuppressant use with an index greater than 1.5, PML risk was approximately 1.2 per 1,000 patients during the first two years of Tysabri treatment, 8.8 per 1,000 patients between two and four years, and 10.1 per 1,000 patients between four and six years. Consistent with previous findings, this updated analysis suggests the anti-JCV antibody index may differentiate PML risk in anti-JCV antibody positive patients with no history of immunosuppressant use. Patients with a JC index less than 1.5 maintained a low risk for developing PML over the course of the study, as opposed to those with a high index where the risk was seen to increase greatly over time. “Doctor, can I stop my medicine?” – Analysis of disease course after stopping disease-modifying therapy in stable MS patients Little data are available on MS disease course after disease-modifying treatment (DMT) discontinuation. MSBase, a 30,000-patient global, observational MS registry, provides a unique opportunity for such a study. Patients were included who, at the time of DMT discontinuation, were: 40 years of age or older; had no relapses and a stable EDSS for five or more years; were on DMT continuously for three or more years; and, after stopping DMT, were followed for three or more years. Predictors of when patients would restart their DMT, as well as time-confirmed progression of disability, were analyzed. A total of 198 (65.4 percent) of 303 eligible patients restarted DMT following discontinuation after only one month, on average. The rate of restarting DMT decreased by 25 percent for every 10-year increase in age, meaning that the older patients were less likely to restart their DMT as quickly as the younger ones. Patients who restarted DMT experienced a 46-percent reduction in the rate of subsequent three-month confirmed disability progression, versus those who did not restart their treatment. Overall, the authors concluded that high rates of DMT restart occurred in this group of stable, older MS patients who discontinued DMT. Younger age (within this group of older MS patients) and lower EDSS predicted an increased rate of restarting treatment. Importantly, even in this group of stable patients, DMT restart was associated with reduced rates of disability progression. It is important to note that in the years following DMT discontinuation, there was evidence in a large percentage of patients for either relapse or progression despite five previous years of good disease control. Knowing the time when someone who is clinically stable “no longer needs to be treated” remains elusive, and more work will need to be done before evidence can guide a decision to stop a DMT. Epidemiology, Environmental Factors, and Disease Course The GEMS Project – Genetics and Environment in MS Investigation of MS prevention requires early identification and understanding of the incidence in the high-risk population. The Genes and Environment in Multiple Sclerosis (GEMS) project has a goal of early detection in first-degree relatives of MS patients. Each subject submits saliva for targeted genotyping and completes detailed web-based questionnaires that capture demographics and risk factors. For each subject, a weighted genetic and environmental risk score (GERS) was calculated. It includes 64 genetic variants, as well as the individual’s gender, whether or not he or she had infectious mononucleosis, and if the person has a history of smoking. By leveraging patient-advocacy groups and social media, the GEMS investigators were able to recruit more than 2,600 first-degree relatives from across the United States. In an analysis of the initial 1,696 subjects (1,583 without symptoms and 113 with MS at enrollment), investigators found that 27 percent of the individuals with MS and 25 percent of the asymptomatic subjects have a history of infectious mononucleosis, both doubling that of the general population. This higher proportion of infectious mononucleosis in asymptomatic family members is not attributable to known MS-genetic susceptibility. MS subjects have a significant excess of current smokers than asymptomatic subjects. Four out of the initial 1,583 asymptomatic subjects developed MS after enrollment, providing an incidence estimate (123 cases per 100,000 first-degree relative annually) 30-times greater than the incidence of sporadic MS in the United States. The average follow-up duration of the study was two years. The GEMS study highlights the role of electronic communication, e.g., using social media and web-based questionnaires, in rapid and large-scale subject recruitment of first-degree relatives. It also provides a first estimate of the incidence of MS among this high-risk population, critically informing the design of a prospective study of high-risk family members. Identification of patients at the highest risk for MS may lead to opportunities for intervention before the condition becomes clinically apparent. The vast collection of organisms that inhabit the human gut, the microbiome, has been demonstrated to influence immune responses and modulate susceptibility to chronic diseases. Recent studies have related gut dysbiosis (an imbalance of bacteria) to Crohn’s disease, type 1 diabetes, obesity, and autism. Additionally, animal model work suggests an important role in MS. The Multiple Sclerosis Microbiome Consortium (MSMC) is a multi-disciplinary collaboration composed of two translational MS Centers (Mount Sinai and UCSF). Together, they have initiated a microbiome-oriented basic/experimental program and sequencing/bioinformatics Core. The MSMC is currently analyzing hundreds of samples by bacterial DNA sequencing aimed at identifying group differences at the genus-level. Tracked variables include demographics, Body Mass Index (BMI), medical history, MS clinical course and phenotype, disease-modifying therapy, and diet. The MSMC has successfully implemented IRB-approved protocols to recruit MS patients and controls, as well as to process and analyze their blood and stool samples. Initial results show significant genus-level differences in the microbiomes of patients treated with Copaxone® (glatiramer acetate) compared to untreated subjects. Female patients showed significant enrichment of members of the Enterobacteriaceae family of bacteria, compared to gender-matched controls. Geographical differences were noted as well. Strikingly, when transferred into germ-free mice, gut microbiota from an MS patient resulted in more severe EAE (a mouse model of MS) than microbiota from a healthy control. This may be the most intriguing result from this project to date. Observed differences between cases and controls suggest a biological effect and warrant further investigation, as do effects of geographic, demographic, and dietary factors. Study of the human microbiome has the potential to yield important insights in understanding the pathophysiology of MS as well as possible treatment strategies. A separate study of microbiome in MS looked at differences in Vitamin D levels predicting alterations in gut bacteria. Analysis of 43 subjects showed increased abundance of a type of helpful bacteria called Ruminococcaceae in untreated MS patients with a serum Vitamin D level above 40 ng/mL, versus patients with a Vitamin D level below 40. The authors conclude that high levels of Vitamin D in untreated MS patients are associated with increased amounts of Ruminococcaceae in the gut. This has relevance to MS, as a decreased amount of Ruminococcaceae has previously been associated with Crohn’s disease. Hence, lower amounts of Ruminococcaceae might be linked to increased inflammation in MS. Further studies are underway to explain the mechanism by which Vitamin D regulates the composition of the microbiota in MS. Caffeine intake has been associated with reduced odds (or risk) of Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases, but previous studies done on caffeine consumption and MS risk have been inconclusive. The study team, led by Ellen Mowry, used two population-based case-control studies – a case-control group from Sweden and a case-control group from Northern California – to look for an association of coffee consumption prior to disease onset with the odds of developing MS. In the Swedish cohort, consuming at least six cups of coffee daily over the course of one year was associated with an adjusted odds ratio (OR) for MS of 0.67, which represents a modestly reduced risk of developing MS. In the Northern California study, among those who consumed four or more cups of coffee daily prior to the year of the study, the odds ratio for MS was also 0.67. It is important to note that the study finding was only significant at the highest levels of coffee intake. Also, no association was found for other types of caffeine. The study authors postulated that coffee may have a direct immunomodulatory effect, although it is possible that this association is present due to other unmeasurable factors. Further work will be needed to investigate this association, and it is not yet recommended that people (with or without MS) commence drinking six cups of coffee per day. The “Topographical Model” of MS was proposed by Dr. Krieger as a way of visualizing disease course in a more individualized way than the typical simple graphs of relapsing or progressive forms of MS. This model is based on the observation that it is difficult to apply our current disease-course categories – RRMS, SPMS, and PPMS – to individual patients, and that even when someone has an apparently progressive disease, progression can take a variety of forms and sometimes stop altogether. Instead of these separate categories, the Topographical Model proposes encompassing the mix of factors underlying the MS disease course in a unified way across a pattern of relapses, progression, both, or neither. “Topography” refers to mapping the locations in the nervous system where MS has caused damage, and from where an individual’s symptoms are derived. The model itself was depicted as a series of 3D animated videos, showing the emergence of signs (such as lesions) and symptoms of MS above a “clinical threshold,” where a physician can observe changes… as well as lesions that can be seen on MRI but don’t cause obvious symptoms, as existing “under the threshold,” so that a physician could not observe changes. Progression is depicted as that threshold slowly drops, representing a loss in function that can occur in progressive disease. It also helps to show why during episodes of fever, or being overheated, patients may often experience a worsening or return of many of their same prior MS symptoms. In this model, these symptoms are transiently being “revealed” (in these 3D animated videos) above the clinical threshold during periods of depleted reserve, and then recede back under the threshold when the fever resolves. The model depicts one’s disease course in a clinically nuanced way that complements the clinical-course categories. It attempts to capture the broad range of experiences of the disease – the unique “disease topography” experienced by an individual person – so that clinical course can be shown and understood to a more personalized degree. The Topographical Model remains to be empirically tested, and may have clinical research implications.

3a72eb78-7495-48bc-83dd-863fb337f8f8,"Complementary & Alternative Medicines Find Programs & Services in Your Area COVID-19 Vaccine Guidance for People Living with MS     PPMS is characterized by worsening neurologic function (accumulation of disability) from the onset of symptoms, without early relapses or remissions. PPMS can be further characterized as either (with an occasional relapse and/or evidence of new MRI activity over a specified period of time) or , as well as  (evidence of disability accrual over time, with or without relapse or new MRI activity) or . This graphic shows the kinds of disease activity that can occur in PPMS; however each person's experience with PPMS will be unique. PPMS can have brief periods when the disease is stable, with or without a relapse or new MRI activity, as well as periods when increasing disability occurs with or without new relapses or lesions on MRI. Disease activity and progression can be evaluated by neurologic examination and MRI. Monitoring your disease course at different points in time helps you and your MS care provider have important conversations about your treatment options and prognosis. For example: If you have PPMS that is active, with new MRI activity or relapses, your conversation with your MS care provider could be about starting treatment with a disease-modifying therapy to reduce the risk of a relapse, as well as rehabilitation to help improve function and mobility. If you have PPMS that is stable without activity (no new MRI activity or relapses) or progression, the conversation with your MS care provider could include the role of rehabilitation to help you maintain function, as well as other symptom management strategies that you may need. If you have PPMS that is not active (no new MRI activity or relapses) but is progressing with increasing accumulation of disability, the conversation with your MS provider could focus on the rehabilitation strategies that can help you maintain function and keep you safe and independently mobile. How does PPMS differ from the other disease courses? Although there is a lot of variability among people with PPMS, we know that as a group, they differ in several ways from people with relapsing forms of MS: Relapsing forms of MS (including relapsing-remitting MS, and secondary progressive in those individuals who continue to experience relapses) are defined by inflammatory attacks on myelin. PPMS involves much less inflammation of the type seen in relapsing MS. As a result, people with PPMS tend to have fewer brain lesions (also called plaques) than people with relapsing MS and the lesions tend to contain fewer inflammatory cells. People with PPMS also tend to have more lesions in the spinal cord than in the brain. Together, these differences make PPMS more difficult to diagnose and treat than relapsing forms of MS. In the relapsing forms, women are affected two to three times as often as men; in PPMS, the numbers of women and men are approximately equal. The average age of onset is approximately 10 years later in PPMS than in relapsing MS. People with PPMS tend to experience more problems with walking and more difficulty . In general, people with PPMS may also require more assistance with their everyday activities. The National MS Society is pursuing all promising research paths and collaborating worldwide to drive progress in research in progressive MS, for which few therapies exist.

Reder, Stephen C. Reingold, Huub Schellekens, Per Soelberg Sørensen The identification of factors that can affect the efficacy of immunomodulatory drugs in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) is important. For the available interferon-beta products, neutralising antibodies (NAb) have been shown to affect treatment efficacy. In June, 2009, a panel of experts in MS and NAbs to interferon-beta therapy convened in Amsterdam, Netherlands, under the auspices of the Neutralizing Antibodies on Interferon beta in Multiple Sclerosis consortium, a European-based project of the 6th Framework Programme of the European Commission, to review and discuss data on NAbs and their practical consequences for the treatment of patients with MS on interferon beta. The panel believed that information about NAbs and other markers of biological activity of interferons (ie, myxovirus resistance protein A [MxA]) can be integrated with clinical and imaging indicators to guide individual treatment decisions. In cases of sustained high-titre NAb positivity and/or lack of MxA bioactivity, a switch to a non-interferon-beta therapy should be considered. In patients who are doing poorly clinically, therapy should be switched irrespective of NAb or MxA bioactivity.

ba3f981b-db10-4c87-bd6b-1a6fac8a9517,"Watch Jack Osbourne Cover 150 Years of MS History in 5 Minutes If ‘you don’t know jack about MS,’ Jack Osbourne is here to help. In a recent video, reality star Jack Osbourne sits on a comfy brown chair inside in a dimly lit room accented with a burning fireplace. Classical music plays in the background. “Oh, hello. I didn’t see you there,” he says, before explaining, “we’re going to be taking a journey to the origins of MS research. Jump aboard and let’s go travel time.” The video is one of the latest in a series of webisodes created by Osbourne for his campaign. Now in its fifth year, the campaign was created along with Teva Pharmaceuticals and focuses on sharing information with people who have a new diagnosis or are living with MS. “We try to humanize the experience for people,” Osbourne told Healthline. “We don’t root ourselves in research. We take the research and hard fact-based evidence that others have done and have proven to be true and we put a human face to it, whether it’s through my story or other people’s stories or educational videos that are easy to understand.” That’s exactly what he does in the 5-minute long webisode, . In the video, Osbourne looks back at how our understanding of MS has changed since 1868 when the disease was officially classified by professor Jean-Martin Charcot, who Osbourne notes was also the first to diagnose the condition in people. Throughout the video, Osbourne talks about other developments of MS throughout history, including those of Dr. James Dawson, who in 1916 released a detailed description of MS as well as changes in lesions caused by the condition. But why does he present the information in the form of a history lesson? Osbourne’s personal journey with MS sparked the idea. In 2012, after experiencing optic neuritis (an inflamed optic nerve) and several months of pinching and numbness in his legs, Osbourne was diagnosed with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). While he experienced permanent damage to his right eye, he currently lives symptom-free. He said understanding how MS treatment has evolved over time strikes a chord with him — and he’s a bit of a history buff as well. “History is the only subject in school that I was any good at,” said Osbourne. “I love telling stories. I think it’s really important. Stories give you an idea of where we’re going to go from where we’ve been and I’ve never really seen anything that was breaking down the history of research into MS, especially as it pertains to the last hundred years or so.” With his campaign team, Osbourne came up with a concise explanation of what the last hundred years plus have looked like “in an easy to digest, somewhat lighthearted way to tell something that is kind of intense,” he said. In all aspects of Osbourne’s campaign, including the webisodes, he said he strives to present humor and lightheartedness. “I have to keep things kind of comical as best as possible because I think without that, all is lost,” he said. “If I can find a way to lift myself up through the process, I think maybe other people will get a little excited about it and not so depressed as far as what we’re talking about.” He also believes that the best way to educate is through comedy. “Some of the most educational, fact-based shows on TV now are delivered through comedy. Not that I’m a comedian in any sense, but keeping things light and funny definitely helps people retain information,” Osbourne said. While he acknowledges that his sense of humor isn’t for everybody, he believes it grabs attention. “My sense of humor is pretty dark. I make pretty dark somewhat inappropriate jokes because I guess I like to make people feel uncomfortable at times. I also like seeing my mother squirm when I make jokes about having MS,” he said with a laugh. “But really, I think keeping it light makes me and others feel better about what we’re going through and leaves people with a little hope.” In fact, hope is something he has lots of, noting that he believes researchers will figure out a way to turn off autoimmune disease during his lifetime. “We are getting so close. We’re screaming ahead and living in a time where we will see huge changes. There seems to be a breakthrough every couple of months as far as research goes or a new treatment coming to market or understanding of genetics,” said Osbourne. “Think about it. Five years ago, there was no treatment for progressive MS. Now there is. They used to tell you that diet and exercise can’t do anything for MS. Now they’re saying it does. It’s a really an exciting time for the community.” Osbourne plans to produce more webisodes and educational information as part of his campaign. He says other ideas are in the works, too, including potentially holding an event. “The great thing is we’ve grown every year and figured out a way to work through things we didn’t know and understand. I think we’ve changed with the landscape of MS in the last 5 years. I don’t think we’re going to run out of ideas any time soon, which is a great place to be,” Osbourne said. He’s proudest of his latest idea coming to life — placing educational handouts in doctors’ offices. “I always wanted to create a platform where doctors can send [their patients] the moment they get diagnosed,” said Osbourne. “Now our pamphlets have been cleared to be placed in doctors’ offices [and those can] direct new patients to our website full of information and educational content that’s easy to digest. That was always my goal.” Cathy Cassata is a freelance writer who specializes in stories around health, mental health, and human behavior.

Common relapse syndromes include unilateral optic neuritis, focal brainstem or cerebellar syndromes, or partial myelitis. Atypical symptoms that would warrant further evaluation include encephalopathy, complete ophthalmoplegia, headache, or isolated fatigue. A typical MS relapse evolves over 24-48 hours and reaches a nadir in several days. More sudden or gradual symptoms should prompt evaluation of alternative diagnoses. Most patients experience some spontaneous recovery though it is variable and affected by other factors such as comorbidities, functional status prior to the relapse, and age.  Q: What is the differential diagnosis for a MS relapse? A: MS can manifest with a wide array of new or worsening symptoms and they do not all constitute a relapse. A pseudorelapse is a temporary recrudescence of prior neurological deficits usually in the setting of certain stressors such as an infection, heat exposure (including fever or exercise), or adverse psychosocial event.  Common paroxysmal syndromes include trigeminal neuralgia, Lhermitte sign which is an electrical sensation elicited with neck flexion or Pulfrich phenomenon which is an illusionary, binocular disturbance where object moving across the visual field is perceived as travelling along a curved trajectory. Uhthoff phenomenon specifically refers to transient visual blurring with exercise in patients with a history of optic neuritis though other motor or sensory symptoms can exhibit the same phenomenon. Disability accrual in MS can also occur independent of relapses (ie progression). The most common phenotypic presentation is gradual worsening myelopathy. This can be a challenging diagnosis because this qualifier is made retrospectively over time and patients can have overlying relapses. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) can be very difficult to distinguish from a MS relapse especially early in PML. Clinicians should be vigilant in MS patients treated with certain therapies associated with PML infection, particularly natalizumab. In patients being treated with highly effective therapies, there is usually a low risk of breakthrough disease so PML as the cause of new symptoms should be considered, especially if they include seizures, behavioral changes or cognitive abnormalities; if they evolve subacutely or do not respond to corticosteroids. MRI can assist in differentiating a PML lesion from a MS relapse. A: The evaluation of a relapse should be tailored to the clinical scenario. In the setting of an established diagnosis of MS, new neurologic symptoms compatible with those caused by MS, and no symptoms or history suggesting an intercurrent condition, no further ancillary testing may be needed. When symptoms are atypical of a relapse, a targeted work-up should be pursued to identify the cause. For example, if a patient presents with reemergence of remote neurological deficits concerning for a pseudorelapse they should undergo basic laboratory testing before consider pharmacological treatment for a relapse. This includes a urinalysis with culture since occult urinary tract infections are common in MS, along with a complete cell count and comprehensive metabolic panel. Based on the clinical history, further investigative measures can be ordered if symptoms suggest an intercurrent condition or alternative medical condition. An infection or other derangement does not exclude a concomitant relapse, but identification and correction of the possible trigger should be managed before the relapse is treated. A: In general, neuroimaging is not necessary to diagnose a relapse, which is a clinical diagnosis. MRI can be a useful adjuvant to screen for other mimics such as PML or stroke. MRI can also be helpful if there is diagnostic uncertainty as radiographic activity in the context of new neurological symptoms would support the diagnosis of a MS relapse. The prototypical MRI finding in a relapse is gadolinium enhancement reflecting blood brain barrier breakdown. Gadolinium enhancement is observed in most but not all new lesions and resolves over the course of several weeks. Clinicians should be aware that potential treatment such as corticosteroids can alter these radiographic findings. Enhancing lesions can also occur without obvious clinical signs or symptoms. A: In general, we treat relapses, as they cause significant morbidity and symptoms typically interfere patients’ ability to function. Mild relapses such as non-disabling sensory symptoms or those already exhibiting spontaneous improvement may not require intervention as the risk of therapy may outweighs potential benefit of treatment. Ultimately, treatment decisions are made jointly between the patient and provider using a shared decision-making model. Mild, asymptomatic MRI lesion activity does not require treatment as the rationale for pharmacological treatment is to decrease the duration and intensity of neurological symptoms. We often treat in the setting of multiple asymptomatic active lesion as those patients are at increased risk for clinical worsening. New clinical or radiographic disease activity may warrant a change in disease modifying therapy. Please refer to the Mellen Center Approach (MCA) on switching disease modifying therapies for more information on that topic. A: Corticosteroids are the mainstay treatment option for MS relapses. High dose corticosteroids offer rapid symptom relief and hasten neurologic recovery. While there has been much debate about intravenous vs oral administration, it has been demonstrated that dose rather than the route of administration is the most important factor in terms of efficacy.10 We typically use intravenous methylprednisolone (IVMP 1000mg daily) or an equivalent dose of intravenous of high dose oral prednisone (1250mg daily which equates to twenty-five 50mg tablets) for 3-5 days for relapses. Multiple studies have shown that high-dose, oral corticosteroid and high-dose, IV methylprednisolone are bioequivalent with a similar side effect profile and equivalent MRI /clinical outcomes. If the oral regimen is selected, we advise patients that they do not need to take all the pills at one time but they take the pills earlier in the day to prevent potential sleep disturbance.  To lessen side effects, we typically prescribe a proton pump inhibitor or H2 antagonists along with a sleep aid (typically melatonin or diphenhydramine) to proactively manage the impact of the high dose corticosteroids. In addition, steroids are associated with rare yet serious complications including aseptic necrosis of the shoulder or hip and hepatic failure. If patients experience severe psychiatric manifestations including mania, depression or psychosis we have a higher threshold for prescribing corticosteroids as those symptoms are difficult to mitigate and could be life threatening. Corticosteroid-induced psychosis usually self-resolves once the medication is stopped but discontinuation is not always possible. Symptoms can be managed with short courses of atypical antipsychotic or mood stabilizing medications though we would encourage treatment coordination with a mental health professional. Hypersensitivity reactions to corticosteroids are rare yet serious adverse reaction that providers should also be aware of. Reactions seem to be attributable to the specific formulation (i.e. the salt or preservative agent) rather than the steroid itself. A different corticosteroid preparation can be tried again in a controlled setting where emergency medications and personnel are present. A steroid taper can be considered based on relapse severity and clinical context (i.e. comorbidities) but is not required. There is no clear evidence that a taper contributes to recovery or that a short course of high dose corticosteroids significantly suppresses the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis which would necessitate a taper in most patients.   Q: What treatments options are available for relapses with incomplete recovery? A: We will consider a second course of corticosteroids if a patient has an incomplete response to the initial treatment though we have a low threshold to escalate therapy as incomplete symptom resolution is a major cause of early disability in MS. We typically use plasmapheresis for treatment of severe or refractory relapses with an incomplete response to the corticosteroids. The length of treatment can vary between 3-7 sessions depending on the treatment response and tolerance. The most common treatment period is 5 sessions over 7-10 days. Plasmapheresis is usually well tolerated but there are a number of potential side effects clinicians should be aware of including infection (specifically related to the venous catheter), deep venous thrombosis, , hypotension, and hypoalbuminemia. Most of these side effects are easily managed and do not require plasmapheresis discontinuation, though close coordination with the plasmapheresis administration team is essential. Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) treatment has been approved for use in MS relapses since the 1960s though it was supplanted in clinical practice by corticosteroids in the 1980s. There has been some recent, renewed interest in ACTH given its effects on melanocortin receptors on circulating lymphocytes. There is no conclusive evidence that ACTH has any additional benefits when compared to corticosteroids or improves the recovery of patients with incomplete response to corticosteroids. Clinical trials are currently underway to further investigate. Current evidence does not support intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) as a treatment for acute MS relapse. IVIG could be considered if a patient was intolerant to both IVMP and PLEX but we do not typical prescribe it at the Mellen Center. Please refer to the MCA on IVIG for more information regarding that specific therapy. A: Relapses are typically managed in the outpatient setting unless circumstances necessitate inpatient treatment such as an inability for the patient to perform self-care, loss of ability to ambulate, or comorbidities that increase the risk of corticosteroid-related complications. Given the challenges of arranging out-patient plasmapheresis, we usually admit these patients to the hospital for expedited central venous line placement and treatment, though sometimes outpatient therapy can be arranged. Acute treatment in the inpatient setting also is considered if subsequent inpatient rehabilitation is anticipated. Q: What adjunctive methods can be used to manage a relapse? A: We believe rehabilitation is an integral part of relapse management. Our patients engage with a multidisciplinary team to focus on their physical and emotional wellbeing when being treated for a relapse or pseudorelapse. This team encompasses physiatrists, psychologists, physical therapists, occupational therapists, and speech therapists. Rehabilitation can focus on motor impairment, gait instability or cognitive dysfunction. These services can also focus on a broader range of functions including an ability to perform activities of daily living, improve mobility, or a return to work. Management of the relapse symptoms can also lead to improved quality of life for patients. For example, treating painful sensory disturbances with a neuropathic pain medications or addressing disabling fatigue with pharmacological and non- pharmacological methods. Q: How are relapses managed during pregnancy or breastfeeding? A: Typically, disease modifying therapy is discontinued during pregnancy and while breast feeding, which increases the risk of disease activity. Fortunately, MS disease activity decreases during this time though women with highly active disease before pregnancy are at higher risk for a relapse, especially for three to four months postpartum. Women undergoing an assisted reproductive technique may also have a higher relapse risk due to the hormone changes induced by gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists. We typically use the standard treatment strategy for relapses during pregnancy or while breastfeeding. We do have a higher threshold for treatment in the first trimester as there is some evidence for adverse fetal outcomes with corticosteroids, including cleft palate and low birth weight. Generally, relapses during the second and third trimesters can be treated safely with corticosteroids. Ultimately, a joint decision is made between the patient, provider and obstetrician (OBGYN). Corticosteroids can cross into the breast milk so we recommend patients to avoid breast feeding for several hours after their treatment.  For disabling, corticosteroids-refractory relapses, plasmapheresis can be considered. For more information regarding MRIs during pregnancy and breast feeding please refer to the MCA on MRI Activity.  References: Thompson AJ, Banwell BL, Barkhof F, et al.

c8a35177-e10b-4220-959a-afb46fa8369e,"The Effects of Alcohol, Coffee, and Smoking on Multiple Sclerosis — Researchers are looking into the possible benefits, if any, of these substances on people with MS. Those are some of the latest findings from researchers studying which substances can help, and which substances can harm, someone with multiple sclerosis (MS). Using the Expanded Disability Status Score (EDSS), and Multiple Sclerosis Severity Score (MSSS), to measure disabilities, some studies are finding that higher is associated with lower EDSS scores and lower rates of . Alcohol, along with smoking, coffee, and vitamin D, can all have effects on people with MS. While some of these behaviors harm the nerves, researchers are finding that others actually protect them. There is nothing good about people with MS cigarettes. In fact, cigarette smokers have five times greater odds of increased disability compared with people with MS who consume alcohol. The benefits of drinking are still being analyzed, while taking has long been touted to help people with MS. Now studies are finding that a drink or two might not be that bad, and that alcohol consumption may have a neuroprotective effect. Many people with MS assert that a drink or two helps them get through the day. “People think I’m drunk when I’m sober and sober when I’ve had a glass of wine,” says MS blogger , who has been living with a progressive form of the disease for the past decade. The effects of alcohol may depend upon the type of MS, relapsing or progressive. found alcohol consumption was beneficial for some and not for others. While consumption of alcoholic beverages, coffee, and fish were all associated with slowing down the progression of disability in people with relapsing onset MS, the people with progressive onset MS did not receive the same benefits. These findings may suggest that different underlying mechanisms might signal progression of disability in relapsing and progressive onset MS and could warrant further study. Patients with relapsing MS who were regular consumers of alcohol, wine, coffee, and fish had lower disability scores compared with those who never consumed these substances. But in the progressive onset group no association was found except for the type of fish eaten. Those who preferred fatty fish showed an increased risk for higher disabilities versus those that consumed lean fish. Some studies suggest that neuroprotective properties, like those found in caffeine, may actually help of developing MS. People who also reported a high consumption of coffee exceeding 900 mL per day showed significantly less risk of developing MS vs. those who never consumed it. While one or two drinks might ease symptoms, the chronic use or abuse of alcohol can exacerbate symptoms. The risks and benefits of alcohol consumption for people with MS are still being studied. These symptoms could include numbness, tingling, loss of sensation, tremor, lack of coordination, and dementia. Excessive alcohol may also damage the liver, stomach, and other organs. Alcohol can also be a bad mix with medications sometimes prescribed for people with MS such as baclofen, diazepam, clonazepam, and some antidepressants. And consumption of alcohol can have a negative effect on important vitamins and minerals, such as lowering levels of , a trace element required for normal cell growth and repair. Further analysis is needed to better understand the potential cause and effect relationship between alcohol and its effects. — Promising Treatments and Clinical Trials for Relapsing-Remitting MS Could an Undiagnosed Sleep Disorder be Causing Your MS Fatigue?

6f015e72-8f4f-4313-99e9-e14a8d9aa9de,"MRI Tests May Help Doctors Predict MS Progression in Patients — Researchers may have figured out how to use information from these imaging tests to determine what type of multiple sclerosis may develop after an initial attack. Researchers have apparently a way to help predict multiple sclerosis disease progression one year after an initial attack. Magnetic resonance imaging scans (MRIs) have long been used to assist in diagnosing multiple sclerosis (MS). But now these tests are providing information that can tell experts what type of MS a patient may get, if any. Experts say that by using the first MRI after the presentation of disease and determining location, length, and numbers of lesions, they created a feasible way to predict whether a patient will have more attacks. They can also gauge whether a person’s disease will turn into relapsing MS or progressive MS. “MS treatments have a price and side effects can be serious,” said Dr. Noam Bosak, part of the research group and a physician in the neurology department of Rambam Health Care Campus in Haifa, a 1,000-bed academic hospital serving more than 2 million residents of northern Israel. “We wish to help healthcare professionals and patients make better decisions together.” Bosak explained how after an initial demyelinating attack, a person could have no more activity, a diagnosis known as clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). “It can sometimes take 12 months for a doctor and patient to make a decision on treatment,” she told Healthline. By categorizing lesions based on size and location, the MRI can help show which kind of treatment may work best and when it’s needed. “Some patients will need more aggressive treatments while others will do well on a more relaxed follow-up program,” Bosak said. “This is a unique study focusing on the first year.” The study took patients with one clinically isolated attack and measured their brain lesions with an MRI at time of attack and at intervals during the first year. One year after the first MRI, 54 percent of the patients had progressed to MS. Researchers concluded that patients with lesions that were temporal, occipital, or perpendicular to the corpus callosum at the first episode were more likely to have a recurrence. Those patients with a combination of more than 13 lesions, with maximal lesion length greater than 0.75 cm, and a lesion perpendicular to the corpus callosum, had a 19 times higher chance of conversion MS during the following year. There were only 46 patients in the study, but experts say the results are revealing. “This small study adds to the literature of MRI studies which suggest the utility of specific MRI parameters as prognostic indicators,” said Dr. Barbara Giesser, professor of clinical neurology at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California at Los Angeles and clinical director of the UCLA MS program. “What people are trying to accomplish is to diagnose as early as possible,” added Bruce Bebo, executive vice president of research at the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. “The earlier we treat [MS], the better the outcomes. We know that.” “This work is part of a whole series of people around the world to discover who’s at high risk to get MS. And to have the confidence to treat these patients before they get MS,” Bebo told Healthline. He added that experts are looking for anything that gives confidence in diagnosing MS as early as possible with tools such as MRI and biomarkers. “It was a fine study, intriguing, interesting, and adds to what we know about the imaging factor, but it’s not actionable yet,” Bebo said. “It was a pretty small number of participants, but it’s a clue. A hypotheses-generating study would need to be pursued by larger groups and people to use it as prognostic tool.” Today, neurologists can use MRIs, clinical history, and examinations to start to get a sense for those with CIS and to separate those with higher and lower risk for developing MS. “Neurologists can then decide if they’re willing to treat CIS if factors like imaging and history are adding up to high risk category,” explained Bebo. MRIs are increasingly used with confidence in helping healthcare providers and patients determine a course of action in treatment. In 2017, the Consortium of MS Centers created new on how to best use MRIs in the MS diagnosis and follow-up processes. “Most interesting, most important thing, I found is clearly practical,” concluded Bosak, “It gives us a tool to make decisions about DMTs [disease modifying therapies] for patients.” The biggest question regarding MS treatment is how to attack it correctly from day one. “One wouldn’t make a decision based on this information, but it gives a direction.” Bosak said. “We need a larger study to make it a better clinical tool.” Editor’s note: Caroline Craven is a patient expert living with MS.

Kynurenine pathway metabolomics predicts and provides mechanistic insight into multiple sclerosis progression Kynurenine pathway metabolomics predicts and provides mechanistic insight into multiple sclerosis progression , Article number:  () Activation of the kynurenine pathway (KP) of tryptophan metabolism results from chronic inflammation and is known to exacerbate progression of neurodegenerative disease. To gain insights into the links between inflammation, the KP and multiple sclerosis (MS) pathogenesis, we investigated the KP metabolomics profile of MS patients. Most significantly, we found aberrant levels of two key KP metabolites, kynurenic acid (KA) and quinolinic acid (QA). The balance between these metabolites is important as it determines overall excitotoxic activity at the N-methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA) receptor. We also identified that serum KP metabolic signatures in patients can discriminate clinical MS subtypes with high sensitivity and specificity. A C5.0 Decision Tree classification model discriminated the clinical subtypes of MS with a sensitivity of 91%. After validation in another independent cohort, sensitivity was maintained at 85%. Collectively, our studies suggest that abnormalities in the KP may be associated with the switch from early-mild stage MS to debilitating progressive forms of MS and that analysis of KP metabolites in MS patient serum may have application as MS disease biomarkers. Increasing evidence supports the hypothesis that inflammation contributes to neurodegeneration and is linked to multiple sclerosis (MS) progression. Weiner HL (2009) described how the adaptive immunity mediated by auto-reactive T-cells, fuels the early stages of MS (i.e. relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis; RRMS), while monocytic cells of the innate immunity contribute to further neuronal degeneration that exacerbates disease progression leading to secondary progressive MS (SPMS). However, it is not well understood why approximately 50% of RRMS patients progress to secondary progressive MS, while 50% do not. We sought to better understand the mechanistic drivers of this switch. As the kynurenine pathway (KP) of the tryptophan metabolism is highly inducible in inflammatory environments, we hypothesized that changes in the KP may be associated with the progressive switch in MS. The kynurenine pathway (KP) is the major route that breaks down tryptophan subsequently leading to the production of NAD. In the presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines, the KP is induced by activation of its first enzyme, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO-1). Metabolites produced along the KP can have neurotoxic or neuroprotective effects. Quinolinic acid (QA) is perhaps the most important, leading acutely to human neuronal death and chronically to dysfunction by at least 7 separate mechanisms, of which, N-methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA) receptor excitotoxicity is the best characterised. Within the brain and CNS, QA is produced by activated microglia and infiltrating macrophages but not in neurons or astrocytes. Kynurenic acid (KA), produced by astrocytes, is an antagonist of ionotropic glutamate receptors and thus blocks the excitotoxic effects of QA, KA also has antioxidant activity, readily scavenging hydroxyl, superoxide anion and other free radicals. Indeed, in disease states where excess QA is produced, it is thought that there is insufficient KA to block QA. Accordingly, we examined the role of the KP in MS progression as it potentially links inflammation-induced activation of the KP, the production of the glutamatergic (NMDA)-modulatory metabolites, KA and QA, to excitotoxic neurodegeneration. This metabolic shift may explain why the inflammatory milieu in RRMS changes to a neurodegenerative one in SPMS and may even constitute a unique metabolic biomarker of MS progression. Currently, there are no biomarkers that can identify this transition, and a suitable biomarker would be useful for assessing patient prognosis and potentially new therapeutics. All studies were carried out in accordance with the guidelines of the relevant institutional human research ethics committee and approved by St Vincent’s Hospital Sydney (HREC– H03/037) and Macquarie University (HREC – 5201300333). Our study adheres to ‘The code of ethics of the World Medical Association (Declaration of Helsinki)’ for experiments involving human subjects. Written consent was obtained from respective sources that provided the samples. In order to thoroughly profile KP metabolism in MS, samples were obtained through the Accelerated Cure Project for Multiple Sclerosis (ACPMS), USA, and consisted of serum samples from patients with RRMS, SPMS, primary progressive (PPMS) and healthy controls (HC) subjects. Exclusion criteria included MS patients currently receiving disease modifying drugs or who had corticosteroid within the past 3 months, or presence of other medical conditions. Randomized samples were age and gender matched between the experimental groups (i.e. RRMS, SPMS, PPMS and HC) where possible. As repeated blood samples collected over two years were available, offered the ability to track changes in the KP longitudinally and was obtained through the Tasmanian MS Longitudinal Study conducted between 2003 and 2005. To further validate our study, we sourced another cohort of MS patients () with matched same-patient serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from The Human Brain and Spinal Fluid Resource Center (HBSFRC), USA. All samples were unsorted and re-labelled for blinding prior to analysis. All reagents and KP metabolites were analytical reagent grade and were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO), unless otherwise stated. Deuterated internal standards were purchased from Medical Isotopes, Inc (Pelham, NH). KP metabolites were extracted using 10% (/) trichloroacetic acid (TCA) with equal volume of serum samples in accordance with methods previously described. CSF samples were prepared similarly to serum samples except that deproteinization with TCA was not performed. Concurrent analysis of tryptophan, kynurenine, 3-hydroxykynrenine (3-HK), 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (3-HAA), and anthranilic acid (AA) was performed with UHPLC as described by Jones ., using an injection volume of 20 μL of the prepared extract from each samples. KA detection was performed using a gradient mobile phase comprise of 50 mM sodium acetate buffer supplement with 25 mM zinc acetate (dihydrate) to enhance fluorescence intensity and 2.25% acetonitrile as organic modifier (Solvent A), and 10% acetonitrile (Solvent B). Each sample (10 μL) was injected into a Poroshell RRHT C-18, 1.8 μm 2.1 × 100 mm column (Agilent Technologies, Inc, Santa Clara, CA) maintained at 38 °C for 12 min run time at a unison flowrate of 0.75 mL/min. The gradient elution consisted of 100% solvent A for 3 min and then 50% solvent A and 50% solvent B for 2 min, followed by 100% B for 2 min and 100% solvent A (run time 10 min). This gradient ensures sufficient time for KA retention while minimizing potential build-up of pressure due to precipitation of the high salt buffer. Detection of KA used fluorescence (excitation and emission wavelengths of 344 and 388 nm, respectively with a retention time of 1.5 min). Agilent OpenLAB CDS ChemStation (Edition C.01.04) was used to analyze the chromatograms (). For GCMS, 50 μL of the prepared extract were derivatized. Concurrent analysis of PA and QA were carried out as described by Smythe . with slight modification using an Agilent 7890 A GC system coupled with Agilent 5975 C mass spectrometry detector and Agilent 7693 A autosampler (Agilent Technologies, Inc, Santa Clara, CA) with one microliter of derivatized mixture. Separation of PA and QA were achieved with a DB-5MS column, 0.25 μm film thickness, 0.25 mm × 30 m capillary column (Agilent Technologies, Inc, Santa Clara, CA) within 7 min but the assay run time was set for 12 min to prevent sample carryover. Concentrations of PA and QA were analyzed using Agilent GC/MSD ChemStation software (Edition 02.02.1431) and interpolated from the established six-point calibration curves based on the abundance count ratio of the metabolites to their corresponding deuterated internal standards within each standards and samples (). The intra- and inter-assay CV was within the acceptable range of 4–8% for UHPLC assays and 7–10% for GCMS assays calculated from the repeated measures of the metabolites standards incorporated during the sequence run. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) was measured with 20 μL of neat serum using a previously described method. Quantification of multiplexing cytokines, chemokines and growth factors was performed using commercial 27-plex magnetic bead based immunoassay kits (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) on . Each assay was performed in accordance to manufacturer’s instructions at the Australian Proteome Analysis Facility, as described by A. Khan. Final readout of the sample concentration was expressed as picogram per millilitre (pg/mL) based on the standard curves integrated in the assay using the Bio-Plex Manager v5.0 software with reproducible intra- and inter-assay CV of 5–8%. The normality of the variables, where required, was checked by Shapiro-Wilk and/or Kolmogorov Smirnov normality tests and equality of the variances by Levene’s test for equality of variances. Comparisons between different MS subtypes and control group were performed by either ANOVA or Kruskal Wallis test, depending on the normality and equal variances analyses. Correlations between variables in were assessed by Pearson’s correlations; where required, log transformation of the variables was made before calculating correlations. A -value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Paired t-tests or Wilcoxon Signed Ranks tests, depending on the distribution of the variables were applied to investigate the changes to the inflammatory mediators and KP variables from where the patients were observed between the years 2003 (baseline, cohort enrollment) and 2005. Four classification methods were used to identify the relative predictive value of each of the variables in each MS subtype in (Training set) and then validated against (Test set). These methods included the Classification and Regression Tree, Support Vector Machines, Discriminant Analysis and C5.0 Decision Tree. A classification model was considered successful when it consistently returned high predictive accuracy rates across all three MS subtypes and control group. The model predictions were compared to random predictions (class specific lifts) to decide which model was best for future predictions. In addition, class-specific statistical powers were compared to identify the best classification model. All classification models were developed using IBM SPSS Modeler 14.2, and R incorporated with various R packages such as Rcmdr, Lawstat, MASS, CAR and Lattice. To investigate whether changes to the CSF KP profiles mirrored serum KP profiles in the controls and MS subtypes of , we developed a series of models to identify the best relationships between the CSF KP variables and serum KP variables in the experimental groups. In the first model (model 1), we investigated whether it was possible to predict the CSF value for a KP variable based on its paired serum sample variable. In the second model (model 2), we added the experimental groups as covariates to model 1 to predict the CSF variables. In the last model (model 3), we used model 2 but adjusted for potential confounding factors from all other serum KP variables. We compared these models based on Akaike information criterion (AIC) and adjusted R, to identify the best model(s). made up a total of 136 participants consisting of 50 RRMS, 20 SPMS, 17 PPMS and 49 HC. Age differences between the subtypes were adjusted accordingly in the subsequent analysis. Similarly a total of 59 participants consisting of 44 RRMS and 15 SPMS from were included in this study. Each participant provided a baseline and follow-up (1.72 years ±0.27) serum samples for analysis. A total of 36 participants from met exclusion criteria and provided CSF and matching serum. Accordingly, consisted of 10 patients with RRMS, 20 patients with SPMS and 6 HC. Demographic and clinical characteristics of the subjects in all cohorts are summarized in . KP activation occurs when the activity of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO-1; the first enzyme in the KP) is significantly higher, leading to the consumption of kynurenine and higher kynurenine/tryptophan (K/T) ratio. In all the MS subtype groups the K/T ratio was significantly increased compared to the HC group (p < 0.0001, ; see for complete KP profile). These data also emphasize the importance of analyzing both TRP and KYN to determine KP activation, as relying on a single metabolite can lead to misinterpretation of data. Abnormal downstream KP metabolites production in MS indicating excitotoxicity As noted above, KA is capable of preventing glutamate-induced excitotoxicity induced by QA. Significantly, we found that KA levels were highest in the RRMS group relative to HC and progressive MS groups (p < 0.0001, ). However, KA levels were significantly lower in the progressive MS groups relative to controls. Picolinic acid, another known neuroprotective KP metabolite, showed a similar trend to KA, being highest in the RRMS but lowest in the PPMS, groups (p < 0.0001, ). Production of QA increased uniformly in concert with disease severity and was particularly elevated in the PPMS group (p < 0.0001, ). We also found decreased NAD+ in all MS patient groups (p < 0.0001, ) which is also indicative of net QA elevation. The QA/KA ratio is indicative of excitotoxic potential with higher QA/KA ratio value favoring excitotoxicity. The QA/KA ratio was higher in both PPMS and SPMS groups compared to controls and the RRMS group (p < 0.0001, ). 3-HK, another potential neurotoxin, was found to be significantly higher in MS groups compared to healthy control (p < 0.0001, ). These data support our hypothesis that toxic KP metabolites fuel neurodegeneration in MS. KP profile changes involving innate immunity are associated with MS disease severity and subtype Pearson’s correlation analysis showed that the KP variables correlated significantly to Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores suggesting that perturbed KP metabolism may reflect the progression of the disease. Notably, the QA/KA ratio has the strongest correlation with EDSS (r = 0.62, p < 0.0001) underscoring the potential significance of these key KP parameters to the disability and severity of MS (). Using the Wilcoxon signed rank test for paired data analysis, we showed that the K/T ratio significantly increased over time (p = 0.029) in patients with RRMS demonstrating increased indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO-1) activity (). We also found increased expression of the innate immunity signature proteins, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1α (p = 0.004) and MIP-1β (p = 0.001) over time in RRMS that are produced by infiltrating macrophages (). This is accompanied by decrease in adaptive immune respond evident by decreased IL-2 level. Although IL-7 was shown to be significantly increased over time, however, the degree of change is very small (from 13 to 18 pg/ml) and unlikely to be clinically relevant. The KP and immune profiles predict the course of disease in MS Currently, there are no validated biomarkers of MS but our data suggests that certain metabolic KP signatures may discriminate MS subtype. To further explore the utility of KP metabolites as MS biomarkers, we applied predictive analytics. Initially, a predictive model was developed incorporating KP metabolites, inflammatory mediators and patient demographic information. The predictive model was then used to yield classification results, i.e., successful identification of MS subtype. From a total of 37 potential predictors, we found six that were the most critical determinants successfully predicting MS subtype (). These were KA, QA, tryptophan, PA, fibroblast growth factor-basic and tumour necrosis factor-α (in order of relevance). Using various classification models in Training Set, a C5.0 Decision Tree provided the best overall prediction achieving an accuracy of 91% shown in . We further validated the model using a Test set () and obtained a predictive accuracy of 83% (). This confirmed that our panel of 6 predictors can be used as a MS subtype biomarker. To confirm that a facile blood-based KP biomarker for MS is feasible, we correlated CSF KP variables to patient-paired serum profiles (Cohort 3). After adjusting for confounding factors (stratification of clinical grouping and presence of other KP parameters), our regression analysis indicated that serum KP metabolites were able to explain 62.9% (p < 0.001) of changes observed in patient-paired CSF KP variables () with a moderately strong (65%) to strong (79.3%) correlation between CSF and serum KP metabolites. We evaluated the KP in MS in order to explore the links between inflammation, the KP and MS disease progression. Our data indicates that KP metabolism is aberrant in MS, as shown by elevated K/T ratio in MS patients compared to healthy controls, confirming previous studies. Increased IDO-1 activity (as reflected by higher K/T ratios) is known to suppress the T-cell mediated response in MS via activation of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). We recently showed that kynurenine, the by-product of IDO1, is an endogenous ligand of the AhR that inhibits the inflammatory response in chronic experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mice model of MS. Indeed, inhibition of IDO1 in EAE mice leads to exacerbation of disease progression. Initially, induction of the KP (i.e., up-regulation of IDO-1) may be beneficial as IDO-1 mediates an immunomodulatory effect in MS that partially explains the therapeutic effect exerted by interferons and vitamin D in early-mild stages of MS. This is also reflected in our longitudinal data (Cohort 2) with elevated K/T ratio (i.e., increased IDO1 expression) in RRMS but not SPMS to maintain a stable EDSS. However, chronic IDO-1 activation changes the excitotoxic balance due to increased QA production and may also disrupt the biosynthesis of serotonin and melatonin in the brain, as these neurotransmitters are produced in separate branches of the KP that are dependent on tryptophan (). Considering that lower serotonin and melatonin have been associated with depression in MS and decreased melatonin is known to correlate to increased risk of MS relapse, restricted tryptophan availability caused by KP activation, may play a role in depression or relapse in MS. Given that the KP is known to be induced by inflammation, we found surprisingly few correlations between inflammatory mediators and KP modulations. However, a positive correlation was found between interferon (IFN)-g-inducible protein (IP)-10 with K/T ratio (r = 0.31, p < 0.001) and QA (r = 0.2, p < 0.001) indicating an IFN-γ mediated response. Although we did not see significant up-regulation/correlation with IFN-γ and the KP, this may reflect the acute-phase nature of IFN-γ. Considering that the innate immunity markers (MIP-1α and MIP-1β) increased over time in the longitudinal RRMS patient samples (), this implies that even with stable EDSS, the innate immune activity is still constitutively active. Activated innate cells such as macrophages or microglia are known to be the major source of pathophysiological concentrations of QA. We previously showed that oligodendrocytes exposed to QA from activated microglia take up QA leading to oligodendrocyte death. This was reversed by targeting QA production, either by a KP inhibitor or a specific QA targeting antibody. Collectively, our data provides evidence that, over time, the initially suppressive T-cell effect mediated by IDO-1 changes to a more chronic form of KP activation that leads to MS progression by the production of excitotoxic QA (and increased QA/KA ratio) by infiltrating macrophages. Our data support the concept that targeting innate cells may be a feasible immunotherapeutic approach to retard MS disease progression in MS which warrants further investigation. Increased levels of neuroprotective metabolites, KA and PA, were only observed in RRMS but not in SPMS or PPMS, while toxic metabolites, 3-HK and QA level were progressively increased in both SPMS and PPMS. These observations may imply a role for neurotoxic KP metabolites in mediating neurodegeneration in MS. As described above, QA mediates potent excitotoxicity at the NMDA receptor, whereas KA plays a neuroprotective role as it antagonizes QA excitotoxicity at this receptor. Hence, the balance between QA and KA (expressed as the QA/KA ratio) defines the overall glutamatergic activity at the NMDA receptor and determines whether QA-mediated neurodegenerative excitotoxicity prevails. The observed increased level of KA only in RRMS may be a compensatory mechanism in early-stage disease against QA-induced excitotoxicity, as suggested by the moderately strong correlation between QA/KA ratio and MS severity. It also indicates that the KP shunts towards production of KA, but not QA, during early disease course, whereas in later disease stages, the KP is shunted differently, favoring production of QA instead of KA. The mechanism(s) of this differential shunting remains unclear, but delineating these may suggest new therapeutic options. Additionally, as 3-HK is known to potentiate QA-induced excitotoxicity, the higher 3-HK levels in SPMS and PPMS patients observed in our study might also be relevant to the neurodegenerative process in MS. Our results are also consistent with the increased levels of 3-HK and QA found in tissues of the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) rat model of MS. Considered collectively, our results suggest that NMDA receptor mediated excitotoxicity is highly relevant in the neurodegeneration associated with progressive MS and may constitute a key threshold event in the switch from RRMS to SPMS. To our knowledge, this is the first study using targeted KP metabolomics as a blood-based prognostic biomarker capable of distinguishing MS subtype. Previously, decreased tryptophan was found in MS patients and described as a potential biomarker. However, this study only detected tryptophan and was not capable of detecting other downstream KP metabolites. This study also failed to distinguish between MS subtype. We showed that tryptophan and 3 other metabolites of the KP were important predictors of MS subtype and correlated to disease severity scores. Indeed, the four KP predictors accounted for approximately 90% of the predictive power of our built model with the two inflammatory mediators only adding 10% predictive power. This suggests that tryptophan metabolism is more relevant to MS pathology than general inflammation. The validity of model was confirmed when applied to an alternate and independent blinded set (Test set, ) where we observed a reproducible accuracy of 83%. One potential limitation of a blood based biomarker for neurological disease may be that blood parameters may not necessarily mirror those of the CNS. However, a previous study demonstrated that the blood KP profile followed closely with changes of the KP profile in CNS and our analysis (which included 3 more KP variables, i.e. K/T ratio, KA and PA) showed generally good to-strong plasma-CNS KP metabolite correlations in the range 65–79.3%. Potential factors limiting these correlations may include the inherent differences in the magnitude of CSF parameters relative to serum values and the fact that the length of storage time (over 10 years) in some of these samples may have led to the partial degradation of some analytes. Although, the key metabolites kynurenine and QA have been reported as relatively stable even after many years of storage. Notwithstanding these points, the moderately strong correlations between CSF and serum, confirms that the serum KP profile is a suitably sensitive blood-based predictor of disease progression in MS. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that KP parameters have a strong association with MS subtype, correlating with disease severity scores. The changing levels of KP metabolites we observed also provides a mechanistic insight that may explain the transition from the milder RRMS form to the more debilitating SPMS disease form. KP profiling is likely to be relevant to the pathogenesis of other diseases characterized by inflammation and neurodegeneration, like Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and ALS, where aberrant KP metabolism has been reported. Our results also suggest that strategies aimed rebalancing the KP, particularly in terms of QA/KA levels, could be useful therapeutic approaches in slowing neurodegeneration in MS. Lim, C. K. .

Multiple sclerosis (MS) literally means “many scars,” which refers to the lesions that accumulate in the brain and spinal cord throughout the course of the disease. These scars, or lesions, consist mostly of dead nerve cells, whose axons have been denuded of the myelin sheaths that normally protect them and permit the conduction of nerve impulses. MS is a chronic, degenerative disease that usually begins in young adulthood and most visibly destroys muscular control, although many other brain functions are affected. Most people will live with MS for decades after their diagnosis. MS reduces life expectancy after onset (as measured by current diagnostic criteria) by only about 10-15 years, and about half of the patients survive 30 years or more from onset. THE CLINICAL PICTURE: SYMPTOMS, DISEASE COURSE, VARIATION, AND DIAGNOSIS MS, as defined by ongoing central nervous system (CNS) lesion formation and increasing cumulative damage, is now recognized as a disease that is active in most patients most of the time. Disease activity has reversible and irreversible sequelae; irreversible sequelae ultimately lead to progressive impairment and disability in most patients. MS takes a variety of forms, distinguished by the clinical pattern of disease activity (, ). Accumulated deficit can produce sustained worsening in both relapsing and progressive MS.

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. Varieties of MS Autopsy studies indicate there are individuals without any known clinical history who have neuropathologic changes typical of MS. It is difficult to get an accurate estimate of subclinical disease, but one recent review suggested asymptomatic MS might account for up to 25% of all cases. This is the major MS subtype. Approximately 85% of patients with a diagnosis of MS start out with relapsing MS. Overall, this subtype accounts for 55% of MS. Relapsing MS patients show a high rate of inflammatory lesion activity (gadolinium-enhancing lesions). This category represents a subset of relapsing patients who have few attacks and make an excellent recovery. They show minimal impairment and disability, even after 20-30 years. The proportion of MS patients with benign disease is controversial. Reasonable studies suggest 10-20% of people with MS fit into this category. This subtype accounts for 10% of MS. Patients show gradual worsening from onset, without disease attacks. These patients tend to be older and often present with a spinal cord dysfunction without obvious brain involvement. This subtype is the least likely to show inflammatory lesion activity on MRI (gadolinium-enhancing). Unlike the other subtypes of MS, men are as likely as women to develop primary progressive MS. This subtype accounts for 5% of MS. Patients show slow worsening from onset, with superimposed attacks. Recent studies suggest these patients are similar to primary progressive patients. This is the major progressive subtype and accounts for approximately 30% of MS. Relapsing MS patients usually transition to secondary progressive disease. They show gradual worsening, with or without superimposed relapses. Natural history studies of untreated relapsing MS indicate 50% of patients will be secondary progressive at 10 years and almost 90% by 25 years. This form of MS shows a lower rate of inflammatory lesion activity than relapsing MS, yet the total burden of disease continues to increase. This most likely reflects ongoing axonal loss. Also referred to as Marburg variant MS, this is the most severe form of MS. Significant disability develops much more rapidly than usual, over weeks to months. Pathologic changes are widespread and destructive. These cases are rare and generally occur in young people. This refers to patients who present with an isolated CNS syndrome (optic neuritis, incomplete transverse myelitis, brainstem or cerebellar lesion), which is often the first MS attack. Clinical, MRI, and CSF studies indicate that such patients with normal brain MRI and CSF have a low risk of developing MS. In contrast, those with abnormal MRI have a high risk of developing MS. NOTE: CSF = cerebrosinal fluid; MRI = magnetic resonance imaging ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future.

In progressive MS, the dominant pattern is a gradual accumulation of neurologic deficits, with slow clinical worsening. Disease activity and progression have both clinical and subclinical components. Clinical disease activity and progression are judged by observation and neurologic examination. Subclinical components refer to pathological changes that are not observable in a clinical examination but are observed using a variety of laboratory tests, predominantly neuroimaging parameters. Relapses are variously referred to as acute attacks, exacerbations, or disease flare-ups. They involve the acute, or sudden onset, of focal neurologi- ""2 Clinical and Biological Features.""

Examples of typical MS relapses include blurring of vision in one eye (optic neuritis), persistent numbness or tingling of a body part (sensory system relapse), weakness of a body part (motor system relapse), or loss of coordination (cerebellar system relapse). Early in the MS disease process, relapses are likely to involve sensory, motor, cerebellar, or visual system abnormalities ( , ). Later in the disease process, relapses are likely to involve bladder, bowel, cognitive, and sexual function abnormalities. Acute disease attacks are a characteristic feature of the relapsing-remitting MS subtype. Relapses also occur in patients with progressive relapsing disease and in a number of patients with secondary progressive disease. The only clinical disease subtype in which relapses never occur is primary progressive MS. Areas of the CNS often affected by MS. Reprinted with permission from University of Delaware. Sensory problems (numbness or tingling of a body part) ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. Relapses generally consist of three phases. There is a period of worsening, with onset of new deficits or increasing severity of old deficits. This is followed by a period of stability, with no change in deficits. The final phase is the period of recovery, with variable degrees of improvement in deficits. Most patients recover within six weeks, although for some, improvements can continue over months. Recovery can be complete return to baseline status, partial return, or no improvement. However, some degree of improvement is typical, particularly early in the disease. Relapsing patients then remain clinically stable until the next disease attack. To be considered a relapse, deficits must persist for a minimum of 24 hours. This avoids confusion with deficits lasting only minutes to hours, which are believed to be a consequence of impaired nerve conduction through old lesion areas rather than the formation of a new lesion. Alternatively, new abnormalities that last seconds to minutes, such as Lhermitte's sign (a tingling sensation radiating down the arms, neck, or back on neck flexion), or paroxysmal attacks (stereotypic neurologic deficits occurring multiple times a day that last less than a minute) are also considered relapses if they occur repeatedly over several weeks. Sequential relapses are considered distinct only when they occur at least 30 days apart with a month of clinical stability in between. Although clinical relapses always produce changes in a patient's condition, they are not always associated with changes on neurologic examination. Maximal deficit in an MS relapse typically develops over several days but in some cases can develop much faster, over hours or even minutes, or much more slowly, over a period as long as several weeks. Physiologic factors such as temperature, pH, or electrolyte balance can temporarily disrupt nerve conduction and produce neurologic abnormality. A relapse must be distinguished from a which is a neurologic deterioration associated with a physiologic change such as infection or fever. This condition can last for days, mimicking a true relapse. Pseudoexacerbation deficits disappear once the precipitating factor has been corrected. They reflect a temporary disruption in nerve conduction, rather than the formation of a new lesion. Approximately 85 percent of MS patients begin with relapsing-remitting disease. MS relapses can involve a single neural system, as in optic neuritis, or several anatomically distinct systems at the same time, for example, combined motor and sensory problems. Attacks involving single neural systems are somewhat more common in the first MS relapse. Most patients experience their second attack within two to three years of the first, but 5 percent of patients remain free of relapses for 15 years or more. In most cases, there is substantial recovery from the first relapse; only 4 percent of patients show no improvement. The average relapse rate is one to two attacks a year, but this rate normally declines over time. The longer a person has MS, the less likely it is that relapses will be followed by complete recovery and the more likely it is that relapses will be associated with residual deficits and increasing disability.

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. Relapse features have prognostic significance (). In the first few years after disease onset, the number and type of relapses, as well as the degree of recovery, help predict future disease course. Relapses that involve visual, sensory, or brainstem systems have a better prognosis than those that involve cerebellar, motor, or sphincter systems. In the first two years of disease, a low relapse rate with excellent recovery indicates a better prognosis than a high relapse rate with poor recovery. Relapses restricted to single neural systems are prognostically better than those involving multiple systems. The relapse rate also has prognostic significance in the later stages of MS. With a disease duration of five or more years, an increasing relapse rate, polyregional relapses that involved multiple systems, and incomplete recovery from relapses indicate a worse prognosis. The relapsing form of MS is characterized by acute disease exacerbations. In contrast, progressive MS is characterized by slow deterioration and increasing neurological deficits. There are three forms of progressive MS. Approximately 15 percent of MS patients show slow deterioration from onset. In the second form, 10 percent have either primary progressive MS and never experience acute disease attacks or progressive relapsing MS (5 percent), and have occasional subsequent attacks. The third form, secondary progressive MS, is the major progressive subtype. These are relapsing patients who begin to slowly worsen 5 to 15 years after the first relapse. Once relapsing patients enter a progressive phase, they either stop having relapses or continue to experience exacerbations superimposed on slow worsening. Documentation of a progressive course requires at least six months of observation. Observation over a year or two is often necessary to be confident of progression, since deficits can accumulate at a very gradual rate. The major defining feature of progressive MS is slow deterioration that occurs independently of acute disease relapses and does not reflect residual deficits from acute disease attacks. An analysis of the disease course among 1,844 patients indicated that the presence or absence of relapses during the progressive phase does not significantly affect the progression of irreversible disability (4 percent of ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. patients in this study had been treated for up to one year with beta-interferon, but this did not affect the study results). Progressive MS patients can be clinically stable for up to several years at a time and can even show slight improvement for a period of time. Ultimately, however, all progressive MS patients develop disability with limited ability to walk. Progressive MS is a more severe form than benign or relapsing-remitting MS and has a worse prognosis. Clinical parameters such as relapses and progression underestimate the actual damage to tissue that occurs in MS. When macroscopically normal-appearing brain tissue is looked at under the microscope, one can detect inflammation, gliosis (scarring), and myelin damage. Chemical studies of normal-appearing brain tissue often reveal changes in organelles such as lysosomes, in enzymes, and in myelin constituents. In addition, a number of the new research neuro-imaging techniques can detect changes in brain and spinal cord areas that appear free of lesions on conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Some of these abnormalities are detectable several months to years before they can be seen with conventional MRI. Changes in normal-appearing brain tissue are generally pronounced in MS patients with severe impairment. As a group, secondary progressive MS patients show more abnormalities in normal white matter and brain tissue than relapsing patients. (White matter corresponds to brain regions where axons are ensheathed in myelin; gray matter corresponds to brain regions that are rich in cell bodies.) Primary progressive patients often show subtle but diffuse changes in normal-appearing brain areas. Even conventional MRI indicates that most new lesion formation is clinically silent, meaning that clinical exam does not reveal any corresponding symptoms. Approximately 80 to 90 percent of new brain lesions do not produce identifiable relapses. They might, however, be associated with subtle cognitive changes or other neuropsychological changes that are not detected in clinical examination. The total lesion burden increases in MS patients, on average, 5 to 10 percent per year, reflecting in large part the development of clinically silent lesions. (This does not apply to patients on the disease-modifying therapies discussed later in this section.) Atrophy of both brain and spinal cord can be detected even in patients with minimal symptoms. Atrophy can progress without obvious lesion formation, most likely reflecting loss of axons. MS patients show an accelerated rate of age-related brain and spinal cord atrophy that is three- to tenfold higher than the rate in control populations. Spinal cord lesions are generally similar to those in the brain except for the absence of “black holes” (see discussion in of T1-weighted lesions). Spinal MS lesions rarely cover more than half of the cross-sectional area of the cord or exceed two vertebral segments in length. They are found more often in the cervical spinal cord (neck region) than thoracic region (midback) and are most ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001.

MRI involves application of a magnetic field to the body that causes nuclei with odd numbers of protons, such as hydrogen nuclei, to behave like tiny magnets. These protons align themselves either parallel or antiparallel to the applied external magnetic field. The net magnetization induces an electric current that forms the basic MR signal. An MR image is formed by determining the spatial distribution of the signal and reconstructing the data into detailed images. The signals are picked up by a very sensitive antenna and forwarded to a computer for processing. Two time constants, T1 and T2 relaxation times, are important in determining the appearance of MR images. T1, or the longitudinal relaxation time, is the time constant when 63 percent of the original longitudinal magnetization is regained as the nuclei return to alignment with the external magnetic field. T2 or the transverse relaxation time, is the time constant when the transverse magnetization decreases to 37 percent of its original value as the nuclei lose alignment with each other following the initial application of an external magnetic field (a radio-frequency pulse). By altering the imaging parameters and pulse sequences used, differences between tissues with intrinsically different proton densities and T1 and T2 relaxation times can be highlighted or obscured. Image contrast can be either T1 weighted or T2 weighted in order to emphasize the differences between normal and pathological tissues. For example, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is dark on T1-weighted images and bright on T2-weighted images. White matter is bright on T1-weighted images, whereas a matter is dark but not as dark as CSF. common in the midcervical region. Disease activity is much less frequent in the spine than in the brain. In summary, the clinical manifestations of MS possibly represent only the “tip of the iceberg,” with most of the CNS damage occurring much earlier and being detectable only when the accumulated damage overwhelms the ability of the CNS to compensate. The mechanisms through which CNS tissue is damaged or destroyed are discussed in greater detail later in the chapter. At the present time, neuroimaging provides the best assessment of disease activity in MS (, ). A number of neuroimaging techniques can measure distinct pathologic changes and thereby provide markers for different aspects of the MS disease ""2 Clinical and Biological Features.""

Magnetic resonance imaging is a technique that creates cross-sectional images of the brain using a magnetic field and radio waves (). It is a versatile, powerful, and sensitive tool for measuring abnormalities in the brain. This is especially valuable with MS, because so much of the pathological activity of the disease is neurologically asymptomatic. Indeed, until neuroimaging results proved otherwise, the disease appeared to be quiescent during remissions. Neuroimaging has revealed a previously unsuspected level of activity and pathology throughout the course of disease. Contrast agents are used in MRI in cases where contrast between two tissues is poor. The contrasting agent, gadolinium, is normally excluded from the brain by the blood-brain barrier.

Gadolinium-enhancing activity on MRI correlates with clinical relapses and predicts increased risk or further disease activity. However, since most new brain MRI lesions are clinically silent, gadolinium-enhanced lesions are seen more often than clinical relapses. In T2-weighted images, MS lesions appear as very bright white areas against a gray or more neutral background and are the most readily visualized MS lesions by MRI. They reflect lesions with different pathology and of various ages, and reversible as well as irreversible abnormalities. T2-weighted hyperintense lesions can be used to measure the total lesion volume (burden-of-disease). The variable pathology, which is not distinguished in T2 burden-of-disease measures, is probably a determinant of associated disability. Only a modest relationship has been observed between T2 burden of disease and clinical disability in relapsing and secondary progressive MS. However, in patients with clinically isolated syndromes who are in the early stages of MS, T2 burden-of-disease has been correlated with the development of MS, as well as the clinical subtype of MS and disability 10 years later. The magnitude of T2 burden-of-disease changes very early in the disease process and may be valuable for predicting subsequent course. Atrophy of both brain and spinal cord can be detected in MS patients, including relapsing patients with minimal neurologic deficits. Both axon and myelin loss contribute to tissue atrophy. Recent studies suggest that CNS atrophy may be the best neuroimaging correlate for clinical disability (reviewed in 1999 by Trapp et al.). A number of different methodologies are used to measure atrophy. Current advances involve measurement of the whole brain and improved automation, but the optimal technique has not been decided. Axonal injury can be measured on proton MR spectroscopy by estimating -acetyl aspartate (NAA) levels in brain tissue. NAA is a molecule that is virtually confined to axons and neurons. Levels of NAA can fluctuate, suggesting that they can be used to measure reversible as well as irreversible damage. Persistent reduction of NAA on MR Spectroscopy correlates with axon loss, damage, or dysfunction. Reduced NAA is found not only within MS lesions but also in the normal-appearing white matter of relapsing-remitting, secondary progressive, and primary progressive MS patients. The reduction in NAA is more severe in secondary progressive MS than in relapsing MS. In addition, NAA decrease in cerebellar white matter has been correlated with clinical ataxia. NAA can be measured in a discrete region of interest within the brain. Recently, whole-brain NAA has been measured in MS. This appears to be a more meaningful neuroimaging marker to evaluate axon damage. MR spectroscopy can also be used to measure lipid changes within both lesions and normal- ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. appearing brain tissue, but these studies are very preliminary and NAA measurements are the major focus of current MR spectroscopy studies in MS. Also referred to as black holes, T1-weighted hypointense lesions have lower signal intensity than the surrounding white matter. T1 hypointense lesions are most common in the supratentorial region (cerebral hemispheres). They are much less common in the infratentorial (brainstem and cerebellum) region and are not reported in the spinal cord. Compared to T2-weighted lesions, they represent more severe tissue pathology, with axon loss, demyelination, and extracellular edema. In postmortem studies of progressive MS, T1-weighted hypointense lesions correlate strongly with axon density measurements. T1-weighted hypointense lesions show a stronger correlation with disability than T2-weighted hyperintense lesions. Magnetization transfer imaging (MTI) can be used to study global brain function or to measure changes within a local region of interest. Populations of bound and soluble protons produce different signals in response to the external magnetic field. The magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) is the ratio of the different signals produced by these two populations. It is reduced in MS and is believed to reflect both demyelination and axon loss, thereby producing an index of tissue destruction. MTR measurements are correlated with MS disability, as measured by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS; see ), as well as cognitive measures. MTI shows great promise as a disease marker. Lower MTR values occur with disease worsening in relapsing, secondary progressive, and primary progressive MS patients and even in patients with clinically isolated MS syndromes. In primary progressive patients who have a relatively small T2 burden of disease, MTR is significantly reduced, suggesting that axon damage is significantly greater in this clinical subtype. Differences in MTRs are associated with different lesion pathology. Lesions that are more destructive (as indicated by T1 hypointensity) have reduced MTR values. Lesions that remain hypointense show a persistent reduction in MTR, whereas lesions that become isointense recover in MTR. New lesions in secondary progressive patients have a lower MTR than those in relapsing patients. The decline in MTR over three years is significantly greater in secondary progressive MS than in relapsing MS, supporting a relationship between MTR changes and disease progression. MTR measures allow more significant lesions to be detected and may provide a better potential correlate with clinical disability. Reduction in MTR can precede the development of new lesions on conventional MRI. Diffusion-weighted MRI is sensitive to the diffusion, or random motion, of water molecules in tissue. It can detect subtle pathological changes that are not seen on conventional MRI. This technique ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. might allow detection of pathological change in white matter tracts, including demyelination and loss of axons, by quantifying anisotropy through a measure of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). DTI can identify significantly altered diffusion properties in normal-appearing white matter. Lesions with the highest diffusion are the more destructive black holes, while the greatest change in anisotropy is seen in acute inflammatory lesions. Coincident with new lesion formation, diffusion-weighted imaging has shown changes in contralateral normal-appearing white matter. High-field-strength magnets, which are 4 tesla (T) or higher, increase the signal-to-noise ratio (conventional imaging machines are 1.5 T). They allow enhanced detection of small (less than 5 mm) MS lesions, particularly those aligned along blood vessels. Both MR spectroscopy and MTI can be conducted on high-field machines with enhanced sensitivity. Functional magnetic resonance imaging, or fMRI, is a technique for determining which parts of the brain are activated by different types of sensation such as sight or sound, by different types of tasks such as moving one's fingers or legs, or by different mental tasks such as adding sums, reading, or memorizing. This “brain mapping” is achieved by using an MRI scanner to measure changes in blood flow to different areas of the brain. When a particular brain region is activated, blood flow into the region increases. The incoming arterial blood is rich in oxygenated hemoglobin, and there is a corresponding decrease in local deoxygenated hemoglobin. Changes in the MRI signal are derived from regional changes in the concentration of deoxygenated hemoglobin, which is a paramagnetic molecule (reviewed in Hirsch et al.). The fMRI signal is, thus, determined by the balance between oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin. FMRI can provide second-by-second images of changes in response to different stimuli and during performance of mental tasks. It provides a unique tool for assessment of neural circuits involved in loss and recovery of function, as well as for measuring the circuits underlying symptoms that are as difficult to study as cognitive changes, fatigue, pain, and sensory disturbances. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is the fluid that circulates around and within the brain and spinal cord. CSF provides a vehicle for removing waste products of cellular metabolism from the nervous system and is believed to be nutritive for both neurons and glial cells and to function as a transport system for biologically active substances such as releasing factors, hormones, neurotransmitters, and metabolites. Sampling this fluid thus provides an index to substances active in the CNS and possibly those involved in MS pathology. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. A number of potential CSF disease markers have been reported in MS, including markers that are proposed as distinguishing between different types of MS (). For the most part, these are markers of tissue damage or immune disturbance. None are currently used in routine clinical practice, since they have not proved useful enough to justify serial lumbar punctures. There has been particular interest in the specificity of oligoclonal bands in MS. Oligoclonal bands are produced by the overrepresentation of particular anti-bodies that can be visualized when CSF proteins are separated by gel electrophoresis where they appear as separate bands of protein on a gel matrix. Each of the bands contains a single type of antibody produced by a single clone of B cells. Oligoclonal bands are for the CSF of MS patients, but they are not to MS patients. For example, they are also found in the CSF of patients with other inflammatory status, such as viral brain infections. In MS, however, the particular antigens that elicit each antibody band are unknown. Investigators have recently used molecular approaches such as phage display libraries to probe MS oligoclonal immunoglobulin G (IgG) bands for sequence information related to their antigenic target. These are powerful methods that should allow for the identification of antigenic targets for the oligoclonal IgG. A main question, however, is whether the oligoclonal IgG bands represent an immune response directed against the etiologic agent of MS or merely constitute a by-product of immune system activity. In other words, upregulation of the antibody response and the heterogeneous distribution of antibodies into oligoclonal IgG bands could be a result of B-cell hyperactivity rather than an immune response to a specific etiologic pathogen. A variety of blood, urine, and mucosal fluid disease markers have been studied in MS, but none of them have provided a reliable disease marker. Again they are either markers of tissue damage (such as S-100) or immune activation (such as neopterin). Blood markers have included matrix metalloproteinases and their tissue inhibitors, circulating adhesion molecules, levels of various cytokines and their receptors, different subpopulations of cells, a variety of antibodies including antiviral and autoreactive antibodies, S-100 levels, and neopterin levels. Urine disease markers have included myelin basic protein-like material, free light chains, neopterin, gliotoxin, and neuron-specific enolase. Mucosal fluid cells and immunoglobulins have also been studied. The diagnosis of MS is based on both clinical parameters, such as medical history and neurological examination, and paraclinical parameters such as MRI, CSF oligoclonal banding, and evoked potentials. There is no MS-specific diag- ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. nostic test, and the intermittent nature of the disease and high variability in presenting symptoms make diagnosis difficult (listed in ). The presentation of MS can be monosymptomatic or have multifocal signs and symptoms, and many neurodegenerative disorders are similar to MS in their presentation. The general diagnostic criteria, established in 1965 by a committee sponsored by the National MS Society (the MS Society), state that a diagnosis of “clinically definite” MS (CDMS) requires clinical evidence of two or more white matter lesions on at least two occasions. In 1983, these criteria were expanded by Poser et al. to include the use of paraclinical parameters, and they have since become the standard MS diagnostic criteria (). In July 2000, an international committee met to further revise these criteria, in particular to make MRI information a more integral component and to incorporate diagnostic criteria for primary progressive MS. The results of that meeting, however, were not available at the time of this writing. The failure of the Poser criteria to incorporate primary progressive MS has recently been addressed by revised criteria that define definite, probable, and possible levels of diagnostic certainty. These criteria are based on clinical findings, CSF abnormalities, brain and spinal cord MRI abnormalities, and evoked potentials. Using these criteria, at least one year of clinical progression must be documented before a diagnosis of primary progressive MS can be made. MRI reveals neuropathological damage in 70 to 95 percent of people with MS and, because of its sensitivity, is the most helpful paraclinical diagnostic test. However, the use of MRI in MS diagnosis has led to concern that its high sensitivity combined with limited MS specificity leads to misdiagnosis, since other conditions including myelopathy and disseminated encephalomyelitis can cause MRI lesions similar to MS lesions. Thus, it is important that imaging be used in combination with clinical data for the diagnosis of MS. Recently, several sets of criteria for the definition of “MRI-definite” MS have been suggested (). Patients with clinically isolated syndromes are particularly difficult to diagnose, and Barkhof et al. and Fazekas have identified criteria that are relevant to such cases. Although assessment of spinal cord damage using MRI remains behind the development of brain methodology, it can be useful in diagnosing patients suspected of MS, particularly in cases with equivocal or negative brain MRI results. Spinal cord imaging increases the diagnostic sensitivity of MRI and might also enable earlier diagnosis. When demyelination or sclerosis (scarring) occurs, the conduction of nerve impulses along axons is slowed or interrupted. Impaired conductance is reflected in an increased latency of evoked potentials or an increase in the amount of time that elapses between the presentation of a sensory stimulus and the resulting ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. change in the brain's electrical field. Evoked potentials are measured by placing small electrodes on the head in the region corresponding to the stimuli presented ( ). Abnormal evoked responses to different types of stimuli provide clues to the location of plaques or lesions and are useful in detecting “clinically silent” lesions that do not produce easily observable symptoms. However, abnormal evoked responses are not unique to MS. For example, although abnormal visual IgG antibodies are composed of light and heavy polypeptide chains. Free light chains are found in patients with chronic infections or inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, but also in healthy individuals particularly following strenuous exercise. Cytokines are intercellular signaling proteins produced by cells of the immune system and CNS. They are involved in various aspects of disease processes, particularly inflammatory responses. Oligoclonal bands are produced by the overrepresentation of particular antibodies. They are of the CSF of MS patients, but not to it. Antiviral antibodies are produced by B cells in direct response to an antigen's presence, and certain antiviral antibodies are increased in the CSF of some patients with MS. Immunoglobulins are produced by plasma cells and are integral in adaptive immune responses. Polyclonal increases of IgG occur in chronic infection and inflammation. White blood cells responsible for cell-mediated immune responses to antigens, including viral infections. Adhesion, costimulatory, and other surface of MS. molecules Upregulated adhesion molecules in blood and CSF indicate sustained potential for inflammation in the CNS throughout the clinical spectrum A major component of myelin, MBP is increased in the CSF of some, but not all, MS patients following a demyelinating episode.

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. evoked potentials are common in MS, they also occur in compressive lesions of the visual pathway and spinocerebellar degeneration. Evoked potentials can aid in the localization of lesions, confirm clinically ambiguous lesions, and confirm the organic basis of symptoms. In addition, changes in evoked potentials can be used to measure disease progression and the effectiveness of therapeutic treatment, including treatments designed to improve conduction. Continued S-100 protein is an astroglial-specific protein that binds calcium. When a brain lesion occurs, S-100 is released into both the CSF and the blood. As a marker of brain damage, NSE reflects the severity of disease in patients with intracerebral hematoma, subarachnoid hemorrhage, head injury, and certain tumors. A major constituent of glial filaments in differentiated CNS astrocytes, GFAP has been used for the diagnosis of astrocytic tumors, the study of astrocytic gliosis, and CNS regeneration and transplantation. Neurofilaments are important for axonal structure, transport, and regeneration. Accumulation of neurofilaments in motor neurons can trigger a neurodegenerative process and may be a key intermediate in the pathway of pathogenesis leading to neuronal loss. A modulator of axon outgrowth and cell adhesion that adapts its structure to requirements during development by alternative splicing and posttranslational modification. CNTF appears to promote remyelination, as well as formation of oligodendroctyes. Highly cytotoxic for astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, gliotoxin may represent an initial pathogenic factor leading to the neuropathological features of MS, such as blood-brain barrier involvement and demyelination. A marker of immune activation, neopterin is increased in CSF of relapsing-remitting patients and correlates with a decrease of -tryptophan, reflecting interferon-gamma-mediated activation of macrophages. Matrix metalloproteinases are enzymes that can dissolve the extracellular matrix of the blood-brain barrier. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. Combinations of various types of evidence are used to diagnose MS under the Poser criteria. More than one combination of clinical and paraclinical evidence can support a diagnosis within a single category. Laboratory-supported diagnosis requires one of two possible immune disturbances in CSF: IgG oligoclonal bands or intrathecal IgG production. NOTES: CSF, Cerebrospinal fluid. OB, Oligoclonal bands.

Evoked Potentials as a Diagnostic Tool in MS Strobe light flash or reversible checkerboard pattern flash on a computer screen Series of clicking noises or tone bursts played into earphone On the scalp along the vertex and on each earlobe Evaluation of sensory nerve tracts in spinal cord, thalamus, and sensory cortex Mild electrical stimulus via electrodes on wrists or knees On the scalp, each wrist (medial nerve), and the knees (peroneal nerve) The use of evoked potentials as a diagnostic tool has greatly declined since the advent of the MRI, which provides a more comprehensive picture of disease activity. In at least some cases of progressive MS, visual evoked potentials show changes over time where none are detected in MRI scans. In May 2000, the Quality Standards Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology concluded that although visual evoked potentials are useful to identify patients at increased risk of developing clinically definite MS, somatosensory evoked responses are only useful for that purpose, and there is insufficient evidence to recommend brainstem auditory evoked potentials as a diagnostic tool. Although MS is postulated to have an underlying immune-mediated pathogenesis, there is as yet no biologic marker that is disease specific and can be used for diagnostic purposes. Similarly, there is insufficient evidence to allow detection of any putative disease-related infectious agent as a basis for defining the disease. Thus, MS continues to be defined by sets of criteria that have been ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. developed based on clinical and pathologic observations. MS may well be heterogeneous when viewed from the perspective of genetics, pathogenic mechanisms, clinical phenotypes, and immunopathology. To be considered a truly distinctive variant of MS, any putative distinct disease subtypes defined in one of these categories would have to be correlated with the distinctive features identified in each of the other categories. Cases classified as MS are recognized where disease distribution is mainly in the spinal cord, hind brain (cerebellum or brainstem), or cerebrum. Different animal models have distinct topographic distributions, some of which seem to have distinct immunopathologies. For example, Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus, the demyelinating disease that afflicts mice, is mainly a spinal cord disease. There is an apparent overrepresentation of specific phenotypes in certain geographic regions. For example, MS that is relatively restricted to the optic nerve and spinal cord is more common in Japan than in other countries. The Devic's pattern of MS features a predominance of spinal cord and optic nerve involvement. The pathology is considered more destructive than classical MS, and the prognosis is worse. At issue is whether these differences reflect different immunopathogenic mechanisms in a given individual, even when the disease trigger, or initiating event, is not distinct among such individuals. Even in identical twins with MS, the disease course can be markedly different. A number of immunomodulatory agents have been shown in double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter Phase III trials to benefit patients with relapsing MS ( ; see also 1999 review by Rudick ). These agents help clinical disease features (they decrease the number of attacks, the severity of attacks, and sustained worsening on neurologic examination) as well as MRI disease features (they decrease the formation of new lesions, the number of contrast-enhancing lesions, the total burden of disease, and brain atrophy). Although all of these drugs have side effects, they are manageable in most patients. The benefit of treatment is sustained for at least several years. It is not yet known whether these agents prevent, reduce, or delay transition from relapsing to progressive MS, but preliminary data suggest that this may be the case. Throughout this report, the term “disease-modifying therapy” is used to distinguish these agents from other medications used to relieve the symptoms of MS that do not alter either the frequency of relapses or the rate of progression. Beta-interferon (IFN-Î²) is an anti-inflammatory regulatory cytokine with antiviral, antineoplastic, and immunomodulatory activity. It has a number of effects on the immune system that would be beneficial in MS. For example, it decreases cell migration into the CNS, inhibits T-cell proliferation and expression of cell activation markers, inhibits inducible nitric oxide synthase (the enzyme that produces nitric oxide, a potentially damaging substance), and enhances ""2 Clinical and Biological Features.""

There are two types of recombinant (artificially made) beta-interferon. Beta-interferon-1a (Avonex, Rebif) is a duplicate of human beta-interferon. Beta-interferon-1b (Betaseron) has three molecular differences from human beta-interferon: it is not glycosylated, there is an amino acid substitution at position 17, and there is no “N-terminal” methionine. The three available beta-interferon therapies are given in different amounts and dosing schedules (). There are well-recognized side effects (most commonly flu-like reactions), which occur maximally during the first weeks or months of therapy. Flu-like reactions can be minimized by initiating therapy with a dose escalation schedule and consistent use of anti-inflammatory premedication during the first few weeks of therapy. *Rebif has been approved for the treatment of relapsing-remitting MS by the European Commission but has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration in the United States because of the Orphan Drug Act. If tentative approval is received, Rebif could enter the U.S. market in 2003, when the exclusivity periods for Avonex and Betaseron end. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. Glatiramer acetate (Copaxone) consists of random polymers of four amino acids, designed to mimic myelin basic protein, an important component of CNS myelin. Glatiramer acetate is believed to work by activating antiinflammatory regulatory T cells, which then migrate into the CNS to inhibit local immune reactions. Glatiramer acetate has an excellent side effect profile. Patients may experience injection site reactions, but they tend to be quite minor. Some 10 to 15 percent of patients experience at least one immediate postinjection reaction characterized by chest tightness, palpitations, flushing, and anxiety within a few minutes of injection. The reaction lasts only minutes and is not dangerous. Mitoxantrone (Novantrone) is a cytotoxic agent that interferes with DNA synthesis and repair, and suppresses a variety of immune system cells. It also enhances suppressor cell activity. It is given as an intravenous infusion over 5 to 15 minutes, every three months. Mitoxantrone is fairly well tolerated at low doses. In the recent Phase III trial, both the low (5 mg/m) and high (12 mg/m) doses showed efficacy, but the high dose gave the best overall results. Mitoxantrone should not be given at a cumulative dose of 140 mg/m or higher because of concerns about cardiotoxicity, which also means that this drug can be used for only a few years. Currently available treatments are highly effective in preventing the type of MS damage that can be visualized using MRI. They are moderately effective in preventing and reducing the severity of relapses, but they are generally disappointing in preventing long-term disability—the most important goal of treatment. This might reflect the timing of treatment, and there has been a recent emphasis on starting therapy at the time MS is first diagnosed. This type of early therapy is likely most effective in delaying or preventing long-term disability, although this effect has not yet been clearly demonstrated through empirical research studies (Richard Rudick, personal communication). Clearly, much remains to be done in the development of therapies for people who suffer from MS. Two recent studies, the interferon beta-1a (Avonex) prevention study (CHAMPS, Controlled High Risk Subjects Avonex Multiple Sclerosis Prevention) and the interferon beta-1a (Rebif) early treatment (ETOMS, Early Treatment of Multiple Sclerosis) trial, have compared the use of disease-modifying therapy with placebo in patients after their first attack who also have an abnormal brain MRI. These are patients at high risk for MS, but who do not meet current criteria for a definite diagnosis. In both studies, early treatment with a disease-modifying agent significantly delayed onset of a second clinical attack over the two-year study period. Patients who received treatment also showed significantly less MRI disease activity over the next two years. These two trials have led to a reassessment of when disease-modifying therapy should be started. The National MS Society consensus statement endorsed treatment of patients as soon as a definite diagnosis of relapsing MS is made. If new diagnostic criteria are formulated for an MRI-based diagnosis at the time of a first attack, it is likely that the use of disease-modifying therapy will expand to include these early patients. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. Beta-interferon and glatiramer acetate have been tested mainly in relapsing MS. It is more controversial whether they benefit progressive MS. Several Phase III trials have examined beta-interferon therapy in patients with secondary progressive MS, with conflicting results. The European Secondary Progressive Study on beta-interferon-1b (Betaseron) showed a significant effect on slowing progression. In contrast, the North American Secondary Progressive beta-interferon-1b study and the European SPECTRIMS beta-interferon-1a (Rebif) study showed no significant effect on progression. These trials did, however, show positive results on secondary outcomes such as relapse rate and MRI disease parameters. The European study, which showed a treatment effect on progression in contrast to the two negative studies, included secondary progressive patients who had a shorter disease duration, were still experiencing relapses, and had contrast-enhancing brain MRI lesions. Considered as a whole, these studies suggest that in the earlier stages of MS, when there is still a significant inflammatory component (reflected in clinical relapses and gadolinium-enhancing lesion activity), beta-interferon may have a positive effect on clinical progression. In the later, nonrelapsing, progressive stages of MS, where there appears to be ongoing atrophy relatively independent of contrast-enhancing lesion activity, beta-interferon does not seem to slow progression. The European Phase III trial of Mitoxantrone enrolled both relapsing and secondary progressive MS patients. The drug had a positive effect on progression as indicated by a decrease in the EDSS impairment scale at the end of the study (change of -0.13 compared to +0.23 in the placebo group, p = .038) (for EDSS scale, see ). An ongoing trial (IMPACT Study) in secondary progressive MS is testing double-dose interferon beta-1a (Avonex) once a week. There have been no major treatment trials in primary progressive and progressive relapsing MS. There currently is an ongoing three-year Phase III trial of glatiramer acetate in primary progressive MS (the Promise trial). Each of the currently available disease-modifying treatments has shortcomings, including partial efficacy for patients as a group and potential adverse effects. There are four reasons why treatments fail—nonadherence on the patient's part, adverse side effects, production of neutralizing antibodies, and nonresponsive disease (reviewed by Cohen at al., 1999). Patient adherence is a factor in the efficacy of any medication, but particularly so when a patient's hopes exceed the outcome—which is particularly salient for therapies that are preventive, but not restorative. The primary principles to increase adherence are appropriate selection of patients for treatment, availability of adequate medical support throughout treatment, and perhaps most importantly, patient education before and during treatment. MS patients need to be fully informed that the therapy can prevent relapses and the accumulation of disability, ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. but that it will not improve preexisting manifestations. In addition, some patients are averse to self-injection and will not be persuaded to inject themselves with any medication (unless, perhaps, they are convinced of a substantial and certain benefit, which many MS patients are not). Health care financing policies vary widely among different countries and even within countries such as the United States and Canada. This will also influence patient adherence. In countries such as France where the costs of MS therapies are fully covered by the state, cost is unlikely to influence adherence, but in countries where patients must assume the full costs of MS disease-modifying therapies themselves, many of them will decide that they cannot afford to pay more than $10,000 (U.S.) annual expense for the modest health benefit they might gain. Adverse effects are a common reason for discontinuing treatment, but they are generally not serious health threats. The most common side effect of glatiramer acetate is irritation at the injection site, although it is typically mild. The most common side effects of beta-interferon are flu-like symptoms, and these usually resolve after three to six months. (Depression is also a possible side effect and is discussed in greater detail in .) Although only 4 percent of actively treated patients withdrew from beta-interferon clinical trials because of side effects, in clinical practice, 11 percent discontinue within four months of initiating treatment (reviewed in 1999 by Mohr et al.). (The percentage of patients who discontinue treatment because of side effects might, however, decline as physicians become more experienced in managing these side effects.) Defining nonresponsive disease in individual patients is difficult, because unfortunately patients can continue to experience relapses after initiation of disease-modifying therapy with beta-interferon or glatiramer acetate. Comparison of pre- and post-treatment relapse rates is fraught with problems, and it is often difficult to identify whether an individual patient is responsive to therapy. At a minimum, a patient's level of neurological impairment and disability should remain stable on therapy. Persistent gadolinium-enhancing or T2 lesion accrual should be considered a worrisome feature, even in the absence of clinical evidence of activity or worsening. Finally, neutralizing antibodies, which can interfere with the effects of interferons, appear in up to 20 percent of patients after two years of beta-interferon treatment. They do not appear to be an issue with glatiramer acetate. Increased neutralizing antibodies appear to be associated with reduced clinical benefit, although there is still some controversy about this point. For example, it is still not known what levels of neutralizing antibodies are clinically significant, how often they persist, and what is the most reliable method of measuring them. More research is needed on testing for neutralizing antibodies in MS patients treated with beta-interferons and how to best use the results to properly manage patient treatment.

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. Disease-modifying therapies are expensive, costing roughly $8,000 to $10,000 (U.S.) per year. Several studies have indicated that their costs outweigh their benefits, but these analyses have been heavily criticized. Forbes and colleagues argued that it is not cost-effective to treat progressive MS patients with interferon beta-1b in Britain and that the money spent on interferon beta-1b would be better spent on other services, such as supportive care and simple interventions to reduce the burden of patients' symptoms. Analyses of cost-effectiveness of medical treatment often use quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) to measure health benefits (see ). The estimated costs of beta-interferon treatment per gain in QALY for relapsing-remitting MS range from 809,000 British pounds ($1,140,000 U.S.) to 2,038,400 British pounds ($2,870,000 U.S.). The estimates are considerably lower in Canada (406,000 to 490,000 Canadian dollars, or $270,000-$330,000 U.S.). For secondary progressive MS, the estimated costs of beta-interferon treatment per gain in QALY range from 874,600 British pounds ($1,230,000 U.S.) to 1,024,000 British pounds ($1,440,000 U.S.). While disease-related expenditures are relatively easy to calculate, the benefits of these expenditures are not so easy to calculate, particu- Quality-adjusted life-years are a health status measure that includes both quantity and quality of life in a single outcome measure. Multiplying life expectancy by a quality-of-life adjustment fraction, or utility, results in a QALY value. Utilities represent the level of quality or value associated with a particular health state, and range in value from 0, representing death, to 1, representing optimal health. Utilities are determined in two ways: by researchers through literature searches for previously conducted utility studies or by direct measurement of utility values based on the assessment of people's values for different levels of health. The use of QALYs for resource allocation has been widely criticized as discriminatory against the elderly and the disabled by placing less value on extending their lives due to the lower potential for health status improvement. The determination of utility values that accurately reflect the many ways quality of life can be affected is difficult in part because one of the underlying assumptions of QALYs— that the severity of a disease state or disability and the corresponding value represent a fixed quantity—is unlikely to be true. The effect of health status on quality of life depends in large part on an individual's unique perspective. Although the use of QALYs is one of the current standards for such evaluations, it is a crude attempt to express a qualitative, subjective reality in quantitative terms and has been criticized as being of limited value in this respect.

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. larly in long-term diseases where treatments might slow the progress of disease, but neither cure it nor restore impaired functions. In addition to the limitations inherent in the use of QALYs, there are other problems with the conclusion that disease-modifying therapies are not cost-effective. The studies done to date have been criticized for using poor economic methodology in interpreting the data. In a year 2000 review of immunomodulatory drugs used to treat MS, the British National Health Service committee on health technology assessment concluded that the cost-effectiveness of these drugs is simply not known. The committee cited a lack of quality clinical trials for each drug, including methodological limitations, poor reporting of data, small sample sizes, short duration, inconsistent treatment regimes and outcome measures, and uncertainty about the clinical significance of reported benefits. The latter criticism might, however, change. New data about these drugs are emerging at such a rapid pace that conclusions about their benefits should be reconsidered as new data from clinical trials become available. In general, cost-effectiveness analysis should be considered skeptically. Cost-effectiveness is a highly politicized issue in which economic principles are often misapplied. Indeed, the United States health care system often favors economically inefficient delivery of some products—for example, liver transplants—in that health care providers are willing to underwrite additional costs to gain market share. Further, cross-national comparisons have little merit because of differences in national health care systems, as well as other economic and social factors. Finally, although economic analysis reveals important financial trade-offs, all societies hold certain social values that outweigh economic considerations. For many people, the health and well-being of their loved ones and themselves is among the deepest of these values. Ultimately, the pathogenic mechanisms underlying MS will have to be better understood to design rational therapies. Physiology of Myelin and Axons: Normal Function, Demyelination, and Repair The integrative activity of the nervous system, which underlies motor, sensory, cognitive, and psychological behavior, depends on electrical signaling between neurons. Each neuron encodes its message in the form of action potentials (small all-or-none electrical impulses) that are carried to other neurons via axons, the cable-like fibers that extend from neuron cell bodies. Many axons within the brain and spinal cord are myelinated. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. The myelin sheath provides a high-resistance, low-capacitance insulator that increases the reliability and speed of action potentials conducted along axon fibers. Myelin is what makes the white matter of brain white. It is a multilayered sheath formed by the oligodendroglial cells, or oligodendrocytes, that insulate axons ( ). Each segment of the myelin sheath surrounds the axon in a segmented fashion, with segments (called internodes) periodically interrupted at nodes of Ranvier. The internodal axon is normally surrounded by myelin sheaths whose thicknesses are related to the caliber of the ensheathed axon. In normal Oligodendrocyte making myelin. The processes of a given oligodendrocyte wrap themselves around portions of the surrounding axons. As each process wraps itself around, it forms layers of myelin. Each process thus becomes a segment of the axon's myelin sheath. SOURCE: National Institutes of Health Office of Science Education. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features.""

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. myelinated fibers, the action potential does not travel in a continuous manner. On the contrary, it jumps from one node of Ranvier to the next, in a manner known as “saltatory” (derived from the Latin word for “jumping”). Saltatory conduction is a rapid process, with the impulse taking only 20 one-thousandths of a second to jump from one node of Ranvier to the next; as a result, myelinated fibers conduct impulses with a high velocity. Significantly, voltage-dependent sodium channels are clustered at the nodes of Ranvier but are relatively more scarce in the internodal axonal membrane. In contrast, potassium channels, which exist in low density at nodes, are more abundant in the internodal and paranodal axonal membrane, under the myelin sheath. Therefore, loss of the myelin sheath exposes relatively inexcitable axonal membranes; the consequence is that nerve impulses are conducted more slowly or not at all. Axonal Conduction Is Impaired in Demyelinated Axons Following damage to the myelin, conduction velocity is reduced, and conduction slows along the demyelinated axon ( ). Studies using evoked potentials to examine human subjects with MS have demonstrated that this slowing of conduction does not, in itself, necessarily produce clinical deficits. In addition, however, conduction failure can occur in demyelinated axons. When conduction failure occurs, the axon potential is not propagated from one end of the fiber to the other, and information is lost. This produces a clinical deficit. Conduction failure in demyelinated axons is now known to result not only from loss of the insulating myelin, but also from the molecular organization of the axon membrane. Following damage to the myelin, internodal parts of the axon membrane (which had previously been covered by myelin) are uncovered. Myelinated Axons Exhibit Complex Molecular Architecture Prior to the last decade, axonal dysfunction in demyelinating diseases was considered to be due entirely to the loss of the myelin insulation. According to this schema, after the myelin is damaged, there is a “short circuit,” and impulse conduction is slowed or fails. It is now known that although the schema described above is partially correct, it is not the whole story. The axon itself exhibits an elegant molecular architecture, and following damage to the myelin, this architecture is disrupted. The molecular architecture of the axon is manifest by the placement of specialized protein molecules, called ion channels, within the membrane of the axon. Sodium channels act as tiny molecular batteries, which produce the depolarization that is necessary for the generation of action potentials. In contrast, potassium channels act as molecular brakes, damping electrical activity. Within myelinated axons, these two types of ion channels have a complementary structure. Sodium channels are clustered in high density in the axon membrane at small gaps in the myelin called nodes of Ranvier, where they support the produc- ""2 Clinical and Biological Features.""

Their numbers there are too low to support secure conduction, which contributes to conduction failure. Potassium channels, on the other hand, tend to be located in the internodal parts of the axon membrane, beneath the myelin sheath; as a result of this, they are masked by the Pathogenesis.

The unmasking of potassium channels by demyelination thus introduces another factor that tends to interfere with the conduction of action potentials. Molecular Plasticity in Demyelinated Axons Underlies Restoration of Impulse Conduction Given that impulse conduction fails in demyelinated axons and that this contributes to clinical deficits, how do remissions occur? It is now clear that demyelinated axons possess a remarkable capability to rebuild themselves at the molecular level. In the weeks following demyelination, demyelinated axons acquire, within regions where myelin has been lost, a density of sodium channels that is high enough to support action potential conduction even in the absence of insulating myelin. The demyelinated nerve fibers insert additional amplifiers (sodium channels) in their membranes so that they are able to conduct action potentials reliably even though there is a short circuit. This is a striking example of neuronal plasticity, in this case at the molecular level. Although this molecular plasticity has been clearly demonstrated in laboratory experiments, a number of important questions remain: How do neurons “know” that their axons have been demyelinated and that there is a need to activate the machinery for synthesis of sodium channels? How do neurons control the synthesis and deployment of sodium channels? What turns on the genes for sodium channels and ensures that the correct types of sodium channels (there are nearly a dozen different types, which are like different types of batteries) are produced following demyelination? Also, how are sodium channels transported and inserted into the correct parts of the axon membrane so that they can function normally? These questions have important therapeutic implications and are currently under study. The presence of axonal degeneration in MS was recognized even in the early descriptions of this disease, but its presence has recently been reemphasized (). Axonal transection might be the structural basis for acquisition of permanent (nonremitting) neurological deficits, making it an especially important part of the pathology of MS. A corollary of this proposition would be that neuroprotective interventions that limit axonal injury should prevent, or at least lessen, the acquisition of new, permanent signs and symptoms in MS. As a step toward the development of neuroprotective strategies in MS, it will be important to delineate the mechanisms that underlie axonal injury in this disorder. Is it a consequence of demyelination? Alternatively, is the axonal damage a by-product of the inflammatory or immune processes involved in triggering demyelination?

Understanding the pathogenesis of the process might lead to the development of new therapeutic targets for MS. These questions are being approached in models of other neurological diseases such as trauma and cerebrovascular disease, including stroke, and should be actively pursued in MS research as well. Axonal transection during inflammatory demyelination. According to this schema, axonal transection during (A) is a consistent feature of inflammatory demyelinating lesions. This results in degeneration of the distal axonal segment (B) and irreversible loss of neuronal function.

MS is defined as a demyelinating disease because the myelin sheaths and their parent cells, the oligodendroglia, are major targets of immune-mediated damage (). The classical lesions are discrete plaques of demyelination, which, depending on disease stage, are associated with varying evidence of inflammation. The clinical signs, which are episodic and are not clinically predictable, are presumably related to the location of the lesions, although clinically “silent” demyelinating lesions also occur. These predominantly white matter lesions occur in multiple brain regions and appear at different times throughout the disease. Common syndromes correlated with lesions in specific areas include visual deficits, weakness and spasticity, eye movement abnormalities, and ataxia (). Lesions are often described as active or chronic, depending on whether there are signs of active inflammation, usually associated with ongoing demyelination, or whether the lesion is stable and does not show signs of inflammatory activity. Disruption of the blood-brain barrier that normally insulates the brain from pathogenic blood-borne substances is an early event in the development of MS lesions (). Antigen-specific T cells enter the nervous system, and when they encounter and recognize their specific antigen, a cascade of cytokine expression begins that contributes to the damage of the blood-brain barrier. This can be detected on contrast-enhanced MRI. Examination of active demyelinating lesions in autopsy cases of MS reveals structural and immunopathological abnormalities related to demyelination and abnormalities of oligodendrocytes. The inflammatory response is dominated by lymphocytes and macrophages, but the data on the relative numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ cells are still not settled. A plaque is characterized by loss of myelin sheath and infiltration by macrophages (which show myelin basic protein and myelin-associated glycoprotein immunoreactivities).

Clinical Pathological Correlations in Common Syndromes of MS Often related to the involvement of the optic nerve as occurs in optic neuritis Frequently associated with plaques involving connections between the brainstem nuclei subserving eye movements One of the consequences of lesions involving the spinal cord or descending motor tracts in the white matter of internal capsule or brainstem Usually the result of lesions in cerebellum or its input-output pathways inflammatory responses amplify, macrophages are filled with lipids, myelin damage occurs, and there is apparently some collateral damage to axons. Scattered B cells and plasma cells are also sometimes associated with these lesions. Immunocytochemical analysis has suggested that there may be leakage of immunoglobulins and complement from vessels at the margins of active plaques. There is evidence for upregulation of a variety of cytokines within MS plaques including various interleukins (IL-1, 2, 4, 6, 10, and 12); beta-interferon; tumor necrosis factor (TNF); and transforming growth factor (TGF). Cytokines are intercellular signaling proteins produced by cells of the immune system and CNS. Their involvement in any disease is complex. They can initiate, sustain, or terminate various aspects of disease processes and are particularly involved in inflammatory responses. Specific chemokine receptors are expressed by infiltrating cells in demyelinating MS brain lesions and in CSF. These results imply pathogenic roles for specific chemokine-chemokine receptor interactions in MS and suggest new molecular targets for therapeutic intervention. Some investigators have emphasized that the pattern of pathology suggests a dying-back oligodendrogliopathy (those parts of the cell, such as the most distal process, farthest from the cell body are the most vulnerable). During the active stages of disease, the number of oligodendrocytes can be reduced near the demyelinating foci. Subsequently, there might be partial recruitment of oligodendrocyte precursors that may, in part, repopulate the margins of the plaque and contribute to remyelination. Trapp and colleagues have emphasized that the relapsing-remitting course is intimately related to the inflammatory demyelination and classical plaques, while more chronic progressive forms of the disease are linked to transection, or severing, of axons at sites of inflammation and demyelination. They have shown that severed axons were a consistent component in the lesions of individuals with MS and suggest that the number of these injured axons is correlated to the magnitude of the inflammation within the lesion. Axonal damage might be a pathological correlate of irreversible neurological deficits that occur in patients with progressive MS. In individuals with chronic MS, plaques are often sharply demarcated with scattered lipid-containing macrophages and little evidence of ongoing myelin destruction. Demyelination can be incomplete. The density of axons may be significantly reduced. There is usually astrogliosis within these lesions. It is not clear exactly how the axonal damage that occurs at later stages plays into this complex evolving pathology, but the extent of axonal damage appears to be a critical determinant of whether a person recovers from an attack or not. Lack of recovery from attacks and disease progression are more likely when axons are more severely damaged and repair mechanisms fail. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features.""

The tight seal of the cells lining the blood vessels forms a blood-brain barrier that keeps many substances out of the brain. Leaky blood vessels in the body allow many molecules to cross through to other tissues, but the tight construction of the vessels in the head guards against entry of most molecules into the brain. Normally, only certain molecules, for example, blood gases such as oxygen and small nutritional molecules, can cross the blood-brain barrier, but this barrier breaks down when the brain is injured or in certain diseases, such as MS.

A correlation between demyelination and axonal degeneration observed at autopsy is supported by imaging studies, including those that compare the concentrations of -acetyl aspartate. For example, one study measured the levels of NAA, an amino acid found only in neurons that serves as a biological marker for integrity of the axon and neuronal cell body. The brains of MS patients showed significantly greater side-to-side differences in levels of NAA, indicating decreased neuronal integrity on the side of the brain with lower NAA levels. There was a correlation between this asymmetry in motor function and the asymmetry of NAA concentrations in the internal capsule. Insights into processes that lead to demyelination and axon damage can be obtained by analyzing T1-weighted image hypointensities, proton spectroscopy, MTI, and DTI and by correlating these measures with clinical and pathological findings. Gliosis is a prominent feature of the MS lesion, but it is best regarded as a secondary phenomenon. Whenever the CNS is damaged, it undergoes an injury response, usually called reactive gliosis or glial scarring. The response is broadly the same whatever the source of injury, although the details vary somewhat with different types of pathology. The glial reaction to injury includes recruitment of oligodendrocyte precursor cells, stem cells, microglia, and astrocytes. Formation of the glial scar after CNS injury generally occurs over a period of weeks. Microglia are typically the first cell types to enter the lesion. In the normal brain, they are quiescent with short, branched processes. Following injury, they exhibit various changes, including activation, cell division, and migration to the injury site. During activation, microglia display conspicuous functional plasticity, which involves changes in cell morphology, cell surface receptor expression, and production of growth factors and cytokines, and they become, in general, more macrophage like. Microglia can be either neurotoxic or neurotrophic. The final glial scar is made up mainly of a meshwork of tightly interwoven astrocyte processes, attached to one another by tight junctions and gap junctions and surrounded by extracellular matrix (reviewed in 1999 by Fawcett and Asher). (Astrocytes are irregularly star-shaped, background structural cells of the nervous system.) Gliosis is usually restricted to the area of demyelination, but it sometimes extends beyond that area. There is no specific way to identify the presence and extent of gliosis in MS lesions through MRI, although the T1 signal might be more sensitive to gliosis than the T2 signal. The role of astrocytes in gliosis is not completely known. Since there is evidence that glial scars can inhibit both axon growth and myelination, it is clearly important to know what causes them to form, what cells are involved, why they are inhibitory, and how to manipulate them. Finally, although gliosis is generally considered harmful, there is also evidence that the gliotic ensheathment of demyelinated axons might favor the restoration of nerve conduction.

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. The relapsing-remitting form of MS appears to be related to the demyelination of axons during relapses, followed by the remodeling and remyelination with consequent restoration of conduction that underlies remission. Remyelination is carried out by surviving oligodendrocytes or by the proliferation of progenitor cells that are then stimulated to become oligodendrocytes. Molecular remodeling of demyelinated axons, in terms of their redistributing their sodium channels along the axon, might act as a form of adaptive plasticity; this process may represent a target for future therapies. In contrast, the progressive form of the disease, which appears clinically as an unremitting accumulation of deficits, might reflect the superimposition of axonal injury or degeneration on multiple chronic foci of demyelinated axons. The finding that axonal damage can occur frequently in MS and the suggestion that these lesions contribute to persistent neurological deficits are important issues in MS research. Thus, it will be important to understand the mechanisms whereby axons are damaged and to define ways of protecting axons, which may be vulnerable to degeneration, in part due to their proximity to inflammatory and demyelinating foci. It will also be important to search for molecules that promote the regrowth of injured axons to their appropriate targets. Some of the lessons from studies of the repair of spinal cord injury are likely to be relevant here. Moreover, because abnormal patterns of ion channels have been found within neurons whose axons are undergoing demyelination, it will be important to understand the factors that influence the regulation of these channels. These lines of research, involving strategies can restore conduction in demyelinated axons represent opportunities to restore that protect axons from degeneration or promote repair, and those agents that functions and could have significant implications for therapy. Similarly, future therapeutic approaches might involve replacement of oligodendroglia with pluripotent stem cells (discussed further in ). Progenitor cells, those either already present in an individual or provided from another source by injection, can produce myelin in demyelinated foci in experimental animals. Future experimental therapeutics will involve approaches directed at restoring oligodendrocytes to ensheath axonal processes and to induce physiological modeling of axons to restore conduction. The most striking pathology in MS is the immune system's attack and destruction of the body's own myelin sheath, which is why it is believed to be an autoimmune disease, although this has not yet been definitively proven (). The pathogenic trigger that first causes the immune system to attack myelin is unknown, but the immunopathology, or pathological activity of the immune system, that ensues after that initial attack is becoming clearer. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. The immune system defends the body against foreign invaders such as bacteria and viruses. It does so by recognizing that foreign invaders have special markers distinguishing them as “non-self,” compared to the body's own tissue (or “self”) (). Normally, the immune system reacts only to non-self invaders, not to its own tissues. Unfortunately, this process is not foolproof. Autoimmunity is an immune response mounted against antigens that are naturally produced within the body, or self-antigens, to cause lasting tissue damage. In the strictest sense, an autoimmune disease must meet several criteria. First, the disease must be reproduced by transfer of autoantibodies or autoreactive T lymphocytes (T cells) from affected to unaffected individuals. Second, the self-antigen that elicits the immune attack must be identified. Third, this antigen (or a closely related one) should cause a similar disease in an animal model. (Scientifically, it would be best to show that the antigen caused the disease in humans, but it would be unethical to intentionally infect humans, hence, the compromise for evidence in animals). It is now feasible to transfer human genes into animals in an attempt to satisfy these criteria. One of the first so-called transgenic studies that introduced certain human genes into an animal without MS led to the development of a disease resembling MS. Among the newly added genes were those for a specific type of histocompatibility antigen and for a particular type of T-cell receptor that binds to a fragment of a myelin protein (myelin basic protein). This type of study begins to confirm the autoimmune nature of MS. Human autoimmune diseases, however, are generally classified as such without meeting these three stringent criteria. Circumstantial evidence often is marshaled for classification. For example, patients are classified as having autoimmune disease if they have high levels of autoantibody or autoreactive T cells, or because there is a correlation between the level of immune activity and disease severity. Some examples of autoimmune diseases are listed in . Why does the immune system have autoreactive lymphocytes? During development, the immune system randomly builds a vast repertoire of cells that respond to a multitude of foreign antigens. At the same time, the immune system must weed out those cells that react to self-antigens. Most self-reactive B cells and T cells are removed early during development. Other regulatory mechanisms exist to keep self-reactive lymphocytes unresponsive later on. These are among the normal regulatory mechanisms resulting in immunological tolerance to most self-antigens. Even though there are usually small numbers of autoreactive lymphocytes in a normal adult, most do not cause disease, and some might even serve a (currently unknown) beneficial purpose. With autoimmune disease, however, there are large numbers of autoreactive immune cells. Autoimmune disease thus can be thought of as a failure of normal regulatory mechanisms that guard against autoimmunity. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. The causes of autoimmune response in MS and most other autoimmune diseases are unknown but likely include a combination of genetic susceptibility and exposure to environmental agents. For most autoimmune diseases, the actual genes and environmental agents are unknown. Gender also plays a role because women are disproportionately affected by autoimmune disease. The reasons for the gender difference are also unknown but appear to relate to distinct immune environments in women and How can genes and environment trigger autoimmune pathology? Genes control many properties of the immune system. Theoretically, autoimmune disease can occur if any of the genes controlling the immune system's ability to distinguish self from non-self are defective. The genes often suspected of predisposing to autoimmune disease encode proteins, such as histocompatibility antigens, that participate in this complex process of self versus non-self recognition. Environmental or infectious agents can stimulate pathological autoimmune reactions through at least two possible mechanisms: molecular mimicry, superantigens, and bystander damage (). Molecular mimicry occurs when a bacterial or viral epitope—the fragment of an antigen that elicits an immune response—is very similar to a self-epitope. This can occur following an infection where an immune cell targeting an epitope on a bacterium subsequently cross-reacts with a self-antigen. Superantigens are proteins from bacteria or retroviruses that lead to widespread activation of T cells. Unlike most antigens, which activate only a specific T cell, superantigens activate approximately one out of every ten T cells. Because of their generic ability to activate so many types of T cells, superantigens may inadvertently activate autoreactive T cells, which then attack self-tissues. In bystander damage, a virus upregulates a nonspecific immune response that then leads to pathology; for example, proinflammatory cytokines might activate Th1 cells or macrophages that contribute to the immunopathology. Once damage occurs, new cellular epitopes become exposed and trigger an immune response in a process called epitope spreading, which can also lead to autoimmune pathology. During an immune response against a particular epitope, the number of lymphocytes that recognize the epitope normally multiplies. Yet, in epitope spreading, the immune response escalates to target other epitopes on the same antigen or on related antigens. In this way, an initially nonpathological autoimmune response expands to produce a pathological response. The underlying basis for epitope spreading in autoimmune diseases is poorly understood. Another way to produce a pathological autoimmune response is for autoreactive lymphocytes to gain access to a target antigen from which they are ordinarily separated. The brain is one example of an anatomical sanctuary site, because it is protected by the blood-brain barrier of the central nervous system. Normally, T cells that might react against myelin do not pass across this barrier into the central nervous system. In MS, however, T cells become activated, which enables them to penetrate the blood-brain barrier and reach their targets—myelin antigens—thereby generating an autoimmune response. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. One of the first pathological processes leading up to MS attacks is thought to be activation of autoreactive T lymphocytes, or T cells, and their migration into the central nervous system. However, T cells and the inflammatory molecules they secrete are not the only players. Many cells and molecules of the immune system—likely unleashed by T-cell activation—participate in demyeli- Interactions between major cell components of the immune system. This simplified outline shows interactions that occur in response to a foreign antigen. The antigen could be an epitope from a virus particle, bacterium, or other foreign agent. The antigen-presenting cell (APC) ingests the antigen (or in the case of an infecting virus, it may already be within the cell) and processes it into peptide fragments. The major histocompatibility complex (MHC, the cell surface structure characteristic of each individual) presents this target to a resting T cell. Binding of the peptide-MHC complex by the T-cell receptor activates the T cell. In the case of a CD8+ cell, it becomes a cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL), which will destroy any cells that have the same peptide-MHC complex on their surfaces. In the case of a CD4+ cell, the activated cell produces and secretes various cytokines that recruit and activate nonspecific effector cells (such as macrophages) or stimulate antigen-bound B cells to produce antibodies. When T and B lymphocytes are activated by a specific antigen, they undergo proliferation, producing more cells with their same antigen specificity. This serves to amplify the immune response against the foreign antigen. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001.

Although no virus has yet been shown to contribute to the etiology of MS, there are several ways in which this could occur, and one of these is shown in this figure. Activated T cells cross the blood-brain barrier following activation by a microbe with a structural similarity to a component of the myelin sheath. Once inside the brain, these cells attack self-antigens, such as the various myelin proteins that are attacked in MS. NOTE: MBP = myelin basic protein. SOURCE: Steinman and Oldstone, 1997.

The key features of this cascade are not fully understood, including the precise ordering of events, the antigens targeted by T cells, and the contributions of B lymphocytes, or B cells, and other cells of the immune system. Yet, as this section explains, much insight has been gained into the immunopathology of MS. This knowledge has been—and continues to be—fundamental for devising therapies targeted to the immunopathology of MS (). ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. As much as a century ago, researchers observed that T cells were particularly abundant in MS lesions. Over time, using modern immunologic techniques, they managed to isolate and characterize a particular type of T cell, the autoreactive T cell, from the blood and CSF of MS patients. These and related findings gave credence to the hypothesis that autoreactive T cells played a dominant role in MS. After all, immunologists have long known that T cells are capable of orchestrating a multifaceted autoimmune attack. However, this was not enough to explain MS pathology. First, elevations in certain types of autoreactive T cells were not unique to MS patients. Second, and more critically, T cells were necessary but not sufficient to cause demyelinating disease in animal models. The transfer of myelin-specific T cells into normal animals initiated only inflammation, not demyelination. This suggested that other immune cells, particularly antibody-producing B cells () and macrophages, might also play key roles, even if autoreactive T cells launched the process. An important component of the myelin sheath, MBP is located on the cytoplasmic face of the myelin membrane, and constitutes 30-40% of myelin protein by weight.

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. The prime autoantigen that elicits the autoimmune response in MS is not known. While there are many candidate autoantigens, as yet none is preeminent. Much MS research focused on myelin basic protein (MBP), located at the inner surface of the myelin membrane. Clinical studies were shaped by research on experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), the classic animal model of demyelinating disease. In many species, MBP acts as a classical encephalitogenic autoantigen (an antigen capable of serving as the focus of an inflammatory attack in the brain). EAE research further established that in some strains of mice and rats, the autoimmune response to MBP displays two unique features. First, in the initial stages of the immune response in EAE, T cells react only to very small regions of the MBP molecule (“epitope dominance”), even though they later react to many more regions of the molecule (“epitope spreading”) (see ). Second, the encephalitogenic T cells in EAE use an unusually narrow repertoire of genes for their antigen receptors. (T cells recognize their target antigen by its capacity to bind to specific receptors on their surface membrane, called T-cell receptors [TCRs]). These two features raised hopes for developing immune-based therapies because a more limited range of therapies might succeed in combating MS in early stages. Unfortunately, these features turned out to be much less prominent in humans with MS. First, human T cells respond to a broader set of MBP epitopes. While there might be a relatively dominant epitope in the central portion of the MBP molecule, there are clearly many other target epitopes along the full sequence of this large polypeptide. Second, MBP-specific T cells use multiple genes for their TCRs, which allows for large variability among individuals. Generally, it appears that the T-cell response against myelin proteins differs greatly between individual patients, a property that suggests the potential need for individually designed immune therapies. Several research teams have attempted to identify MBP-specific T cells in MS patients. Unfortunately, these attempts did not show significant increases in MBP-specific T-cell counts in MS patients compared to healthy blood donors. However, when more definitive assay systems were used, increased frequencies of activated MBP-specific T cells were found in MS patients. These studies relied on complex methods and were influenced by numerous factors that complicate the interpretation of results. More direct assays, such as those that use binding of oligomeric class II-peptide complexes to specific T cells, might resolve the problem. To add a further degree of complexity, MBP does not appear to be the only autoantigen in MS: there are a number of additional myelin and nonmyelin proteins that are potential autoantigens in MS. Earlier hypotheses had implicated MBP on the basis of two lines of research. First, studies of EAE had suggested that MBP was indeed the most important, if not the only, encephalitogenic myelin autoantigen. Second, due to its particularly convenient molecular properties, MBP was the only myelin protein available both at high purity and in large ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. quantities. However, thanks to modern biotechnology, even minor myelin proteins are now available in large quantities and can be studied for their encephalitogenic capacity. Later studies established that many, if not all, myelin proteins are potentially encephalitogenic. Especially interesting among these newly recognized autoantigens is myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG). In contrast to MBP, which lies on the inside of the myelin sheath, MOG lies on the surface. As one of the few myelin proteins accessible to humoral autoantibodies, MOG is a target for demyelinating immunoglobulins (see next section). In addition, MOG is a very effective autoantigen in rodents and in primates for encephalitogenic T cells. Some studies even demonstrated increased frequencies of MOG-reactive T cells in MS patients. These findings clearly warrant general confirmation. It is also important to investigate whether different subtypes of MS, which are distinguished by divergent clinical, genetic, and morphological features, are associated with enhanced T-cell responses against different target autoantigens. Thus far, research has spotlighted one class of T cells—those with a TCR termed Î±Î². Î±Î² T cells are the major class of immune cells centrally involved in adaptive immune responses against infections and tumors. Much less attention has been given to other T-cell classes (Î³Î´ T cells and NK1 T cells), which may function both as effector cells in autoimmune attacks and as suppressor cells that dampen autoimmune responses. There are reports linking the presence of Î³Î´ T cells in the brain (presumably) with the induction of heat shock proteins in MS lesions. Certain members of this broad class of proteins are a normal component of the myelin sheath, yet they are also found outside the CNS as well as in pathogens. The role of heat shock proteins in the development of the MS lesion is unknown, but there are various possibilities. Some of these proteins might act as a target autoantigen, as has been shown in autoimmune diabetes. They might also reflect inflammatory stress inflicted on local CNS cells, or they might be determinants of beneficial anti-inflammatory control mechanisms. Even though the precise pathological roles of T cells and their autoantigens are unresolved, this line of research has generated many approved or emerging therapies. These include vaccination strategies, which use either attenuated myelinspecific T cells or peptides representing myelin-specific T-cell receptors as vaccines to strengthen the body's own regulatory responses against pathogenic T cells (reviewed in Zhang et. al., 1998). Also under development are “altered peptide” therapies that use peptide analogues of myelin protein segments to induce autoreactive T cells to produce protective, rather than pathogenic, cytokine mediators. Cytokines, as discussed later, are a functionally diverse set of signaling molecules produced by T cells. *Each (Î± and Î²) refers to a polypeptide chain that forms the T-cell receptor. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. B cells (also known as B lymphocytes) have been detected in MS lesions for many years, although less consistently than T cells. While most MS research naturally focused on T cells, evidence also has accumulated for participation by autoreactive B cells. It now appears that both types of lymphocytes actively contribute to MS immunopathology. Autoreactive T cells are thought to launch inflammation and, through their release of cytokines, to stimulate B cells to secrete antibodies that cause demyelination. This is consistent with animal studies finding that EAE can be produced only by injecting myelin-specific T cells in combination with myelin-specific antibodies. Without injecting the antibodies, demyelination does not occur. In MS patients, levels in cerebrospinal fluid of the type of protein known to consist of antibodies (immunoglobulin) are often higher than in healthy people. The increased immunoglobulin is due to production by only a few different clones of B cells that have been induced to proliferate. B cells from the CSF of MS patients have been reported to contain mutations in the DNA sequences that encode antibodies, which is consistent with the notion of an antigen-driven selection of antibodies with high-affinity antigen-binding sites. Such events are commonly observed in immune responses against foreign antigens such as bacterial infections, as well as in humoral autoimmune responses. However, no foreign antigen or autoantigen responsible for the generation of oligoclonal bands in MS has yet been identified. One recent study using sophisticated immunocytochemistry furnished direct evidence of a pathologic role for autoantibodies. For the first time, MOG-specific antibodies were demonstrated to be bound to myelin debris in active MS lesions. If confirmed and extended to a larger group of patients, this finding would suggest that B-cell-derived autoantibodies might induce myelin destruction. On the other hand, although anti-MOG antibodies are found in the CSF of MS patients, they are also found in CSF of patients with other neurological diseases that are not demyelinating. Thus, despite tantalizing leads, the role of anti-MOG antibodies in MS patients is still unclear. Cytokines are soluble proteins produced and released by T cells, macrophages, and certain other cell types. Interferons (IFN- Î±, Î², and Î³), interleukins (including IL- 1, 4, 6, 10, 12, and 13), TGF-b, and the neuropoietic cytokines (such as ciliary neurotrophic factor and leukemia inhibitory factor) are all different types of cytokines. They generally act as intercellular signaling molecules that regulate *Neuropoietic cytokines are the family of neural growth factors that act on both the nervous and the hematopoietic or immune systems.

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. and carry out immune functions, but their repertoire is complex. Some function as pro-inflammatory, others as anti-inflammatory agents. Some even have divergent functions during different phases of disease. Cytokines, including the subset known as chemokines (for ), also alter the permeability of the blood-brain barrier or act on neural cells. Thus, particular cytokines can initiate, sustain, or terminate inflammatory disease processes. Proinflammatory cytokines and other secretory products of immune cells are proposed in several neurological diseases—including MS—to be toxic to neurons and oligodendrocytes if they are secreted in sufficiently high concentrations over a sustained period of time. In MS, the initial entry of autoreactive T cells into the CNS is thought to trigger the local production of cytokines and chemokines, which in turn begins the inflammatory process and enhances the permeability of the blood-brain barrier. A more permeable blood-brain barrier allows infiltration into the CNS of more immune cells which in turn contribute to the ongoing inflammation. Thus, understanding the roles of cytokines and their temporal sequence of activation is crucial to modifying the course of MS. Much of our present understanding of cytokine action in demyelinating disease comes from studies of animal models, including EAE. A large body of research is being compiled on the expression and possible function of cytokines as pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators in MS. Some studies have used in situ immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization to visualize gene expression in lesions, whereas others have relied on the activation of inflammatory cells (T cells, B cells, macrophages) in vitro. Much of the research is comparing material from MS patients with or without treatment with immunomodulatory agents, especially glatiramer acetate and beta-interferon. Pro-inflammatory cytokines within active MS lesions have been localized to both infiltrating immune cells and glia. Longitudinal studies have linked clinical exacerbation and remission to high and low expression, respectively, of proinflammatory cytokines, especially TNF-Î³. For example, secretion of TNF-Î³ and cell adhesion molecules by inflammatory cells is upregulated immediately prior to relapse. Yet, not all findings could be verified in all patient groups studied. Understanding of cytokines and their diverse roles throughout the course of disease, although still incomplete, has nevertheless spawned new treatments. One explanation for the success of glatiramer acetate and beta-interferon relates to their control over cytokine expression: they can induce T cells to switch from a pro-inflammatory phenotype (Th1) to an anti-inflammatory phenotype (Th2). T cells that are switched to an anti-inflammatory phenotype release a variety of cytokines, such as IL-10, that reduce inflammation. CNS. CNS tissues were traditionally thought to be exempt from active immune reactivity, but it is now known ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. that the brain is subject to immune surveillance and can be the site of immune responses. Only activated and not resting T cells can cross the blood-brain barrier and interact with local CNS cells. Local glial cells can be stimulated by proinflammatory cytokines to express immunologically active molecules, such as the major histocompatability complex (MHC) products, cytokines, and chemokines required for local immune responses. Neurons are capable of suppressing immune responses within the CNS. Thus, immune responses are more likely to occur in areas of neuronal degeneration than in intact CNS tissues. Immune reactivity within the CNS must hence be viewed as the balance between the proinflammatory signals contributed by activated T cells and other inflammatory cells entering the brain and the anti-inflammatory signals from functional neurons. Epidemiologists define what causes a disease and what puts an individual at risk of getting this disease. They look for correlations such as whether Caucasians are more likely to have MS than Asians or whether residents of one county are more likely to get MS than residents of another. These correlations lead to hypotheses or working models as to which factors actually cause MS and which are only associated with it. These hypotheses or models can then be tested experimentally. Epidemiological studies have limitations, but for a complex disease like MS, they can rule out some factors and highlight others. They are the first step toward finding a biological mechanism for MS, or possibly a cure. Most epidemiological studies of MS have been observational and retrospective; researchers collected the information (for example, ethnicity, age of onset) from an individual (or from records) that had been diagnosed with MS. Such studies rely on an individual's ability to accurately recall information from years ago, for example, the infections that she or he had before the age of five. Other sources of data, such as death certificates, can contain incorrect information. Despite these shortcomings, a few factors consistently correlate with MS prevalence. Determining how these factors lead to an increased risk of MS has proven more difficult. The risk of MS increases with increasing distance from the equator. In the United States, this is seen as a gradient of risk, with higher risk in northern regions and a lower risk in the south. In Australia, the prevalence of MS increases similarly from lower, subequatorial latitudes to the more southerly latitudes. Studies on migrating populations, although inconclusive, offer tentative support for the hypothesis that environment influences MS risk. Individuals who have moved from a region with one risk level to a region with a higher or lower risk, in general, adopt the risk level of their new home. This is especially true for individuals moving from a low-risk to a high-risk area. Studies carried out in the 1960s and 1970s suggested that this geographical effect had a defined susceptibility period before age 15. Although these data still ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. appear in the MS literature and have led to several hypotheses about the effects of puberty or early dietary effects on MS risk, the sample numbers are too small to support such a tight cutoff. A later and larger study assayed the effects of migration by comparing location at birth with location at approximately 24 years of age. Although individuals did adopt the risk of their new home, the age values in that study are not precise enough to add to the argument for or against a cutoff. Most recently, a study comparing the prevalence of MS among native-born Australians and Australian immigrants from the United Kingdom (thereby providing a rough control for genetic background) suggests that rather than being established around age 15, environmental risk factors operate over many years and into early adulthood. Although the migrational studies suggest an environmental correlation with MS, the root cause of this latitude effect is unknown. Differences in diet or sunlight have been proposed, but neither has been supported by rigorous studies. Alternatively, the geographical distribution of MS could result from the migration either of a viral agent or of individuals (perhaps originally Scandinavians) who carried a pool of susceptible genes. Ethnicity is another definite risk factor. MS is more prevalent among Caucasians than other groups. In a study of 5,305 U.S. veterans with MS, Caucasian males had twice the risk of MS as African-American males. Other factors can modulate the effect of ethnicity on risk of MS. MS is almost absent among black Africans. African Americans, however, show a low risk of MS; this might be due to genetic mixing with Caucasian Americans or to an environmental effect. MS occurrence among Asians is also quite low. Again, Asian Americans show an intermediate risk for MS between Asians and Caucasian Americans. A discussion of the role of genetics in MS can be found in the next section. When applied to a complex disorder such as MS, conclusions derived from epidemiologic data of this type must be interpreted cautiously because inapparent explanations may be present. For example, a higher-than-expected incidence of MS observed in South Vietnamese immigrants (a low-risk group) residing in France (a moderate-risk area) superficially suggest a modifying role of the environment on MS. However, this immigrant population was in fact racially mixed and contained substantial numbers of individuals with mixed French and Asian ancestry. Thus, the higher-than-expected MS incidence in these immigrants could have been due to either genetic or environmental factors. Neither factor can be ruled out. A similar argument could explain the incidence of MS in West Indian immigrants residing in Great Britain. On the other hand, the increased incidence of MS observed in Japanese-Americans compared to individuals residing in Japan is not easily explained by racial admixture and does support a role of the environment on MS risk. As in other autoimmune diseases, women are much more likely to get MS than men, suggesting that hormonal or genetic factors are involved. The ratio of women to men with MS is about 2:1. Among both sexes, the age of onset for ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. MS ranges between 10 and 59 years, with the highest incidence occurring among individuals in their mid-20s to early 30s, depending on the population examined. Males tend to have a slightly later mean age of onset than females. This results, at least in part, from an increase in the percentage of males with the primary progressive variant. This form of MS has a later onset than other types and affects approximately 15 percent of patients. The ratio of males to females with primary progressive MS is approximately 1:1. Epidemiological studies have provided conflicting data as to whether an infectious agent (viral or bacterial) either causes or triggers MS. The occurrence of MS epidemics has suggested that an infectious agent might be at work. The two MS epidemics cited most often, one in the Faroe Islands and one in Iceland, were directly preceded by the influx of foreign troops during World War II. Both, however, are open to multiple interpretations. Coincident with the stationing of foreign soldiers, the population of the Faroe Islands received increased medical services and changed its diet. The Icelandic epidemic, on the other hand, began shortly after the arrival of that island's first neurologist. In both cases, the increased prevalence of MS might have resulted from an increased level of detection or a combination of other factors, such as nonspecific immune stimulation resulting from the introduction of a variety of infectious agents into previously unexposed populations. No infectious agent has been associated with either of these MS clusters. Another area of investigation has explored whether environmental factors contribute to the onset of MS or the probability of MS attacks. Some studies suggest that MS attacks are more likely to occur in the spring and fall than in the winter or summer. Such a finding, if true, suggests that a relationship exists between some viral infections and the risk of exacerbations. Many patients with MS are also at heightened risk for urinary tract, pulmonary, or skin infections, yet the relationship between these potentially preventable infections and the course of MS has never been adequately studied. Additional research in this area is needed. Perhaps the most clear-cut epidemiologic link to MS attacks is the effect of pregnancy and the postpartum period. Pregnancy is associated with a decrease in the risk for MS attacks, particularly during the third trimester. The postpartum period is, conversely, associated with a significant increase in risk. An immunosuppressive state in the pregnant mother is created by increased numbers of regulatory T cells (Th2 cells) which, presumably, dampen the autoimmune reaction that produces attacks of MS. The explanation for the increase in attack risk during the postpartum period is less clear but might involve immunostimulation by prolactin, the hormone responsible for milk production. The absence of supporting evidence does not prove that a virus is connected with the disease. Unrelated individuals (in the case of the adoptee and conjugal studies) may differ in their susceptibilities to infectious agents. Researchers have isolated a variety of viruses from individual MS patients, but to ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. date, no one virus has been isolated from all MS patients examined. It might, however, be the case either that MS is not one single disease or that there are multiple ways to trigger it. Researchers continue to look for causative infectious agents. (See section below on infectious causes of MS for further discussion.) The aggregation of MS in some geographic areas, ethnic populations, or families could be explained by a common environmental exposure, a shared genetic background, or a combination of both environmental and genetic susceptibility. It is likely that in MS, as in other complex disorders, both factors contribute. It is also possible that the relative contributions of environment versus genetics might vary in different situations, depending on the degree to which an individual is genetically susceptible and the specific environmental context. The role of genetic factors in MS is discussed in the next section. MS is not considered a genetic disease in the classic sense because it usually occurs sporadically. However, population and family studies are consistent with a principal pathogenic role for genetic risk factors in MS etiology. This genetic component is indicated primarily by the increased relative risk to siblings of affected individuals compared with the general population. Familial aggregation (Î»s) is measured by estimating the ratio of the prevalence (frequency) in siblings versus the population prevalence of the disease. A Î»s of 1 represents no familial clustering of the trait. For MS, the Î»s is estimated to be between 20 (0.02/0.001) and 40 (0.04/0.001). Half-sibling1 and adoption studies confirm that genetic, and not environmental, factors are responsible for familial aggregation. In addition, twin studies from different populations consistently indicate that a monozygotic twin of an MS patient is at higher risk (25 to 30 percent concordance) for MS than a dizygotic twin (2 to 5 percent), providing additional evidence for a significant but complex genetic etiology. Finally, the frequent occurrence of MS in some ethnic populations (particularly those of northern European origin) compared to others (African and Asian groups), irrespective of geographic location, also provides evidence for a complex genetic etiology. Overall, adoption and family studies suggest that being related to a person with MS is a greater risk factor than living with someone with MS. A simple genetic model for the inheritance of MS is unlikely to be valid. Such a single-gene hypothesis is at odds with concordance data in twin and family studies and with the observed nonlinear decrease in disease risk as the genetic distance from the relative with MS is increased. It is likely that susceptibility is determined by multiple independent genetic loci (polygenic inheritance), each with a relatively modest contribution to overall risk. It is also possible that there are different genetic causes of susceptibility to MS (genetic heterogeneity). Finally, the genes that contribute to MS susceptibility are likely to be normal, common variants (or alleles) of genes rather than obviously defective mutations. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. Most individuals who carry such susceptibility genes would have no obvious deleterious consequences. For example, the DR2 gene (described below) is the most important genetic contributor to MS susceptibility identified to date. Approximately half of patients with MS have this gene, but so do 15 to 20 percent of healthy Caucasians. Thus, only approximately 1 in 250 people who have DR2 develop MS. The cumulative action of several susceptibility genes, each with weak effects and limited penetrance, is thought to underlie genetic susceptibility to MS. (Penetrance refers to the likelihood that a person carrying an allele will develop specific manifestations caused by that gene.) The effects of individual susceptibility genes may also be influenced by interactions with other genes and by specific environmental exposures. Locus heterogeneity is also likely, meaning that there are different susceptibility genes in different MS patients. The possibility that MS is a heterogeneous disease with different causes or pathological processes adds an additional level of complexity to the analysis. In addition to MS, similar issues are present in other autoimmune diseases such as diabetes mellitus that are genetically complex, and common research tools will be needed to decipher specific disease genes in these different conditions. The genetic region most clearly associated with MS susceptibility is the major histocompatibility complex (MHC, or HLA [human leukocyte antigen] in humans) locus on the short arm of chromosome 6 (6p21) (). This association has been seen in different population studies that have relied primarily on sporadic patients. Formal genetic linkage to 6p has also been found in several recent whole-genome scans of multiple affected MS families. Many of the MHC genes are extraordinarily variable or polymorphic, reflecting the importance of genetic variation of these critical antigen-presenting molecules in the maintenance of a heterozygous advantage and the need to effectively present a diverse array of antigens if immune homeostasis is to be maintained. Immune homeostasis refers to the capacity of the immune system to respond appropriately to a diverse number of infectious pathogens and tumors without initiating unhealthy responses against self-constituents (auto- The major histocompatibility complex is a chromosomal region that contains more than 100 genes, many of which make proteins involved in the immune system. It is named for the role it plays in rejecting tissue transplants ( means tissue). In humans, this region resides on chromosome 6 and is called the human leukocyte antigen gene complex. The terminology is slightly confusing because ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. MHC and HLA also refer to the proteins that some of these genes make. In this report, the term “MHC molecules” is used to indicate the proteins. The role of the immune system is to differentiate between self and non-self. This allows it to tell the difference between, for example, muscle tissue (self) and an invading virus (non-self) and to respond appropriately. To do this, the immune system relies on several different proteins that specifically bind antigens. This process is analogous to a lock and key. The “lock” is an antibody, a T-cell receptor, or an MHC molecule. The “key” is an antigen, which can be a carbohydrate, lipid, nucleic acid, or protein—anything that binds specifically to a component of the immune system. This discussion focuses on T-cell receptors and MHC molecules. T-cell receptors sit on the surface of T cells and bind to antigens outside the cell. (In the case of T-cell receptors and MHC molecules, antigens are small protein fragments.) Binding to an antigen signals the T cell either to die, to do nothing, or to become active. The signal context, such as whether the antigen is self or non-self, determines which of these signals is relayed. However the T cell cannot bind the antigen alone. It needs the help of an MHC molecule. MHC molecules sit on the surface of other cells. The MHC molecule, like two outstretched arms, holds onto an antigen and presents it to a T-cell receptor. There are two major classes of MHC molecules. MHC I molecules, which are expressed on most cell types, present antigens to CD8+ T cells. MHC II molecules, which are expressed on special antigen presenting cells (APCs), present antigens to CD4+ T cells. In humans, there are three main class I molecules, HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C, and three main class II molecules, HLA-DP, HLA-DQ, HLA-DR. Each arm of the MHC molecule is made up of a separate protein. In the case of MHC I molecules, there is an Î±-chain (A, B, or C) that pairs with the protein b2microglobulin. An MHC II molecule is made up of an Î±-chain and a Î²-chain (for example, DP-Î± and DP-Î²), but the story becomes more complex. Each MHC molecule can bind many but not all of the thousands of antigens that confront the immune system. The immune system relies on diversity among the MHC proteins to help stack the odds in its favor. The gene for each MHC protein chain comes in different varieties, or alleles. One of the MHC Î²-chains has more than 150 alleles. Each of these alleles produces a slightly different protein. The proteins vary just enough that although they all function as MHC proteins, they can bind different antigens. Any one person will have two alleles, at most, for a particular MHC protein (there are two copies of each gene in human cells), but across a population of individuals, this variety becomes more important. For example, in Gambia, West Africa, 25 percent of HLA-B genes are the HLA-B53 allele, compared to less than 1 percent in Europe. HLA-B53 is very effective at presenting an antigen from the parasite that causes malaria to CD8+ T cells. Researchers hypothesize that because HLA-B53 can protect people from the most severe forms of malaria, it is more prevalent in Gambia. Having a particular MHC allele can also be a disadvantage, as researchers have shown in the case of HLA-DR2 and MS. (HLA-DR2 actually designates both a specific DR-a chain allele and a DR-b chain allele.) Scientists still do not understand how HLA-DR2 predisposes individuals to MS, but this might have to do with the MHC molecule's ability to present specific antigens (for example, a fragment of myelin basic protein) to T cells.

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. immune responses). In Caucasian MS populations of northern European descent, the critical MS-associated genetic region is thought to reside near the class II locus and is comprised of a group of genes with specific polymorphisms (alleles) that tend to occur in certain fixed combinations, termed haplotypes. In molecular terms, the “DR2” haplotype is designated as HLA-DRB1*1501, DQA1*0102, DQB1*0602. DR molecules are comprised of alpha and beta chains (encoded by A and B genes, respectively), and the polymorphisms are predominantly present in the beta chain. Of the more than 100 beta-chain sequence variations identified in humans, only one (1501, also designated as DR2) is associated with MS. How can the DR2 association with MS be explained? The DR2 molecule itself may have a propensity to bind peptide antigens of myelin and stimulate disease-inducing T cells. DR2 is known to bind with high affinity to a region of MBP (spanning amino acids 89-98) thought to be “immunodominant” in humans. X-ray crystallography of the DR2-MBP peptide complex revealed that the DR2 molecule contains a distinctive hydrophobic pocket in its antigen-binding region, created by a unique alanine residue at the B71 position into which glutamic acid at position 93 of MBP is tightly bound, anchoring the MBP-DR2 complex. In a larger sense, the structure of the antigen-binding domain of DR2 molecules likely facilitates binding of many peptides containing certain amino acid residues, specifically aromatic amino acids. Glatiramer acetate (copolymer 1), a currently available disease-modifying therapy for MS, is a random synthetic protein composed of four amino acids, including tyrosine. The tyrosine residues of processed copolymer peptides likely also bind to the hydrophobic pocket of DR2, perhaps interfering with presentation of this key MBP peptide to encephalitogenic T cells. It is surprising that no data exist on the interaction of DR2 and the response to glatiramer acetate in MS. Another possibility is that the DR2 molecule does not itself predispose to MS but that another nearby gene (perhaps another HLA gene such as DQ) is responsible. DR2 is also linked to other diseases. Besides MS, narcolepsy is the disease most strongly linked to DR2. In various studies, the HLA region has been estimated to confer somewhere between 10 percent and half of the inheritability of MS. To date, no other genes of major effect have been identified in genomic screens. Several studies appear to demonstrate that a deletion mutation in the CCR5 chemokine receptor gene (a coreceptor for HIV) on chromosome 3 confers a later age of onset or a more benign course of MS; this mutation is also associated with protection against HIV. This is particularly important because the expression of CCR5, which is increased in MS brain lesions, is thought to attract inflammatory cells into tissue. Another locus on chromosome 19q22 near apolipoprotein C1 has been linked to MS in several genomic screens, but the estimated Î»s is only 1.4. A polymorphism near the gene for myelin basic protein on chromosome 21 was reported to be linked to MS in a family from Finland, but not in other populations. Some studies have suggested linkages or ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future.

The inability to confirm some genetic regions as containing MS susceptibility genes might reflect the small genetic contribution of these putative genes or genetic heterogeneity; alternatively, the original claim might have been spurious. As noted above, it is likely that an additive model consisting of multiple independent genes, each with small effects, explains the non-MHC genetic contributions to MS. It should be emphasized, however, that the identification of specific genes that have even very minor genetic effects on MS can have an enormous payoff, both in terms of helping to decipher the underlying biology of MS and in pointing to new potential treatments. For example, the genetic studies discussed earlier that identified a role for the CCR5 chemokine receptor suggest that therapies aimed at this receptor could be investigated in people with MS. Perhaps the strongest indication that MS is a heterogeneous disorder comes from HLA studies showing an absence of DR2 association in particular ethnic groups or perhaps in some clinical variants. In Japanese patients, one form of MS (“Western type”) is characterized by disseminated CNS involvement and is associated with the DR2 haplotype. In contrast, a more restricted form of MS in which optic nerve and/or spinal cord involvement predominate (“Asian MS”) is not associated with DR2. Lesions in the non-DR2-associated condition are frequently more severe and necrotizing than in the disseminated form. In one report, the Asian MS form was genetically associated with an HLA gene named DP (the DPB1*0501 allele). Another area of uncertainty is the strength of the association between primary progressive MS (PPMS) and DR2. A number of (relatively) small studies failed to show any association between PPMS and DR2, although a recent larger study from northern Ireland appeared to show an association; it is possible that PPMS represents more than one underlying disorder. Evidence for genetic heterogeneity is not limited to case-control HLA association studies but is also derived from formal linkage studies. Analysis of the MHC locus in an American multiple affected member MS data set confirmed the significant genetic linkage to this region (lod score of 4.60), and the specific association with the DR2 allele; however 25 percent of the families that were DR2 negative showed no linkage to the HLA region on 6p21. This indicated most likely the presence of locus heterogeneity in familial MS in Caucasians. A related *Lod scores are based on the ogarithm of the ds of linkage between two genes. A score of 3 or more is considered evidence of a genetic linkage between a known gene (or gene marker) and another unknown gene that underlies a trait (such as MS). That information thus indicates that the trait has a genetic basis and localizes the gene to a specific chromosomal region. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. observation in MS-prone Caucasian families is that the phenotypic expression of MS aggregates within families in some cases, suggesting that some clinical manifestations of MS are influenced by an individual's genetic background. The extent to which distinct clinical forms of MS are associated with different susceptibility genes, as may be the case in EAE (see discussion of animal models), is not known. Also unknown is whether specific genes interact with certain causative agents or triggers. Genetic studies have the potential to answer these questions, particularly when the information is analyzed in combination with epidemiologic, clinical, and neuroimaging data. There are several human and animal diseases of known etiology or pathogenesis that resemble either the clinical or the pathological features of MS (). Animal diseases that resemble MS are discussed under animal models. CNS demyelinating diseases include those mediated by immune responses, infection, and toxins, as well as inherited disorders. Infectious agents can induce direct injury of oligodendrocytes and their myelin membranes, as well as indirect injury via the immune system. A variety of toxins, such as diphtheria, lysolecithin, cuprizone, and ethidium bromide, have been associated with demyelinating lesions. Many of these toxins induce lysis of the oligodendrocyte, with demyelination as a secondary effect. In addition, nutritional deprivation can be associated with demyelination in the central and peripheral nervous system. Immune-Mediated and Virus-Induced CNS Demyelinating Diseases Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), also known as post vaccination encephalomyelitis, occurs as a consequence of vaccination with neural antigens. EAE, the most widely used animal model of MS, is the animal counterpart of this human disease. ADEM is characterized pathologically by widespread perivenular inflammation and demyelination. The uniformity of lesions differs from the multi-age lesions found in even the most acute case of MS. Post vaccination immune-mediated damage can also affect the peripheral nervous system. Since there is no standard laboratory-based test to diagnose the human disorder, the most reliable descriptions of the clinical spectrum of the disease are derived from collections of cases in which epidemiologic and statistical studies support the association of a triggering stimulus and disease. Such criteria are best met by cases associated with immunization with CNS tissue containing vaccines, for example, original Pasteur rabies vaccine. This vaccine complication can occur at all ages. A clinical hallmark of the rabies vaccine-associated form of ADEM is its uniphasic course evolving over days to several weeks. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. CNS Demyelinating Diseases That Resemble MS ADEM is characterized pathologically by widespread perivenular inflammation and demyelination. Multifocal CNS lesions can occur as a component of an array of systemic collagen vascular disorders including systemic lupus eryhemtosus and polyarteritis nodosa. The CNS manifestations may be the presenting feature. The peripheral nervous system is also frequently involved. PML is caused by the JC virus, which infects and destroys oligodendrocytes with minimal associated immune response. It typically occurs in immunosuppressed or immunocompromised individuals and is common in AIDS. The disease can feature a subacute progressive or relapsing clinical course. The imaging and pathologic features can be distinguished from classical MS. HTLV-1 (human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I) infection is sometimes associated with a neurological syndrome called HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). Patients with HAM/TSP have a progressive myelopathy, usually with spastic paraparesis, sensory disturbance, bladder dysfunction, and occasionally, optic neuritis. These inherited disorders are characterized by specific gene defects that result in either inadequate formation or excess breakdown of myelin. There may be a prominent inflammatory response in the region of myelin breakdown, but this is considered to be secondary to tissue breakdown. To date, therapeutic attempts with immunomodulatory agents in the leukodystrophies, specifically, adrenoleukodystrophy, have been ineffective. Toxic optic neuropathy, subacute myelo-optic neuropathy (SMON) Outbreaks of toxic optic neuropathy and SMON have been described in Cuba and in Japan.11,12,99 Sporadic cases of toxic optic neuropathy likely account for the disorder tobacco-alcohol amblyopia. Conversely, one need consider whether deficiency syndromes could underlie development of demyelinating syndromes; deficiency of vitamin B12, a cofactor in myelin formation, has also been implicated.

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. ADEM, or postinfectious encephalomyelitis, has been implicated as a consequence of a wide array of viral infections, although for many, the epidemiologic data are not strong enough to support a causal link. Measles virus epidemics have, however, been convincingly linked to ADEM. Postinfectious encephalomyelitis (PIE) is thought to be autoimmune in nature rather than secondary to a direct virus injury for the following reasons: (1) encephalitis appears after the rash clears; (2) there is generally little or no evidence of infectious virus or viral genome in the CNS at the time of the demyelinating disease; and (3) there is evidence of increased reactivity against myelin antigens during the demyelinating disease. Postinfectious encephalomyelitis is generally uniphasic. Immune system disturbances, which are known to occur following measles virus infection, might underlie the immunopathological response of post-infectious encephalomyelitis. A new direction for studies of PIE involves the possibility of establishing a model for this disease in transgenic mice that express the CD46 measles virus receptor. Molecular cross-reactivity, or molecular mimicry, has been demonstrated between myelin antigens and an array of viruses. Homologous sequences from viruses have been used to induce EAE (for example, hepatitis virus antigens). The extent of T-cell receptor degeneracy (meaning that the same receptor can respond to a wide sequence of peptides) and T-cell receptor heterogeneity in humans suggests that a wide array of exogenous agents could induce such a disease mechanism. As in MS, the putative infectious trigger could be different in individual MS patients depending on their immunogenetic makeup and the status of their immune system at the time of infection. A remaining challenge in MS is to determine whether any infectious agents detected in the CNS of such cases also persist in the CNS without causing harm or whether they are responsible for generating a pathogenic immune response. ADEM cases are usually sporadic, and it is sometimes difficult to identify the initiating factor. Relapsing cases of ADEM have been described, especially in younger-age patients. For some cases, characteristic pathologic material has been available. Similarly, the EAE model can be manipulated to produce a relapsing chronic disorder by selecting animals with specific immunogenetic backgrounds and timing their immunizations so that the underlying systemic immune response is amplified or the blood-brain barrier is altered. Such variables could also determine the nature of the response of humans when they are exposed to potential disease-inducing antigens. JC virus, a member of the papovavirus family, is a common pathogen in humans, although the *JC refers to the initials of the individual from whom the virus was isolated in 1970. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. primary disease caused by this virus is not characterized. Common symptoms include hemiparesis, aphasia, focal seizures, and visual disturbances. JC virus is thought to reactivate in immunosuppressed hosts, especially individuals with AIDS, producing the opportunistic infection PML. The disease involves a progressive CNS syndrome with symptoms and signs that suggest white matter involvement. Demyelination is usually most prominent in the occipital lobes of the cerebral hemispheres. The histopathology is characterized by the presence of oligodendrocytes with intranuclear inclusion bodies filled with papovavirus infectious particles, indicating that this disease involves a direct, lytic infection of the oligodendrocyte; that is, the oligodendrocyte is broken apart after being infected with the virus. Enlarged astrocytes are also seen, suggesting that the JC virus can transform these cells. Demyelination is a result of the direct oligodendrocyte infection by JC virus. Thus, in PML the immune response is considered to be protective rather than pathogenic. This retrovirus is common in the tropics as well as Japan, and is usually associated with asymptomatic disease. HTLV-1 infection is infrequently associated with a T-cell leukemia or lymphoma or a neurological syndrome called HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). Patients with HAM/TSP have a progressive myelopathy usually with spastic paraparesis, sensory disturbance, bladder dysfunction, and occasionally, optic neuritis. The CSF generally shows a lymphocytic pleocytosis with elevated IgG and oligoclonal IgG bands directed against HTLV-1. Necrotizing lesions with inflammation in the white matter are present in the spinal cord. HAM/TSP can resemble MS clinically. In fact, a case of HAM/TSP might be diagnosed as MS if it were not for the presence of HTLV-1 antibody and the observation that the HTLV-1 genome can be detected in the CNS. The pathogenesis of HAM/TSP remains unclear. There are numerous CD8+ T cells that recognize the virus, suggesting that this immune response might foster white matter disease. Infected glial cells are a possible source of inflammatory pathogenic cytokines and might also be the target for these cytolytic T cells. In addition, there is some evidence that molecular mimicry plays a role in disease pathogenesis. Host genetic factors, for example, HLA type, might also be important in determining susceptibility to HAM/TSP after infection. It has not been proven that MS is caused by an infectious agent, but various data, including the inflammatory nature of the disease, epidemiological studies, and a heightened immune response against several pathogens, suggest an infectious etiology (reviewed in 1998 by Kastrukoff et al.). Demyelinating diseases that clinically and pathologically resemble MS can be caused by viral agents or ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. Koch’s Postulate on Causation of Disease by a Pathogen The pathogen is always present in pathologically affected tissue. It would be rare to consistently isolate a pathogen from all cases of the disease that it causes because of shortcomings in isolation procedures. The pathogen is not present in tissues from controls. Pathogens can have a variety of clinical manifestations, from asymptomatic disease to varied diseases. Host restriction may prevent experimental transmission. immunopathological responses (). Infectious agents might be able to cause demyelination either directly, as a result of oligodendrocyte lysis, or indirectly, by means of an immunopathological response. Demyelination mediated by an immunopathological response can occur by a number of mechanisms. For example, the infectious agent can induce a pathogenic cross-reactive immune response (molecular mimicry), or the release of myelin antigens can stimulate an immune response that is directed against white matter antigens and becomes more broad over time (epitope spreading). (See for a summary of autoimmunity and disease.) There are clear limitations to using classical criteria to implicate a pathogen isolated in MS as a causal agent for the disease, as shown in . These issues make it especially difficult to establish the significance of a positive isolation from tissues of a patient with MS. However, all cases in which an infectious agent causes a disease will clearly not fit standard criteria, and individualization of the requirements is sometimes necessary. Because of these limitations, it is prudent to consider criteria that may be more appropriate and realistic. One could consider the following additional guidelines in analyzing disease causation by a pathogen: consistent transmission or isolation of the pathogen; cure or effective treatment of the disease following elimination of the pathogen; absence of the disease in geographic regions where the pathogen is not present. It may also be appropriate to consider particular molecular signatures related either to the genes of the pathogen or to the transcription expression profile associated with a particular pathogen. Many pathogens have been implicated over the years as etiological agents in MS (). ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. Agents Isolated or Implicated in the Etiology of MS Some of these claims have been doubted for the following reasons: contamination (for example, spirochete), artifacts of isolation methods (for example, simian cytomegalovirus), and normal flora (for example, herpes simplex-1 [HSV-1]). Although some of these agents are clearly capable of inducing a CNS demyelinating syndrome that resembles MS, it remains uncertain whether particular cases in which a pathogen is isolated represent a rare MS-like case or whether the pathogen may actually be a common cause of MS. There are various possible explanations of why so many pathogens have been isolated in MS but no single pathogen has been consistently observed. First, there might be a variety of pathogens that can independently cause MS (i.e., the disease is multifactorial), perhaps inducing heterogeneous forms of the disease. Second, MS might not be an infectious disease. The isolations of different pathogens might all be artifactual or related to rare events associated with a particular pathogen. Third, the relationship of the pathogen to MS might be a relatively minor one, possibly through interactions with genetic factors. Finally, the true pathogen might not yet have been identified. Thus far, there is inadequate evidence to either accept or reject suggestions that any particular pathogen is causally related to MS. A variety of members of the herpes group of viruses (for example, simian cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, HSV-1, and human herpesvirus-6 [HHV-6]) have been implicated in the etiology of MS. Members of this group of viruses remain attractive candidates as etiologic agents in MS since they are common pathogens that are known to persist and reactivate from a latent stage (and therefore could trigger the attacks and remissions seen in MS) and in some cases can induce focal demyelination in animals (see discussion of animal models of virus-induced demyelination). The most recent herpesvirus candidate to generate attention is HHV-6. HHV-6, a common pathogen, is the cause of the childhood disease, roseola (exanthem subitem). This virus is associated with febrile seizures in children, can invade the CNS, and can persist in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and the spinal fluid. In some cases, HHV-6 induces an MS-like disease, which raises the issue ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. of its broader involvement in MS. Some recent studies of HHV-6 have found no or rare evidence of HHV-6 genome in MS CSF (as well as little, if any, evidence of genome from several other members of the herpesvirus group). One recent study reported that there was an increased incidence of HHV-6 (as well as HSV and varicella-zoster virus) genome in CNS tissue from MS cases compared to tissues from controls; however, the differences were not statistically significant (see Sanders). Some investigators have argued that the cell type that is infected by HHV-6 differs in MS CNS compared to controls and, therefore, that the virus plays a role in the pathogenesis of MS. The interpretation of HHV-6 studies may be complicated because HHV-6 infection and the localization of the virus may be altered secondary to inflammation associated with MS or to immunosuppressive treatment of MS patients; therefore, a change in localization of HHV-6 in MS CNS compared to control CNS may be unrelated to any pathogenic role of HHV-6 in MS. Although HHV-6 may not induce the white matter lesions of MS, it remains a possibility that HHV-6 contributes to the demyelination seen in some cases of MS. The recent identification of CD46 as a cellular receptor for HHV-6 and the availability of transgenic mice that carry CD46 provide an opportunity to develop an experimental model of HHV-6-induced CNS disease pathogenesis. A recent study found that CSF from MS patients was culture-positive for and PCR (polymerase chain reaction)-positive for this agent more commonly than CSF from patients with other neurological disease. In addition, there was evidence of increased antibody against chlamydia in MS CSF, as well as evidence that MS CSF oligoclonal IgG bands were absorbed by chlamydia antigens. This work clearly needs confirmation. Members of the public awaiting cures for specific diseases often express impatience with the fact that most research on the biological basis of disease is based on animal studies, complaining that the time and money spent on animal studies would be better invested in clinical trials. However, animal studies are not simply interchangeable with clinical studies. Ultimately, every biologically active substance exerts its effects at the cellular and molecular levels, and the evidence has shown that this is remarkably consistent among mammals, even those as different in body and mind as rats and humans. Thus, animals can serve as models for basic biological processes in humans and can provide information about how drugs work that would not be obtainable in clinical studies. Animal models in which both spontaneous and induced disease occur have contributed greatly to our knowledge of the pathogenesis of diseases, and in the future, they will be increasingly used to aid in the assessment of various treatment modalities. A variety of animal models have been used to study the pathogenesis and experimental treatment of diseases that share features with MS (). ""2 Clinical and Biological Features.""

Immunization of mice, rats, or primates with myelin proteins (MBP, MOG, PLP) or other autoantigens (PLP). CREAE is a chronic, relapsing type of EAE In contrast to T cells, there is no technology available to routinely clone autoantigen specific B cells. As an alternative approach, B-cell “monoclonal” mice have recently been generated by gene replacement transgenesis Genetic engineering is used to produce animals that express particular human genes hypothesized to be involved in MS A variety of viruses can induce CNS demyelination, including Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus, mouse hepatitis virus, and herpes simplex virus Most of our present knowledge of myelin-specific autoimmunity and, more generally, of immune reactivity within the CNS emanates from experimental animal models. It should, however, be noted that there is a diversity of distinct models, defined by the animal species, the target autoantigen, and the mode of induction. Three basic types of animal models have been developed to understand the disease mechanisms underlying MS: EAE, virus-induced demyelination, and genetically modified animals. EAE models have served, in many respects, as the prototype for current thinking on the pathogenesis of MS. This paralytic disease is characterized by the presence of inflammation and demyelination in the CNS. It is an autoimmune syndrome induced in different susceptible strains and species, generally by intradermal immunization with myelin antigens (natural or synthetic) or by adoptive transfer of T lymphocytes reactive against myelin proteins. The antigens capable of inducing EAE vary depending upon the strain and species of animal, the adjuvants employed, and perhaps also the history of environmental exposures experienced by the animal. EAE should be considered not as a single model but rather as a heterogeneous family of related disorders. Each of the EAE variants reflects different aspects of human MS, and conversely, there is no one EAE model that represents the entire complexity of MS (). As is the case in MS, susceptibilities to EAE are determined as complex genetic traits. In both disorders, the most evident susceptibility locus resides within the HLA locus. Also in both disorders, locus heterogeneity is extensive (i.e., different loci and genes). Different genes can act at specific stages of the ""2 Clinical and Biological Features.""

Comparison Between Multiple Sclerosis and EAE SOURCE: Larry Steinman, presentation to the committee, November 17, 1999. EAE or Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) disease process, influencing severity, recovery, susceptibility to relapse, remyelination, and other elements of the phenotype. Knowledge of the extensive heterogeneity in disease susceptibility and modifier genes in these MS models should provide targets for study in human MS. Even within genetically identical littermates, the immune response following immunization with whole myelin is heterogeneous, with different antigenic targets dominating in different individuals. When groups of genetically identical animals are housed in different facilities, the resulting clinical syndromes can be markedly different, presumably reflecting the effects of different individual microenvironments. Studies of EAE established that the pathogenic agents of the disease are CD4+ T cells, which produce cytokines of the proinflammatory Th1 pattern (IFN-Î³ and TNF-Î±, but no IL-4) upon stimulation. The precursors of these T cells are contained within the normal immune repertoire, but they unfold their pathogenic potential only on activation, by either specific antigens, microbial superantigens, or mitogens. In EAE induced in the Lewis rat strain (and H-2 mice) by immunization ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. with MBP, the encephalitogenic T cells recognize almost exclusively single, circumscript epitope segments of the MBP in the molecular context of MHC class II (clonal dominance). This dominance can be gradually lost over time, a phenomenon referred to as determinant spreading. Furthermore, in these models, the T-cell receptor for most autoreactive T cells is based on a highly simplified repertoire of structural genes, such as the VÎ²8.2 gene for the TCR Î²-chain. These unusual features of antigen recognition have raised hopes with regard to immunospecific therapies. Unfortunately, however, they seem to be limited to only a few experimental models. Most EAE models, as well as the human myelin-specific T cells, do not show either striking epitope dominance or T-cell receptor biases. To date, attempts to identify possible functions of CNS-specific T-cell classes distinct from CD4+ T cells have not led to consistent pictures. Evidence from T-cell transfer models and TCR transgenic mice suggests that CD8+ T cells might help control and limit an ongoing CD4+ dependent EAE process. Most acute EAE models show profuse inflammatory CNS reactions with a conspicuous absence of large-scale demyelination, implying that MS-like demyelination is not caused directly by myelin-specific T cells but must be brought about by other mechanisms. B cells are the best-characterized effectors of this function. Large, confluent inflammatory demyelinated lesions can be produced in rats by transferring encephalitogenic T cells along with a monoclonal antibody against myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein. The T cells cause inflammation, thereby opening the blood-brain barrier to the autoantibodies, which enter the CNS where they bind to myelin and destroy it via complement- or phagocyte-dependent mechanisms. “Simple” immunization of rodents with MOG can also produce the same result. In addition to producing humoral autoantibodies, brain-specific B cells target and present myelin antigens to specific T cells. During this presentation process, the B cells may stimulate the activation of specific T cells, with a possible tendency to shift them from Th1 (pro-inflammatory) to Th2 cytokine (anti-inflammatory) profiles. The roles of autoreactive B cells in the pathogenesis of EAE are incompletely understood, mostly because of technical shortcomings. In contrast to T cells, there is no technology available to routinely clone autoantigen-specific B cells. As an alternative approach, B-cell “monoclonal” mice have recently been generated by gene replacement transgenesis. The germline repertoire of immunoglobulin genes in these mice has been replaced by the mature, rearranged gene encoding a MOG-specific autoantibody. Most, if not all, of the B cells in these mice express immunoglobulin receptors that are autoreactive to MOG. The mice spontaneously produce high titers of anti-MOG autoantibodies in their blood. There is no natural, spontaneous animal model resembling MS. The immunological conditions leading to relapses ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. and remissions of inflammatory demyelinating disease over time are most commonly examined in chronic relapsing versions of EAE. These episodic courses depend on the modes of immunization as well as on genetic factors innate to the host animals. Although the conditions that trigger relapses in CREAE models are not yet well understood, models are expected to provide clues to these essential aspects of MS, especially when refined by the use of suitable transgenic animals. It has recently been shown that a chronic relapsing EAE in a primate, the common marmoset, is more like MS than other EAE models. This form of EAE, induced in marmosets by immunization with MOG, produces lesions that are almost indistinguishable from fresh, acute human MS plaques. In both the human disease and this animal model, a zone of myelin destruction is seen at the margins of lesions; within the lesions, myelin sheaths are replaced by vesiculated membranous elements. MOG-specific antibodies, thought to be related to the deposition of antigen-specific antibody, are present over the vesiculated myelin. In both settings, oligodendrocytes were spared, and there was some evidence of myelin repair. Axonal pathology, however, was more conspicuous in MS cases than in this animal model. It has been suggested that processes mediated by T-cells initiate the demyelinating lesions and that other effector mechanisms are the principal offenders in damaging the myelin sheath. Mechanisms that initiate the lesion might be immunologically distinct from those that propagate disease. Antibodies might play an important role in these processes. The marmoset EAE model has also confirmed the encephalitogenic potential of autoreactive T-cell clones, whose precursors are preformed in the healthy immune repertoire. At the same time, however, these experiments also show that all T-cell clones are not equally autoaggressive. Experimental animal models of MS are based almost exclusively on the use of rodents, mostly rats and mice. Unfortunately, rodent and human immune systems differ to such a large degree that not all observations made in rodent EAE can be directly translated to human MS. An important disadvantage of animal models is that they do not necessarily mirror the cellular or molecular pathology of MS. Some types of EAE, for example, produce brisk demyelination, whereas others produce little demyelination. Which is the best model? Since these features of MS are not yet fully understood, it is dificult to know how faithfully any given animal model of MS illustrates the human disease. In addition, these models are not very tractable for studies on the electrophysiology and biophysics of neuronal function, a serious limitation in a disease such as MS in which symptoms and signs arise from impaired nerve function. Powerful research methods are now available for studying the physiology and ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. biophysics of normal or injured nerve cells. These methods permit neuroscientists to study electrical signaling in both normal and injured neurons, but they require that these nerve cells, with reproducible abnormalities, be reproducibly located, within fractions of a millimeter, in specific parts of the nervous system so that they can be studied. In MS and in most currently available animal models, the pathology is patchy, and the location of demyelinated and injured neurons varies from case to case. For the electrophysiologist who studies neuronal signaling by precisely placing tiny microelectrodes within neurons, studying the physiology of demyelinated or otherwise injured neurons when their location varies from animal to animal is, indeed, a challenge. A model in which focal demyelination, or axonal injury, can be produced at specific locations that are consistent from animal to animal would be a great improvement. Viruses can cause demyelination in several ways, the most straightforward of which is for viruses to lyse, or break open, oligodendrocytes, the myelinproducing cells. In some cases, however, the immune system is also involved. The mechanism by which virus-induced immune-mediated demyelination is carried out is not clear, but roles for molecular mimicry, bystander damage, and superantigen activation of T cells have all been proposed (see ). The best developed models of virus-induced demyelination are those caused by certain strains of TMEV and the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) (reviewed in Kastrukoff et al.). Probably the most fruitful of the remaining models are those of semliki forest virus (SFV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV) (). The advantages of SFV are its small, simple genome and ease of mutagenesis. Although the HSV genome is large and complex, the wealth of molecular information related to this virus and the ability to manipulate the viral genome make it an attractive model system, as well. The DA strain of TMEV produces an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the spinal cord with lesions that resemble MS. A variety of experimental studies of TMEV-induced demyelination suggest that as in MS, the immune system fosters demyelination. The inflammatory, demyelinating, and multifocal lesions of TMEV infection are mediated at least in part by T cells directed against viral antigens. The inflammatory response directly contributes to tissue damage in this MS-like model, since susceptibility is determined in part by immune response genes and immunosuppression abrogates demyelination. One to two weeks after inoculation with the DA virus, there is a brisk inflammatory response in the brain with high levels of virus. This is generally a subclinical process since the mouse usually appears normal. After three weeks, the brain pathology virtually disappears, but mice develop a progressive spastic para- ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001.

Animal Viruses That Induce Demyelination The TO subgroup strains of TMEV produces an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the spinal cord with lesions that resemble MS. A variety of experimental studies of TMEV-induced demyelination suggest that the immune system fosters the white matter disease. The many different strains of MHV lead to a plethora of different diseases, including hepatitis, as well respiratory CNS disorders. The presence and extent of demyelination depend on the viral genotype, dosage, and route of inoculation, as well as the strain, age, and immune status of the infected mouse. Virus persists in glial cells of demyelinated mice. Experimental infection of mice and rats with specific strains of SFV leads to demyelination; other strains induce an encephalomyelitis. Demyelination depends on the specific strain of virus, the mouse strain, and the immune status of the host. Virus persists in the central nervous system. The role of the immune system in the demyelinating disease remains unclear. Many strains of HSV produce a diffuse encephalitis in mice, but certain virus strains induce an inflammatory demyelinating disease in particular strains. Other strains of mice have multifocal demyelination that can relapse or persist in varied areas of the brain. The role of the immune system in this model is unclear but appears to contribute to the destruction of CNS tissue. Maedi visna is found only in sheep. There is no experimental rodent model of maedi visna infection, and therefore one needs to investigate sheep. The absence of markers for the sheep's immune system and of genetically modified sheep with knockouts of different arms of the immune system are clear limitations of the maedi visna model. The pathology of disease varies from an encephalomyelitis to a pure inflammatory demyelination that resembles MS.37 Virus persists during the disease with a restricted expression in microglial cells. It remains unclear whether demyelination is a result of direct viral lysis or is mediated by the immune response. CDV produces a variety of CNS diseases in dogs, including acute and chronic encephalitis and demyelinating disease. Virus persists in the chronic disease and appears to be present in oligodendrocytes in some cases. Work with this model has been limited since dogs are required as the host. The pathogenesis of the demyelinating disease remains unclear. paresis associated with an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the spinal cord. Although the titers of DA virus decrease over the first few weeks, virus persists in the central nervous system for the life of the mouse. The persistent virus is said to have a restricted, or incomplete, expression. In other words, viral genome is present, but the levels of infectious virus are low, with relatively little viral capsid ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. protein produced. (The capsid is the protein shell surrounding the viral DNA or RNA and is generally required for viral infectivity.) Advantages of the TMEV model include the simplicity of its genome, the detailed structural information about the virus, the ease with which it can be genetically manipulated, and finally, the extensive knowledge about the genes and immune system of mice, the natural host of TMEV (see .). Despite all that is known about TMEV and despite the ease in manipulating this simple virus, the pathogenesis of the demyelinating disease is not yet fully understood. It is clear that viral persistence in the oligodendrocytes and microglia is critical to the development of TMEV-induced demyelination; that is, an ongoing virus infection is always associated with the white matter disease. It is also clear that the immune system contributes to the late demyelinating disease, but exactly how remains poorly understood. Part of the difficulty in dissecting the role of the immune system in the pathogenesis of TMEV (as well as some of the other animal models of virus-induced demyelination) is that it changes over time. Early after infection, the immune system controls the virus infection, but later in Advantages of the TMEV Model of Virus-Induced Demyelination The following features of TMEV make it an attractive model for studies of virus-induced immune-mediated demyelination: with only four structural proteins in the infectious particle. The genome is only approximately 8,100 nucleotides in length. Three strains are completely sequenced. The crystallographic structure of three strains of the virus has been solved, so that the location of every amino acid in the infectious particle is known. The B-cell epitopes that are the targets for neutralizing antibody have been identified and located on the infectious particle. Some of the epitopes on the virus that trigger proliferation of immune CD4+ T cells and some that act as targets for an antivirus cytolytic T-cell response are also known. Some components of the receptor for the virus have been identified. Infectious clones of the virus are available so mutations can be quickly engineered into any region of the genome. There is extensive knowledge about mouse genetics and immunology. The mouse, which is the natural and experimental host of TMEV, provides a special benefit in studies of the pathogenesis of TMEV-induced demyelinating disease because so much is known about mouse genetics and the immune system. In addition, many genetically engineered mice are available, including those in which specific genes for different components of the immune system have been “knocked out.” ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. the disease, it contributes to the demyelination. In addition, during the disease there appears to be a critical “balance” of the immune response that is necessary for the induction of demyelination: an inadequate immune response early in the disease can lead to the death of the mouse within the first couple of weeks and before the appearance of demyelination, while a very forceful immune response early can lead to clearance of the virus so that no virus persists and white matter disease fails to develop. In other words, viral persistence and demyelination occur only in association with a certain level of the antiviral immune response. CD4+, as well as CD8+, T cells might be mediators of the late demyelinating disease. DA virus infection induces demyelination in both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell knockout mice, suggesting that both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells mediate the late demyelinating disease. The targets for these immunopathogenic CD4+ and the CD8+ T cells are unknown. There is some evidence for epitope spreading, in which an increasing number of myelin antigenic epitopes become the target for a CD4+ T-cell response. However, epitope spreading appears to begin after demyelination has become established, so it is unclear how important this mechanism of immunopathology is to DA-induced demyelination, especially early in the white matter disease. Mouse strains that are resistant to DA-induced demyelinating disease mount an antivirus cytolytic T-cell response and clear the virus. Mouse strains that are susceptible to the late disease do not mount this response, presumably allowing for virus persistence. L*, a small protein synthesized by demyelinating strains of TMEV via alternative translation, is critical for TMEV persistence and demyelination. L* inhibits the antivirus cytolytic T-cell response in susceptible mouse strains through an, as yet, unknown mechanism. Certain cells, for example, oligodendrocytes, may have cell-specific RNA-binding proteins that bind to the viral genome (as well as some nonviral messenger RNAs) and regulate whether L* or the viral capsid proteins are synthesized. The more L* that is synthesized, the more the expression of the virus is restricted. TMEV induces apoptosis in certain cells, including neurons and macrophages. The relationship between apoptosis and DA-induced demyelination remains an open question. There are many different strains of mouse hepatitis virus that lead to a plethora of different diseases, including hepatitis as well as respiratory and CNS disorders. JHM, S, and A59 strains of MHV induce demyelination. The extent of demyelination depends on the virus, including its geno-type, dosage, and route of inoculation, as well as on the condition of the infected mouse, including its strain, age, and immune status. Intracerebral inoculation of the JHM strain into weanling mice leads to demyelination in the mice that survive encephalitis. Virus persists in glial cells of demyelinated mice. At present, there are some notable limitations to MHV pathogenesis studies. MHV has a remarkably large viral genome (32 kb), making this a complex ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. pathogen. A system for efficient and rapid mutagenesis has not yet been perfected, and therefore manipulation of the viral genome is not straightforward. Investigators initially thought that demyelination occurred as a result of viral lysis of oligodendrocytes independently of the immune system. More recent studies, however, suggested that it does contribute to the demyelination (reviewed in 1996 by Houtman et al.). For example, investigators found that C57BL/6 mice that are immunosuppressed by gamma irradiation before being exposed to the JHM virus develop less severe demyelination. Adoptive transfer of JHM virus-infected splenic T cells to the infected irradiated mice leads to the development of significant demyelination. Other studies in rats showed that transfer of T cells from rats that have JHM virus-induced demyelinating encephalomyelitis leads to the development of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis-like lesions. Studies in CD4+ and CD8+ knockout mice demonstrated that both T-cell types are needed for clearance of the virus; however, CD4+ T cells contribute to central nervous system inflammation and demyelination. A suggestion of the latter study was that the CD4+ T cells influenced the expression of cytokines, specifically the RANTES cytokine, and led to macrophage entry into the CNS; treatment of the infected mice with anti-RANTES antibody resulted in a decrease in macrophage infiltration and demyelination. These studies and conclusions require confirmation. The committee notes that the following animal models of virus-induced demyelinating disease are particularly likely to yield clues to the pathogenesis of MS: The HAM/TSP syndrome resembles MS. Because the principles relevant to this human disease might be similar to those in MS, investigating the pathogenesis of this disease could reveal insights into MS pathogenesis. The development of a widely available animal model for HAM/TSP is a high priority. PIE is of special interest since recurrences following this acute inflammatory white matter disease are so similar to MS attacks that the two diseases are indistinguishable, indicating a close relationship between PIE and MS. The availability of transgenic mice that carry a receptor for measles virus might provide an experimental model for the study of PIE. The pathological lesions of TMEV are similar to MS plaques; therefore, continuing delineation of the mechanism by which the immune system contributes to the virus-induced demyelination might lead to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of demyelinating disease. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. Research on the MHV-induced demyelination model is presently limited by difficulties with site-directed mutagenesis methods. A high priority for research with this virus should be the generation of an infectious MHV cDNA clone and a refinement of mutagenesis techniques. Molecular genetic manipulation has become one of the most important tools for evaluating gene function in living organisms. These tools of molecular biology have extended the reach of researchers to a new level of understanding of neurodegeneration mechanisms. The development of animal models for neurodegenerative disorders by means of genetic engineering has revolutionized experimental neurology. The identification and cloning of genes involved in diseases such as Alzheimer's, Huntington's, and amyotropic lateral sclerosis provided the keys to develop mice that overexpress the human genes involved in these diseases (reviewed in 1999 by Brusa). The nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse is genetically susceptible to diabetes, and transgenic NOD mice have been developed to allow examination of the role of possible autoantigens in the development of diabetes, which like MS involves an inflammatory autoimmune pathology. The NOD mouse has also identified candidate molecules and processes that have influenced research in EAE and MS. Mutant mice have provided insights into all aspects of biology for generations, but only in the last two decades has it been possible to modify the expression of selected genes, an essential breakthrough for analyzing the role of specific genes in complex processes and diseases such as MS. In addition, identification of the genes that are activated or inactivated in both pathological and repair processes in the CNS will likely reveal new and unexpected targets for uniquely selective disease-modifying therapies in MS. “Reverse genetics” and “forward genetics” offer contrasting approaches to the analysis of gene function. Forward genetics is an approach to identify genes that are not already implicated in a particular disease or process. Reverse genetics is an approach to identify the role of genes whose involvement in the disease or process being studied is already implicated. In forward genetics, large numbers of mice are mutagenized (using techniques that mutagenize genes at random); their resulting phenotypes are analyzed to select mutants that exhibit spontaneous MS. The mutated genes in the selected mutants are then positionally cloned and identified. The homologous human clones can also be identified, a task that is becoming vastly simpler as the human genome project nears completion. The advantage of this approach is that the screen is not biased in any way and can reveal genes beyond those already known to be involved in MS. Another advantage of forward genetics is that once a gene is identified in a disease process, one can quickly do a screen for suppressors and ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. enhancers of the phenotype. This will yield the entire biochemical pathway (as opposed to just one step) involved in disease pathogenesis. One limitation to the forward genetics approach is that only a small percentage of the mutated genes will result in a phenotype relevant to MS. Consequently, large numbers of mutants have to be screened, which is generally expensive, time-consuming, and labor intensive. Yet the rewards—especially for complex diseases and processes that have resisted traditional approaches—are unparalleled. In reverse genetics, mutant strains of mice that either overexpress or lack specific genes are generated through a variety of techniques. The classic approach to creating transgenic mice is to inject a foreign gene (“transgene”) into a fertilized egg, thereby inducing overexpression of the transgene. The egg bearing the transgene is implanted into a host mother. Progeny bearing DNA encoding the transgene are screened, as are the corresponding levels of RNA and protein. This transgene is randomly incorporated into a mouse chromosome and ultimately leads to production of the protein of interest. This approach has been used to transfer human genes (such as those for T-cell receptor, HLA DR2, and CD4) into mice to see if they develop spontaneous MS. One limitation of “knockin” mice is that genes can be inserted in uneven copy numbers in “replicate” animals or might be integrated into disparate sites in the genome. Gene expression can also be altered through knockout experiments. Knockout mice, or null mutants, are created using embryonic stem cells and homologous recombination to produce a cell line in which a certain gene has been removed, or ablated. When transferred into an early mouse embryo, these cells can participate in the generation of all cell lineages including germ cells, thereby transmitting their genotype to the next generation. Alternatively, embryonic stem cells can be used to create so-called knock-in mice by inserting a gene into a particular locus. The transgenic gene-targeting approaches described above all rely on irreversible changes to the genome that are present from the onset of development throughout an animal's life. The function of the gene must be deduced from the phenotype of animals that have been deficient for the product of the disrupted gene throughout development. Yet, many genes play different roles at different stages of development and in different tissues. This presents serious drawbacks (reviewed in 1998 by Gingrich and Roder and in 1999 by Muller). First, an animal with a gene alteration that lethally disrupts development obviously cannot be studied as an adult—even though the gene might play another critical role, for example, in neural repair. This is particularly relevant to MS because many of the genes that regulate embryonic neural development also regulate neural repair in adults. Another limitation of transgenic models is that changes in the regulation of other genes could yield misleading phenotypes, in part because of differences between effects of the gene at different developmental stages, gene redundancy (other genes might also play the role of the missing gene), or adaptive mecha- ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. nisms that compensate for the missing gene. Even apparently unaltered phenotypes would thus not prove that the gene was not involved in the disease or process being studied. Another limitation of this approach is that in physiological responses, gene products tend to be produced in waves, whereas in transgenics, expression is usually “on” from the time of development. Alternative approaches in which one gene, or parts of it, can be inactivated or activated in specific tissues or at specific times (“conditional” and “inducible” mutants) have recently been developed in this rapidly expanding array of genealtering techniques (reviewed in Brusa, 1999; Gingrich and Roder, 1998; and van der Neut, 1997). This second generation of transgenic technology derives from the possibility of modulating the suppression of a transgene with external stimuli, by using a “biological switch” that can turn the foreign gene on and off. Gene expression patterns in the nervous system are highly regionalized. For example, the enzymes involved in producing neurotransmitters and their receptors differ from one subpopulation of neurons to another. Other proteins are more widespread, such as the intermediate filament proteins NF (neurofilament) or GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein), or are ubiquitous, such as N-CAMs (neural cell adhesion molecules) and integrins. Thus, it would be particularly advantageous to develop tissue-specific mutants for MS research. The development of inducible systems will become an important tool in the many diverse aspects of research on the disease mechanisms and possibilities for repair in MS, including the potential administration of gene therapy. Transgenic overexpression of cytokines or gene targets of cytokines in the CNS offers a relatively non-intrusive mechanism to assess the role of individual cytokines in CNS development, function, and response to insult. A common technique for assessing the effects of a particular cytokine in EAE is to induce its expression directly in the CNS. This allows researchers to ask whether expression of the cytokine induces CNS pathology similar to that seen in MS. Directed expression of transgenes in the CNS relies on promoters that normally control the expression of CNS-specific genes. This includes the GFAP gene promoter, which drives expression in astrocytes, as well as the neurofilament promoter (neurons), and the myelin basic protein promoter (oligodendrocytes). To date, no one has isolated a microglial-specific promoter. Only MBP promoters have been used to overexpress gamma-interferon in the CNS. Phenotypes of transgenic mice range from a lethal, “jimpy”-like hypomyelinating mouse, through progressive demyelinating disease, to mice with no outward phenotype that nevertheless showed progression from EAE to a *A point mutation in the gene coding for myelin proteolipid protein causes male offspring of jimpy mice to have little or no myelination. Affected mice develop severe tremors and die prematurely at approximately 30 days. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. chronic demyelinating disease in contrast to control mice that recovered from EAE-induced demyelination. It is of interest that the same laboratory observed both extremes using the same constructs. This might be because the transgenes were unevenly integrated at different loci, since levels of expression did not obviously correlate with phenotype in one case. Asymptomatic transgenic mice did, however, show enhanced glial responses to CNS injury, and exacerbated ischemic infarction (Lambertsen et al., unpublished). These asymptomatic mice presumably reflect sub-threshold levels of cytokine. Nevertheless, crossing an asymptomatic MBP promoter-driven gamma-interferon transgenic mouse with MBP or MHC class I mice produced a more extreme jimpy phenotype. This might provide a clue to cytotoxic effects of beta-interferon-Î³ on oligodendrocytes, being perhaps dependent on local interferon-Î³ titers becoming sufficiently high to stimulate MHC I induction. It is not known whether similar mechanisms account for oligodendrocyte pathology in TNF-Î± and interferon-Î± transgenic mice. The IL-3 and IL-12 transgenic mice provide a useful counterpart, there being no obvious suggestion of a direct effect on oligodendrocytes., These mice illustrate the potential for direct macrophage and microglial attack on oligodendrocytes, which might occur in TNF-Î± transgenic mice. It is not clear from any of these experiments whether activation of immune cells took place within the CNS or following cytokine exit to the periphery. A systemic effect must account for the fact that overexpression of the antiinflammatory cytokine IL-10 protected animals from EAE in two separate preparations. The fact that IL-4 transgenic mice did not show similar resistance might reflect insufficient expression within the CNS or strain background differences, given that IL-4 knockout exacerbated disease in another study. Most recently, a transgenic mouse has been “constructed” that expresses T-cell receptor genes from a human MBP-specific T-cell clone, along with relevant human MHC class II determinants and MBP. Under certain conditions, this “humanized” mouse developed spontaneous EAE that indeed showed inflammation with some demyelination. In recent years, there have been many advances in the use of transgenes (including gene knockouts), as well as even more sophisticated models that make use of tissue-specific and time-dependent regulators. These models should facilitate the development of rational therapies and the transfer of knowledge from animal models to the prevention and treatment of human disease. However, although temporally regulated targeting controlled by the administration of an environmental inducer has become feasible with high efficiency for some organs, it remains to be further improved for other tissues, particularly the brain. New generations of inducible promoters will more faithfully mimic the in vivo kinetics and dynamics of cytokine production. Knock-in mice, in which ""2 Clinical and Biological Features.""

Multiple sclerosis is a chronic and often disabling disease of the nervous system, affecting about 1 million people worldwide. Even though it has been known for over a hundred years, no cause or cure has yet been discovered—but now there is hope. New therapies have been shown to slow the disease progress in some patients, and the pace of discoveries about the cellular machinery of the brain and spinal cord has accelerated. This book presents a comprehensive overview of multiple sclerosis today, as researchers seek to understand its processes, develop therapies that will slow or halt the disease and perhaps repair damage, offer relief for specific symptoms, and improve the abilities of MS patients to function in their daily lives. The panel reviews existing knowledge and identifies key research questions, focusing on: Research strategies that have the greatest potential to understand the biological mechanisms of recovery and to translate findings into specific strategies for therapy. How people adapt to MS and the research needed to improve the lives of people with MS. Management of disease symptoms (cognitive impairment, depression, spasticity, vision problems, and others). The committee also discusses ways to build and financially support the MS research enterprise, including a look at challenges inherent in designing clinical trials. This book will be important to MS researchers, research funders, health care advocates for MS research and treatment, and interested patients and their families. 3 Characteristics and Management of Major Symptoms 5 Strategies for Future Research on Disease Mechanisms 7 Building and Supporting the Research Enterprise Appendix D: Kurtze's Expanded Disability Status Scale Appendix F: U.S. Social Security Administration's Criteria for Qualifying as Disabled from MS Appendix G: Treatments That Have Been Claimed to Be of Benefit in MS You're looking at OpenBook, NAP.edu's online reading room since 1999.

For some, these treatments reduce the number and severity of attacks and slow disease activity.   We are making significant progress in stopping MS: The Society joined with NIH to launch a therapy trial of the re-purposed therapy ibudilast in primary-progressive and secondary-progressive MS. suggest that ibudilast significantly slowed the rate of brain atrophy (shrinkage), which has been linked to cognitive and physical disability in MS.This therapy has been designated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as a “Fast Track Product” in terms of its development as a possible treatment of progressive MS. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the expansion of the use of the oral MS therapy Gilenya® (fingolimod, Novartis AG) and adolescents 10 years of age or older with relapsing MS. This is the first therapy specifically approved to treat pediatric MS. The Alliance is an unprecedented global collaboration of MS organisations, researchers, health professionals, the pharmaceutical industry, companies, trusts, foundations, donors and people affected by progressive MS, working together to address the unmet needs of people with progressive MS ─ rallying the global community to find solutions. The mission is to accelerate the development of effective treatments for people with progressive forms of multiple sclerosis to improve quality of life worldwide. There is increasing understanding that malfunctioning mitochondria, the tiny energy producers of cells (like battery packs), may contribute to nervous system damage in MS, opening up possibilities for preventing that damage.  An international team has reported the feasibility and safety of using a patient’s own altered blood cells to reduce immune responses against specific components of myelin. The National MS Society-launched MS Outcome Assessments Consortium and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration continue to clear a pathway for a new tool for improving and speeding clinical trials in MS. This team already has generated a new database containing nearly 2500 patient records from the placebo arms of nine MS clinical trials is now available for research by qualified investigators.  Identifying the causes of MS, and the underlying mechanisms and biological pathways involved in MS injury to the brain and spinal cord, will expose new targets for the development of treatments to stop the damage that causes disability. Diagnosing progressive disease based on biomarkers, in addition to clinical presentation would enable the testing of therapies earlier, promising better ways of protecting the nervous system from MS injury. High impact research areas include: Clarifying the destructive and protective roles of the adaptive and innate immune system, including both infiltrating and compartmentalized cells Determining the causes of tissue injury at different stages of disease, and whether neurodegeneration and demyelination can be independent events in MS Determining how evolving MRI sequences relate to pathological changes in the central nervous system Leveraging big data and transformative technologies to identify and interrogate relevant biological pathways and clinical/demographic features that influence disability progression Ensuring access to human central nervous system tissues/cells from MS patients and healthy controls for the purpose of gaining a thorough understanding of the neuropathology of MS Determining the specific pathologic underpinnings of MS progression Identifying objective indicators of disease activity that mark the transition to progression, measure treatment impact, and predict an individual’s course and response to therapy Determining mechanisms underlying the causes of progression in the absence of acute inflammation or relapses, the transition from relapsing to secondary progressive MS, and whether primary progressive and secondary progressive MS have similar biological underpinnings Developing better animal models that recapitulate human pathology to inform the study of the mechanisms underlying MS and progression Developing tools that allow better treatment decision making and personalized medicine, including therapy risks/benefits Testing approaches for the prevention and treatment of MS progression including repurposed/repositioned FDA-approved therapies, impact of early aggressive treatment vs. step therapy, and cell-based therapy  Read more about our successes and goals for stopping MS. Understanding and stopping MS in its tracks requires a better understanding of the role that the immune system plays in the inflammatory attacks on myelin and, very possibly, in the injury to axons (the wire-like nerve fibers) that contributes to longer-term disability. We Support academic and commercial research leading toward clinical trials of new therapies to stop damage and progression of disability; we are feeding the pipeline in several ways and pursuing therapies for EVERYONE with MS. Understanding the processes that lead to tissue damage in MS is crucial to our focus on reversing this damage to regain function through nervous system and myelin repair.

83099e81-7d36-465e-827d-ad5cb119c360,"Multiple Sclerosis Relapses Don’t Necessarily Occur After Pregnancy In a new study, researchers say there was no significant increase in relapse rate after childbirth for women with MS. Pregnancy may not cause multiple sclerosis (MS) to worsen as previously thought. For the past 20 years, women with MS were told that while pregnancy might help , those relapses often got worse after childbirth. However, researchers say in a that they discovered the disease didn’t show increased relapse activity after a woman has given birth. The research team was headed by , a clinical assistant professor of neurology at the University of Southern California (USC) Keck School of Medicine as well as an affiliated investigator in neurology with Kaiser Permanente Research. “This is a super interesting study,” , PhD, executive vice president of research at the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, told Healthline. “We have had this dogma for a long time,” said Bebo. “Women with MS showed an exacerbated rate of relapses after pregnancy, but Dr. Langer-Gould questioned this and found in this preliminary study a different result.” Previous studies occurred before current disease-modifying treatments.There are now approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Almost in the United States are estimated to be living with MS. Of these, about are women. The objective of the recent study was to investigate what happens to women with MS after giving birth. Researchers looked at the risk of relapses and identified potentially modifiable risk factors. This population study looked at 466 pregnancies from 375 women in the years 2008 to 2016. The records were taken from the Kaiser Permanente Southern and Northern California databases. The participants were surveyed about treatments, breastfeeding, and relapses. “This study provides an important update on previous data, which had indicated that women with MS were more likely to have a relapse in the first three to six months postpartum, with that risk being higher for patients with more active disease before pregnancy,” , professor of clinical neurology at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) and clinical director of the UCLA MS program, told Healthline. Of the women in the study, 38 percent weren’t on any treatment in the year prior to conception, while 15 percent had clinically isolated syndrome and 8 percent relapsed during pregnancy. No increase in relapses postpartum were observed, although the authors point out that some of the women had only had a single episode. About one-third of the women breastfed exclusively, which seemed to reduce the relapse rate. “This is good news for women with MS who wish to have children, and larger population-based studies of this type are encouraged,” noted Giesser. Immune mechanisms are triggered during pregnancy to keep a woman’s body from rejecting the fetus. This mechanism is also responsible for suppressing the immune system responsible for MS relapses. “These results are exciting, as MS is more common among women of childbearing age than in any other group,” Langer-Gould said in a . “This shows us that women with MS today can have children, breastfeed, and resume their treatment without experiencing an increased risk of relapses during the postpartum period,” she added. “The results are somewhat preliminary and not definitive,” noted Bebo. “But it provides an important piece of information that adds to our knowledge for MS and pregnancy, before and after.” The authors report the lack of rebound disease activity in the early postpartum period is likely due to a combination of the participants in a population-based setting, inclusion of women diagnosed after a single relapse, and high rates of breastfeeding. “There were not a lot of people in the study that were on the stronger DMTs, so it may be skewed to a more calm version of disease,” cautioned Bebo, “There wasn’t a lot of exacerbation postpartum.” “We do not know how certain DMTs will affect pregnancy,” Bebo said. He emphasized the importance of pregnant women with MS contacting their healthcare provider as soon as possible to us a shared-decision approach to treatment. “People should have all the information in making family decisions, and this is something that can help,” said Bebo. “This information is helpful, but everyone needs to evaluate their own circumstance with their healthcare provider to make informed decisions on how to proceed.” Editor’s note: Caroline Craven is a patient expert living with MS.

9a51f6ad-5e86-47ac-bcb5-46c0d0778929,"— — is an unpredictable disease that affects each person differently. Adjusting to your new and ever-changing situation may be easier if you have an idea of what to expect. It’s important to face your diagnosis head-on and learn as much as you can about the disease and the symptoms. The unknown can be scary, so having an idea of what symptoms you may experience can help you be better prepared for them. Not everyone will have the same symptoms, but some symptoms are more common than others, including: or weakness, usually affecting one side of your body at a time loss or disturbance of vision, usually in one eye at a time Expect some relapses of symptoms. Approximately of Americans with MS are diagnosed with , which is characterized by attacks with full or partial recovery. About of Americans with MS don’t have attacks. Instead, they experience a slow progression of the disease. This is called . Medications can help reduce the frequency and severity of attacks. Other drugs and therapies can help alleviate symptoms. Treatment can also help change the course of your disease and slow its progression. Being diagnosed with MS may have been out of your control, but that doesn’t mean you can’t be in control of your treatment. Having a plan in place helps you manage your disease and alleviate the feeling that the disease is dictating your life. The recommends taking a comprehensive approach. This means: modifying the disease course by taking FDA-approved medications to reduce the frequency and severity of attacks treating attacks, which often involves using corticosteroids to reduce inflammation and limit damage to the central nervous system managing symptoms using different medications and therapies taking part in rehabilitation programs so that you can maintain your independence and continue your activities at home and work in a way that’s both safe and appropriate to your changing needs seeking professional emotional support to help you cope with your new diagnosis and any emotional changes you may experience, like or Work with your doctor to come up with a plan. This plan should include referrals to specialists who can help you with all aspects of the disease and available treatments. Having confidence in your healthcare team can have a positive impact on the way you deal with your changing life. Keeping track of your disease — by writing down appointments and medications as well as keeping a journal of your symptoms — can also be helpful for you and your doctors. This is also a great way to keep track of your concerns and questions so that you’re better prepared for your appointments. Though the symptoms of MS can be burdensome, it’s important to note that many people with MS continue to live active and productive lives. Depending on your symptoms, you may need to make some adjustments to the way you go about your daily activities. Ideally, you want to continue to live your life as normally as possible. So, avoid isolating yourself from others or stopping doing the things you enjoy. Being active can play a big role in managing MS. It can help reduce your symptoms and help you keep a positive outlook. A physical or occupational therapist can give you suggestions on how to adapt your activities at home and work to suit your needs. Being able to continue to do the things you love in a way that’s safe and comfortable can make it much easier for you to adjust to your new normal. — — Doctor Discussion Guide: What to Ask About Primary Progressive MS Everything You Need to Know About PPMS and the Workplace People Like Me: Living with Primary Progressive MS © 2005-2021 Healthline Media a Red Ventures Company.

In HSCT for MS, hematopoietic (blood cell-producing) stem cells, which are derived from a person’s own (scientifically referred to as “autologous”) bone marrow or blood, are collected and stored, prior to depleting much of the immune system using chemotherapy drugs. Then the stored hematopoietic stem cells are reintroduced to the body. The new stem cells migrate to the bone marrow and over time reconstitute the immune system.  Is HSCT an FDA-approved therapy option for people with MS? The medications and procedures used in HSCT are already approved by the FDA. Publication of the outcomes from well controlled clinical studies of HSCT therapy will encourage greater acceptance and use by the medical community. The goal of HSCT is to reset the immune system and stop the inflammation that contributes to active relapsing MS.  The National Medical Advisory Committee of the National MS Society has written an article reviewing evidence related to the optimal use of autologous HSCT for the treatment of specific types of relapsing multiple sclerosis. The committee’s findings are published in () . There is growing evidence that aHSCT is not for everyone with MS but may be highly effective for people with relapsing MS who meet very specific characteristics. While the general approach is the same, there are different treatment protocols that vary depending on the medical center and doctors performing the procedure. In general, these are some of the steps involved: A person undergoing autologous HSCT to treat MS is given some form of chemotherapy, usually by infusion in the vein, for 1-2 days, and also another type of treatment for up to 10 days to stimulate the production of bone marrow stem cells and promote their release into the blood. Then some blood is drawn from a vein and the stem cells in the blood are stored for later use. Then the individual is usually hospitalized, and given a powerful mix of chemotherapies for several days to kill or suppress immune cells throughout the body. The stored stem cells are then infused into the bloodstream through a vein. The individual is usually given medicines such as antibiotics to help combat possible infection. The person remains in the hospital for an additional period of time while the immune system begins to rebuild itself. Sometimes individuals are discharged from the hospital in two to four weeks, but this can be longer.  The immune system gradually rebuilds itself within 3 to 6 months.   Read more frequently asked questions about HSCT and MS National MS Society Releases Recommendations for aHSCT-Bone Marrow Transplant for MS November 11, 2020 Investigators Recruiting Nationwide for Study Comparing AHSCT to Other Therapies in Active Relapsing MS January 7, 2020 Results Published from Study of Bone Marrow Stem Cell Transplants (HSCT) in Relapsing-Remitting MS January 15, 2019 Results Published from Australian HSCT Bone Marrow Stem Cell Transplantation Trial in MS December 13, 2018 Paper Published on Recommendations for Speeding Research on Cell-Based Therapies for MS July 24, 2017 ""Combined Analysis of Previously Published HSCT/Bone Marrow Transplantation Studies"" May 4, 2017 ""Large Study Showed Long-Term Benefits of Bone Marrow-Derived Stem Cell Transplantation in Some People with MS"" February 21, 2017 ""Final 5-Year Results Published from Study of Bone Marrow Stem Cell Transplantation in Relapsing MS"" February 3, 2017 ""International Conference Held by National MS Society and ECTRIMS to Assess Progress and Define Research Directions for Cell-Based Therapies for MS""  December 9, 2015 “Positive Results from Study of Bone Marrow-Derived Stem Cells in People with Aggressive, Relapsing MS”  June 9, 2016 Additional research is focusing on figuring out who might benefit from this procedure and how to reduce its risks. HSCT is being investigated in Canada, the United States, Europe and elsewhere. For example:  • A multicenter phase 3 clinical trial of HSCT (“BEAT-MS”) began in 2020 in Cleveland, Seattle and up to 19 sites across the country. This study is now recruiting participants nationwide. The Society has been engaged with the team conducting the trial and is helping with recruitment.  • A clinical trial is getting underway at medical centers in Denmark, Netherlands, Norway and Sweden. The trial is testing treatment with HSCT compared with alemtuzumab in people with active relapsing-remitting MS.   • A phase 3 trial at Northwestern Medical in Chicago launched by Dr. Richard Burt to determine the optimal protocol for safety and benefit is ongoing and no longer recruiting participants. According to Northwestern, Dr. Burt will be going on a planned research sabbatical at the end of 2019. • In December 2020, a team from Lithuania published results of a study assessing cognitive dysfunction and physical disability after autologous HSCT. Thirteen people who did not respond to conventional therapies for highly active relapsing MS underwent autologous HSCT and completed 24 months of follow up. Disability progression was measured by the EDSS scale. Two people had one relapse during the first year and three people had one relapse during the second year. EDSS improved in 11 participants (84.6%). Information processing speed and verbal learning improved significantly at 12 months. No transplant-related deaths occurred. Fever was the most common side effect. • Researchers from Florence, Italy report on a small, open-label study involving 26 people with moderate to severe secondary progressive MS who underwent HSCT. Most showed signs of clinical or MRI inflammatory activity in the year prior to the procedure. Five years after the procedure, 42% of participants were stable with no further progression of disability that was reduced to 30% 10 years after transplant. No relapses or inflammatory activity occurred on MRI scans after treatment. These results suggest that HSCT might be appropriate in a subgroup of people with SPMS that have significant inflammatory activity as measured by MRI. Further study in larger numbers are needed to understand who among those with secondary progressive MS might benefit from HSCT. Read a  or an  in . • In January 2019, an international team of researchers led by Richard K. Burt, MD (MD (going on research sabbatical late 2019 from Northwestern University, Chicago, IL) published results of the first randomized, control trial of bone marrow stem cell transplant (HSCT) in people with aggressive relapsing-remitting MS. They enrolled 110 people whose MS was not controlled by available disease-modifying therapies. Half received immunosuppressant therapy followed by hematopoietic (blood cell-producing) stem transplant. The other half were switched to a different disease-modifying therapy. Significantly fewer people experienced MS progression in the group that underwent HSCT, compared with the group who were switched to a different MS disease-modifying therapy. There were no deaths or life-threatening adverse events in either group. The investigators consider this study to be preliminary and recommend that further research is needed to confirm these findings and to determine longer-term outcomes and safety. or in JAMA. • In December 2018, Drs. John Moore, David Ma (St. Vincent’s Hospital, Darlinghurst, NSW, Australia) and colleagues reported results of a small clinical trial of HSCT conducted at a single medical center in Australia. This trial enrolled 35 people with relapsing-remitting MS or secondary progressive MS whose disease had not responded well to disease-modifying medications. There was no control group or blinding; all participants underwent the HSCT procedure. The team reported on results after following participants from 12 to 66 months after transplantation. After 12 months, 82% remained free of relapses, MRI-detected new or enlarging lesions, and progression (called “Event-Free Survival” or EFS). At two years after transplant, 65% of the group had EFS, and at three years 60%. EFS was better in those who had relapsing MS. Of 8 who experienced MS progression after transplantation, 2 had relapsing-remitting MS and 6 had secondary progressive MS. Twelve of thirteen whose disability scores improved after transplantation had relapsing-remitting MS. At this center, which has a long experience with bone marrow transplants, there were no transplant-related deaths. Many experienced complications expected from the chemotherapy cocktail (called “BEAMS”) used to deplete their bone marrow cells in preparation for the transplant. or in the JNNP. • In April 2017, researchers in Italy combined and analyzed results from 15 previously published studies of HSCT (Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation) involving 764 people with various forms of MS. They found that overall, the procedure showed a significant benefit against disease activity and progression. Two years after transplantation, about 83% of all participants had not progressed; overall, studies involving more people with relapsing-remitting MS had lower progression rates. The pooled results showed an overall transplant-related mortality rate of 2.1%. There were fewer deaths in later studies as researchers gained more experience with the procedure. here or the ​• In February 2017, results of an international study were published. The study evaluated long-term outcomes from HSCT in 261 people with different forms of MS. The transplants took place between 1995 and 2006, with a follow-up period of up to 16 years. Several different transplant protocols were followed. After 5 years, 46% still had not experienced any progression or worsening of symptoms, including 73% of those with relapsing MS and 33% of those with secondary progressive MS. Eight deaths (2.8%) occurred within 100 days of the transplant. Most of these occurred during the early development of the procedure; improvements in patient selection and transplant techniques have significantly reduced the mortality. Those with the best outcomes tended to be younger, had relapsing MS, lower accumulation of disability and had used fewer MS therapies prior to the transplant procedure. Additional research is needed to better understand who might benefit from this procedure and how it compares to the benefits of powerful immune-modulating therapies now available.  or the • In February 2017, results were published from a multi-center, 5-year trial called the HALT MS Study. It tested HSCT in 24 people with MS and active relapsing-remitting disease that was not controlled by disease-modifying medications. Results suggest that after five years, 69.2% of participants experienced no new disease activity after the procedure and did not need disease-modifying therapies to control their disease. All participants experienced severe and/or life threatening adverse events. Most of these occurred within the first 30 days after transplant and were related to low white blood cell counts and infections. This trial, which was funded by the National Institutes of Health, is an important addition to research needed to determine whether this approach to stem cell transplantation is safe and effective in people with MS. A larger, phase 3 study is in the process of launching (see""Ongoing Research in HSCT"" above).   or the  • In June 2016 researchers in Canada published results of a long-term HSCT trial involving 24 people with aggressive relapsing-remitting MS whose disease was not controlled with available therapies. Three years after the procedure, 70% remained free of disease activity, with no relapses, no new MRI-detected inflammatory brain lesions, and no signs of progression. None of the surviving participants experienced clinical relapses or required MS disease-modifying therapies to control their disease, and 40% experienced reductions in disability. One participant died and another required intensive hospital care for liver complications. All participants developed fevers, which were frequently associated with infections, and other toxicities.    Read more about stem cell clinics and questions to ask Read about National MS Society Research in Stem Cells  from the International Society for Stem Cell Research Researchers from Italy Report Long-Term Outcomes from Bone Marrow Transplants (aHSCT) to Treat MS Study Shows that Stem Cells Derived from Skin Cells of People with MS Make Normal Nerve-Insulating Myelin National MS Society Releases Recommendations for aHSCT-Bone Marrow Transplant for MS HSCT Shows Benefits in Some People with Secondary Progressive MS in Small Study Myelin Repair, Clinical Trials, Gut Bacteria, and Exercise Headline at ECTRIMS2019, the World’s Largest MS Research Meeting © 2020 The National Multiple Sclerosis Society is a tax exempt 501(c)3 nonprofit organization.

d7ccea3c-f2e8-4ed8-b344-1bb35f1adc16,"Information about the 2019 Novel Coronavirus. Información sobre el coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurodegenerative disease. It interferes with your brain's ability to control your body. It can be disabling. Each type might be mild, moderate, or severe. MS affects people differently.  With PPMS, neurologic functions get steadily worse in the beginning. There are no symptom flare-ups (also called relapses or attacks). And there is no recovery (remission). How fast the disease progresses may vary. There can be times when things are stable. And there can be periods of short-term (temporary) minor improvements. But declining neurologic progression is constant.  Men and women are evenly affected by this type of MS. About 10% of people diagnosed with MS have PPMS. On average, people with primary-progressive MS start having symptoms between ages 35 and 39. The exact cause of MS is not known, but research suggests it develops when your immune system attacks a substance called myelin. Myelin acts as a type of insulation on your nerve cells. This process can lead to damage in and around the nerves in your brain and spinal cord. It can also damage nerves used for vision. The occurrence and severity of PPMS symptoms vary with each person. Symptoms can include: Pain (for example, headaches, pain in the legs and feet, back pain, and muscle spasms) Electric-shock sensations that run down the back and limbs when the neck is bent (Lhermitte sign) Methods that your healthcare provider may use to diagnose MS include: Your healthcare provider will talk with you about your symptoms. This is done to see how your nerves and muscles are working. These images will help your healthcare provider look for signs of damage that suggest MS. This test measures nerve fibers in the retina. Your healthcare provider removes a sample of spinal fluid to check for signs of MS. This test is done to see how well your optic nerves are working. After the general diagnosis of MS, the diagnosis of PPMS is based almost exclusively on the patient's symptom history. Because of this, it may take time for the PPMS diagnosis to be made. Several medicines are available to treat relapsing forms of MS. But the FDA hasn't approved any medicines to treat primary-progressive MS. Your healthcare provider may still be able to use 1 of these medicines in your case. But more likely your healthcare provider will try to provide treatments that relieve symptoms and improve your quality of life. These may address problems such as depression, sexual problems, and extreme tiredness (fatigue). Experts don't know how to prevent MS or the PPMS type of MS. Some people limit MS relapses by avoiding specific triggers such as stress and overheating. Physical and occupational therapy may be helpful. For example, therapists may teach you exercise strategies and how to manage new symptoms that develop. Your healthcare provider will also probably want to meet with you on a regular basis to monitor your disease. Regular exercise and getting plenty of sleep may also help. If your body temperature goes up, it may make your symptoms worse for a short time. So it’s best to not do things that could lead to overheating, such as extended periods of time in the sun or overexerting yourself.",85,Relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis,-6.3552565574646,113

Your CNS is composed of your brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves. causes symptoms that gradually get worse, as well as symptoms that come on suddenly after a period of being controlled. This sudden appearance of symptoms is called a . There’s for MS, and the damage it causes can’t be reversed. However, certain medications can help you manage the condition. Condition management focuses on medication that can treat relapses, as well as modify the disease to reduce damage and disability. It also involves other drugs that treat the symptoms or complications of MS. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the following drugs for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS): cladribine (Mavenclad), dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera), diroximel fumarate (Vumerity), fingolimod (Gilenya), monomethyl fumarate (Bafiertam), ozanimod (Zeposia), siponimod (Mayzent), teriflunomide (Aubagio) interferon beta-1a (Avonex, Rebif), interferon beta-1b (Betaseron, Extavia), glatiramer acetate (Copaxone, Glatopa), peginterferon beta-1a (Plegridy) alemtuzumab (Lemtrada), mitoxantrone hydrochloride, natalizumab (Tysabri), ocrelizumab (Ocrevus) There are several types of that work to help change the course of MS. The length of treatment with these medications can range from a few months to years, depending on how effective the medications are for you. Your may recommend switching between these drugs throughout the course of your treatment. This will depend on how effectively each drug manages your disease and how you tolerate the side effects. If you switch to a different DMT, your doctor will take note of whether you develop new . The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved 12 MS medications that are administered by injection or infusion. They help modify relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) and secondary progressive MS (SPMS) in cases of active disease — that is, a relapse has occurred or new lesions have appeared on an MRI scan. They also treat clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), a one-off episode of neurological symptoms. CIS can progress to MS and is sometimes categorized as a type of MS. These drugs are made up of proteins that keep certain from entering your brain and spinal cord. These WBCs are thought to that forms a protective coating over your nerve fibers. Therefore, preventing these WBCs from moving into your brain and spinal cord can help slow their damage and reduce the number of relapses you have. You inject these drugs yourself. Your healthcare provider will show you how to do this. The number of injections depends on the drug: Glatiramer acetate (Copaxone) is a manufactured substance that resembles a basic protein of natural myelin. It’s thought to work by prompting the WBCs to attack the substance instead of the myelin cells. It’s used to treat RRMS and SPMS in cases of active disease — that is, a relapse has occurred or new lesions have appeared on an MRI scan. It can also treat CIS. You inject this drug yourself once per day or three times per week, depending on your dosage. Your healthcare provider will show you how. People who receive injections three times per week should ensure that at least 48 hours elapses between their injections. The FDA has also approved Glatopa, a generic form of Copaxone. Natalizumab (Tysabri) is an antibody that may block damaged T lymphocytes from moving into your brain and spinal cord. It’s used to treat RRMS and SPMS in cases of active disease — that is, a relapse has occurred or new lesions have appeared on an MRI scan. It can also treat CIS. A healthcare provider gives you this drug as an intravenous (IV) infusion. The infusion takes about an hour, and you’ll get it every 4 weeks. Mitoxantrone hydrochloride was originally used to treat cancer. Now it’s also prescribed to treat people with MS. It suppresses the immune system cells that are thought to attack myelin cells. This medication is only available as a generic drug. It’s used to treat SPMS or worsening RRMS in instances where other drugs haven’t worked. It has a high risk of serious side effects, so it’s only appropriate for people with these more severe forms of MS. A healthcare provider gives you this drug as a short IV infusion once every 3 months. The infusion should only take 5 to 15 minutes. Alemtuzumab (Lemtrada) is approved for people with relapsing forms of MS, including RRMS and active SPMS. It’s intended for people who’ve tried at least two other MS medications but found that treatment was unsuccessful or caused intolerable side effects. It works by reducing the number of specific B and T lymphocytes in your body. This action may decrease the inflammation of and damage to nerve cells. Alemtuzumab is given as a 4-hour IV infusion. To start, you receive this drug once per day for 5 days. Then 12 months after your first treatment course, you receive it once per day for 3 more days. Ocrelizumab (Ocrevus) is the newest infusion treatment for MS. It was approved by the FDA in 2017. It’s the first drug used to treat primary progressive MS (PPMS). It’s also used to treat CIS and relapsing forms of MS. Ocrelizumab appears to work by targeting and ultimately reducing the number of B lymphocytes. B lymphocytes are responsible for damage and repair of the myelin sheath. Ocrelizumab is given as an IV infusion. To begin, you’ll receive it in two 300-milligram (mg) infusions, separated by 2 weeks. After that, you’ll receive it in 600-mg infusions every 6 months. You’ll also receive a corticosteroid and an on the day of each infusion to reduce the risk of reaction to the medication. Ofatumumab (Kesimpta) was approved by the FDA in August 2020 and is the newest treatment for MS. It’s used to treat RRMS and SPMS in cases of active disease — that is, a relapse has occurred or new lesions have appeared on an MRI scan. It can also treat CIS. Like ocrelizumab (Ocrevus), it also works by targeting harmful B lymphocytes and reducing their overall number. Ofatumumab is given as an injection once per week for the first 3 weeks. After a 1-week break, the drug is given as a monthly injection. The FDA has approved eight oral medications for the treatment of MS. Fingolimod (Gilenya) comes as an oral capsule that you take once per day. It was the first oral medication approved by the FDA to treat RRMS. It’s also used to treat CIS and active SPMS. Fingolimod causes the damaging WBCs to remain within your lymph nodes. This reduces the chance that they’ll enter your brain or spinal cord and cause damage. Teriflunomide (Aubagio) is an oral tablet that you take once per day. It’s used to treat RRMS and SPMS in cases of active disease — that is, a relapse has occurred or new lesions have appeared on an MRI scan. It can also treat CIS. Teriflunomide works by blocking an enzyme that’s needed by the damaging WBCs. As a result, teriflunomide helps decrease the number of these cells, which reduces the damage they can inflict. Dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera) is an oral capsule that you take twice per day. It’s used to treat RRMS and SPMS in cases of active disease — that is, a relapse has occurred or new lesions have appeared on an MRI scan. It can also treat CIS. It appears to work by interfering with the activity of certain immune system cells and chemicals to reduce the risk of MS relapse. It may also have antioxidant properties that help protect against brain and spinal cord damage. Monomethyl fumarate (Bafiertam) is an oral capsule that you take twice per day. It’s the newest oral drug on the market, having been approved by the FDA in April 2020. It’s used to treat RRMS and SPMS in cases of active disease — that is, a relapse has occurred or new lesions have appeared on an MRI scan. It can also treat CIS. Monomethyl fumarate is a bioequivalent of dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera). Like dimethyl fumarate, monomethyl fumarate may have antioxidant properties and appears to work by interfering with the activity of certain immune system cells and chemicals. Cladribine (Mavenclad) is a pill that you take for a total of 16 or 20 days over the course of 2 years. You’ll have treatment for 2 weeks per year, with each one lasting 4 or 5 days. There’s a 1-month break in between the 2 weeks of treatment. It’s approved for people with relapsing forms of MS, including RRMS and active SPMS. It’s intended for people who’ve tried at least one other MS medication but found that treatment was unsuccessful or caused intolerable side effects. It may work by reducing the number of harmful B and T lymphocytes that you have. Siponimod (Mayzent) is an oral tablet that you take once per day. It’s used to treat RRMS and SPMS in cases of active disease — that is, a relapse has occurred or new lesions have appeared on an MRI scan. It can also treat CIS. It’s believed to work by blocking certain inflammatory cells from leaving your lymph nodes. This action limits the amount of nerve damage that they can inflict. Diroximel fumarate (Vumerity) is an oral capsule that you take twice per day. It’s used to treat RRMS and SPMS in cases of active disease — that is, a relapse has occurred or new lesions have appeared on an MRI scan. It can also treat CIS. Diroximel fumarate has the same active ingredient as dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera), and it works the same way. This means that it may also have antioxidant properties and interfere with the activity of certain immune system cells and chemicals. Ozanimod (Zeposia) is an oral capsule that you take once per day. It’s used to treat RRMS and SPMS in cases of active disease — that is, a relapse has occurred or new lesions have appeared on an MRI scan. It can also treat CIS. It’s believed to work by blocking immune cells from leaving your lymph nodes and entering your CNS. Fingolimod (Gilenya) is currently the only DMT that’s approved by the FDA for use in children. It’s safe for use in people ages 10 years old and up. However, doctors may prescribe other DMTs off label. Off-label drug is when a medication approved by the FDA for one purpose is used for a different purpose that hasn’t been approved. However, a doctor can still use the drug for that purpose. This is because the FDA regulates the testing and approval of drugs, but not how doctors use drugs to treat their patients. So, your doctor can prescribe a drug however they think is best for your care. While many relapses go away on their own, more severe relapses require treatment. Inflammation causes MS relapses, and it’s typically treated with . These drugs can reduce inflammation and help make MS attacks less severe. Corticosteroids used to treat MS include: If corticosteroids don’t work, your doctor may prescribe corticotropin (H.P. Acthar Gel). Corticotropin is an injection, and it’s also known as ACTH gel. It works by prompting the adrenal cortex to secrete the hormones cortisol, corticosterone, and aldosterone. The secretion of these hormones helps to reduce inflammation. Medications to treat MS symptoms and complications Other drugs can be used to treat specific or from MS-related damage. Dalfampridine (Ampyra) is an oral tablet taken twice per day to help improve walking. Dalfampridine works by blocking potassium channels, which form tiny pores in your nerve cells. This action may help damaged nerve cells to better send messages. Improved nerve impulse conduction aids in leg muscle control and strength. A doctor will often give to people with MS who have painful muscle stiffness or muscle spasms. Drugs commonly used to treat these symptoms include: is a common problem for people with MS. For this symptom, your doctor may prescribe a drug such as modafinil (Provigil). They may also prescribe an off-label drug, such as amantadine (Gocovri) and fluoxetine (Prozac). means “bad sensation.” It’s a type of pain that can feel like ongoing burning or itching. It may also feel like wetness, electric shock, or pins and needles. According to a published in Nature Reviews Neurology, some research has shown that people with MS are more likely to be clinically depressed than the general population. Drugs used to treat depression in people with MS include: Constipation is another common complication of MS. Your doctor may recommend with one of the following : Bladder dysfunction is also a common complication of MS. Symptoms may include frequent urination, , or hesitancy in starting urination. You may also experience frequent (nighttime urination). Both men and women with MS tend to have higher rates of sexual dysfunction than the general population, according to an from 2016. that may be prescribed to help treat include: Older drugs that must be injected directly into the penis are also available. These drugs aren’t used as much now that oral drugs are available. They include alprostadil (Caverject). A drug that may be used off label for this purpose is the blood pressure medication papaverine. People with a vagina or clitoris may experience problems such as reduced feeling or . There are no drugs currently available to treat these problems. However, for vaginal dryness, you can use water-soluble personal lubricants available over the counter. Many different types of drugs are available to help you manage MS. The type of drugs that may be best for you depend on the type of MS you have and the symptoms you experience. You may not be able to access all of these medications. Ask your doctor to confirm which drugs are currently on the market in your area and which ones might be most appropriate for you. Speaking with your doctor is especially important if you’re pregnant or planning to become pregnant. Work with your doctor to to manage your MS symptoms and help prevent further damage from the disease. Sticking to your treatment plan can help you feel better and slow the progression of your condition. — — MS Treatment Chart: Comparing Disease-Modifying Therapies Oral vs. Injectable MS Treatments: What’s the Difference?

a925962c-b7f3-474b-b5fb-6c8c1822b6d1,"Multiple sclerosis is an in which activated invade the and cause , , and tissue damage. The underlying cause is currently unknown. Current research in , , , and , together with , provide support for the notion that MS is not a single disease but rather a spectrum. There are three : , characterized by periods of neurological worsening following by remissions; , in which there is gradual progression of neurological dysfunction with fewer or no relapses; and , in which neurological deterioration is observed from onset. is a convergence of pathology with physiology. Pathology is the medical discipline that describes conditions typically observed during a disease state; whereas physiology is the biological discipline that describes processes or mechanisms operating within an organism. Referring to MS, the physiology refers to the different processes that lead to the development of the lesions and the pathology refers to the condition associated with the lesions. Multiple sclerosis can be pathologically defined as the presence of distributed (or ) in the disseminated in time (DIT) and space (DIS). The gold standard for MS diagnosis is pathological correlation, though given its limited availability, other diagnosis methods are normally used. The scleroses that define the disease are the remainders of previous demyelinating lesions in the CNS white matter of a patient () showing special characteristics, such as confluent instead of perivenous demyelination. There are two phases for how an unknown underlying condition may cause damage in MS: An unknown soluble factor (produced by CD8+ T-cells or CD20+ B-cells), creates a toxic environment that activates microglia. with hidden damage appear in the brain and spine (). Some clusters of activated , axonal transection and myelin degeneration are present. appear and immune cells infiltrate, causing . and axon destruction. Multiple sclerosis differs from other in its confluent cortical lesions. These types of lesions are the most specific finding for MS, being exclusively present in MS patients, though currently they can only be detected at autopsy. Most MS findings take place inside the white matter, and lesions appear mainly in a periventricular distribution (clustered around the ventricles of the brain). Apart from demyelination, the and deep (GM) nuclei can be affected, together with diffuse injury of the NAWM. GM atrophy is independent of classical MS lesions and is associated with physical disability, fatigue, and cognitive impairment in MS At least five characteristics are present in CNS tissues of MS patients: beyond classical white matter lesions, production with , an environment fostering immune cell persistence, and a disruption of the outside of active lesions. The that give the name to the condition are produced by healing old lesions. MS is active even during remission periods. -like aggregates in the are formed only in secondary progressive MS. and correlate with the degree of subpial cortical demyelination and brain atrophy, suggesting that they might contribute to cortical pathology in SPMS These follicles are composed mainly of infected B-cells. Four different damage patterns have been identified in patient's brain tissues. The original report suggests that there may be several types of MS with different immune causes, and that MS may be a family of several diseases. Though originally a biopsy was required to classify the lesions of a patient, since 2012 it is possible to classify them by a blood test looking for antibodies against 7 lipids, three of which are cholesterol derivatives are believed to both impair myelin repair and aggravate inflammation. It is believed that they may correlate with differences in disease type and prognosis, and perhaps with different responses to treatment. In any case, understanding lesion patterns can provide information about differences in disease between individuals and enable doctors to make more effective treatment decisions. According to one of the researchers involved in the original research, ""Two patterns (I and II) showed close similarities to T-cell-mediated or T-cell plus antibody-mediated autoimmune encephalomyelitis, respectively. The other patterns (III and IV) were highly suggestive of a primary oligodendrocyte dystrophy, reminiscent of virus- or toxin-induced demyelination rather than autoimmunity."" The scar presents and around blood vessels, with preservation of , but no signs of activation. The scar presents T-cells and macrophages around blood vessels, with preservation of oligodendrocytes, as before, but also signs of activation can be found. This pattern has been considered similar to damage seen in NMO, though AQP4 damage does not appear in pattern II MS lesions Nevertheless, pattern II has been reported to respond to , which points to something pathogenic into the blood serum. The infiltration in these cases convert this pattern into a candidate for research into autoimmune connections like anti-, anti- or About the last possibility, research has found antiMOG antibodies in some pattern-II MS patients. Pattern II pathogenic T cells has been shown to be different from others The functional characterization shows that T cells releasing Th2 cytokines and helping B cells dominate the T-cell infiltrate in pattern II brain lesions. The scars are diffuse with inflammation, distal , activation and loss of (MAG). It is considered atypical and an overlap between MS and . The scars do not surround the blood vessels, and a rim of preserved myelin appears around the vessels. There is evidence of partial remyelinization and oligodendrocyte apoptosis. At first, some researchers thought it was an early stage of the evolution of the other patterns. Recently, it is thought that it represents ischaemia-like injury with absence of oligoclonal bands in the CSF, related to the pathogenesis of . The scar presents sharp borders and degeneration, with a rim of normal-appearing . There is a lack of oligodendrocytes in the center of the scar. There is no complement activation or MAG loss. These differences are noticeable only in early lesions and the heterogeneity was controversial for some time because some research groups thought that these four patterns could be a consequence of the age of the lesions. Nevertheless, after some debate among research groups, the four patterns model is accepted and the exceptional case found by Prineas has been classified as NMO For some investigation teams this means that MS is an immunopathogenetically heterogeneous disease. The latter hypothesis is further corroborated by a recent study that demonstrated significant differences in routine cerebrospinal fluid findings between patients with pattern I lesions and patients with non-pattern I lesions, including a lack of CSF-restricted oligoclonal bands, in most pattern II and III patients. Finally, some previously diagnosed with pattern II MS were later found to have in fact MOG-IgG-related encephalomyelitis, suggesting that both the current clinicoradiological diagnostic criteria for MS and the histopathological criteria for MS may be insufficiently specific. This was already indicated by previous studies that found a relatively high rate of false diagnoses of MS among patients with AQP4-IgG-positive neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders or MOG encephalomyelitis. Currently antibodies to and in sera, detected by , can be used as markers of the pathological subtype given by brain biopsy. Another development in this area is the finding that some lesions present defects that could distinguish types of lesions. In multiple sclerosis, inflammation, demyelination, and neurodegeneration are observed together. Some clinical trials have shown that the inflammation produces both the relapses and the demyelination, and that neurodegeneration (axonal transection) is independent from inflammation, produces the accumulative disability, and advances even when inflammation and demyelination are delayed. It seems that neurodegeneration is produced by damaged , which in turn comes from activated . Currently it is unknown what the primary cause of MS is; if MS is a heterogeneous disease, the lesion development process would not be unique. In particular, some PPMS patients having a special clinical course named could have a special genetic cause and a different development process. Several types of damage appear in the brain: and characteristic . Changes in NAWM include axonal injury without demyelination, low-grade inflammation, and microglial and astrocytic activation Illustration of the four different types of glial cells found in the central nervous system: ependymal cells, astrocytes, microglial cells, and oligodendrocytes MS lesions develop inside NAWM areas. Their shape is influenced by their activity The most accepted sequence of events is first NAWM appearance, then the so-called pre-active lesions, with activated microglia, and finally the BBB breakdown, which enables the entry of T-cells to the CNS. This marks the beginning of an autoimmune attack which destroys myelin in active lesions. When the attack is resolved, a characteristic is formed by astrocytes. Current models can be divided into two categories: and . In the former, it is hypothesized that a problem in CNS cells produces an immune response that destroys myelin and subsequently breaks the BBB. In latter, an external factor produces BBB leaks, enters the CNS, and destroys myelin and axons. Whatever the underlying condition for MS is, it appears that damage is triggered by an unknown soluble factor in the CSF, potentially produced in meningeal areas; this factor can diffuse into the cortical parenchyma and destroy myelin either directly or indirectly through microglia activation. The evolution of a preactive lesion is related to reactivity. Increased expression of pro-inflammatory cell surface markers have been observed in NAWM and ""initial"" lesions, corresponding to a so-called loss of homeostatic microglial equilibrium. Some authors report active lesion formation before BBB breakdown; others point to as a factor of the breakdown. MS lesions are driven mainly by . It has been found recently that B-cells are also involved. The () is a protective barrier that denies the entrance of foreign material into the nervous system. BBB disruption is the moment in which penetration of the barrier by lymphocytes occur and has been considered one of the early problems in MS lesions. The BBB is composed of which line the walls of the central nervous system. Compared to normal endothelial cells, the cells lining the BBB are connected by and which form in order to create a barrier to keep out larger molecules such as proteins. In order to pass through, molecules must be taken in by or an alteration in the BBB permeability must occur, such as interactions with associated like ZO-1, ZO-2 and ZO-3. The BBB is compromised due to active recruitment of lymphocytes and monocytes and their migration across the barrier. Release of allow for the activation of on the lymphocytes and monocytes, resulting in an interaction with the endothelial cells of the BBB which then activate the expression of to degrade the barrier. This results in disruption of the BBB, causing an increase in barrier permeability due to the degradation of tight junctions which maintain barrier integrity. Inducing the formation of tight junctions can restore BBB integrity and reduces its permeability, which can be used to reduce the damage caused by lymphocyte and monocyte migration across the barrier as restored integrity would restrict their movement. After barrier breakdown symptoms may appear, such as . Activation of and lymphocytes and their migration across the barrier may result in direct attacks on myelin sheaths within the central nervous system, leading to the characteristic demyelination event observed in MS. After demyelination has occurred, the degraded myelin sheath components, such as and , are then used as identifying factors to facilitate further immune activity upon myelin sheaths. Further activation of cytokines is also induced by macrophage and lymphocyte activity, promoting inflammatory activity as well continued activation of such as matrix metalloproteinases, which have detrimental effect on BBB integrity. Recently it has been found that BBB damage happens even in non-enhancing lesions. MS has an important vascular component. Postmortem studies of the BBB, especially the vascular endothelium, show immunological abnormalities. Microvessels in periplaque areas coexpressed HLA-DR and VCAM-1, some others HLA-DR and urokinase plasminogen activator receptor, and others HLA-DR and ICAM-1. The damaged white matter is known as ""Normal-appearing white matter"" (NAWM) and is where lesions appear. These lesions form in NAWM before blood–brain barrier breakdown. BBB can be broken centripetally (the most normal) or centrifugally. Several possible biochemical disrupters were proposed. Some hypotheses about how the BBB is compromised revolve around the presence of compounds in the blood that could interact with vessels only in the NAWM areas. The permeability of two , and , may be involved in BBB breakdown. Breakdown is responsible for infiltration and inflammation in the brain. Monocyte migration and -mediated attachment to brain microvascular endothelia is regulated by through . Using iron nanoparticles, involvement of macrophages in BBB breakdown can be detected. A special role is played by . These increase BBB T-cell permeability, specially in the case of MMP-9 and are supposedly related to the mechanism of action of interferons. Whether BBB dysfunction is the cause or the consequence of MS is disputed, because activated T-Cells can cross a healthy BBB when they express adhesion proteins. Apart from that, activated T-Cells can cross a healthy BBB when they express adhesion proteins. (Adhesion molecules could also play a role in inflammation) In particular, one of these adhesion proteins involved is (Activated Leukocyte Cell Adhesion Molecule, also called ), and is under study as therapeutic target. Another protein involved is , which is found also in brain biopsies of inflammatory elements, and which could be related to the behavior of under therapy. Some molecular biochemical models for relapses have been proposed. Normally, gadolinium enhancement is used to show BBB disruption on MRIs. Abnormal tight junctions are present in both SPMS and PPMS. They appear in active white matter lesions and in gray matter in SPMS. They persist in inactive lesions, particularly in PPMS. A deficiency was implicated in this process. Uric acid added in physiological concentrations (i.e. achieving normal concentrations) is therapeutic in MS by preventing BBB breakdown through inactivation of . The low level of uric acid found in MS victims is manifestedly causative rather than a tissue damage consequence in the white matter lesions, but not in the grey matter lesions. Uric acid levels are lower during relapses. It is not known what causes MS. Several problems appear together with the white matter lesions, like cortical lesions and normal-appearing tissues. Several theories have been proposed to explain it. Some areas that appear normal under normal MRI look abnormal under special MRI, like magnetisation transfer MTR-MRI. These are called Normal Appearing White Matter (NAWM) and Normal Appearing Grey Matter (NAGM). The cause why the normal appearing areas appear in the brain is unknown, but seems clear that they appear mainly in the ventricles and that they predict the course of the disease. Given that MS lesions begin inside the NAWM areas, these areas are expected to be produced by the same underlying condition that produces the lesions, and therefore the ultimate MS underlying condition, whatever it is. Historically, several theories about how these areas appear have been presented: The search for an auto-antigen has taken a long time, but at least there is one reported. It is the enzyme This theory in part could also explain why some patients report amelioration under dietary treatment. (HERVs) have been reported in MS for several years. In fact, one of the families, was first discovered while studying MS patients. Recent research as of 2019 point to one of the HERV-W viruses (pHEV-W), and specifically one of the proteins of the that has been found to activate in vitro. Activated microglia in turn produces demyelination. Some interactions between the and the HERVs could be the trigger of the MS microglia reactions. Supporting this study, a against the viral capside () has shown good results in trials in phase IIb. Venous pathology has been associated with MS for more than a century. Pathologist noted in 1863 that the inflammation-associated lesions were distributed around veins. Some other authors like pointed to venous obstructions. Mechanical flow: Later the focus moved to softer hemodynamic abnormalities, which were showing precede changes in sub-cortical gray matter and in substantia nigra. However, such reports of a ""hemodynamic cause of MS"" are not universal, and possibly not even common. At this time the evidence is largely anecdotal and some MS patients have no blood flow issues. Possibly vascular problems may be an aggravating factor, like many others in MS. Indeed, the research, by demonstrating patients with no hemodynamic problems actually prove that this is not the only cause of MS. Endothelium: Other theories point to a possible primary endothelial dysfunction. The importance of vascular misbehaviour in MS pathogenesis has also been independently confirmed by seven-tesla . It is reported that a number of studies have provided evidence of vascular occlusion in MS, which suggest the possibility of a primary vascular injury in MS lesions or at least that they are occasionally correlated. Venous insufficiency: Some morphologically special medullar lesions (wedge-shaped) have also been linked to venous insufficiency. BBB infection: It has also been pointed out that some infectious agents with positive correlation to MS, specially , can cause problems in veins and arteries walls CCSVI: The term ""chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency"" was coined in 2008 by Paolo Zamboni, who described it in patients with multiple sclerosis. Instead of intracranial venous problems he described extracranial blockages, and he stated that the location of those obstructions seemed to influence the clinical course of the disease. According to Zamboni, CCSVI had a high differentiating healthy individuals from those with . Zamboni's results were criticized as some of his studies were not blinded and they need to be verified by further studies. As of 2010 the theory is considered at least defensible A more detailed evidence of a correlation between the place and type of venous malformations imaged and the reported symptoms of multiple sclerosis in the same patients was published in 2010. Haemodynamic problems have been found in the blood flow of MS patients using Doppler, initially using (TCCS), pointing to a relationship with a vascular disease called (CCSVI). In 2010 there were conflicting results when evaluating the relationship between MS and CCSVI. but is important to note that positives have appeared among the blinded studies. CSF flow: Other theories focus in the possible role of flow impairment. This theory could be partially consistent with the previous one. Currently a small trial with 8 participants has been performed Whatever the underlying primary condition is, it is expected to be a soluble factor in the CSF, maybe an unknown or , or a combination of them. Also B-cells and microglia could be involved. In particular, it is known that B-cells of MS patients secrete an unknown toxin against oligodendrocytes It has been reported several times that CSF of some MS patients can damage myelin in culture and mice and have been recently brought into the stage. Whatever the problem is, it produces of neurons respecting astrocytes In 2012 it was reported that a subset of MS patients have a seropositive anti- status, which can represent up to a 47% of the MS cases, and the study has been reproduced by at least two other groups. In 2016 a similar association was reported for anti--2 If the existence of any of these subsets of MS is confirmed, the situation would be similar to what happened for Devic Disease and . MS could be considered a or a new medical entity will be defined for these cases. Some authors propose a primary neurodegenerative factor. Maybe the strongest argument supporting this theory comes from the comparison with NMO. Though autoimmune demyelination is strong, axons are preserved, showing that the standard model of a primary demyelination cannot be hold. The theory of the trans-synaptic degeneration, is compatible with other models based in the CSF biochemistry. Others propose an oligodendrocyte stress as primary dysfunction, which activates microglia creating the NAWM areas and others propose a yet-unknown intrinsic CNS trigger induces the microglial activation and clustering, which they point out could be again axonal injury or oligodendrocyte stress. Finally, other authors point to a cortical pathology which starts in the brain external layer () and progresses extending into the brain inner layers If as expected MS is an heterogeneous disease and the lesion development process would not be unique. In particular, some PPMS patients have been found to have a special genetic variant named which would behave differently from what here is explained. It is due to a mutation inside the , an to mutation in the position p.Arg415Gln, in an area that codifies the . Several for diagnosis, disease evolution and response to medication (current or expected) are under research. While most of them are still under research, there are some of them already well stablished: : They present proteins that are in the CNS or in blood. Those that are in CNS but not in blood suggest a diagnosis of MS. A polyspecific antiviral immune response against the viruses of , and found in 1992. In some reports the MRZR showed a lower sensitivity than OCB (70% vs. 100%), but a higher specificity (69% vs. 92%) for MS. (FLC). Several authors have reported that they are comparable or even better than oligoclonal bands. Golan, Daniel; Staun-Ram, Elsebeth; Miller, Ariel (2016). ""Shifting paradigms in multiple sclerosis"". .

cab3d81b-683b-4ad2-95c4-00c2b349450f,"How to S.E.A.R.C.H.™ for the Right MS Therapy for You! Once a DMT is initiated, evidence suggests that treatment needs to be ongoing for benefits to persist. Non-adherence and gaps in treatment have been associated with an increased rate of relapses and progression of disability. Rather than discontinuing the medication, it is essential for individuals to talk with their doctor about recent changes in their MS and explore options to make adjustments with their current medication or switch to another DMT. The SEARCH model can be helpful in recalculating a treatment decision. MSAA also recognizes that adhering to an MS medication can present certain challenges over time, which may cause people to limit or discontinue prescribed usage. Fortunately, many of these challenges can be managed to help keep you on course with your therapy. Some helpful strategies include: Each of the approved treatments has side effects that are usually manageable. Initial side effects to some of the DMTs include headache and flu-like symptoms. These often dissipate after several weeks and can be easily managed with over-the-counter medications. Individuals using injectable medications can manage pain or skin reactions at the injection site by icing the area, rotating injection sites, taking over-the-counter pain relievers, and using an auto injector. For individuals taking an oral medication, common side effects include headache, nausea, and diarrhea. These are usually mild, dissipate over time, and can often be managed by taking over-the-counter medications, as prescribed by your doctor. Taking an oral DMT while having a full stomach may also assist with reducing side effects, if advised by your doctor. Individuals must allow six months to one year for their prescribed medication to have an effect on their disease course. This also necessitates that patients are taking their medication as prescribed on a consistent basis and not skipping or altering doses. People often think that in order for the medication to be working they must “see” results. In fact, the opposite is true for MS. It is important to realize that if patients are not seeing an increase in relapses and/or not experiencing additional symptoms, then, most likely, their DMT is effectively treating their MS. However, individuals need to consult their neurologist and/or healthcare team to help determine the success of their current long-term treatment. Even with the best intentions, people can forget to take their medication. A few simple suggestions to help remember include setting a schedule and abiding to it as much as possible, utilizing memory aids such as print and electronic calendars and reminder notes, recording your dosage in a journal or mobile phone app such as , and involving family members in the treatment plan. In addition to forgetfulness, fear or anxiety related to injections has often been a concern shared by the MS community. Receiving proper training from a healthcare professional on administering the injection and using an auto injector are effective strategies in building self-confidence and reducing fear. The effectiveness of any disease-modifying therapy for MS can vary greatly from person-to-person and even change within the same individual as the disease progresses over time. All DMT’s have potential risks and some of the newer therapies require tests before and during treatment to help determine if the medication would be considered an appropriate option for the individual, and whether or not he or she can manage the potential side effects. It is important for individuals with MS to work together with their neurologist to explore new treatment options and remain committed to finding a therapy that works for them. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurological disorder affecting the nerves of the , which consists of the brain, optic nerves, and spinal cord. Most individuals with MS experience their first symptoms as a young adult and are often diagnosed in the prime of their life. Although MS is not contagious, a cause and cure have yet to be discovered. As discussed later in this booklet, several effective treatment choices are available for most individuals with MS to help reduce disease activity. Caucasians have the greatest incidence of MS and about three times as many women are diagnosed with MS than men. MS does not usually occur with populations living in warm areas near the equator; in general, the further people live from the equator (north or south), the greater their risk of developing the disease. With MS, nerve fibers (or ““) and their fatty-rich protective covering (known as ““) become damaged. As a result, nerve impulses along these nerve fibers are interrupted; causing the symptoms of MS. MS is believed to be an , where the body’s own immune system is sending disease-fighting cells to destroy specific elements within the body. Examples of other autoimmune diseases include lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. The symptoms of MS include a wide range of physical, mental, and emotional difficulties. Examples include: visual problems, spasticity (spasms and tightening of muscles), weakness, tremor, numbness, and dizziness; bladder, bowel, and sexual dysfunction; mobility issues; chronic, aching pain; fatigue, depression, and memory problems. On average, 80 percent of people with MS begin with the . This type of MS has temporary symptom flare-ups or “relapses” (also referred to as exacerbations, attacks, or bouts), which may last from a few days to a few months. These are followed by a complete or partial recovery (““). Women are more likely to be diagnosed with RRMS than men. Between relapses, many people may go into remission for a year or more. During this time, they may remain symptom-free, or only experience mild changes with symptoms that did not fully remit following the exacerbation. This remission can be deceptive, however, because of the aspect of MS. While symptoms may not appear or worsen between MS attacks, changes do continue within the CNS. (areas of inflammation along the nerves in the brain and spinal cord) can flare up within the CNS at least 10 times as often as clinical attacks (those with visible symptoms). If untreated, more than 90 percent of individuals with RRMS may eventually enter a second phase of RRMS, known as , within 25 years of their diagnosis. This phase is reached when an individual experiences a progressive worsening of symptoms. SPMS may occur with or without superimposed relapses. While approximately 80 percent of individuals with MS are initially diagnosed with RRMS, the majority of the other 20 percent are diagnosed with . This form of MS presents a gradual but steady accumulation of neurological problems from the onset, without the presence of relapses and remissions. Unlike RRMS, PPMS is equally divided between the genders. Other types of MS exist, but these are not as common. These include (with little or no change after 20 years), (PRMS) (a progressive course from the onset with acute relapses), and or (a rapidly progressive disease course). What drugs are approved for the long-term treatment of MS? At the time of this publication, have been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), each shown to help slow disease activity for individuals with relapsing forms of MS. Since inflammation appears to be a major component in the relapsing forms of MS, these treatments are believed to reduce the inflammation within the CNS, thereby reducing the number and severity of active lesions (and also reducing the number of clinically silent flare-ups). Other immunological changes are also thought to occur with these disease-modifying therapies (DMTs). Many experts now recommend treatment as early as possible with one of these approved DMTs. Research has shown that treating after the first attack can significantly delay the amount of time to the second attack. Early treatment is also thought to possibly limit axonal (nerve) injury, which may be irreversible, and later lead to a progressive form of MS. The 13 FDA-approved, long-term disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) for MS (as of the printing of this booklet) are listed on pages 8 through 11. An individual with MS is usually prescribed only one of these medications during any one time period, although trials with combinations of these treatments are being conducted. When switching from one therapy to another, doctors will often allow time between treatments for the former medication to be completely out of one’s system. This is known as a “wash-out” period. Results from several large clinical trials have found that all of these medications reduce the number and severity of relapses, as well as the development of new areas of inflammation as seen on MRI. These studies also showed some evidence of delaying disease progression. Similar to most any medication, these DMTs are accompanied by certain side effects and/or adverse events, most of which may be managed or avoided through various precautionary actions. For instance, the interferons may cause flu-like symptoms and injection-site reactions, especially when first starting the such as smaller needles and gradually increasing from a small dose to the full dose (dose titration), can greatly help to avoid the potential side effects mentioned. Liver function is also monitored while taking an interferon. Injection-site reactions can occur with Copaxone, and for a small percentage of patients, a brief systemic reaction (such as flushing, dizziness, palpations, and/or shortness of breath) may occur following an injection. Novantrone poses additional risks to the heart and for developing leukemia. For this reason, this medication is typically reserved for severe cases of MS that are not responding to any of the other DMTs. To avoid these adverse events, Novantrone may not be taken for more than two to three years. Approximately 0.1 percent (or one in one thousand) of patients taking Tysabri develop a condition known as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), which is a potentially fatal brain infection with the JC virus (JCV), in people with weakened immune systems. About 55 percent of individuals with MS have this virus, which normally stays dormant, unless a suppressed immune system allows it to become activated. New guidelines to minimize the risk have been identified, and safety monitoring programs have been put in place for early detection and treatment, as well as to track any occurrences of this condition. A new blood test shows if a person has been exposed to the JC virus and if he or she could be at risk of developing PML if taking Tysabri. Gilenya may cause certain heart-related issues when first starting the medication. For this reason, patients are screened in advance for heart problems and are monitored during the first six to 24 hours following the initial treatment at a treatment center. Please note that all of these MS medications have been approved by the FDA. This agency has determined that the benefits of these medications outweigh any risks – many of which are rare. Other side effects (not listed in this booklet) may occur with these drugs. For more information on potential benefits and risks, individuals are advised to speak with their physician.

ad5e5205-0d29-4515-9eed-e48e264add58,"Cladribine treatment of multiple sclerosis is associated with depletion of memory B cells Cladribine treatment of multiple sclerosis is associated with depletion of memory B cells   , , –() The mechanism of action of oral cladribine, recently licensed for relapsing multiple sclerosis, is unknown. To determine whether cladribine depletes memory B cells consistent with our recent hypothesis that effective, disease-modifying treatments act by physical/functional depletion of memory B cells. A cross-sectional study examined 40 people with multiple sclerosis at the end of the first cycle of alemtuzumab or injectable cladribine. The relative proportions and absolute numbers of peripheral blood B lymphocyte subsets were measured using flow cytometry. Cell-subtype expression of genes involved in cladribine metabolism was examined from data in public repositories. Cladribine markedly depleted class-switched and unswitched memory B cells to levels comparable with alemtuzumab, but without the associated initial lymphopenia. CD3 T cell depletion was modest. The mRNA expression of metabolism genes varied between lymphocyte subsets. A high ratio of deoxycytidine kinase to group I cytosolic 5′ nucleotidase expression was present in B cells and was particularly high in mature, memory and notably germinal centre B cells, but not plasma cells. Selective B cell cytotoxicity coupled with slow repopulation kinetics results in long-term, memory B cell depletion by cladribine. These may offer a new target, possibly with potential biomarker activity, for future drug development. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic-inflammatory disorder of the central nervous system leading to accumulating disability. Historically, myelin-directed, CD4, Th17 cells have been considered to be the important mediators of the inflammatory process []. This is largely based on animal experimental autoimmune encephalitis models where T cell-mediated responses are key to pathogenesis []. However, suppression of CD4, Th17 cells has only produced modest benefits in clinical trials in MS [, ]. Therefore, other mechanisms may play a crucial role in the disease process. Whilst animal models and in vitro studies in MS provide circumstantial evidence for the involvement of particular pathways, positive and properly conducted, negative trials provide invaluable information for understanding the cellular mechanisms that drive disease activity. Alemtuzumab, a CD52, T and B cell depleting antibody [], ocrelizumab, a CD20-B cell depleting antibody [] and cladribine, a lymphocyte depleting agent [], are immune-reconstitution therapies that are amongst the most efficacious treatments for MS and can provide long-term benefit from few treatment cycles [, , ]. However, there is no clear consensus on their mode of action, particularly for cladribine [, ]. It is well known that lymphocytes produce many secreted proteins, rapidly proliferate in response to infections and rely on both de novo and importantly salvage pathways for nucleotide synthesis. To accommodate this requirement, lymphocytes express high levels of adenosine deaminase (ADA) protein [, ]. This prevents the accumulation of cytotoxic levels of deoxyadenosine triphosphate, by catalysing the deamination of adenosines to inosines []. Cladribine is a chlorinated analogue of deoxyadenosine that is partially resistant to ADA [, ]. This is phosphorylated by deoxycytidine kinase (DCK) to create lymphocyte cytotoxicity []. This action is countered by cytosolic 5′ nucleotidase (5′NT) enzymatic activity that dephosphorylates phosphorylated-cladribine. Lymphocytes and lymphocytic cancers, including hairy cell leukaemia for which parenteral cladribine is licensed, have a high DCK-to-5′NT ratio relative to other cell types and are susceptible to cladribine-induced cytotoxicity []. An oral-cladribine prodrug was shown to be very effective at controlling relapsing MS [, ]. This was first licensed in 2011, but was later withdrawn when regulators requested more studies to address issues related to severe lymphopenia (25.6% ( = 110/430) grade 3/4 found in year 2) and cancer seen in the pivotal trial [, ]. However, we demonstrated that the short-term cancer risk of oral cladribine was no greater than for any of the licensed disease modifying treatments (DMT) [], and instigated a compassionate-use programme using generic, subcutaneous cladribine that was dose-adapted to limit severe lymphopenia []. This and probably the licensing of alemtuzumab, which induces significantly more lymphopenia and side-effects than cladribine [, , ], prompted re-submission of cladribine tablets to the regulators. These were licensed in Europe for the treatment of relapsing MS []. Although, cladribine is considered to be a T and B cell inhibitor, emphasis has been placed on T cell inhibition as a mechanism of action [, ]. However, immunophenotyping data demonstrated that effective doses of oral cladribine induced only about a 20–30% depletion of CD8 T cells and about a 40–45% depletion of CD4 T cells within 12 months that was reflected by comparable memory T cell depletion, but induced marked (80–85%) CD19 B cell depletion []. Alemtuzumab induced a similar, but more transient depletion, of CD19 B cells [] again focussing attention towards the long-term depletion of T cells as a mechanism of action []. However, analysis of CD19 subpopulations in alemtuzumab-treated people with MS (PwMS) demonstrated that it was a composite response of enhanced immature and mature B cell hyper-repopulation that masked a substantial and sustained depletion of memory B cells []. Importantly, we identified that memory B cells were depleted by all DMT that inhibit MS, in a manner reflecting their efficacy in controlling relapsing MS [, ]. We therefore hypothesised that given the high efficacy of cladribine [, ], it too would deplete memory B cells and that public gene expression databases would contain data on purine salvage pathways genes that may explain its mechanism of action. The study was approved by the Health and Social Care Research Ethics Committee B and the Health Research Authority, UK. People were recruited following informed consent. Purchased blood samples were collected with informed consent and did not require additional ethical review. Participants (Supplementary Table S1) were diagnosed with MS based on the revised McDonald criteria. Subjects provided demographic details and drug history at the time of informed consent and completed an online Extended Disability Status Scale (EDSS) (). Inclusion criteria are diagnosis of MS; aged 18–65 years and either on alemtuzumab or cladribine therapy or drug-naive (MS controls) undergoing investigations to start treatment. Healthy control volunteers also provided blood samples with informed consent. People were excluded if they could not give valid consent or comply with the study requirements. PwMS were treated with 12 mg/day alemtuzumab for 5 days at month 1 and 12 mg/day for 3 days at month 13 []. Subcutaneous cladribine was used off-label on compassionate grounds. This consisted of 3 × 10 mg adjusted for weight (4 × 10 mg if > 90 kg) at month 0 and repeated 4 weeks later and further dose-adjusted from 0 to 4, 10 mg doses depending on subject weight and level of lymphopenia with > 1.0 × 10 cells/L receiving three doses, 0.8 to  < 1.0 × 10 cells/L receiving two doses; 0.5 to  < 0.8 × 10 cells/L receiving one dose and those with < 0.5 × 10 cells/L receiving no additional doses []. A cross-sectional study was performed on PwMS attending the Royal London Hospital, for routine blood monitoring as part of their standard of care. Samples were collected from healthy controls; drug-naïve PwMS and PwMS at their end of year blood test, prior to their second cycle of treatment. The level of lymphopenia was assessed via standard haematology laboratory measures. One 1-year data was extracted from the pivotal CLARITY dataset of oral cladribine [4–5 daily dosing of 10–20 mg tablets (4–8 mg/day generic cladribine equivalent) week 1 and 5] of the group that were immunophenotyped ( = 309) supplied by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) under a Freedom of Information request []. The data from the 3.5 and 5.25 mg/kg groups [] were merged as they had both received identical dosing up to 9 weeks. Analysis was restricted to data, where baseline 5- and 9-week data were all available. This was compared and contrasted with anonymous audits of people treated with subcutaneous, generic cladribine (3–4, 10 mg subcutaneous cladribine) doses at week 1 and week 5 or 5 daily 12-mg doses of alemtuzumab. The nadir at week 4 or 9 was selected for cladribine and the depletion at week 5 was analysed for alemtuzumab. The grade of lymphopenia was based on standardised definitions of the Common Terminology Criteria for adverse events V4, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda. Differences in the frequency of severe lymphopenic events were estimated using Chi-squared analysis. Anonymised heparinised venous blood samples were collected and cells were labelled for 1 h with mouse anti-human antibody–fluorophore conjugates: CD3-PE (T cells), CD10-PECy7, CD19-PECy5, CD25-BV421, CD27-BV205, CD38-APC, IgD-BB515 and IgG1k-BV421 isotype (Becton-Dickinson, Oxford, UK) and cells were analysed by flow cytometry. Memory B cells were identified as CD19/CD27 lymphocytes. The presence of class-switched (CD19/CD27/IgD), unswitched (CD19/CD27/IgD) and interleukin-2 receptor expressing (CD19/CD25/CD27) memory B cell subsets was assessed. The number of immature (CD10/CD19/CD27/CD38); naïve/mature (CD10/CD19/CD27/CD38) and plasmablasts (CD19/CD27/CD38) were estimated. The absolute number of cell subsets was calculated based on automated full blood counts (Sysmex XE-2100, Kobe). Anonymised healthy donor blood samples were purchased from Cambridge Bioscience UK and mononuclear cells extracted. These were incubated with various concentrations of cladribine with or without 250 μM deoxycytidine to neutralise DCK activity []. Cells were stained with CD3-PE, CD19-PECy5 and CD27-BV205, Annexin V (Invitrogen, Loughborough, UK) and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) to detect live (Annexin V−, DAPI−), early (Annexin V+ , DAPI−) and late stage (Annexin V+, DAPI+) apoptosis. Cells were analysed using flow cytometry. Gene expression of T cell and notably B cell subsets of , and -related genes were identified through searches in public databases: at the Human Protein Atlas for immunohistology (, []) and Microarray and RNA data at BioGPS (, []) and the Gene Expression Omnibus at the National Center for Biotechnology Information, Bethesda, USA (, GEO profiles/DATA sets). Sample size calculations were based on data within the CARE-MS I alemtuzumab trial data set [], with 80% power to detect an 80% memory B cell depletion, comparable with the 12-month alemtuzumab depletion data [], at the  = 0.05 ( = 4/arm) and  = 0.01 ( = 8/arm) levels. Relative proportions of B populations and live/apoptotic cells were determined using FlowJo 8 (FlowJo, Ashland, USA) software. Analysis of variance with Bonferroni post hoc test or Kruskal–Wallis analysis of variance with a Dunn’s post hoc test was performed using Sigmaplot software. Analysis of the in vitro effect of cladribine demonstrated that healthy human lymphocytes were dose-dependently killed by cladribine (Fig. a). This occurred by apoptosis and was blocked by excess deoxycytidine (Fig. b), supporting DCK as a major mediator of the cytotoxic effect. Memory B cells were sensitive to cladribine, similar to T cells (Fig. a), at concentrations achievable in plasma in humans []. However, as anticipated, without additional activating stimuli, B cells rapidly died in culture even in the absence of cladribine, limiting detection of any possible influence for different immune subsets. Therefore, we examined the in vivo response to cladribine in MS. Cladribine induces limited severe lymphopenia compared to alemtuzumab Our dose-adapted, subcutaneous cladribine induced a low (1.8%.  = 1/57) incidence of severe (grade 3/4) lymphopenia during the first cycle of treatment (Table ). This was marginally lower than the 6.2% ( = 12/194) found in the immunophenotyping dataset of people taking oral cladribine (Table ). Importantly the incidence of severe lymphopenia induced by subcutaneous cladribine was significantly ( < 0.0001) lower than the marked (84.1%,  = 106/126) lymphopenia induced by the first cycle of alemtuzumab treatment (Table ). However, there was lymphocyte recovery towards the end of year 1 (Fig. ). Cladribine depletes peripheral blood memory B cells Although serial analysis of B memory cell numbers following cladribine is needed and will be undertaken as a consequence of this study, initial analysis of cladribine-treated PwMS ( = 11) indicated that switched and unswitched memory B cell were consistently depleted to levels below reference levels [] across a wide time-range (Supplementary Figure S1A). This suggests that once depleted, levels of B memory cells remain persistently low for over 12 months, as found in alemtuzumab- and rituximab-treated PwMS [, ]. Therefore, the memory B response was examined at a single point at the end of the treatment cycle in additional individuals (Figure S1B, Fig.a–d). Healthy controls did not significantly differ from MS controls for any outcome measure assessed. However, there were significant treatment effects of both cladribine and alemtuzumab (Fig. a–e). There was depletion in the absolute numbers of CD3 T cells in people treated with cladribine (45.0% depletion) and alemtuzumab (67.1%) at year 1 (Fig. c), which are similar with results of serial blood samples from the CLARITY [] and CARE-MS I [] studies. These pivotal phase III trials indicated that there was a marked depletion of CD19 B cells by both alemtuzumab and cladribine [, ]. Consistent with the repopulation kinetics of alemtuzumab and rituximab [, ], there was an increase in the absolute numbers of immature and mature cells in PwMS treated with cladribine (Fig. c). These were comparable with the absolute B cell numbers in alemtuzumab-treated individuals (Fig. c). Most importantly, there was a marked (80.3%) and significant ( = 0.001) depletion of memory B cells by cladribine, compared to healthy controls, to levels at least as low to that seen in year 1 (75.6%) and year 2 (65.8%) samples post-alemtuzumab treatment (Fig. c). Similarly there was a marked reduction (76.5 and 86.5% depletion compared to healthy controls) in the absolute numbers of both class-switched ( < 0.001) and unswitched ( = 0.003) memory B cells, respectively (Fig. d). This was comparable (67.8 and 84.9% depletion compared to healthy controls) to the class-switched and unswitched memory B cell depletion seen 1 year after the initial alemtuzumab treatment, respectively. Interestingly, there was also selective depletion of the CD25 subset of memory B cells (Fig. d). These cells represented 63.3 ± 4.3% of the CD19, CD27 pool in healthy controls, but only 34.1 ± 2.0% of the memory B cell pool in PwMS treated with cladribine and 27.0 ± 3.6% (year 1) and 32.4 ± 4.4% (year 2) in PwMS treated with alemtuzumab, indicating a marked depletion in this subset by cladribine (88.9% depletion compared to healthy controls) and alemtuzumab (88.6% depletion at year 1, Fig. d). To aid comparison with other published studies [, ], the percentage of total B memory cells within the CD19 population (Figure S1B and E) was also analysed. Both class-switched and unswitched memory B cells were significantly ( < 0.05) reduced following cladribine treatment to a level comparable with that found following alemtuzumab treatment at year 1 and year 2 (Fig. d). Expression of purine salvage pathway genes suggests selective vulnerability of B cells to cladribine Gene and protein expression data within public repositories were searched to determine whether differences in purine salvage pathway genes could help explain selectivity of the action of cladribine for B cells. It was evident that ADA and DCK are relatively specific for leucocytes in contrast to nucleoside phosphorylases that have broad expression []. This was readily observed following examination of microarray data (Fig. a, b). It was found that the tissue distribution of message correlated well with the previously reported [] protein activity (Fig. a). Furthermore, although there was variation in lymphocyte expression levels between different microarray studies, it was evident that B cells often express lower levels of ADA than T cells (Fig. a, b, E-GEOD-22886, GSE62584 from blood during first demyelinating event) and importantly B cells may, but not always (E-GEOD-22886, GSE62584), express higher levels of DCK than T cells (Figs. a, b, ). This is consistent with observations measuring protein or functional activity of the enzymes within normal cells and malignant cells, where B lineage cells tend to exhibit higher activity than T lineage cells []. However, it was evident that B cell subsets are very heterogeneous with regard to expression (Fig. b). Whilst there was variation between different microarray studies (GPS_00013; E-GEOD-22886; GSE68878; GSE68245; GSE68878) on balance it was found that immature, mature and memory populations, which populate the blood compartment, had similar levels of DCK (Fig. b). These expressed low levels of ADA (Fig. b). However, it was consistently found (GPR_00013; GSE68878; E-GEOD-22886) that plasma cells in blood, tonsil and bone marrow (Fig. b) exhibited significantly lower levels of DCK compared to memory and germinal centre cells. Interestingly, it was evident that germinal centre cells and notably lymphoblasts, which localise to the dark zone of the germinal centre exhibit high levels of DCK (Fig. b, E-GEOD-38697; E-GEOD-15271). This profile was consistent with protein expression within human lymphoid tissue (Fig. ). Indeed B cells within the follicles express more staining than cells within the paracortical areas, which contain T cells (Fig. a–d). Importantly there was high expression of DCK within the dark zone of the secondary follicles (Fig. a–d). Within the light zone there were intensely stained, modestly stained and poorly stained cells, which is perhaps consistent with levels of DCK message in centrocytes, memory cells and plasma cells (Fig. b) that reside in these areas. Although DCK is expressed at high levels within B cells, some 5′NT subtypes, notably NT5C3 isoforms are expressed at high levels within B cells (Fig. c). This could counter the action of DCK. Likewise, NT5E was expressed at higher levels in the circulatory: immature, mature and memory subtypes than T cells (Fig. c), which is consistent with reports on protein expression []. Whilst NT5E will dephosphorylate deoxyadenosine monophosphates, as it is an ecto-enzyme, it may not be particularly relevant to control the cytosolic action of DCK []. Likewise, as cytosolic NT5C2 preferentially targets inosines and NT5C3 isoforms are involved in pyrimidine catabolism [], their relevance to dephosphorylation of 2-deoxycladribine monophosphate remains to be properly identified. However, based on the ratio of DCK activity to total 5′NT activity, the germinal centre cells would appear to be a potentially highly sensitive to cladribine (Fig. d). This aspect is particularly notable, when the balance between DCK and the cytosolic adenosine monophosphate degradative NT5C1 isoforms [] was examined (Fig. d). These are expressed at low levels (Figs. c, e). There was a significantly higher DCK:NT5C1 ratio in CD4 T cells than CD8 T cells and higher DCK:NT5C1 ratio between mature and memory B cells and memory CD4 and CD8 T cells (Fig. d). In contrast neutrophils expressed little DCK message and more NT5C1B (Fig. d). This may help explain the pattern of neutrophil, T cell and B cell depletion profiles observed following use of cladribine. Although memory B cells have previously been shown to be suppressed by alemtuzumab in MS, with numbers remaining low for at least 50 weeks post-therapy [], this action was extended here to show an effect on activated and both immunoglobulin class-switched and unswitched memory B cells. Importantly, to our knowledge this is the first evidence of the effect of cladribine on the memory B cell pool. These data support the hypothesis that memory B cells play an important role in the pathogenesis of MS []. This data is consistent with the observation that agents that inhibit relapsing MS, with the exception of natalizumab that increases peripheral blood memory B cells presumably because they are prevented from entering the CNS, deplete peripheral memory B cells in a manner that appears to reflect their level of treatment efficacy [, ]. Importantly, if memory cells are central to the action of DMT, that cladribine and alemtuzumab induced comparable memory B cell depletion, at least at about 1 year after treatment, indicates that the personalised, adaptive-dosing of generic cladribine can limit the occurrence and potential consequences of severe lymphopenia, possibly without a potential detriment to efficacy. However, serial monitoring of peripheral memory B cells will be required to determine the extent and longevity of the response. There is a lack of correlation of MS activity with the level of T cell subset deletion []. Therefore, it will be of interest to determine whether peripheral blood memory B cell levels correlate with lesional/clinical activity, where CD8 T cells and memory B cells accumulate [], as seen in some other CD20-sensitive autoimmune conditions [,,]. The results obtained with alemtuzumab are comparable with results from the CARE-MS I study []. It will be important to determine the extent of memory B cell depletion following oral cladribine use. However, it is anticipated that it may be similar to this study as comparable amounts of cladribine was administered based on the 40% bioavailability of the oral formulation compared to 100% bioavailability of the subcutaneous formulation used here []. Indeed the level of lymphocyte, CD3 and CD19 T and B depletion by subcutaneous depletion observed here is similar with results of serial blood samples from the CLARITY oral-cladribine study []. Although, we did not measure T cell subset depletion in this study, the level of CD3 depletion seen here (45.0% depletion in the mean number of CD3 cells in PwMS treated with cladribine at 44 weeks compared to controls) with subcutaneous cladribine was similar to that reported previously with 3.5 mg/kg oral cladribine (39.1 ± 2.4% depletion at week 44 from baseline), where the absolute number of CD4, CD45R0 memory T cells was depleted by 34.4 ± 6.3% (at 9 weeks) and 37.0 ± 2.9% (at 44 weeks) from baseline [] and CD8, CD45RO memory T cells were depleted by only 15.2 ± 2.5% (at week 9) and 13.5 ± 6.3% (at week 44) from baseline. This may suggest that depletion of these T subsets by the dose of subcutaneous cladribine used here, may be limited also, but further studies are warranted to include analysis of Th1, Th17 cells and T regulatory cells to determine whether selective depletion occurs following cladribine. Indeed, by increasing the dose and frequency of dosing, more substantial depletion T cell, notably CD4 T cell depletion, can be achieved [, ]. This may contribute to and even account for the clinical efficacy observed [, ]. This study does not prove that memory B cells actually mediate an essential component of relapsing MS. Likewise, definitive proof that T cells are the central mediators of the action of DMT in MS in humans is circumstantial and unproven also and the levels of their peripheral blood depletion do not correlate with efficacy [, ]. However, it is evident that DMT have a number of possible mechanisms of action [] and given the activity of CD20-depleting antibodies [], it is essential that the importance of B cells in disease control is considered. The relatively high B cell expression levels of DCK, coupled with low levels of NT5C1 and ADA, compared to T cells, and neutrophils, and the higher turnover of B cells may create the B cell-selective depleting effect of cladribine seen in vivo [, ]. This effect coupled with the slow kinetics of memory B cell repopulation [, ], may explain why memory B populations are vulnerable to cladribine. As seen with other DMT including rituximab and alemtuzumab [, ], the peripheral blood mature B cell population expands following depletion from the immature B cell pool that rapidly enter the blood, probably from the bone marrow [, ]. This probably accounts for the apparent rapid normalisation of CD19 B cells that reconstitute the blood faster than T cells [, , ]. It has been recently questioned whether fingolimod inhibits the action of alemtuzumab due to sequestration of immune cells within lymphoid tissue, probably the bone marrow, which may not be effectively purged by alemtuzumab []. This could perhaps account for the rapid hyper-proliferation of immature and mature B cells seen after alemtuzumab treatment []. The slower repopulation of B cells may reflect the fact that bone marrow, B cell precursor cells have deoxycytidine kinase and should therefore be sensitive to depletion by cladribine. Cladribine therefore behaves as a chemical CD19-depleter. In contrast to immature and mature cells, peripheral blood memory B cells repopulate very slowly from the lymphoid organ pool mostly via germinal centre activity []. The germinal centres may be particularly vulnerable to inhibition by cladribine due to the high level of proliferation and DCK expression, leading to selective long-term loss of peripheral blood memory B cells. These may be depleted for 18 months or substantially longer in some individuals, as seen in development [] and following depletion with alemtuzumab or rituximab [, ]. As the expression of DCK in plasma cells was low, it suggests that long-lived plasma cells may be relatively unaffected as occurs following CD20 B cell depletion, and thus not interfering with pre-existing vaccination responses. However, this remains to be established. The longevity of the memory B cell depletion may be a key contributor to the mechanism of “induction therapy” activity of these pulsed immune-reconstitution treatments. Pathogenic memory cell repopulation may be a simple reason for treatment failures, requiring re-dosing, which occurs with cladribine and alemtuzumab [, ,,]. Furthermore, it remains to be established whether the peripheral memory B cell compartment has value as a biomarker for response to disease activity, therapy and as an indicator for retreatment, as occurs in a number of other neurological and non-neurological, CD20 depletion-sensitive autoimmune conditions [,,]. Although we have placed emphasis on the potential role of the memory B cell, the thymus is targeted by cladribine [] and T cells still harbour elevated DCK levels, compared to other tissues, and are depleted. Furthermore, the action of cladribine may block the antigen presentation function of memory B cells and thus silence the remaining autoreactive T cells, using mechanisms suggested for CD20-depleting antibodies []. Therefore, cladribine may control MS via an action on both T and B lymphocytes, notably as T cell activities are integrally involved in B cell function. However, the importance of memory B cells is consistent with the potential genetic and infectious aetiology of MS []; the pathology that is associated with memory B cell accumulation during attacks [, ], the generation of nerve and oligodendrocyte cytotoxic molecules and ectopic B cell follicle formation [, , ]; and importantly the response to effective DMT []. Epstein Barr Virus is believed to be an aetiological trigger of MS and drives the production of memory B cells, which may become relatively T cell-independent, and perhaps more autoimmune prone, due to B the antigen receptor and CD40-signalling mimics created by the virus [, ]. The data presented here indicates that cladribine depletes memory B cells, in addition to T cells, and suggest that memory B cells could possibly be useful targets for the development of new, specific and better tolerated drugs for MS treatment. Also, in the shorter term, it is possible that we will be able to improve effectiveness and patient safety by routinely monitoring memory B cell levels. The oral and subcutaneous routes produce cladribine with defined pharmacokinetics that allow bioequivalent doses to be selected []. Our subcutaneous cladribine protocol was originally developed for compassionate use for people without access to treatment, rather than an alternative to the commercial product. As such it has only been administered to PwMS from a few local centres within the UK. This may change as our experience becomes published and neurologists and nurses become comfortable using the oral formulation that has been licensed and is available for use in highly active relapsing MS within the UK and the rest of Europe []. This could lead to the development of treatment options for all people with MS. Legroux L, Arbour N (2015) Multiple sclerosis and T lymphocytes: an entangled story.

d359081e-c45f-455e-ac2a-bfceab3db4b5,"Reviewed by MSAA Chief Medical Officer While we all know “MS” stands for “multiple sclerosis,” with so much exciting research reported in this edition of “What’s New in MS Research,” we can almost imagine that “MS” could also refer to the quest for “multiple solutions” in MS. Although a great deal of the research looks to further understand the biology, easing the symptoms, and slowing or stopping the physical damage of MS, the studies and other information presented here are very encouraging – and they are only a small sample of the vast array of research under way around the world. Most of the clinical trials and other studies featured in this issue of “What’s New in MS Research” are drawn from virtual presentations given at the September 2020 joint meeting of the Americas Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ACTRIMS) and the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS). That meeting, held virtually this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, was a forum for laboratory scientists and clinical investigators to share their findings from literally thousands of research efforts. As reflected in the reports that follow, those inquiries touch upon everything from enhancing the diagnosis of MS and better understanding its course, to evaluating the effectiveness and safety of approved disease-modifying therapies, investigational agents, and other types of interventions. Impact of Vumerity on brain-volume change: Encouraging interim findings People with relapsing MS who took the oral disease-modifying therapy Vumerity (diroximel fumarate) for up to two years had changes (reductions) in brain volume that approach those seen in people who do not have MS. That’s the encouraging finding from interim results of a study examining the long-term impact of the medication, which the FDA approved in October 2019. The study, EVOLVE-MS-1, is an ongoing, open-label Phase 3 investigation. Analysis of data on 365 patients who had taken Vumerity for a median of 96 weeks showed that their average percent of brain volume change (PBVC) was -0.36 from baseline to Week 48 and -0.35 from Week 48 to Week 96. Meanwhile, the estimated proportion of patients who were free of confirmed disability progression was 94.3% at Week 48 and 90.7% at Week 96. The proportions of patients with no evidence of disease activity at Week 48 and Week 96 were 44.7% and 25.2%, respectively. The study’s authors noted, “Interim findings from the ongoing EVOLVE-MS-1 study demonstrate that yearly PBVC in [Vumerity]-treated patients approached the rate observed in healthy adults.” Newly approved DMT shows efficacy in newly diagnosed, treatment-naïve patients In August, Kesimpta (ofatumumab) became the first self-administered targeted B-cell therapy approved by the FDA to treat relapsing forms of MS. A recent analysis of data from the Phase III ASCLEPIOS I/II trials that led to that approval provide insights into the efficacy and risk profile of the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody in newly diagnosed patients who had not received any prior disease-modifying therapy (DMT) for their MS. The analysis involved 615 patients with a median age of 36 years who typically had been diagnosed within a year of starting either Kesimpta, or the comparison agent Aubagio (teriflunomide), in the Phase III trials. Compared to Aubagio, the study found that Kesimpta reduced the annual relapse rate (ARR) by 50.3%. It also reduced six-month confirmed disability worsening by 46%, and the number of new or enlarging T2 lesions seen on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a year by 82.0%. The study’s authors noted that these findings in newly diagnosed patients who had not received prior DMTs were consistent with results for the overall study population. Assessing the long-term impact of Mayzent in secondary-progressive MS Mayzent (siponimod) is an oral DMT approved by the FDA in March 2019 as a treatment for both relapsing and active secondary-progressive MS (aSPMS). In the EXPAND trial that led to its approval, the medication reduced worsening of both clinical disability and cognition at the six-month mark in people with aSPMS. New data show that those benefits may continue for up to five years. An analysis assessed long-term outcomes in 582 people with aSPMS, comparing those who had received Mayzent throughout the EXPAND trial and its open-label extension (Continuous Group), with those who had been on placebo during the main trial and then switched to Mayzent during the extension (Switch Group). Median time to confirmed disability progression over any six-month period was 48 months for the Switch Group, but was not reached for the Continuous Group. Similarly, the risk of confirmed cognitive worsening over any six-month period was reduced by 33% in the Continuous Group vs. the Switch Group, a statistically significant difference. The annual relapse rate (ARR) was also significantly reduced in the Continuous Group relative to the Switch Group. The study’s authors concluded, “Long-term data analyses in the Continuous versus Switch groups showed that siponimod treatment effects on disability, cognitive processing speed, and relapse outcomes in patients with active SPMS are sustained for up to 5 years, and highlight the value of early treatment initiation.” Arnold D, et al.

Evaluating the impact of ponesimod on brain volume and other measures Ponesimod is an oral medication in late stages of investigation for treatment of relapsing forms of MS. It belongs to a class of medications called sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 modulators. The class also includes FDA-approved disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) such as Gilenya (fingolimod) and Mayzent (siponimod). The Phase III OPTIMUM study evaluated the efficacy and safety of ponesimod relative to the approved DMT Aubagio (teriflunomide) over two years of treatment. The study included 985 patients. Analysis of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings and other data from the trial showed that patients in the ponesimod group had less change in brain volume than those taking Aubagio and fewer new or enlarging T2 lesions seen on MRI per year. Further, at week 108 of treatment, 28.2% of patients receiving ponesimod had no evidence of disease activity as assessed by three measures (NEDA-3), compared to 18.3% of people taking Aubagio. Evobrutinib shows two-year reduction in relapse rate Evobrutinib is an investigational medication that belongs to a class of medications known as Bruton’s tyrosine kinase inhibitors, or BTKIs. Its developers note that it has a dual mode of action, targeting B cells and myeloid cells, both of which play a role in autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). In a recent Phase II trial involving people with relapsing MS, evobrutinib significantly reduced T1 gadolinium-enhancing lesions on MRI compared to placebo at Week 24, and showed continued efficacy through Week 48. Patients who participated in that trial were eligible to join an open-label extension study that tracked clinical relapse rates and other measures. The extension included both people who had received various doses of evobrutinib in the Phase II trial and those who had received placebo. All participants in the extension study received evobrutinib. Among 148 patients who completed 108 weeks of treatment, those who had been on the highest dose of evobrutinib in the main trial had an annualized relapse rate of 0.12, which was roughly one-third that of the 0.31 rate for patients who received placebo in the main trial before switching to evobrutinib in the open-label period. Similarly, the estimated time to relapse in the higher-dose evobrutinib patients was almost three times longer than that of patients who started on placebo. For all of the remarkable progress that has been made in expanding treatment options for MS, there also are periodic reminders that drug development is a difficult and complex process that offers no guarantees of success. One such reminder came a few weeks ago, when Biogen noted in its third-quarter report that it will discontinue development of its investigational agent opicinumab. The medication, which is also known as anti-LINGO-1 and BIIB033, is an antibody that was thought to promote repair of the myelin sheath that protects nerves. Damage to that sheath is the hallmark of MS. The agent has been studied in a number of Phase II studies, including RENEW, SYNERGY, and the AFFINITY trial, which was scheduled to run until 2022. Unfortunately, the latter trial did not meet primary or secondary endpoints, so development of opicinumab was discontinued. Kappos L, et al.

Two of those studies are summarized below. Neurofilament light, or NfL, is a protein found in axons, the component of neurons that facilitates transmission of electrical impulses. When neurons are damaged, as occurs in MS and other diseases, the protein is released, eventually reaching the blood, or serum. Researchers seeking biomarkers that can help correctly identify MS and provide clues to its future course have focused in recent years on the sNfL chain, with generally encouraging results. In a multi-center, prospective study, investigators looked for an association between sNfL levels and the diagnosis of MS, MRI parameters, and treatment decisions. The study, which involved 814 patients, found that: Patients with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) had lower sNfL levels than those with MS, a finding that may help clinicians distinguish between the two conditions. sNfL levels correlated with the number of clinical relapses a person experienced and the number of gadolinium-enhancing lesions seen on MRI. Patients who received disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) in the first two years after diagnosis had higher baseline sNfL levels than patients who did not receive a DMT, suggesting that they may have presented with more pronounced symptoms. Further, sNfL levels measured over four years reflected treatment decisions, supporting the idea that those levels are a marker of disease status. The study’s authors concluded that evaluating sNfL levels may both enhance diagnosis and help guide decisions about initial treatment. A second study found that sNfL levels obtained in the early stages of MS can predict how patients are likely to fare as much as 15 years later. Drawing on long-term data from the BENEFIT study examining use of interferon beta-1b in people with MS, researchers found that patients with baseline sNfL values above the 90th percentile were almost 2.5 times more likely than people with lower sNfL concentrations to have an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 4 or greater 15 years later. An EDSS score of 4 indicates that although fully ambulatory and self-sufficient, an individual is experiencing significant disability. One less headache for people with MS who also suffer from migraines It could be intuitive to think – or at least to worry – that a history of migraines would not bode well for the course of MS, but researchers have found that this isn’t necessarily the case. Those investigators analyzed data on 2,017 people with MS, including 336 people who had reported experiencing migraines. The people who reported migraines tended to be younger than the other patients, and were more likely to also have a history of anxiety, depression, and obstructive sleep apnea. However, they were less likely than the other study subjects to have severe disability (5.4% of those with migraine vs. 12.0% of those without, a statistically significant difference), and did not show differences in walking speed, manual dexterity, cognitive processing speed, relapse rates, or rate of new brain-lesion development. While the investigators cautioned that the evidence gathered to date on migraine and MS is conflicting, and that further studies are needed, their findings nonetheless offer reassurance to people who may have feared that migraine headaches would somehow contribute to or be associated with a more-difficult MS course. Different types of MS impact quality of life similarly Depression, pain, and walking difficulty are the symptoms that have the greatest impact on quality of life for people with MS, regardless of which form of the condition they have. This is the main finding to emerge from a study examining how 13 different MS symptoms affected health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in 1,985 people with MS. Although the study subjects were stratified by MS phenotype, such as relapsing-remitting MS, secondary-progressive MS, and primary-progressive MS, the investigators found that depression, pain, and problems with walking were the main contributors to a reduced quality of life across and among the different subgroups. “Reducing these symptoms may have the largest impact on improving HRQoL in all MS phenotypes of people with MS,” they said.

An MS trial focused exclusively on minority patients In keeping with efforts to address long-standing inequities in society as a whole and within the healthcare system, a new trial will evaluate the efficacy and safety of the disease-modifying therapy Ocrevus (ocrelizumab) in people with relapsing forms of MS who are of African ancestry or Hispanic and Latino ethnicity. In previewing the trial, researchers noted that minority patients with MS tend to have greater disease severity and faster progression than Caucasians, but are significantly under-represented in clinical trials, “owing to poor access and cultural, economic and other participation barriers.” They added that while large-scale clinical trials of Ocrevus showed that the B cell-targeting anti-CD20 therapy reduced rates of disease activity and progression in both relapsing MS and primary-progressive MS, minority participation in those studies was less than 10%. By contrast, the researchers said, the single-arm Phase IV study, called CHIMES, is an industry-sponsored collaborative approach designed to meet the needs of patients of African or Hispanic ancestry. The study’s primary endpoint will be disease activity, defined by the proportion of patients free of protocol-defined events such as relapses, at one year. Study subjects will be eligible to participate in a second-year extension that will assess disease progression and biomarker endpoints. One-third of the patients will take part in a sub-study evaluating cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers. The researchers noted, “Findings from CHIMES are expected to improve current understanding of MS disease biology, treatment response and clinical trial participation among [African ancestry and Hispanic ancestry] patients with MS, with the ultimate goals of increasing high-quality standard of care to traditionally underserved populations and enhancing equality through clinical research.” Examining MS relapse rates during – and after – pregnancy A new study has bolstered prior findings that MS relapses tend to decrease during pregnancy and then increase again in the early postpartum period. The analysis assessed information on 119 women who became pregnant while they were patients at the University of California San Francisco Multiple Sclerosis Center during the period 2005 to 2018. For the 146 live-birth pregnancies that the study subjects had, the pre-pregnancy annual relapse rate (ARR) was 0.33. That rate decreased during pregnancy to 0.10 but then increased to 0.61 by three months after delivery. (Both changes were statistically significant.) Another key finding: Women who exclusively breastfed their babies for at least three months after delivery had a significantly reduced likelihood of having a relapse. Identifying indicators of long-term disability in children with MS Children and adolescents who have optic nerve, brainstem, or spinal cord lesions when they are diagnosed with MS are at greater risk for long-term disability than other pediatric MS patients. That was one of the major findings to emerge from a study of 123 young people followed for an average of nine years after diagnosis. Researchers found that optic nerve involvement at baseline predicted a shorter time to first relapse and 10-year disability worsening. Brainstem lesions at baseline also were predictive of 10-year disability worsening, as well as of a higher 10-year Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score. The number of cervical spinal cord lesions at diagnosis also helped identify patients likely to have higher EDSS scores 10 years after diagnosis. Several other clinical and imaging features seen in the first three years after diagnosis, including number of relapses in the first year and detection of at least two lesions seen on MRI within two years, also provided reliable information on long-term disease course. The study’s investigators noted, “Accurate clinical and MRI monitoring during the first two years of disease has proven to represent a powerful tool for counseling [pediatric] patients about long-term prognosis and personalizing treatment strategies.” Williams M, et al.

Comparing stem cell transplantation with disease-modifying therapies Encouraging results from small- and medium-sized studies have generated considerable interest in treating multiple sclerosis with stem cell therapy, but important questions remain about the long-term outcomes of the treatment strategy, as well as about how it compares with current disease-modifying therapies (DMTs). The StarMS study will examine that last issue: the safety and efficacy of stem cell transplantation relative to DMTs. Funded by the British government, the study will involve 198 people with relapsing-remitting MS. One half of the study participants will receive stem cells that have been taken from their body, treated, and then re-infused after the patient undergoes immunosuppression. This approach is designed to “reboot” the immune system. The other half of the participants will receive one of two DMTs, Ocrevus (ocrelizumab) or Lemtrada (alemtuzumab). The primary endpoint of the study will be the rate of patients achieving no evidence of disease activity (NEDA), based on clinical and imaging assessments, over a two-year follow-up period. Allowing time for full patient enrollment, results are expected in about four years. Study investigators note, “The StarMS trial has the potential to provide definitive data on the comparative efficacy of aHSCT [autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation] versus highly efficacious DMTs, help improve patient outcomes, and impact national and international guidelines.” Might administering microscopic crystals to people with MS prove to be the gold standard – literally – for repairing the nerve-sheath damage that drives MS? Clene Nanomedicine, a biopharmaceutical company based in Salt Lake City, Utah, is pursuing the answer to that question as it develops CNM-Au8, a concentrated, aqueous suspension of clean-surfaced faceted gold nanocrystals that act catalytically to support intracellular biological reactions. The agent is being investigated as a potential treatment not only for MS, but also for Parkinson’s disease (PD) and potentially other neurological conditions. Studies in animals indicate that CNM-Au8 has both remyelination and neuroprotective effects, the Company notes. Clene Nanotechnologies adds that Phase I studies in healthy human volunteers have demonstrated the safety of CNM-Au8. As a next step in the research process, the Company organized the REPAIR-MS and REPAIR-PD studies. The Phase II, single-center, open-label, imaging studies are examining the brain metabolic effects, safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of CNM-Au8 in patients who have been diagnosed with MS in the past 15 years (REPAIR-MS) or who have been diagnosed with PD in the past three years (REPAIR-PD). Study participants take either a 15 or 30 mg orally delivered dose of the nanocrystal suspension each morning. Study participants undergo sophisticated brain imaging scanning to assess key bioenergetic brain metabolites at baseline, prior to administration of CNM-Au8, and at the end of the study. The objective is to show that CNM-Au8 engages with targeted central nervous system biomarkers related to bioenergetics and neuronal metabolism in people with MS and PD. The study is taking place at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. Survey finds that one in five people with MS are using cannabis for symptom relief Roughly one-third of people with MS have looked to cannabis at least once for relief of spasticity or pain, or to help with sleep, and 20% currently are taking cannabis to ease MS symptoms. Those were the main findings of a recent online survey conducted by the North American Research Committee on Multiple Sclerosis, or NARCOMS, a voluntary self-report registry for people with MS. NARCOMS researchers invited 6,934 registry participants to complete the survey. Forty-seven percent – or 3,249 people – responded. The participants had an average age of 61.2 years and a mean age at MS symptom onset of 31.2 years. Current users were more likely than past users to be male, and also were likely to be somewhat younger. More than 60% of the respondents reported moderate to severe spasticity, pain, and sleep problems. Phase III study examines cannabinoid agent for MS spasticity Americans who look to cannabis-based agents for relief of MS symptoms may have a new treatment option – one already offered in more than two dozen other countries – available to them in the years just ahead. GW Pharmaceuticals and its United States subsidiary, Greenwich Biosciences, on November 3, 2019 announced the initiation of the first United States Phase III clinical trial studying nabiximols for MS-associated spasticity. Nabiximols, which are known as Sativex outside of the United States, are approved for treatment of MS spasticity in more than 25 countries. GW Pharmaceuticals, which focuses on the development and commercialization of cannabinoid prescription medicines, said that nabiximols is a complex botanical medicine formulated from extracts of the cannabis plant. It is administered as an oral spray. The company noted that three European Phase III clinical studies showed that nabiximols was well-tolerated and provided continued reductions in patient-reported spasticity in people with MS. The new Phase III trial is one of five pivotal studies planned for nabiximols in MS spasticity, with the remaining studies on track to begin later this year or in 2021. The company said that it expects that a positive result in any one of the five studies will enable submission of an application for Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of the agent, potentially as early as mid-2021. The Phase III, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of nabiximols for spasm frequency over a 12-week period. It is expected to enroll 446 participants. Evaluating the long-term impact of therapeutic plasma exchange Therapeutic plasma exchange – the removal and replacement of the plasma component of a person’s blood through the use of a special machine – is an option sometimes employed when high-dose steroid therapy isn’t effective in treating an MS relapse. A recent study examined the impact of the treatment strategy over 12, 18, and 24 months, and sought to identify whether certain patient characteristics or disease features were associated with a better response to therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE). Researchers analyzed data on 24 people with relapsing-remitting MS who received steroids followed by TPE and 43 patients who received steroids only. Patients in the two groups were matched for age, sex, disease duration, and disability level at the time of the relapse. Good response to treatment was defined as a reduction of at least 50% in one’s Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score. Initial EDSS scores in the two groups were similar. While two-thirds of the people receiving TPE initially had a good response to the treatment, the researchers found no significant differences between their EDSS scores and those of the steroid-only patients at 12, 18, or 24 months of follow-up. Further, preliminary analysis did not identify any patient characteristics or disease features associated with a favorable response to TPE. Although the study did not identify an added long-term benefit from following high-dose steroids with TPE, the fact that most TPE recipients had a good initial response to the therapy is encouraging news, especially considering that up to one-quarter of people experiencing a relapse do not obtain sufficient improvement from steroids alone. Can taking aspirin as a warm-up help avoid overheating during exercise? In addition to the time pressures and other deterrents to regular exercise that all people face, many people with MS also have to cope with the exertion-induced overheating that is a frequent feature of multiple sclerosis. A new study is examining whether taking aspirin before working out can help remove that MS-specific obstacle to maintaining an exercise routine. ASPIRE is a large-scale, double-blind randomized controlled trial that will compare the effects of aspirin with those of acetaminophen (generic version of the brand name Tylenol) and placebo in 60 people with MS. Each study participant will engage in three maximal exercise tests, with the evaluations scheduled at one-week intervals. A study subject will take 650 mg of aspirin before one test, a standard dose of acetaminophen before another session, and placebo prior to the third session. The study’s two main endpoints are time to exhaustion and change in body temperature from the pre-exercise period to the immediate post-exercise period. Study organizers note that a pilot trial showed that aspirin pre-treatment increased exercise time and reduced the post-exercise increase in body temperature by 56% in people with MS who experience overheating on exertion.

cca598de-ee64-465f-9eac-d51fe1d40a0e,"Selma Blair Says She Probably Lived with MS for 15 Years Before Diagnosis Actress Selma Blair recently revealed that she has multiple sclerosis — and that she had symptoms for about 15 years before receiving a diagnosis. Blair, who has starred in films like “Hellboy” and “Legally Blonde” wrote on her Instagram this week that she “is disabled.” “I have . I am in an exacerbation,” Blair wrote in an Instagram post. “By the grace of the lord, and will power and the understanding producers at Netflix, I have a job. A wonderful job. I am disabled. I fall sometimes. I drop things. My memory is foggy. And my left side is asking for directions from a broken gps.” Blair said she was diagnosed in August but had symptoms years earlier. “I have probably had this incurable disease for 15 years at least,” she wrote. In fact, Blair actually fits many of the demographics at higher risk of the disease. The actress’ news has put a spotlight on a condition that can still be confusing for patients and physicians alike. MS isto affect women than men, and most symptoms first appear when a person is between 20 and 40, according to the American Association of Neurological Surgeons. About 1,000,000 Americans have MS, which also affects over 2.3 million individuals across the globe, reports. Multiple sclerosis, also known as MS, is a neurological disease that impairs communication between the brain and other parts of the body. Difficulty with coordination and balance, as well as blurred vision, are common symptoms of the disease. Dr. Daniel M. Harrison, a neurologist and interim division director of the Maryland Multiple Sclerosis Center, said an accurate diagnosis can be made in the majority of cases when a patient undergoes proper evaluation and testing. “The diagnosis of multiple sclerosis is made based on a combination of a patient’s clinical signs and symptoms, and the results of supportive testing,” he said. But sometimes, symptoms are not as obvious, added Dr. Philip De Jager, PhDa director of the Multiple Sclerosis Clinical Care and Research Center at the Columbia University Medical Center in New York. “There is no test that tells you whether you have MS. It remains a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning we have to rule out all other possibilities,” he said. Harrison noted that MS is an autoimmune condition that occurs when inflammation causes a loss of myelin (the insulation around nerve cells). This damages the nerve cells and their supporting structures in the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves. Having a family history of MS or another autoimmune condition significantly increases your chance of having MS, Harrison said. Vitamin D deficiency, especially in childhood, also plays a clear role and likely works together with a genetic predisposition for MS. “More controversially, exposure to some viral infections, perhaps also in childhood, may also work together with a genetic predisposition to help trigger the development of MS,” he explained. Some people experience MS “attacks” but recover from them; others accumulate disabilities over time, noted De Jager. While vision changes, weakness, numbness, and imbalances are common symptoms, each patient’s symptoms can vary greatly. Signs of MS vary, and can also include movement control issues, alterations of reflexes, muscle tone changes, slow moving limbs, and poor limb coordination. Sensory pathways can also be affected, so a patient may experience a decreased sensitivity to touch, pain, temperature, vibration, or position. Lower acuity of vision, missing visual fields and altered pupil reflexes are also symptoms. “If the parts of the brain that control eye movements are affected, we will often find misalignments in the way that the left and right eyes move together,” he added. Sometimes, patients can experience cognitive symptoms, such as memory impairment, language dysfunction, or concentration difficulties. Kathy Costello, associate vice president of health care access for the National MS Society, explained that MS is a progressive disease. “The disease course and severity are different for each person who is diagnosed,” she said. For about 85 percent of patients, MS includes times when they will experience symptoms, followed by a period when symptoms may seem to disappear. “Over time, these individuals generally have fewer relapses, but the disease course changes to being predominantly progressive, with a worsening of symptoms and potentially an increase in disability over time,” she said. The other 15 percent of people who have MS experience a primary progressive form of the disease, which means their symptoms worsen and accumulate. These patients don’t have relapses or remissions. “When a patient experiences such an event, they will often have supportive findings on their physical examination, which should trigger the ordering of an MRI,” Harrison said. An MRI scan of the brain and spinal cord will show signs of both current and previous regions of inflammation and loss of myelin. If the patient’s symptoms and findings on MRI are sufficient to meet the diagnostic criteria for MS, the diagnosis can be made at this point, he said. In some cases, spinal fluid testing is needed to confirm the diagnosis. “Since MS can affect almost any part of the brain and spinal cord, the symptoms of MS can be very similar to many other neurologic conditions, so it is very difficult to know someone has MS solely based on their symptoms,” he explained. A thorough physical examination and use of the proper diagnostic procedures will help a physician determine if MS is a concern, or, if there is another neurologic or non-neurologic explanation for the symptoms. “If anyone is experiencing neurologic symptoms, they should seek medical attention for them and undergo a proper evaluation by their physician,” Harrison added. Harrison said there are many treatments available for MS, including more than 10 treatments for relapsing MS, which is just one variation of the disease. The treatments can drastically reduce a patient’s chance of having future episodes, new MRI activity, and disability accumulation. Last year, the FDA approved a treatment for primary progressive MS, which is a rarer form of the condition. The newer treatment helps to reduce the disability from further progressing. Treatments on the horizon include those that possibly may be able to restore health, repair myelin, and reverse symptoms. MS cannot be prevented, though some research is examining the potential of vitamin D use in those with a family history, as a way to prevent the disease from forming. “Despite the benefits of the treatments we currently have for MS, many patients can still experience lifelong symptoms, some of which can be disabling,” Harrison said. Actress Selma Blair’s MS diagnosis puts a spotlight on a confusing and sometimes misunderstood disease. Multiple sclerosis is a neurological disease that impairs communication between the brain and other parts of the body. Difficulty with coordination and balance, as well as blurred vision, are common symptoms of the disease. About 400,000 Americans have MS, which also affects about 2.1 million individuals across the globe, reports. It is more likely to affect women than men, and first symptoms often occur between the ages of 20 to 40. Temperament Can Play a Big Role in Quality of Life with MS Multiple Sclerosis May Affect Ability to Read Social Cues New Guidelines Released on Multiple Sclerosis Treatments Promising Treatments and Clinical Trials for Relapsing-Remitting MS Temperament Can Play a Big Role in Quality of Life with MS Researchers say if a person with multiple sclerosis is irritable or anxious, it can make overcoming the obstacles of their disease much more difficult. Multiple Sclerosis May Affect Ability to Read Social Cues A recent study suggests that MS disease activity could damage an area of the brain responsible for processing facial emotions and other social cues. New Guidelines Released on Multiple Sclerosis Treatments At its annual meeting, the American Academy of Neurology unveiled recommendations for starting, switching, and stopping disease-modifying treatments. Promising Treatments and Clinical Trials for Relapsing-Remitting MS Disease-modifying therapies are the main treatments for relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). These have been shown to help reduce the number of attacks and… A new report shows that MS patients taking fingolimod have greater odds of developing the painful varicella-zoster rash.

Stretch It Out: Yoga Eases Multiple Sclerosis Symptoms in Pilot Study Researchers bent over backwards to help those with MS realize the benefits of yoga in a new study. More clinical trials are soon to follow. Could a Low-Grade Fever Be Making Your MS Fatigue Worse?

54577771-adaf-4cdb-a0c1-bac3dd4075c4,"The first three long-term treatments for multiple sclerosis (MS) became available in the early to mid 1990s and were dubbed the “A-B-C” drugs because of their brand names: , , and . These are interferon beta-1a, interferon beta-1b, and glatiramer acetate, respectively. In 2002, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved another interferon, (interferon beta-1a), for the long-term treatments of MS. This is the same drug as Avonex, but is injected differently and in more frequent and higher doses. In 2009, (interferon beta-1b) was also approved. This is the same medicinal product as Betaseron and is given in the same doses, but is marketed under a different brand name and by a different pharmaceutical company. In 2014, (peginterferon beta-1a) became the 11th DMT approved for the long-term treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS) – and the fifth interferon medication approved for MS. Plegridy is a pegylated version of interferon beta-1a. Pegylation is a chemical modification of a molecule (in this case the interferon beta-1a molecule) that extends its half-life, which refers to how long a drug stays active in the body before it is metabolized or eliminated. While Copaxone (noted earlier) was initially approved as a daily 20-mg injection, a 40-mg dose of Copaxone injected three-times weekly was approved by the FDA in 2014; physicians and their patients may choose either dose regimen. In April 2015, (glatiramer acetate injection) was approved as the 13th long-term treatment for individuals with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS). Glatopa is a generic version of Copaxone (glatiramer acetate injection), given at the original 20-mg daily dose, and as of February 2018, was also approved at the newer, 40-mg three-times-weekly injected dose. This is the first generic version of a disease-modifying therapy for MS to be approved by the FDA. In October 2017, was approved at both the 20-mg daily injected dose and the 40-mg three-times-weekly injected dose. All eight of these self-injected disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) listed above are approved by the FDA for treating either relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) or all relapsing forms of MS. Some of these DMTs have also been approved for “clinically isolated syndrome” (CIS), which refers to the initial symptom a patient reports prior to a diagnosis of MS. Each of these treatments is administered by self injection at one’s home, with the frequency of injections ranging from once daily to once every two weeks, depending on the drug prescribed. These therapies have been used for several years and research shows that many people are doing well on these medications for extended periods of time (some for more than 20 years). Most side effects (such as flu-like symptoms and injection-site reactions) are manageable through various strategies and over-the-counter medications. Blood tests may be given periodically to monitor various items, such as liver enzymes, the number of red blood cells and white blood cells, and the possible development of neutralizing antibodies* (please see note below). In May 2016, (daclizumab) became the 14th disease-modifying therapy to be approved for the long-term treatment of relapsing forms of MS (RMS) in adults. However, please note that this medication was voluntarily withdrawn from the marketplace in March 2018 by its manufacturers and is no longer available to the MS community. This voluntary withdrawal was due to new safety concerns, including several cases of inflammatory encephalitis and meningoencephalitis (both forms of brain inflammation) that were reported in Europe, as well as earlier issues with liver failure. As background information, this monoclonal antibody was self-administered subcutaneously (under-the-skin) once per month and had been shown to reduce the number of relapses as well as new or newly enhancing lesions, as compared to another approved MS medication and to placebo, in two separate studies. This medication carried safety risks, which included liver injury and immune conditions. The FDA stated that Zinbryta would only be used in patients who had an inadequate response to two or more MS drugs. Zinbryta had a boxed warning, was available only through a restricted distribution program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, and monthly liver-function tests were required. In August 2020, the FDA approved (ofatumumab) for adults with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS), which includes clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting disease, and active secondary-progressive disease. Kesimpta is a B-cell therapy, which binds to and depletes B-cells shown to be associated with disease activity in MS. Typically this type of therapy is only available via infusion at a hospital or infusion center; however, Kesimpta is the first self-administered B-cell therapy for MS. It is given monthly via subcutaneous injection at one’s home. The approval of Kesimpta is based on results from the Phase III ASCLEPIOS I and II studies, in which Kesimpta demonstrated superiority over Aubagio (oral teriflunomide) in significantly reducing the annualized relapse rate (ARR), three-month confirmed disability progression (CDP), and the number of gadolinium-enhancing (Gd+) T1 and new or enlarging T2 lesions. The most common side effects of Kesimpta include upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), with symptoms that include sore throat, runny nose, and headache, as well as headache not related to a URTI. Other serious but less-common side effects can occur. In 2000 (prior to the approval of some of the medications mentioned above), (mitoxantrone) was approved by the FDA for the long-term treatment of MS. This was the first drug indicated for RRMS, secondary-progressive MS (SPMS), and worsening RRMS. Novantrone has been used for many years to treat cancer. It is given via intravenous infusion once every three months. Side effects may include cardiac disease and leukemia, and for this reason, patients must be closely monitored and are limited to a maximum of two to three years of treatment with this drug. Because of the potential risks and with the approval of more long-term treatments for MS, Novantrone is seldom prescribed for individuals with MS. Anyone taking Novantrone now or given Novantrone previously needs to have (as noted in this advisory), even if no longer receiving this medication. In 2004, (natalizumab), was approved for relapsing forms of MS. It is administered via intravenous infusion every four weeks. After its initial approval, Tysabri was temporarily suspended after two individuals (taking Tysabri in combination with Avonex) developed progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), which if not discovered early, is an often-fatal viral infection of the brain. Since that time, Tysabri has been re-approved and patients are closely monitored through the “TOUCH Prescribing Program.” In 2012, the FDA announced that three factors have been identified with increasing the risk of PML for individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS) being treated with Tysabri. These include: (1) the presence of JC virus antibodies (detected through a blood test); (2) previous treatment with immunosuppressive drugs, such as Novantrone, Imuran, or Cytoxan; and (3) the length of time an individual has been taking Tysabri – specifically beyond the two-year mark. More details are included in MSAA’s article, In November 2014, the FDA announced the approval of (alemtuzumab) for the long-term treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS). This is the 12th DMT to be approved for the long-term treatment of MS, and the third intravenous medication for MS. Given for a course of five days via intravenous (IV) infusion and followed one year later by a second three-day course, Lemtrada has been approved as a second-line therapy. This classification refers to a drug that may only be prescribed when other FDA-approved treatments fail or are not tolerated well by a patient. Lemtrada should generally be prescribed for patients who have had an inadequate response to two or more of the disease-modifying therapies, because of the medication’s safety profile. Adverse events from Lemtrada can include infusion reactions to the medication, an increased risk of infection, emergent autoimmune diseases, and other serious conditions. For early detection and management of these risks, Lemtrada is only available through a restricted distribution program, the Lemtrada REMS (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy). REMS ensures that prescriptions are only given through certified prescribers and that patients are enrolled in this important safety and monitoring program. In March 2017, (ocrelizumab) became the 15th FDA-approved treatment, notably for two types of MS: relapsing forms of MS (RMS) and primary-progressive MS (PPMS). This is the first time that a medication for MS has been approved for two types of the disease, and the first time that any medication has been approved to treat PPMS. Ocrevus is given via intravenous (IV) infusion every six months. Ocrevus is a humanized monoclonal antibody designed to selectively target CD20-positive B cells. These are a specific type of immune cell that is an important contributor to the MS-disease process. The fact that Ocrevus targets B cells differentiates it from most of the previously approved disease-modifying therapies for MS, which target a different type of immune cell called “T cells.” Side effects can include infusion reactions and an increase in infections. Other rare adverse events, including cancer and PML (described earlier with Tysabri), could potentially occur, but these risks are still being investigated. The eighth DMT for MS is (fingolimod), which was approved in September 2010. Pronounced as “Jil-EN-ee-ah,” this is the first oral drug available for the long-term treatment of MS. Until this time, all of the other approved treatments were given either via self injections at home or infusions at a medical facility. The approval of an oral treatment provides a more convenient and comfortable option to some individuals, particularly if they do not respond to or are unable to tolerate the other approved medications. As with the other treatments, Gilenya also has potential side effects and adverse events, including a temporary slowing of the heart rate, edema (swelling) behind the eye, and liver changes. PML (described earlier with Tysabri), could potentially occur, but this risk is still being investigated. In May 2018, Gilenya became the first DMT also approved for the treatment of children and adolescents, ages 10 through 17, with relapsing forms of MS. At this time, Gilenya is the only DMT approved for this patient population, referred to as “pediatric MS.” In December 2019, FDA approved the applications from three separate pharmaceutical companies for the first for the treatment of relapsing forms of MS in adult patients. While generic treatments carry the same benefits and risks of the initially approved medication, this approval does not include the treatment of children and adolescents. Details on when these generic versions will be available to the MS community have not yet been announced. In September 2012, (oral teriflunomide) became the ninth FDA-approved DMT for relapsing forms of MS — and the second approved DMT that is taken orally. Aubagio has been approved in two dose levels: 7 mg and 14 mg. While the higher dose (14 mg) shows greater effectiveness, for individuals who may be more sensitive to the drug and experience greater side effects, the lower dose (7 mg) may be more appropriate. In October 2014, Phase III data was added to Aubagio’s label, noting that it may (1) reduce the relative risk of sustained disability progression (along with reducing the annual relapse rate) and (2) prevent or delay a second clinical attack (relapse) in individuals with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). Common adverse events include headache, elevations in liver enzymes, hair thinning, diarrhea, nausea, neutropenia (a condition that reduces the number of certain white blood cells that normally fight infection), and paresthesia (tingling, burning, or numbing sensation). More severe adverse events include the risk of severe liver injury and the risk of birth defects if used during pregnancy. (dimethyl fumarate or DMF, formerly known as BG-12) was approved by the FDA as a first-line therapy for the long-term treatment of relapsing forms of MS in March 2013. This is the 10th DMT for the long-term treatment of MS. Tecfidera is administered in pill form orally and is the third oral DMT approved for MS. The approved dosage is 240 mg to be taken two times daily. Clinical trials with Tecfidera showed a reduction in relapse rate, a delay in progression of physical disability, and a slowing in the development of brain lesions, as compared to placebo. The most commonly reported side effects are flushing and gastrointestinal events, occurring more often at the beginning of treatment, and decreasing in frequency after the first one to two months on this medication. PML (described earlier with Tysabri), could potentially occur, but this risk is still being investigated. In August 2020, the FDA awarded early approval of (dimethyl fumarate), an oral medication approved in 2013 for relapsing forms of MS in adults (as noted above). This is the first generic of any MS oral treatment available to individuals in the United States. Generic treatments have the same active ingredients and carry the same benefits and risks of the initially approved (brand-name) medication. Inactive ingredients can differ with generic medications, and generic treatments are not required to conduct the same degree of rigorous clinical trials prior to approval. Mylan’s generic version of Tecfidera is given in the same dosage, with both 120-mg and 240-mg delayed-release capsules available. In March 2019, (siponimod) oral tablets became the 16th approved DMT to treat adults with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS). The approval includes individuals with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), and active secondary-progressive MS (SPMS) – a form of MS where someone with RRMS advances to experiencing a more steady increase in disability, but relapses are still occurring. Taken by mouth once daily, Mayzent has been shown to reduce the risk of three-month and six-month confirmed disability progression (CDP), slow the rate of brain volume loss, and reduce the annual relapse rate. Headache, high blood pressure, and changes in liver function tests were the most common adverse reactions reported. Patients taking Mayzent need to be monitored for changes in vision caused by macular edema, transient decreases in heart rate, decline in lung function, and changes in liver enzymes; women who could become pregnant should use contraception during and for 10 days after stopping treatment. Also in March 2019, (cladribine) oral tablets became the 17th approved DMT to treat adults with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS). The approval is for individuals with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) and for individuals with active secondary-progressive MS (SPMS). Mavenclad is generally recommended for patients who have had an inadequate response to, or are unable to tolerate, an alternate drug indicated for the treatment of MS. This oral medication is given in two annual courses for a maximum of 20 days over two years; no treatment is needed for Years 3 and 4. Mavenclad has been shown to reduce disease activity in patients with relapsing MS, including disability progression, annualized relapse rate, and MRI activity. Potential adverse events include lymphopenia, a condition that causes abnormally low counts of white blood cells that play a role in fighting infection, and herpes zoster infection. Mavenclad has a Boxed Warning for an increased risk of malignancy (cancer) and fetal harm. The most common adverse reactions include upper respiratory tract infections, headache, and decreased lymphocyte counts. In December 2019, the FDA approved (diroximel fumarate) oral capsules to treat adults with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS). This approval includes the treatment of clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), and active secondary-progressive MS (SPMS). This medication is taken by mouth twice daily. Vumerity is in the same class of MS therapy as Tecfidera (dimethyl fumarate), but is believed to cause fewer gastrointestinal (GI) side effects – such as diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. (ozanimod) was approved in March 2020 for the treatment of adults with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS). This once-daily oral medication is a sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator and joins two other previously approved S1P receptor modulators: Gilenya (fingolimod) and Mayzent (siponimod). However, unlike the first two medications, Zeposia does not require a genetic test or label-based first-dose observation. In clinical trials, Zeposia was shown to have a significant effect on reducing the annual relapse rate (ARR) as well as the number of brain lesions, when compared to Avonex (interferon beta-1a). The most common adverse reactions include: upper respiratory infection; elevated liver enzymes; orthostatic hypotension, which is a sudden drop in blood pressure when changing position; urinary tract infection; back pain; and high blood pressure. Warnings and precautions include an increased risk of infections, heart-rhythm issues, liver injury, fetal risk if pregnant while taking Zeposia, a decline in pulmonary (respiratory) function, and macular edema (swelling behind the eye). The launch date for Zeposia has not yet been announced. In April 2020, the FDA approved (monomethyl fumarate) delayed-release oral capsules to treat relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS). Bafiertam is a “bioequivalent alternative” to Biogen’s Tecfidera (dimethyl fumarate), which means that the active ingredient and site of action do not differ significantly between the two medications. The therapeutic effect is assumed to be equivalent. Since a lower dose of Bafiertam is equivalent to Tecfidera, this may potentially lead to a reduction in gastrointestinal (GI) side effects, such as diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. However, these side effects have not been evaluated in clinical trials in people with relapsing forms of MS. The launch date for Bafiertam has not yet been announced. Individuals are usually prescribed only one type of DMT during any one time period. Several large clinical trials have been conducted to study each of these drugs separately for their safety and effectiveness in MS. Although differences exist in study design and specific findings, trials generally showed these common results: Reduced the development of new areas of inflammation as seen on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans Showed some evidence of delaying disease progression and/or disability Some may prevent or delay a second clinical attack (relapse) for individuals with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). CIS refers to individuals who do not meet the criteria to be diagnosed with MS, but have experienced symptoms. The documented effectiveness of each of these drugs varies to some extent, and differences can be attributed to the type of the drug, dose and administration, as well as variations in study design. Stronger drugs may offer greater effectiveness but may also pose greater health risks. Additionally, the effectiveness and side effects of each drug may vary from one patient to another, so individuals need to consult with their physician to determine which treatment might be the best option for them. Each of the approved treatments has side effects that are usually manageable. At this time, Novantrone is the only drug that has a set limit of doses, which is necessary to avoid cardiotoxicity (heart damage). Tysabri increases the risk of PML (described above) and patients are closely monitored through the “TOUCH Prescribing Program.” For early detection and management of potentially severe adverse events, Lemtrada is only available through the Lemtrada REMS (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy). Patients beginning on Gilenya are monitored for changes in heart rate and are given baseline evaluations for any issues with the heart, lungs, liver, eyes and vision, as well as white-blood-cell count. The other drugs mentioned earlier appear safe provided the person taking the drug is not experiencing any adverse effects and blood tests continue to be normal. While no damage to the reproductive system or the fetus has been observed, these drugs are not recommended if a woman is pregnant or considering pregnancy during her treatment period. Male patients considering certain long-term treatments may want to discuss options for family planning with their doctor. Other treatments are sometimes used to try to slow MS disease progression when other therapies have been ineffective. Such treatments are approved by the FDA for other illnesses, but not specifically for the treatment of MS. These include intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) therapy, methotrexate, azathioprine (Imuran), and cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan). In 2014, the Multiple Sclerosis Coalition (MSC) published two papers detailing the current evidence that supports the FDA-approved disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) for the long-term treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS). The first paper was written for medical professionals. The second paper summarizes the information and has been written for members of the MS community. To view either of these papers, please go to the following links: For medical professionals (updated June 2019): The Use of Disease-Modifying Therapies in Multiple Sclerosis: Principles and Current Evidence For members of the MS community (updated March 2017): The Use of Disease-Modifying Therapies in Multiple Sclerosis: Principles and Current Evidence; SUMMARY *Additional information about interferons: Some individuals develop neutralizing antibodies (NABs) to the interferons (Avonex, Betaseron, Rebif, and Extavia), but their impact on the effectiveness of these medications has not been established. Many continue to do well on these drugs despite the presence of NABs. Others may have sub-optimal results even without NABs present. The MS Council and the American Academy of Neurology have concluded that the higher-dosed interferons are likely to be more effective than lower-dosed interferons. Several factors, however, must be considered when selecting one of these drugs, and this decision must be made on an individual basis under the guidance of a qualified physician. Please note that MSAA does not endorse or recommend any specific drug or treatment. Individuals are advised to consult with a physician about the potential benefits and risks of the different treatment therapies.

This is the first therapy specifically approved to treat primary progressive MS. Potential safety issues identified by the FDA include infusion reactions and infections. There may be an increased risk of malignancy in people taking Ocrevus. More information about Ocrevus is available from Genentech:  1-844-OCREVUS (9am-8pm Eastern) Additional details and Frequently Asked Questions below DETAILS The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved Ocrevus™ (ocrelizumab - Genentech, a member of the Roche Group) for use in the treatment of and , making it the first therapy for the treatment of primary progressive multiple sclerosis. Ocrevus will be available as a first-line treatment, which means that there are no recommendations in the approved labeling for people to try other MS therapies before taking it. Ocrevus has not been tested in children.    “As the first therapy specifically approved to treat primary progressive MS, this represents a significant milestone,” said Kathy Costello, MS, ANP-BC, MSCN, Associate Vice President of Healthcare Access at the National MS Society.   “We are grateful that there is finally a disease-modifying treatment for people with primary progressive MS, and also an important new option for people with relapsing MS,” said Bruce Bebo, PhD, Executive Vice President, Research, at the National MS Society. “We hope this is just the first of many new treatments approved for people with progressive MS.”   Ocrevus is a monoclonal antibody that binds to a molecule (CD20) on the surface of immune cells called B cells, and reduces the numbers of certain B cells that are circulating in the blood. B cells have several functions including making antibodies, and they are believed to play a role in immune-system-mediated damage to brain and spinal cord tissues in MS. Ocrelizumab is administered by intravenous infusion every 6 months. The first dose is given in two infusions, two weeks apart. Subsequent doses are given as a single infusion.   The ORATORIO study involving people with primary progressive MS, which compared Ocrevus to inactive placebo, met its primary endpoint, showing treatment with Ocrevus significantly reduced the risk of progression of clinical disability by 24% compared with placebo in 732 people. Compared to placebo, Ocrevus also reduced the time required to walk 25 feet by 29%, and decreased the volume of brain lesions.   In the OPERA I and OPERA II studies involving people with relapsing MS, which compared ocrelizumab to interferon beta-1a (Rebif,® EMD Serono and Pfizer), Ocrevus significantly reduced the annualized relapse rate by up to 47% compared with Rebif over two years in a total of 1,656 people with relapsing MS. In addition, Ocrevus significantly delayed confirmed progression of disability on the EDSS scale by 40% compared with Rebif. Ocrevus also significantly reduced active inflammation observed on MRI scans by up to 95%, and total damage on MRI scans by up to 83% compared with Rebif.  (.pdf) for Ocrevus includes several warnings and precautions. Ocrevus can cause a wide variety of infusion-related reactions, the most frequent being itchy skin, rash, irritation in the throat, flushed face or fever, headache or other symptoms. In rare cases, these can be life-threatening. Infusion reactions occur most frequently with the first infusion, and they can occur up to 24 hours after the infusion. As a precaution, people are administered a steroid and antihistamine before their infusion and monitored at least one hour after infusion. Ocrevus increases the risk of infection, including respiratory tract infections and herpes infections. Ocrevus administration should be delayed in people with an active infection, and vaccination with live or live-attenuated vaccines is not recommended during treatment and not until B cells have been repopulated following treatment. There may be an increased risk of malignancy (cancers), including breast cancer, in people taking Ocrevus. Individuals using Ocrevus should follow standard breast cancer screening guidelines.The clinical trial results and ongoing monitoring of trial participants indicate an imbalance in the number of cancers that occurred in individuals treated with Ocrevus compared to those who were on interferon in the relapsing remitting trial and those on placebo in the primary progressive trial.The numbers are too small to know for sure if this is related directly to Ocrevus. This imbalance will require continued careful observation, evaluation, and data in larger numbers of individuals. PML: Although no cases of PML (progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy), a serious brain infection, occurred in clinical trials, PML has been observed in people taking related medications for other conditions. Typical symptoms are diverse, progress over days to weeks and include progressive weakness on one side of the body or clumsiness, vision disturbances, and changes in thinking, memory, orientation and personality. Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation: Although no cases of hepatitis B virus reactivation have been reported in people taking Ocrevus, they have occurred in people taking similar medications. Before initiating treatment with Ocrevus, individuals should have a blood test to detect hepatitis B virus.  For more information, people with MS can contact Genentech at: 1-844-OCREVUS (9am-8pm Eastern)   For people who qualify, Genentech plans to offer patient assistance programs through Genentech Access Solutions: (866) 4ACCESS/(866) 422-2377 or http://www.Genentech-Access.com.   The approval of Ocrevus is an exciting milestone for people with primary progressive MS and an encouraging new option for people with relapsing forms of the disease. The National MS Society applauds Genentech for their leadership in setting the wholesale acquisition cost (or list price) of Ocrevus at $65,000 per year -- nearly 20 percent below the current market average for an MS treatment. The continually escalating prices of MS disease-modifying therapies are creating barriers to people with MS getting these life-changing medications. Through its action on Ocrevus, Genentech is changing industry dynamics so that more people can access the life-changing treatments they need to live their best lives. We encourage other companies to follow suit, creating a drug pricing trend that keeps patients first.    - - -Read the FDA ""Snapshot"" describing the clinical trials of Ocrevus -Read details of the clinical trials of Ocrevus in two papers published in the December 21, 2016 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine: “Ocrelizumab versus Placebo in Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis” (Dr. Xavier Montalban and others) “Ocrelizumab versus Interferon Beta-1a in Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis” (Dr. Stephen Hauser and others)   Ocrevus is a trademark of Genentech, a member of the Roche Group.

Ocrevus™ (ocrelizumab - Genentech, a member of the Roche Group) is a monoclonal antibody that binds to a molecule (CD20) on the surface of immune cells called B cells, and reduces the numbers of certain B cells that are circulating in the blood. B cells have several functions including making antibodies, and they are believed to play a role in immune-system-mediated damage to brain and spinal cord tissues in MS.   A. The FDA has approved ocrelizumab for the treatment of adults with  and with .   Q. Will everyone who has primary progressive MS benefit from Ocrevus? A. We don’t know, since like all clinical trials, the Ocrevus trial in primary progressive MS limited the characteristics of people who could participate. The trial only included people who were aged 18 to 55, who had an EDSS (Expanded Disability Status Scale – a scale to assess neurological functioning used in clinical trials) score of up to 6.5 (meaning they were able to walk with the help of a walker or bilateral crutches or other devices on both sides), and who had evidence of immune proteins in a test of their spinal fluid (“oligoclonal bands”). It is not possible to predict how a specific individual will respond to treatment. The use of Ocrevus in clinical practice will help determine who is likely to benefit.   Q. Will Ocrevus help people with secondary progressive MS who are no longer experiencing relapses? A. We don’t know. So far, the clinical trials of Ocrevus have involved people with relapsing forms of MS and primary progressive MS. Results were announced as positive for the trials in these populations. There is no data yet on whether Ocrevus may be effective in those people with secondary progressive MS who are no longer experiencing relapses.   A. Ocrevus is administered by intravenous (into a vein) infusion every 6 months. At the beginning of treatment there are two doses separated by 14 days. After that, there is a single infusion every 6 months.   Q. When will ocrelizumab be available by prescription? A. According to Genentech, people may talk to their MS doctors now about taking Ocrevus. The company expects supplies of the therapy to be available in about two weeks (around the week of April 4, 2017). Accessing the medication also depends on issues related to an individual’s health insurance.   Q. How effective is Ocrevus in primary progressive MS? A. The ORATORIO study involving people with primary progressive MS, which compared Ocrevus to inactive placebo, met its primary endpoint, showing treatment with Ocrevus significantly reduced the risk of progression of clinical disability by 24% compared with placebo in 732 people. Compared to placebo, Ocrevus also reduced the time required to walk 25 feet by 29%, and decreased the volume of brain lesions.   A. In the OPERA I and OPERA II studies involving people with relapsing MS, which compared ocrelizumab to interferon beta-1a (Rebif,® EMD Serono and Pfizer), Ocrevus significantly reduced the relapse rate by up to 47% compared with Rebif over two years in a total of 1,656 people with relapsing MS. In addition, Ocrevus significantly delayed confirmed progression of disability on the EDSS scale by 40% compared with Rebif. Ocrevus also significantly reduced active inflammation observed on MRI scans by up to 95%, and total damage on MRI scans by up to 83% compared with Rebif. Q. Should individuals who have relapsing MS switch from their current therapy to Ocrevus? A. The decision about whether to take Ocrevus should be made in collaboration with your MS doctor, taking into account a variety of factors including the effectiveness of any therapy you are currently using, the potential risks and benefits, as well as costs and lifestyle factors. Important questions to be considered and discussed with your doctor in terms of Ocrevus include: What is my tolerance for the risk of known side effects? What is my tolerance for the risk of adverse consequences that might emerge with longer-term use? How will my medication choice affect my ability or plans to become pregnant?  Q. If I have been taking another disease-modifying therapy for MS, how long will I have to wait before starting the Ocrevus? A.  There is no wash-out or waiting time currently established or recommended for switching from another therapy to Ocrevus. Therefore a decision to wait or proceed needs to be made in collaboration with your MS doctor.   Q. What are the potential side effects of Ocrevus? A.  (.pdf) for Ocrevus includes several warnings and precautions. Ocrevus can cause a wide variety of infusion-related reactions, the most frequent being itchy skin, rash, irritation in the throat, flushed face or fever, headache or other symptoms. In rare cases, these can be life-threatening. Infusion reactions occur most frequently with the first infusion, and they can occur up to 24 hours after the infusion. As a precaution, people are administered a steroid and antihistamine before their infusion and monitored at least one hour after infusion. Ocrevus increases the risk of infection, including respiratory tract infections and herpes infections. Ocrevus administration should be delayed in people with an active infection. Vaccinations need to be administered at least 6 week prior to starting Ocrevus and vaccination with live or live-attenuated vaccines is not recommended during treatment and not until B cells have been repopulated following treatment. PML: Although no cases of PML (progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy), a serious brain infection, occurred in clinical trials, PML has been observed in people taking related medications. Typical symptoms are diverse, progress over days to weeks and include progressive weakness on one side of the body or clumsiness, vision disturbances, and changes in thinking, memory, orientation and personality. Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation: Although no cases of hepatitis B virus reactivation have been reported in people taking Ocrevus, they have occurred in people taking similar medications. Before initiating treatment with Ocrevus, individuals should be given a blood test to detect hepatitis B virus.  Although there is long-term safety data available on other medications that work in a similar fashion (those medications that deplete B cells), the long-term safety of Ocrevus is unknown at this time.   A. There may be an increased risk of malignancy (cancers), including breast cancer, in people taking Ocrevus. Individuals using Ocrevus should follow standard breast cancer screening guidelines. The clinical trial results and ongoing monitoring of trial participants indicate an imbalance in the number of cancers that occurred in individuals treated with Ocrevus compared to those who were on interferon in the relapsing remitting trial and those on placebo in the primary progressive trial. The numbers are too small to know for sure if this is related directly to Ocrevus. This imbalance will require continued careful observation, evaluation, and data in larger numbers of individuals.   Q. Has Ocrevus been proven to be more effective than other disease-modifying therapies? A. Ocrevus has only been compared to Rebif® (interferon beta-1a, EMD Serono and Pfizer). In two phase III studies in a total of 1,656 people with relapsing MS (people with relapsing-remitting MS and those with secondary-progressive MS who were experiencing relapses), Ocrevus significantly reduced relapse rates after two years compared to Rebif. Ocrevus has not been compared in clinical trials to other disease-modifying therapies.   A. There is no specified time limit for taking Ocrevus. Like with other disease modifying medications, Ocrevus would likely be continued if the person’s MS is stable, and is experiencing no adverse events or new safety issues that could be ascribed to the medication.   Q. Will people taking Ocrevus have to get any special medical tests or monitoring? A. Your doctor will need to run a blood test prior to starting this medication to test for hepatitis B infection. For individuals with relapsing MS, some MS doctors might like to have a new “baseline” MRI prior to starting a new medication. This will be at the discretion of your doctor. Individuals using Ocrevus should follow standard breast cancer screening guidelines.   Q. Will Ocrevus help my mobility, prevent me from getting worse or reverse my progressive disability? A. Based on results from the clinical trials, Ocrevus is not likely to significantly reverse an individual’s disability, but may help stabilize it. In the ORATORIO trial for primary progressive MS, treatment with Ocrevus significantly reduced the risk of progression of clinical disability. This reduced risk of progression means that people taking Ocrevus in the trial were 24% less likely to demonstrate worsening of disability than people taking placebo. Ocrevus also reduced the time required to walk 25 feet, and decreased the volume of brain lesions. This means that as a group, people taking Ocrevus in the trial had a lower risk of progression, improved in their 25-ft walk speed and had reduced volume of brain lesions. However, it is not possible to predict how any one individual will respond to this or any other therapy.   Q. Will Ocrevus reduce disease activity in relapsing MS? A. As a group, people taking ocrelizumab in the trial had fewer relapses, fewer new or enlarging lesions on MRI and less risk of disability worsening than people who were taking Rebif (interferon beta-1a). However, it is not possible to predict how any one individual will respond to this or any other therapy.   Q. Can I continue to take supplements while on Ocrevus, such as Biotin, vitamin D, vitamin B12, etc.? A. Yes. However, it is essential that your MS doctor knows all of the prescription and over-the-counter medications, supplements and vitamins you are taking. Q. What about vaccinations and Ocrevus? Can I have a flu shot, the pneumonia shot, and the vaccine for shingles? A. Individuals should wait 6 weeks after being vaccinated before beginning therapy with Ocrevus. Any vaccination with live or live-attenuated viruses is not recommended during treatment with Ocrevus, and not until B cells have been repopulated following treatment. Individuals should speak to their doctors about whether the shot they are considering is available in an inactivated form.   Q. How often should I have an MRI while on Ocrevus? A. Your MS doctor will guide you on how often an MRI is needed. The 2015 Revised Recommendations of the Consortium of MS Centers’ Task Force for a Standardized MRI Protocol and Clinical Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Follow-Up of Multiple Sclerosis suggest a brain MRI approximately 6 months after switching to a new treatment and then routine brain MRI every 6 months to 2 years for all of those with relapsing MS. Currently there are no recommendations regarding the frequency of MRI in primary progressive MS.   Q. Will my immune system be suppressed or compromised if I take Ocrevus? Will I be more likely to “catch” ordinary infections if I take this medication? A. Ocrevus increases the risk of infection, including respiratory tract infections and herpes infections.   Q. Can I continue my other medications while I am on Ocrevus, such as Ampyra,® baclofen, and bladder medications? A. You can continue to take all of your MS symptom management medications. However, it is essential that your MS doctor knows all of the prescription and over-the-counter medications, supplements and vitamins you are taking.   Q. Will I need to have a spinal tap before starting Ocrevus? A. No.   Q. What if I no longer live in my own home. Can I still get Ocrevus if I live at an assisted living facility or a nursing home? A. Whether you live at home or in a facility should not affect your ability to be on Ocrevus. However, insurance coverage may impact access to the medication.   Q. What are the differences between relapsing-remitting MS, secondary progressive MS and primary progressive MS? A. Relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) is characterized by clearly defined attacks of new or increasing neurologic symptoms. These attacks – also called relapses or exacerbations – are followed by periods of partial or complete recovery (remissions). Secondary progressive MS (SPMS) follows an initial relapsing-remitting course. Many people who are diagnosed with RRMS will eventually transition to an SPMS course in which there is progressive worsening of neurologic function (accumulation of disability) over time. Primary progressive MS (PPMS) is characterized by worsening neurologic function (accumulation of disability) from the onset of symptoms, without early relapses or remissions. “Relapsing forms” of MS is a phrase that includes RRMS as well as progressive MS in those individuals who continue to experience relapses.   Q. Is Ocrevus more likely to help me if my disability from primary progressive MS is mild versus severe? A. It is not known who will benefit most from the use of Ocrevus. The study involving people with primary progressive MS only included individuals between the ages of 18 and 55, who had scores on the EDSS disability scale between 2.0 (minimal disability) to 6.5 (able to walk with the help of a walker or bilateral crutches or other devices on both sides). It is not possible to predict how a specific individual will respond to treatment.   Q. Is it better to take it earlier than later for treating progressive MS? A. In the ORATORIO trial for primary progressive MS, the average time from diagnosis in participants was 3.3 years. It is not known how the medication will work in people who have had primary progressive MS for longer periods of time.   Q. Is it better to take Ocrevus earlier than later for treating relapsing MS? A. In general, early and consistent treatment with a disease-modifying therapy is recommended. () However, it is not yet specifically known whether it is better to use Ocrevus earlier or later, and it is not known whether it is better to use Ocrevus before or after other disease-modifying therapies.   Q. Is there a point at which Ocrevus does not work? A. There is no known point in time when this or any MS therapy may stop working effectively. Each individual will respond differently to any given therapy, and response to treatment must be assessed regularly by your MS doctor.   A. The list price has been announced as $65,000 per year. However, the price of Ocrevus to an individual who has MS will depend on the provisions of his or her insurance coverage and the degree to which that individual will be eligible for programs designed to assist with out-of-pocket costs.   Q. What is the National MS Society’s response to the posted price of Ocrevus? A. The approval of Ocrevus is an exciting milestone for people with primary progressive MS and an encouraging new option for people with relapsing forms of the disease. The National MS Society applauds Genentech for their leadership in setting the wholesale acquisition cost (or list price) of Ocrevus at $65,000 per year — nearly 20 percent below the current market average for an MS treatment. The continually escalating prices of MS disease-modifying therapies are creating barriers to people with MS getting these life-changing medications. Through its action on Ocrevus, Genentech is changing industry dynamics so that more people can access the life-changing treatments they need to live their best lives. We encourage other companies to follow suit, creating a drug pricing trend that keeps patients first.    A. Coverage will depend on individual insurance plans. For people who qualify, Genentech plans to offer patient assistance programs through Genentech Access Solutions: (866) 4ACCESS/(866) 422-2377 or http://www.Genentech-Access.com.   Q. Where can I get information about the support that Genentech will provide to help people gain access to Ocrevus? A. Physicians and people with MS can contact Genentech for information about access at Genentech Access Solutions: (866) 4ACCESS/(866) 422-2377 or http://www.Genentech-Access.com.   Q. Is Ocrevus the same as rituximab, which is a therapy used to treat some cancers? A. No, and Ocrevus is not a derivative of rituximab. Both rituximab and Ocrevus work by depleting B cells. However, the two medications are not the same. Based on published reports, Ocrevus is manufactured differently than rituximab. Ocrevus is mostly human, and rituximab is equal parts mouse and human. These monoclonal antibodies bind to specific, but overlapping, areas of a molecule on immune B cells (called CD20 cells). There are also differences in the ways that rituximab and Ocrevus induce the death of CD20 B cells. Whether these differences are meaningful in terms of potential effectiveness in MS, or in terms of safety, is difficult to say at this time.    Q. Are there other therapies in development for progressive MS? A. Yes. The Society is closely watching clinical trials that could lead to treatments for people with progressive forms of MS. For example, positive results were recently announced from a trial of BAF-312 (Siponimod) in secondary progressive MS.  In addition, other studies include: The MS-SMART trial is testing three therapies that may have nerve-protecting properties in secondary progressive MS (with the MS Society of the U.K.). The SPRINT-MS trial of Ibudilast, an oral anti-inflammatory agent, is ongoing in people with secondary progressive and primary progressive MS thanks to a unique collaboration between NIH's NeuroNEXT Network, MediciNova, and the National MS Society. The MS-STAT2 study getting underway at University College London is a multicenter trial testing whether a repurposed cholesterol-lowering therapy can slow the course of secondary progressive MS; the Society is providing funding.The Society is also very interested in wellness research to identify exercise, dietary and other approaches that will help people who have MS live their best lives. The Society supports several clinical trials that are investigating dietary interventions for symptom management and for their potential to modify the disease process.  Q: Based on these trial results, is there still a need to invest in additional research on progressive MS? A:  Yes. We need to continue our investment in research to find solutions for progressive MS.  This trial is the first success after many disappointments. We welcome this development, but we must remain focused on finding more and better solutions for treating all forms of progressive MS. We will do this by our continued leadership in the International  and by funding research on progressive MS through our own research programs, and by encouraging other companies to commit to developing treatments for progressive forms of MS.   Multiple sclerosis is an unpredictable, often disabling . range from numbness and tingling to blindness and paralysis, and there is currently no cure for MS. The progress, severity and specific symptoms of MS in any one person cannot yet be predicted, but advances in and are leading to better understanding and moving us closer to . An estimated 1 million people live with MS in the United States. Most are diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 50, and it affects women three times more than men. © 2020 The National Multiple Sclerosis Society is a tax exempt 501(c)3 nonprofit organization.

Zaffaroni, Tomasz Zielinski Background: Opicinumab is a human monoclonal antibody against LINGO-1, an inhibitor of oligodendrocyte differentiation and axonal regeneration. Previous findings suggested that opicinumab treatment might enhance remyelination in patients with CNS demyelinating diseases. We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of opicinumab in patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis. Methods: We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging, phase 2 study (SYNERGY) at 72 sites in 12 countries. Participants (aged 18–58 years) with relapsing multiple sclerosis (relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis and secondary progressive multiple sclerosis with relapses) were randomised in a 1:2:2:2:2 ratio by an interactive voice and web response system to opicinumab 3 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, 30 mg/kg, or 100 mg/kg, or placebo. An identical volume of study drug was administered intravenously once every 4 weeks. All participants self-administered intramuscular interferon beta-1a as background anti-inflammatory treatment once a week. The primary endpoint was the percentage of participants achieving confirmed disability improvement over 72 weeks, which was a multicomponent endpoint measured by the Expanded Disability Status Scale, the Timed 25-Foot Walk, the Nine-Hole Peg Test, and the 3 s Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test. The primary endpoint was analysed under intention-to-treat principles. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01864148. Findings: Between Aug 13, 2013, and July 31, 2014, 419 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned either placebo (n=93) or opicinumab 3 mg/kg (n=45), 10 mg/kg (n=95), 30 mg/kg (n=94; one patient did not receive the assigned treatment), or 100 mg/kg (n=92). The last patient visit was on March 29, 2016. Confirmed disability improvement over 72 weeks was seen in 45 (49%) of 91 patients assigned to placebo, 21 (47%) of 45 assigned to opicinumab 3 mg/kg, 59 (63%) of 94 assigned to opicinumab 10 mg/kg, 59 (65%) of 91 assigned to opicinumab 30 mg/kg, and 36 (40%) of 91 assigned to opicinumab 100 mg/kg. A linear dose-response in the probability of confirmed disability improvement was not seen (linear trend test p=0·89). Adverse events occurred in 79 (85%) patients assigned placebo and in 275 (85%) assigned any dose of opicinumab. The most common adverse events of any grade in patients assigned any dose of opicinumab included influenza-like illness (140 [43%] with any dose of opicinumab vs 37 [40%] with placebo), multiple sclerosis relapses (117 [36%] vs 30 [32%]), and headache (51 [16%] vs 23 [25%]). Serious adverse events reported as related to treatment were urinary tract infection in one (1%) participant in the the placebo group, suicidal ideation and intentional overdose in one (1%) participant in the 30 mg/kg opicinumab group, bipolar disorder in one (1%) participant in the 100 mg/kg opicinumab group, and hypersensitivity in four (4%) participants in the 100 mg/kg opicinumab group. One patient in the opicinumab 30 mg/kg group died during the study due to a traffic accident, which was not considered related to study treatment. Interpretation: Our findings did not show a significant dose-linear improvement in disability compared with placebo in patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis. Further studies are needed to investigate whether some subpopulations identified in the study might benefit from opicinumab treatment at an optimum dose. Funding: Biogen.

N2 - Background: Opicinumab is a human monoclonal antibody against LINGO-1, an inhibitor of oligodendrocyte differentiation and axonal regeneration. Previous findings suggested that opicinumab treatment might enhance remyelination in patients with CNS demyelinating diseases. We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of opicinumab in patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis. Methods: We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging, phase 2 study (SYNERGY) at 72 sites in 12 countries. Participants (aged 18–58 years) with relapsing multiple sclerosis (relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis and secondary progressive multiple sclerosis with relapses) were randomised in a 1:2:2:2:2 ratio by an interactive voice and web response system to opicinumab 3 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, 30 mg/kg, or 100 mg/kg, or placebo. An identical volume of study drug was administered intravenously once every 4 weeks. All participants self-administered intramuscular interferon beta-1a as background anti-inflammatory treatment once a week. The primary endpoint was the percentage of participants achieving confirmed disability improvement over 72 weeks, which was a multicomponent endpoint measured by the Expanded Disability Status Scale, the Timed 25-Foot Walk, the Nine-Hole Peg Test, and the 3 s Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test. The primary endpoint was analysed under intention-to-treat principles. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01864148. Findings: Between Aug 13, 2013, and July 31, 2014, 419 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned either placebo (n=93) or opicinumab 3 mg/kg (n=45), 10 mg/kg (n=95), 30 mg/kg (n=94; one patient did not receive the assigned treatment), or 100 mg/kg (n=92). The last patient visit was on March 29, 2016. Confirmed disability improvement over 72 weeks was seen in 45 (49%) of 91 patients assigned to placebo, 21 (47%) of 45 assigned to opicinumab 3 mg/kg, 59 (63%) of 94 assigned to opicinumab 10 mg/kg, 59 (65%) of 91 assigned to opicinumab 30 mg/kg, and 36 (40%) of 91 assigned to opicinumab 100 mg/kg. A linear dose-response in the probability of confirmed disability improvement was not seen (linear trend test p=0·89). Adverse events occurred in 79 (85%) patients assigned placebo and in 275 (85%) assigned any dose of opicinumab. The most common adverse events of any grade in patients assigned any dose of opicinumab included influenza-like illness (140 [43%] with any dose of opicinumab vs 37 [40%] with placebo), multiple sclerosis relapses (117 [36%] vs 30 [32%]), and headache (51 [16%] vs 23 [25%]). Serious adverse events reported as related to treatment were urinary tract infection in one (1%) participant in the the placebo group, suicidal ideation and intentional overdose in one (1%) participant in the 30 mg/kg opicinumab group, bipolar disorder in one (1%) participant in the 100 mg/kg opicinumab group, and hypersensitivity in four (4%) participants in the 100 mg/kg opicinumab group. One patient in the opicinumab 30 mg/kg group died during the study due to a traffic accident, which was not considered related to study treatment. Interpretation: Our findings did not show a significant dose-linear improvement in disability compared with placebo in patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis. Further studies are needed to investigate whether some subpopulations identified in the study might benefit from opicinumab treatment at an optimum dose. Funding: Biogen.

It affects quality of life and correlates with worsened disease outcome. Out approach is to try to systematically identify and treat this problem early and effectively. Q: How common are cognitive disorders present in MS? The prevalence of cognitive impairment in MS is estimated to be between 40 and 65 percent (Bobholz and Rao, 2003; Benedict, Zivadinov, 2011). The cognitive abilities most often affected include episodic memory (recall of previously studied information, like a shopping list or story), working memory (temporary on-line maintenance and manipulation of information), divided attention (multi-tasking ability), and speed processing. Language, executive, and visuospatial functions are relatively spared. However, there is considerable variation in the neuropsychological presentation of MS patients. For example, one study identified six distinct cognitive profiles among patients with relapsing MS entering a trial of interferon-β1a (Fischer, 1999). The largest subgroup, which included 34% of the sample, was cognitively intact. Only 2% showed global cognitive impairment across multiple cognitive domains. The remainder showed circumscribed deficits in two to three cognitive domains. At the Mellen Center, we specifically inquire about the presence of cognitive symptoms at each visit. This is done both in our previsit screening questionnaire and as part of our review of symptoms for each visit. If this is an issue for the patient or their families, we inquire more deeply into this issue. Q: What other factors need to be considered when a patient states they have cognitive problems? (Differential diagnosis) Early in the process of cognitive evaluation for MS patients, other facts should be considered. Standard assessment of laboratory parameters used for general cognitive disorders should be undertaken (For example, thyroid indices and vitamin B12 level). The patient should have an assessment for depression to ensure that the problem is not primarily related to an emotional disorder (see below). Questions about sleep disturbance should be asked as sleep disorders are common in MS and may affect cognitive abilities. The medication the patient is taking should be evaluated for negative impact on cognition. Q: Do physical disability, disease course, and disease duration correlate with cognitive dysfunction in MS? Level of physical disability, as measured with the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), has at best a modest correlation with severity of cognition in MS. This is not surprising since the EDSS is heavily influenced by non-cognitive signs and symptoms, such as ambulation. Several studies have shown that cognitive dysfunction is greater in secondary progressive than in relapsing-remitting MS (Gaudino, Chiaravalloti et al.,2001). Cross-sectioning studies have found only a modest relationship between duration of the disease and the extent of cognitive impairment. As noted above, this is likely due to the inter-patient variability in the presentation of cognitive disorders. It is important to note that cognitive changes can occur early in the course of the disease (Deloire, Salort et al.,2005) and, in some patients, may never occur. Longitudinal neuropsychological studies of MS patients studied over an extended period of time suggest that approximately 5-10 percent of patients experience a discernible worsening of cognitive functioning over the course of a year (Amato et al., 2001). Unlike patients with progressive dementias, MS patients with cognitive impairment can be stable for years. In addition, recent cases reports have noted cognitive impairment as a sole manifestation of relapse of MS, with cognitive declines correlating with new lesion formation on MRI imaging. For the above reasons we also do not assume that patients with physical disabilities are cognitively impaired, now do we assume that those without physical impairment are cognitively intact. Q: Do abnormalities detected on brain MRI scans correlate with cognitive dysfunction in MS? Compared to demographic and disease variables, neuroimaging indices correlate relatively well with cognition in MS. Several studies have demonstrated an inverse relation between cognitive performance and the number of volume of lesions on conventional MRI, including T2-weighted or fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging (Rovaris and Filippi, 200). Regionally specific relations between lesion volume and cognition have been reported. For example, one study showed specific relations between frontal lobe involvement and executive functions, like conceptual reasoning (Arnett, Rao et al., 1994). Some studies have suggested that brain atrophy is a better predictor of cognitive impairment in MS than lesion volume (Bermel, Bakshi et al., 2002; Benedict, Weinstock-Guttman et al., 2004). Longitudinal studies have shown a relation between progressive brain atrophy and cognitive changes patterns in MS (Hohol, Buttman et al., 1997). There are occasional patients with subacute cognitive changes that correlate with the presence of new lesions, so that a new complaint of cognitive dysfunction may prompt further imaging to assess for disease activity (Pardini, 204). Recent studies indicate that cortical lesions are not only present in early clinical MS, but may be as common as white matter lesions (Lucchinetti 2011). Such lesions and associated tract degeneration may underly some component of the cognitive dysfunction in MS. Note that in addition there are patients with prominent cognitive symptoms with limited lesion burden or atrophy on brain imaging. In such patients, we would assess carefully for other factors such as medication, sleep disturbance, and depression masquerading as cognitive deficits (See below). Q: Do cognitive disorders correlate with other factors related to MS (for example, depression, fatigue, sleep disorders)? Emotional problems, sleep disorders, and fatigue are significantly more common in individuals with MS than in the general population. Although the relationship among these symptoms may be complex, depression has been reported to affect cognitive test performance in the areas of rapid information processing, working memory, and executive function in MS patients (Arnett, Higginson et al., 2001). Although subjective reports of fatigue do not necessarily correlate with observable deficits in cognitive function, decrements in cognitive performance occur during sustained mental effort and after completion of cognitively challenging tasks in MS patients (Krupp and Elkins, 2000; Schwid, Tyler et al., 2003). It is reasonable to assume that patients' performance may be compromised if they are significantly depressed, fatigued, or sleep deprived during cognitive testing. There are many medicines used in MS care that may have a negative impact on cognition. We assess these medicines in our patients with cognitive deficits and consider whether they can be changed to alternative medicines or whether they can be weaned off. Medicines that have such an impact include steroids (particularly IV high dose solumedrol), anticholinergics such as oxybutynin, tricyclic antidepressants, sedatives, beta blockers, muscle relaxants, etc. In addition, the chronic use of marijuana and related substances can have a negative effect on cognition. Sleep disorders may be seen with MS and may affect daytime cognitive performance. We do inquire about sleep at the Mellen Center and consider expert evaluation depending on symptoms presented (for example, snoring, restless leg, periodic leg movements, repeated awakenings, etc). There are documented events where subacute cognitive impairment is the only clinical manifestation of a relapse documented by a decline in neuropsychological function and imaging findings of new lesion formation. A subacute decline in cognition should prompt both a search for factors such as infection, new medications, or emerging illness, or imaging to assess for new lesion activity. Q: How can cognitive disorders be detected in the clinical setting? A: We note that patient self-report of cognitive deficits in unreliable. Patients with MS who are depressed will report cognitive impairment, while patients with cognitive deficits may under report their deficits. An informant (family member, close friend) is critical to assist in giving history to document cognitive impairment. One method for identifying cognitive dysfunction is to administer rating questionnaires to patients and their family members. One such scale is the MS Neuropsychological Screening Questionnaire (MSNQ), a 15-item self-informant-report inventory (Benedict, Cox et al., 2004). Results suggest that informant ratings of cognitive problems are more likely to correlate with objective neuropsychological tests than patient self-reports. Unfortunately, informant ratings are not always available in the clinical setting. An alternative approach is to use a brief cognitive screening examination. One commonly used test, the Mini-Mental State Examination, has been found to be insensitive to the cognitive impairments in MS. Performing extensive cognitive testing can be too time consuming for centers with limited staff, yet performing an annual cognitive screen may be necessary as part of ongoing MS care. Langdon and others (2012) extensively reviewed the literature on neuropsychological measures in MS. They determined that the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), with the possible addition of the California Verbal Learning Test-Second Edition and the Brief Visuospatial Memory Test-Revised learning trials, is a reasonable screen. Their expert panel judged these studies to be preferred over others when rated on psychometric qualities (reliability, validity, and sensitivity), an international application, ease administration, feasibility in the specified context, and acceptability to patients. The SDMT consists of single digits paired with abstract symbols. The patient must say the number corresponding with each symbol. The test can be administered and scored within 5 minutes. It is a sensitive test of information processing speed that is preferentially affected in MS patients. It is well validated against multiple MRI measures and has minimal practice effect. One problem with the standard SDMT is that there are not multiple versions, so as a repeated measures test this would be subject to a training effect. The California Verbal Learning Test-Second Edition comprises a 16 item word list, with four items belonging to each of 4 categories. This is read aloud 5 times in the same order to the patient at a rate slightly slower than 1 per second. This test can be completed in 5-10 minutes including instructions, testing, and responses. This test has also been validated with brain MRI measures. The Brief Visuospatial Memory Test-Revised Learning T1-3 requires the patient to inspect a 2x3 stimulus array of abstract geometric figures. There are three learning trials of 10 seconds, then the stimulus is removed and the patient is required to draw the array from memory. This study also correlates with a variety of MRI measures. Other measures which could be used include the PASAT, MOCA test, and others. At the Mellen Center we screen both with items on a self-reported quality of life scale as well as in our review of symptoms. We have not systematically used screening tools in out entire population though this would be a reasonable approach as well. Q: What is the role of neuropsychology in ascertaining and monitoring cognition? The brief cognitive screening batteries described above could be administered by a non-neuropsychologist to determine if an MS patient is experiencing some form of cognitive dysfunction. Such a result is of limited importance, however, if not tied into specific clinical management. For this to happen, it is common to refer MS patients for a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment performed by a board certified clinical neuropsychologist. Such as assessment typically entails three to four hours of testing and includes a clinical interview. Comprehensive assessments can provide detailed baseline and follow-up data as well as information that pertains to complex matters such as differential diagnosis (e.g. MS dementia versus Alzheimer's disease in an elderly patient), guidance for rehabilitation or therapies, or determination of disability status. Neuropsychology testing can be particularly helpful if work or school related performance has been questioned, potentially leading to recommendation for accommodations (for example, breaks between tasks, more time for examinations, quieter workspace, part time work, etc.) Referral to a clinical neuropsychologist, board-certified by the American Board of Clinical Neuropsychology, is recommended. Q: What non-medication interventions exist for cognitive dysfunction? Non pharmacologic treatment for cognitive impairment in MS, variously described as cognitive retraining, cognitive remediation, or cognitive rehabilitation among other labels, includes three main approaches: (1) restorative therapies that aim to improve specific abilities, (2) compensatory approaches that aim to circumvent cognitive problems through the use of cognitive strategies, and (3) adaptive approaches that aim to circumvent cognitive problems through the use of external aids and modifications (Amato and Zipoli, 2003). Recent studies have begun to assess interventions specifically designed to improve targeted aspects of learning and memory in MS (Chiaravalloti, DeLuca et al., 2005). A recent Cochrane Review found low level evidence for the benefit of neuropsychological rehabilitation in MS patients (Rosti-Otajarvi 2004). Variations in study design and conduct precluded a strong recommendation for such rehabilitative strategies. In addition to the direct treatment of cognition, it is useful to detect and treat comorbidities such as depression and fatigue that can influence cognition and quality of life (Amato and Zipoli, 2003; Bagert, Camplair et al., 2002; Bakshi, 2003). Cognitive-behavioral counseling based in neuropsychological principles has been shown to improve insight and social skills, leading to a reduction in disinhibition and social aggressiveness in cognitively impaired MS patients (Benedict, Shaprio et al., 2001) In addition, a single study indicated reduced brain atrophy in patients actively exercising, which might have an impact on cognition (Lovera, 2010). Compensatory strategies may be helpful. These include a simplified schedule of activities, reminder lists or other strategies, reducing clutter in the household, among others. Where available, vocational rehabilitation may be useful to counsel the patient on alternatives or adaptions which might assist them in the workplace. In general populations, various preventive strategies to spare cognition have been supported by epidemiological or clinical trials data. These may be worth discussing with patients concerned about preventing cognitive decline: Treating hypertension, diabetes, and other vascular risk factors Data on brain training is limited at the present time. Q: What medication approaches are there for cognitive dysfunction? Treatment of cognitive problems in MS has received relatively little clinical or empirical attention in the past. However, recent years have seen the emergence of studies of pharmacologic interventions that have undergone rigorous scientific scrutiny in well-designed clinical trials (Doraiswamy and Rao, 2004). Prevention of cognitive impairment in MS is an important target of therapy. Some disease-modifying medications have been shown to have a beneficial effect on cognition (e.g., Fischer, Priore et al. 2000). Pharmacologic strategies used to treat cognitive impairment in other disorders may have a beneficial effect on MS. A randomized, placebo-controlled study demonstrated a modest but statistically significant benefit of the cholinesterase inhibitor donepezil on memory test performance in MS (Krupp, Christodoulou et al., 2004). However, a larger multicenter study of donepezil did not confirm this finding (Krupp et al 2011). It may also be helpful to minimize, when possible, the use of medications with potential adverse cognitive consequences, such as bladder-control medications with anticholinergic effects (Tsao and Heilman, 2005). A randomized multicenter study of memantine 10mg bid in MS patients with cognitive symptoms shows more fatigue and neurological adverse events than patients on placebo and no positive effect on cognition. Higher doses of memantine may have more cognitive side effects in this population as well. Other medications considered for use in this population have not been tested in a randomized trial way. These include activating antidepressants, stimulants, and modafinil. There is limited data to support the use of these medications in this situation. Q: What do families need to think of when there are cognitive disorders? Independent of the severity of physical disability, cognitive dysfunction can have a major impact on employment and activities of daily living in MS (Rao, Leo et al., 1991). Severity of cognitive impairment, as measured by neuropsychological testing, is predictive of ability to drive (Schultheis, Garay et al., 2002), employment status (Benedict, 2005; Rao, Leo et al., 1991), success in rehabilitation (Langdon and Thompson, 1999), and social skills (Knight, Devereux et al., 1997). It is critical that patients and family members receive accurate information and psychosocial counseling to assist them in coping with these sometimes intractable consequences of MS. There are specific recommendations available on the assessment and management of cognitive impairment in MS which may be useful to families and patients with such impairment (Benedict Zacharia, et al., 2006). Specific considerations to discuss with families include safety (to avoid falls, wandering, injury); financial oversight; and driving safety. Bobholz, JA and Rao, SM (2003).

Experts Clarify How to Describe MS to Improve Care and Clinical Trials What Type of MS Do You Have? Experts Clarify How to Describe MS to Improve Care and Clinical Trials An international committee of MS experts has that clarifies how to describe the different courses of multiple sclerosis and disease activity. The statement was prompted by inconsistencies in the way MS descriptors are used by the MS community. These clarifications can improve care and access to treatments, and refine the selection of clinical trial participants so that trial outcomes can be better applied to clinical care.   The statement was an effort by the International Advisory Committee on Clinical Trials in Multiple Sclerosis, which is jointly supported by the US and the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (). The Committee provides perspective and guidance in areas of interest to planning and implementing clinical trials for new agents for the treatment of MS.   “With this published statement, we’re encouraging the healthcare and regulatory community to use the terms as described for the different subtypes of MS and for describing disease activity,” noted Fred Lublin, MD (Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai), who is senior author of the statement and two previous papers defining MS subtypes that were published in 1996 and 2013 under the auspices of the committee. “It’s critical not just for improving patient care, but also for selecting participants for clinical trials, so you are comparing apples to apples.”   The 2013 paper defined based on current clinical course:  (an initial episode of neurological symptoms), , , and . The paper also recommended adding terms to describe an individual’s current disease state, such as “active” (shown by relapse or changes on MRI) and “progression” (shown by worsening of disability independent of relapse activity). While the time period for the activity was not specified, it was recommended that an assessment be performed at least annually.   Since the 2013 paper was published, there has been confusion in the use of the terms describing a person’s current disease state and the terms have been used without reference to a timeframe. For example, in the prescription indications for recent MS therapy approvals, neither the European Medicines Agency nor the U.S. Food and Drug Administration specified a timeframe for determining disease activity. Moreover, the agencies defined activity differently; the European Medicines Agency defined “activity” as either clinical relapse or MRI-detected inflammation, whereas the U.S. Food and Drug Administration defined “activity” only in terms of relapses.   The recently published statement reiterates the definition of “activity” as clinical relapses or imaging features of inflammatory activity, evaluated annually or over another specified interval. The definition of “progression” is reiterated as clinical evidence of disability worsening, independent of relapses, in individuals in a progressive phase, evaluated annually or over another specified interval. Also, the more general term “worsening” refers to any increase in impairment or disability as the result of residual deficits caused by relapses, or increasing disability during progressive phases of MS.   “As part of its ongoing activities, the committee plans to continue to reevaluate and refine course descriptors, especially when new evidence-based methods enable pathological distinctions between MS phenotypes, said Professor Alan Thompson, Chair of the International Advisory Committee on Clinical Trials in MS and Dean of University College London’s Faculty of Brain Sciences. “This would vastly improve prognosis, treatment choices, and the development of more selective therapies.”   Read the recently published open access statement, “The 2013 clinical course descriptors for multiple sclerosis: A clarification” by Fred D.

3a21d874-d621-4ca9-814b-ae4e12ca68dd,"— — is a progressive neurological disease that can affect the . Every time you take a step, blink, or move your arm, your CNS is at work. Millions of nerve cells in the send signals throughout the body to control these processes and functions: Nerve cells communicate by sending electrical signals via nerve fibers. A layer called the myelin sheath covers and protects these fibers. That protection ensures that each nerve cell properly reaches its intended target. In people with MS, immune cells mistakenly attack and damage the myelin sheath. This damage results in the disruption of nerve signals. Damaged nerve signals can cause debilitating , including: MS affects everyone differently. The severity of the disease and the types of symptoms vary from person to person. There are , and the cause, symptoms, progression of disability may vary. The exact cause of MS is unknown. However, scientists believe that four factors may play a role in the development of the disease. MS is considered an immune-mediated disease: The immune system malfunctions and attacks the CNS. Researchers know that the myelin sheath is directly affected, but they don’t know what triggers the immune system to . Research into which immune cells are responsible for the attack is ongoing. Scientists are seeking to uncover what causes these cells to attack. They’re also searching for methods to control or stop the progression of the disease. Several genes are believed to play a role in MS. Your chance of developing MS is slightly higher if , such as a parent or sibling, has the disease. According to the , if one parent or sibling has MS, the chances of getting the disease are estimated to be around 2.5 to 5 percent in the United States. The chances for an average person are approximately 0.1 percent. Scientists believe that people with MS are born with a genetic susceptibility to react to certain unknown environmental agents. An is triggered when they encounter these agents. Epidemiologists have seen an increased pattern of MS cases in countries located farthest from the equator. This correlation causes some to believe that may play a role. Vitamin D benefits immune system function. People who live near the equator are exposed to more . As a result, their bodies produce more vitamin D. The longer your skin is exposed to sunlight, the more your body naturally produces the vitamin. Since MS is considered an immune-mediated disease, vitamin D and sunlight exposure may be linked to it. Researchers are considering the possibility that may cause MS. Viruses are known to cause inflammation and a breakdown of myelin. Therefore, it’s possible that a virus could trigger MS. It’s also possible that the bacteria or virus that have similar components to brain cells trigger the immune system to mistakenly identify normal brain cells as foreign and destroy them. Several bacteria and viruses are being investigated to determine if they contribute to the development of MS. These include: human herpes virus-6, which leads to conditions such as Other risk factors may also increase your chances of developing MS. These include: Women are more likely to develop relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) than men. In the primary-progressive (PPMS) form, numbers of men and women are approximately equal. RRMS usually affects people between the ages of 20 and 50. PPMS usually occurs approximately 10 years later than other forms. People of northern European descent are at highest risk of developing MS. There are several triggers that people with MS should avoid. Stress can trigger and worsen MS symptoms. Practices that help you reduce and cope with stress can be beneficial. Add to your day, such as or . can add to the progression of MS. If you smoke, look into . Avoid being around . Not everyone sees a difference in symptoms due to , but avoid direct sun or hot tubs if you find you react to them. There are several ways that medication can worsen symptoms. If you’re taking many drugs and they poorly, talk to your doctor. They can decide which drugs are vital and which ones you may be able to stop taking. Some people stop taking their because they have too many side effects or they believe they aren’t effective. However, these medicines are critical to help prevent relapses and new lesions, so it’s important to stay on them. Fatigue is a common symptom of MS. If you’re not getting enough sleep, this can decrease your energy even more. From to the or , infections can cause your symptoms to worsen. In fact, infections cause approximately one-third of all , according to the . Although there’s no cure for MS, there are to help manage MS symptoms. The most common treatment category is , such as oral (Prednisone Intensol, Rayos) and methylprednisolone. These drugs reduce nerve inflammation. In cases that don’t respond to steroids, some doctors prescribe . In this treatment, the liquid portion of your blood () is removed and separated from your blood cells. It’s then mixed with a protein solution (albumin) and put back into your body. are available for , but they may entail significant health risks. Talk to your doctor about whether any are right for you. While much of what causes and prevents MS is a mystery, what’s known is that those with MS are living increasingly full lives. This is the result of treatment options and overall improvements in lifestyle and health choices. With continued research, strides are being made every day to help stop the advancement of MS. — — Medically reviewed by Multiple sclerosis is a disorder where your immune system is compromised and the protective coverings of nerve cells are being attacked.

77314a19-dc77-4bf7-b9c7-5cc6306a7733,"New Drug Shows Promise in Treating Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis — Half of all people with MS are ultimately diagnosed with secondary progressive MS. This new treatment is the first to slow progression of the disease. Is a breakthrough treatment for secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) finally on the horizon? It’s still too early to answer that question, but in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, a new Novartis drug called siponimod (BAF132) was able to delay progression of the disease in people with SPMS, many of whom had already reached a stage of advanced disability. The study, funded by Novartis, included 1,651 participants from 31 countries. The results were recently published in the peer-reviewed journal . After three months of use, siponimod was able to slow down the disease’s effects by 21 percent and reduced the risk of six-month disease progression by 26 percent. Participants who took a daily oral dose of siponimod also lost less brain volume, had fewer brain lesions, and reduced their number of annual relapses by 55 percent. However, siponimod didn’t improve how well the participants could walk. The results of this study show that siponimod “can delay disability progression in typical established SPMS patients, where other approaches tested so far have been unsuccessful,” Dr. Ludwig Kappos, a professor at University Hospital of Basel in Switzerland and the principal study investigator, said in a . “These data are all the more impressive when considering that the majority of patients already had advanced disability when starting treatment.” Other experts are more cautiously optimistic, pointing out that siponimod was tested against a placebo and for a relatively short amount of time. “There’s an indication that siponimod could be useful in SPMS, but we need more studies,” said Dr. Jaime Imitola, director of the Progressive Multiple Sclerosis Multidisciplinary Clinic and Translational Research Program at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. SPMS is an advanced form of MS, an autoimmune disease that disrupts the normal flow of information in the brain as well as between the brain and body. Symptoms vary from person to person, but numbness and tingling, trouble walking, extreme fatigue, dizziness, pain, depression, and even paralysis. The estimates that more than 2.3 million people have MS worldwide. At least two to three times more women than men are affected. The majority of people with MS initially receive a diagnosis of relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). They experience occasional periods of time in which their symptoms improve or may even go away for a while. But within a decade of initial diagnosis, of people with RRMS progress to SPMS. With this form of MS, symptoms no longer wax or wane, but stick around — and get steadily worse. While researchers are always looking for new treatments for SPMS, so far other potential drugs haven’t produced . Of the 15 medications approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of RRMS, for SPMS. Siponimod is what’s known as a “disease-modifying therapy.” This is a type of drug that works to keep a disease from getting worse. By binding to lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell, and blocking them from entering the central nervous system, siponimod is able to reduce the inflammation that’s responsible for so many SPMS symptoms. “The challenge is going to be how to determine who is going to respond to this medicine and who will not,” said Bruce Bebo, PhD, executive vice president of research at the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. “It looks like the younger and closer to the conversion to SPMS you are might be factors that contribute to a response to therapy. But until [siponimod] is used more broadly, it will be hard to know for sure.” Bebo expects the risks and side effects of siponimod to be similar to the immunosuppressive drug fingolimod (Gilenya), which has a similar mechanism of action. These include a slightly higher risk for infection, slowed heart rate, macular edema, and liver damage. Novartis plans to file for approval of siponimod for SPMS with the FDA this year, which means it could be available in late 2019 or early 2020. In the meantime, Imitola stresses that it’s important for patients with MS to get a prompt diagnosis and start treatment with a MS specialist as soon as possible. “Why wait until a patient is declared to have SPMS, around 10–15 years after relapses, to reduce progression?” Imitola asked. “If you stop the disease in its tracks early on with potent medications, then a patient may never get to SPMS. That is the goal. It’s clear that the next generation of MS medications are changing the natural history of the disease. We need more medications that tackle the neurodegeneration in MS.” — Understanding Secondary-Progressive Multiple Sclerosis Promising Treatments and Clinical Trials for Relapsing-Remitting MS Understanding Secondary-Progressive Multiple Sclerosis Secondary-progressive MS (SPMS) is a form of multiple sclerosis.

77171449-0b3d-418f-92a5-ce339f5947b5,"Molecular Sensor Finds Early Signs of Multiple Sclerosis in the Brain — Even before the telltale symptoms, this glowing marker could shed light on MS disease activity. Researchers at Gladstone Institutes in San Francisco have created a molecular sensor that can detect multiple sclerosis (MS) early. The method is so precise that MS can be tracked long before disease onset when a patient first presents with symptoms. Short of performing an autopsy, the only way doctors can currently diagnose MS is by a process of elimination. Many diseases mimic MS, so getting a definitive diagnosis can sometimes take months or years. In the meantime, the patient loses any benefit he or she might gain from starting disease modifying therapy (DMT) early. But a team of scientists, led by Katerina Akassoglou, Ph.D., a senior investigator at Gladstone and a professor of neurology at the University of California, San Francisco, has found a molecular marker of MS disease activity that may one day become a test used to diagnose MS with certainty. Read More: Iron Deposits in the Brain May Also Be an Early Indicator of MS » When the protective blood-brain barrier (BBB), which separates the body’s blood supply from the brain and spinal cord, is compromised, a protein called fibrinogen leaks into the brain. This causes a chain reaction where thrombin, another protein, converts fibrinogen into fibrin—a protein not normally present beyond the BBB. The body recognizes that something is amiss when fibrin appears in the brain, and it sends immune system defenders to respond. Akassoglou’s theory is that this process causes damage to the myelin coating of nerve cells that characterizes MS. “We already knew that the buildup of fibrin appears early in the development of MS, both in animal models and in human patients, so we wondered whether thrombin activity could in turn serve as an early marker of disease,” said Akassoglou in a press release. “In fact, we were able to detect thrombin activity even in our animal models—before they exhibited any of the disease’s neurological signs.” Using an Activatable Cell-Penetrating Peptide (ACPP), which acts as a molecular tracker, researchers were able to deliver a fluorescent agent into the brain and detect thrombin, causing it to light up. “Our study showed that thrombin activity occurs early in the disease and correlates with the severity of neurologic symptoms in mice,” said Akassoglou in an interview with Healthline. “We hope that tracking thrombin might be indicative of the onset of disease activity in MS.” Although they have not yet tested this theory in humans, the results from the mouse study are promising. The hope is to adapt the ACPP for use in humans so that thrombin build-up can be seen on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. “Our future work will focus on developing a sensitive thrombin sensor for MRI imaging and testing its efficacy to detect and maybe predict the appearance of MS lesions,” explained Akassoglou. “Combined with our work on developing new methods to target fibrin actions in the central nervous system, we hope that we will be able to [define] a new pathway that can be exploited for early MS detection and the discovery of new treatments.” This is great news for anyone who is in diagnosis “limbo.” With a single MRI scan, fluorescing thrombin could give patients the answer they need. While neurologists already use MRI as a diagnostic tool, the presence of thrombin would leave no doubt as to the cause of a patient’s symptoms. Use This Free Tool to Track Your MS Symptoms and Progress » The research team isn’t stopping there, though. Akassoglou is interested in preventing the destructive fibrin build-up from forming in the first place. “My laboratory is currently working on developing specific inhibitors of fibrin actions in the central nervous system to halt the destruction caused to axons and myelin,” she said. — Promising Treatments and Clinical Trials for Relapsing-Remitting MS Could an Undiagnosed Sleep Disorder be Causing Your MS Fatigue?

CALABRESI, M.D., Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland Abstract Abstract Multiple sclerosis, an idiopathic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system, is characterized pathologically by demyelination and subsequent axonal degeneration. The disease commonly presents in young adults and affects twice as many women as men. Common presenting symptoms include numbness, weakness, visual impairment, loss of balance, dizziness, urinary bladder urgency, fatigue, and depression. The diagnosis of multiple sclerosis should be made by a physician with experience in identifying the disease. Diagnosis should be based on objective evidence of two or more neurologic signs that are localized to the brain or spinal cord and are disseminated in time and space (i.e., occur in different parts of the central nervous system at least three months apart). Magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium contrast, especially during or following a first attack, can be helpful in providing evidence of lesions in other parts of the brain and spinal cord. A second magnetic resonance scan may be useful at least three months after the initial attack to identify new lesions and provide evidence of dissemination over time. It is critical to exclude other diseases that can mimic multiple sclerosis, including vascular disease, spinal cord compression, vitamin B deficiency, central nervous system infection (e.g., Lyme disease, syphilis), and other inflammatory conditions (e.g., sarcoidosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjögren’s syndrome). Symptom-specific drugs can relieve spasticity, bladder dysfunction, depression, and fatigue. Five disease-modifying treatments for multiple sclerosis have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. These treatments are partially effective in reducing exacerbations and may slow progression of disability. Multiple sclerosis (MS) typically presents in adults who are 20 to 45 years of age. Occasionally, the disease presents in childhood or late middle age. Twice as many women are affected as men, and persons of Northern European descent appear to be at highest risk for the disease. Magnetic resonance imaging should be performed or repeated three months after a clinically suspicious episode to facilitate early diagnosis of MS. Corticosteroid therapy should be used to shorten the duration of MS relapses and accelerate recovery. Disease-modifying treatment should be started early in the course of MS to minimize irreversible axonal damage. Glatiramer and the beta interferons have different mechanisms of action. Patients with MS who have an unsatisfactory response to beta interferons should be considered for glatiramer therapy. Patients with worsening forms of MS may be referred for mitoxantrone therapy; however, this agent has acute short-term adverse effects, as well as serious long-term adverse effects that include cardiotoxicity. A = consistent, good quality patient-oriented evidence; B = inconsistent or limited quality patient-oriented evidence; C = consensus, disease-oriented evidence, usual practice, opinion, or case series.

See page 1845 for more information. The onset of MS may be insidious or sudden. Common presenting symptoms include monocular visual impairment with pain (optic neuritis), paresthesias, weakness, and impaired coordination . Frequent accompanying signs and symptoms include bladder urgency or retention, constipation, sexual dysfunction, fatigue, depression, diplopia, gait and limb ataxia, and Lhermitte’s sign (electrical sensation down the spine on neck flexion). Lhermitte’s sign (electrical sensation down the spine on neck flexion) Decreased perception of pain, vibration, or position Impaired visual acuity or red color perception with optic disc pallor and afferent pupillary defect; disconjugate eye movements Lhermitte’s sign (electrical sensation down the spine on neck flexion) Decreased perception of pain, vibration, or position Impaired visual acuity or red color perception with optic disc pallor and afferent pupillary defect; disconjugate eye movements MS frequently is overlooked because initial symptoms resolve spontaneously in most patients. Relapses occur within months or years. In some patients, however, MS has a primary progressive course from onset. Abstract The diagnosis of MS is based on the presence of central nervous system (CNS) lesions that are disseminated in time and space (i.e., occur in different parts of the CNS at least three months apart), with no better explanation for the disease process. Because no single test is totally reliable in identifying MS, and a variety of conditions can mimic the disease , diagnosis depends on clinical features supplemented by the findings of certain studies. CNS infection (e.g., Lyme disease, syphilis, human immunodeficiency virus infection, human T-lymphotrophic virus type I) CNS inflammatory condition (e.g., sarcoidosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjögren’s syndrome) CNS microvascular disease (e.g., disease caused by hypertension, diabetes mellitus, vasculitis, CADASIL) Genetic disorder (e.g., leukodystrophy, hereditary myelopathy, mitochondrial disease) Structural or compressive condition of the brain and spinal cord (e.g., cervical spondylosis, tumor, herniated disc, Chiari’s malformation) Vitamin B deficiency CNS = central nervous system; CADASIL = cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been shown to be highly sensitive in detecting clinically silent MS plaques. Consequently, findings of this imaging modality are included in diagnostic criteria that have been proposed by one set of investigators.  The major advantage of the proposed criteria is that an early diagnosis of MS can be made if an MRI scan performed three months after a clinically isolated attack demonstrates formation of a new lesion. The proposed diagnostic criteria also define MRI lesion characteristics that increase the likelihood of MS, including number of lesions (nine or more), location of lesions (position abutting the ventricles; juxtacortical, infratentorial, or spinal position), and lesion enhancement with the use of contrast medium . MRI Lesion Characteristics Suggestive of Multiple Sclerosis High signal on T-weighted and FLAIR MRI sequences (more than nine lesions) When actively inflamed, often enhanced with gadolinium contrast Position abutting ventricles (often perpendicular) Involvement of brainstem, cerebellum, or corpus callosum Incomplete cross-sectional involvement (dorsolateral common) MRI = magnetic resonance imaging; FLAIR = fluid attenuation inversion recovery; STIR = short tau inversion recovery.

A brain MRI scan is the most useful test for confirming the diagnosis of MS. MS lesions appear as areas of high signal, predominantly in the cerebral white matter or spinal cord, on T-weighted images . MRI scanning is useful for detecting structural pathology in regions that can be difficult to image by computed tomography, such as the posterior fossa, craniocervical junction, and cervical cord. A brain MRI scan performed with a high-field magnet (1.5 tesla or greater) is abnormal in almost all patients who have clinically definite MS.

This image shows multiple high-signal periventricular and white-matter lesions. Although the FLAIR sequence is the most sensitive sequence for detecting MS lesions, it is not specific for demyelination.

Sagittal images using the short tau inversion recovery (STIR) protocol reveal multiple high-signal lesions within the spinal cord, consistent with demyelination. These lesions, which also can be seen on the transverse cuts, often are situated dorsolaterally, and are usually less than one vertebral body in length. The lesions rarely cause cord swelling. MRI scans of the spinal cord in a patient with MS. Sagittal images using the short tau inversion recovery (STIR) protocol reveal multiple high-signal lesions within the spinal cord, consistent with demyelination. These lesions, which also can be seen on the transverse cuts, often are situated dorsolaterally, and are usually less than one vertebral body in length. The lesions rarely cause cord swelling. Evoked potentials (visual, brainstem auditory, and somatosensory) may be useful in demonstrating the presence of subclinical lesions in sensory pathways or in providing objective evidence of lesions suspected on the basis of subjective complaints. Of the sensory evoked potential tests, the visual evoked potential is the most useful because it can provide objective evidence of an optic nerve lesion that may not be evident on an MRI scan. In approximately 90 percent of patients with definite MS, the CSF IgG concentration is increased relative to other CSF proteins (e.g., albumin), and CSF gel electrophoresis reveals oligoclonal bands that are not present in a matched serum sample. However, an increased CSF IgG index and the presence of oligoclonal bands are not specific for MS and therefore are not diagnostic of the disease. CSF analysis probably is most useful for ruling out infectious or neoplastic conditions that mimic MS. Peripheral blood tests may be helpful in excluding other disease processes. Testing frequently includes determination of the vitamin B level, thyroid-stimulating hormone level, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and anti-nuclear antibody titers, as well as a test for Lyme disease, and a test for syphilis (rapid plasma reagin test). In unusual cases, a more extensive evaluation may include tests for anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, anti-phospholipid antibodies, Sjögren’s syndrome A and B, angiotensin-converting enzyme, human T-lymphotrophic virus type I, and very long chain fatty acids (for adrenoleukodystrophy). Rarely, human immunodeficiency virus infection and opportunistic infections can mimic MS. Certain clinical or laboratory red flags should alert physicians to a possible diagnostic error. These flags include symptoms that could be explained by localized disease; the presence of steadily progressive disease; the absence of clinical remission; the absence of oculomotor, optic nerve, sensory, or bladder involvement; and normal CSF findings. However, none of these findings excludes the diagnosis of MS. Abstract Mild spasticity may be managed by stretching and exercise programs such as water therapy, yoga, and physical therapy. Medication is indicated when stiffness, spasms, or clonus interferes with function or sleep. Baclofen (Lioresal), tizanidine (Zanaflex), gabapentin (Neurontin), and benzodiazepines are effective antispastic agents . Intrathecal baclofen therapy has a major impact on medically intractable spasticity and has largely supplanted chemical rhizotomy or myelotomy. Baclofen (Lioresal), 10 to 40 mg three times daily; in high doses, can cause weakness and fatigue Tizanidine (Zanaflex), 2 to 8 mg three times daily; in high doses, can cause weakness and fatigue Gabapentin (Neurontin), 300 to 900 mg three or four times daily; in high doses, causes fatigue Gabapentin, 300 to 900 mg three or four times daily; in high doses, causes fatigue Carbamazepine (Tegretol), 100 to 600 mg three times daily; in high doses, causes rash and neurologic side effects; requires monitoring of complete blood count and liver function Amitriptyline (Elavil), 10 to 150 mg per day at bedtime Oxybutynin (Ditropan), 5 mg once daily to 20 mg per day in divided doses; causes dry mouth and can exacerbate glaucoma or worsen urinary retention Tolterodine (Detrol), 2 to 4 mg twice daily; causes dry mouth and can exacerbate glaucoma or worsen urinary retention (these side effects occur less often than with oxybutynin) SSRIs preferred because of activating properties; can have sexual side effects Alternatives to SSRIs when sexual side effects occur: extended-release venlafaxine (Effexor) 75 to 225 mg per day, or sustained-release bupropion (Wellbutrin), 150 mg per day to 150 mg twice daily Third-line drug or for use when a patient has a sleep disorder or concomitant headaches: amitriptyline, 10 to 150 mg per day at bedtime Amantadine (Symmetrel), 100 mg twice daily; can cause rash, edema, and anticholinergic effects Modafinil (Provigil), 100 to 200 mg given in the morning; can cause jittery sensation and palpitations Baclofen (Lioresal), 10 to 40 mg three times daily; in high doses, can cause weakness and fatigue Tizanidine (Zanaflex), 2 to 8 mg three times daily; in high doses, can cause weakness and fatigue Gabapentin (Neurontin), 300 to 900 mg three or four times daily; in high doses, causes fatigue Gabapentin, 300 to 900 mg three or four times daily; in high doses, causes fatigue Carbamazepine (Tegretol), 100 to 600 mg three times daily; in high doses, causes rash and neurologic side effects; requires monitoring of complete blood count and liver function Amitriptyline (Elavil), 10 to 150 mg per day at bedtime Oxybutynin (Ditropan), 5 mg once daily to 20 mg per day in divided doses; causes dry mouth and can exacerbate glaucoma or worsen urinary retention Tolterodine (Detrol), 2 to 4 mg twice daily; causes dry mouth and can exacerbate glaucoma or worsen urinary retention (these side effects occur less often than with oxybutynin) SSRIs preferred because of activating properties; can have sexual side effects Alternatives to SSRIs when sexual side effects occur: extended-release venlafaxine (Effexor) 75 to 225 mg per day, or sustained-release bupropion (Wellbutrin), 150 mg per day to 150 mg twice daily Third-line drug or for use when a patient has a sleep disorder or concomitant headaches: amitriptyline, 10 to 150 mg per day at bedtime Amantadine (Symmetrel), 100 mg twice daily; can cause rash, edema, and anticholinergic effects Modafinil (Provigil), 100 to 200 mg given in the morning; can cause jittery sensation and palpitations In most instances, dystonic spasms respond well to carbamazepine (Tegretol) can be treated effectively with anticonvulsants or amitriptyline (Elavil). In patients with new bladder symptoms, urinalysis and culture should be performed to rule out infection, with appropriate treatment provided if needed. The first step in medical management of the neurogenic bladder is to determine whether the problem is a failure to empty urine or a failure to store urine. The history may or may not be helpful. A postvoid residual urinary volume is the best means of determining urinary retention. The anticholinergic drugs oxybutynin (Ditropan) and tolterodine (Detrol) are effective for symptoms of failure to store urine (in the absence of infection or overflow incontinence). Drug treatment of urinary retention usually is ineffective, although some patients benefit from attempts to decrease bladder neck tone using an alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonist such as terazosin (Hytrin), doxazosin (Cardura), or tamsulosin (Flomax). Bethanechol (Urecholine) may be helpful in patients with a flaccid bladder. Definitive treatment of urinary retention involves teaching the patient to perform intermittent self-catheterization, if possible. In some patients, inhaled desmopressin (DDAVP) can be used to suppress nocturnal urinary production. Constipation is common in patients with MS. It should be managed aggressively to avoid long-term complications. Fecal incontinence is rare; when it occurs, the addition of fiber can provide enough bulk to the stool to allow a partially incompetent sphincter to hold in the bowel movement long enough for the patient to reach a bathroom. Short-term use of anticholinergics or antidiarrheal agents may be effective in combating incontinence associated with diarrhea. A careful sexual history may reveal problems such as feelings of sexual inadequacy, impaired libido, or direct sexual dysfunction resulting from erectile dysfunction, impaired lubrication, spasticity, or heat-related sensory dysesthesias. Counseling, a review of the sexual side effects of medications, and medical therapy may be appropriate. In some patients with MS, erectile dysfunction can be managed effectively with sildenafil (Viagra). Depression occurs in more than one half of patients with MS. Patients with mild, transient depression can be cared for with supportive measures. Those with more severe depression should be treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which are less sedating than other antidepressants. Bedtime administration of amitriptyline can be useful in depressed patients who also are having difficulty sleeping or have headaches or other pain syndromes. This symptom often responds to rest or medication. Amantadine (Symmetrel), 100 mg twice daily, may be effective. Modafinil (Provigil), a narcolepsy drug that acts as a CNS stimulant, has been found to be effective in patients with MS; the drug is given in a dosage of 200 mg once daily in the morning. Occasionally, SSRIs can relieve fatigue in patients with MS. Amantadine has the added advantage of having anti–influenza-A properties and may be given from October to March. In a patient with an apparent relapse of MS, it is important to rule out a treatable infection such as sinusitis, bronchitis, or urinary tract infection. Corticosteroids are the mainstay of symptomatic relief for an acute relapse of MS. These agents work through immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects, restoration of the blood-brain barrier, and reduction of edema. They also may improve axonal conduction. Corticosteroid therapy shortens the duration of acute relapses and accelerates recovery. However, corticosteroids have not been shown to improve the overall degree of recovery or to alter the long-term course of MS. If a patient is having acute disability from an attack, the physician should consider treatment with a three- to five-day course of intravenous methylprednisolone (or equivalent corticosteroid) in a dosage of 1 g administered intravenously in 100 mL of normal saline over 60 minutes once daily in the morning. In patients with MS, physical therapy always should be considered because it improves function and quality of life independent of drug therapy. Supportive care in the form of counseling, occupational therapy, advice from social workers, input from nurses, and participation in patient support groups are all part of a united health care team approach to the management of MS. Some patients require temporary disability status. Patients with MS often are tempted to try alternative therapies such as special diets, vitamins, bee stings, a compound “off-label” transdermal medication (i.e., Prokarin), or acupuncture. Although definitive proof of the effectiveness of these treatments in MS is lacking, patients sometimes use them in a complementary fashion. Sole reliance on alternative therapies should be discouraged because patients then may be deprived of therapies that have been shown to be effective in the treatment of MS. Four disease-modifying therapies for the initial management of MS are available in the United States: intramuscular interferon beta-1a (Avonex), subcutaneous interferon beta-1a (Rebif), interferon beta-1b (Betaseron), and glatiramer acetate (Copaxone). A fifth agent, mitoxantrone (Novantrone), has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of worsening forms of relapsing-remitting MS and secondary progressive MS .

The beta interferons are naturally occurring cytokines with a variety of immunomodulating and antiviral activities that may account for their therapeutic effects. The three FDA-approved beta interferons that are used for MS have been shown to reduce relapses by about one third and are recommended as first-line therapy or for use in glatiramer-intolerant patients who have relapsing-remitting MS. In randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trials, use of beta interferons resulted in a 50 to 80 percent reduction in inflammatory lesions visualized on brain MRI scans. There also is evidence that these drugs improve quality of life and cognitive function. The major difference in the beta interferon drugs is that intramuscular interferon beta-1a is given once a week and subcutaneous interferon beta-1a and interferon beta-1b are given three times a week, or every other day, respectively. The adequacy of weekly dosing has been questioned. There appears to be a modest dose-response effect with the beta interferons. One study of double-dose (60-mcg) intramuscular interferon beta-1a administered once a week found no benefit over the single-dose regimen. Whether the benefit of more frequent dosing is sustained remains unclear. An increased incidence of neutralizing antibodies with the more frequent subcutaneous dosing also must be considered. Influenza-like symptoms, including fever, chills, malaise, muscle aches, and fatigue, occur in approximately 60 percent of patients treated with interferon beta-1a or interferon beta-1b. These symptoms usually dissipate with continued therapy and premedication with a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug. Dose titration at the initiation of beta interferon therapy also is a useful strategy. Other side effects of the beta interferons include injection-site reactions, worsening of pre-existing spasticity, depression, mild anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated transaminase levels. These side effects usually are not severe and rarely lead to discontinuation of treatment. Treatment with any beta interferon can result in the development of neutralizing antibodies. Although study results are variable, once-weekly intramuscular interferon beta-1a therapy has been reported to have the lowest incidence of neutralizing antibody development. The effect of neutralizing antibodies on the long-term efficacy of beta interferon therapy remains to be fully defined because titers and durations of antibody positivity (some neutralizing antibodies resolve with time) are variable. This drug is a polypeptide mixture that was originally designed to mimic and compete with myelin basic protein. Its mechanism of action is distinct from that of the beta interferons; therefore, patients may respond differently to the drug. Glatiramer in a dosage of 20 mg administered subcutaneously once daily has been shown to reduce the frequency of MS relapses by approximately one third. The drug also is recommended as a first-line treatment in patients with relapsing-remitting MS and in the treatment of patients who cannot tolerate beta interferon therapy. Glatiramer therapy results in a one-third reduction in the inflammatory activity seen on MRI scans. Glatiramer generally is well tolerated and is not associated with influenza-like symptoms. Immediate postinjection reactions include local inflammation and an uncommon idiosyncratic reaction consisting of flushing, chest tightness with palpitations, anxiety, or dyspnea, which resolves spontaneously without sequelae. Routine laboratory monitoring is not considered necessary in patients treated with glatiramer, and the development of binding antibodies does not interfere with therapeutic efficacy. A phase-III, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial found that mitoxantrone, an anthracenedione antineoplastic agent, reduced the number of treated MS relapses by 67 percent and slowed progression on the Expanded Disability Status Scale, Ambulation Index, and MRI measures of disease activity. Mitoxantrone is recommended for use in patients with worsening forms of MS. Acute side effects of mitoxantrone include nausea and alopecia. Because of cumulative cardiotoxicity, the drug can be used for only two to three years (or for a cumulative dose of 120 to 140 mg per m). There also is some concern about treatment-related leukemia. Mitoxantrone is a chemotherapeutic agent that should be prescribed and administered only by experienced health care professionals. Natalizumab (Antegren) is in the final stages of phase-III clinical trails and is under accelerated review by the FDA. In a phase-II clinical trial, this drug appeared promising in that it reduced active MRI lesions by 90 percent and decreased MS relapses by more than 50 percent. Natalizumab is a monoclonal antibody that is directed against an adhesion molecule called VLA-4. The drug is administered intravenously once a month. Despite lack of FDA approval and definitive evidence of efficacy, several other drugs commonly are used in patients with MS. A number of small clinical trials support the modest effect of intravenous IgG, azathioprine, methotrexate, and cyclophosphamide, either alone or in combination with standard therapy. Abstract Accumulating evidence indicates that the best time to initiate disease-modifying treatment is early in the course of MS. Data indicate that irreversible axonal damage may occur early in relapsing-remitting MS, and that drug therapies appear to be more effective in preventing new lesion formation than in repairing old lesions. With disease progression, the autoimmune response of the disease may become more difficult to suppress. Both intramuscular interferon beta-1a therapy and subcutaneous interferon beta-1a therapy have been shown to reduce the cumulative probability of the development of clinically definite MS in patients who present with a first clinical demyelinating episode and have two or more brain lesions on an MRI scan. Based on these data, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society supports the initiation of immunomodulating therapy at the time of diagnosis. The physician must weigh evidence and recommendations against the practical concerns of young patients for whom the prospect of starting therapy that requires self-injection may be frightening and burdensome. Furthermore, few long-term data (more than 10 years) are available on the safety and sustained efficacy of disease-modifying drugs. A patient may opt to defer therapy, hoping to be among the minority of persons with benign MS; however, certain MRI and clinical features should prompt the physician and patient to reconsider this approach. An MRI scan with contrast-enhancing lesions, a large burden of white matter disease, or any T low-signal lesions (black holes) suggests a relatively poor prognosis. It may be useful to repeat brain MRI scanning in six months or one year to determine how quickly the disease process is evolving. The presence of spinal cord lesions or atrophy also suggests a poor prognosis. Clinical features may be less useful for assessing prognosis. Once definite disability develops, it may be too late to treat that component of the disease. The ability to diagnose and treat MS has improved considerably in the past 10 years because of the availability of MRI and partially effective immunomodulating therapies. The limited efficacy of immunomodulating drugs in the later, noninflammatory stages of MS highlights the importance of developing remyelinating and neuroprotective strategies for the disease.

4d32ce6f-a506-4c83-9a63-dd864eacf8fe,"Vitamin D and Multiple Sclerosis: A Comprehensive Review Vitamin D and Multiple Sclerosis: A Comprehensive Review , –() Numerous observational studies have suggested that there is a correlation between the level of serum vitamin D and MS risk and disease activity. To explore this hypothesis, a literature search of large, prospective, observation studies, epidemiological studies, and studies using new approaches such as Mendelian randomization was conducted. Available data and ongoing research included in this review suggest that the level of serum vitamin D affects the risk of developing MS and also modifies disease activity in MS patients. Newer Mendelian randomization analyses suggest there is a causal relationship between low vitamin D level and the risk of MS. Post-hoc evaluations from two phase 3 studies, BENEFIT and BEYOND, support the findings of observational trials. Study limitations identified in this review recognize the need for larger controlled clinical trials to establish vitamin D supplementation as the standard of care for MS patients. Though there is increasing evidence indicating that lower vitamin D levels are associated with increased risk of MS and with greater clinical and brain MRI activity in established MS, the impact of vitamin D supplementation on MS activity remains inadequately investigated. Knowledge of the widespread effects of vitamin D on skeletal and non-skeletal functions, including immune functions, has developed considerably over the past 3 decades. Higher levels of vitamin D are associated with reduced risk for developing multiple sclerosis (MS), and with reduced clinical activity in established MS, including decreased risk of relapse and reduction in disease activity on brain MRI [, ]. Vitamin D supplementation may diminish the risk of MS in the general population, as well as in children of mothers supplemented before and during pregnancy []. In the information that follows, we will summarize the available data on vitamin D, with a focus on vitamin D’s effects on the risk of onset of MS and on the disease course of MS. Sources, Metabolism, and Biological Functions of Vitamin D Vitamin D is a lipid-soluble vitamin, but acts like a hormone. Unlike a vitamin, which is an essential organic compound that cannot be synthesized by the body and must be ingested, vitamin D can be synthesized []. The active form of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25[OH]VD), also known as calcitriol (Fig. ) [] has chemical similarities to typical hormones such as testosterone, estrogen, and cortisol []. The main sources of vitamin D are sunlight, diet, and supplementation (Fig. ) []. UVB in the 290–315-nm range photolyses 7-dehydrocholesterol in the skin to form pre-vitamin D3, which then isomerizes to vitamin D3 or cholecalciferol []. Foods rich in vitamin D include fatty fish (e.g., salmon, mackerel), cod liver oil, egg yolk, and shiitake mushrooms. The plant form of vitamin D is called vitamin D2 or ergocalciferol []. Cholecalciferol and ergocalciferol are also available from fortified foods (e.g., milk, cereal, some orange juice, and cheeses) and vitamin supplements. Relative to sun exposure, diet is a poor source of vitamin D, providing only 40–400 IU per food serving, whereas whole-body UVB exposure for 20 min for a light-skinned person during the summer months will produce upwards of 10,000 IU of vitamin D [, ]. However, UVB exposure and vitamin D production through the skin may be reduced with increased skin pigmentation, age, use of sunscreen, and environmental factors such as winter season, high latitude, pollution, cloud cover, and ozone levels []. For instance, sun exposure during most of the winter at latitudes above ~ 33° North (e.g., Atlanta, GA, USA; Casablanca, Morocco) and below ~ 33 degrees South (e.g., Santiago, Chile; New South Wales, Australia; Southern Cape of Africa) provides minimal, if any, vitamin D production []. Both forms of vitamin D, cholecalciferol, and ergocalciferol are biologically inactive and undergo an enzymatic transformation in the liver to 25(OH)D (calcidiol). Stimulated by parathyroid hormone, 25(OH)D goes through a second hydroxylation in the kidney or other tissues to 1,25(OH)VD (also known as calcitriol if derived from vitamin D3), which is the active metabolite (Figs.  and ) [, ]. 1,25(OH)VD has a half-life of several hours, while 25(OH)D has a relatively long half-life (20–60 days), and thus more accurately exemplifies the overall vitamin D stores in the body. This supports the standard practice of measuring 25(OH)D in serum, and represents an integrated measure of vitamin D derived from both UVB exposure and diet. As a side note, most assays that evaluate 25(OH)D do not discriminate between the original forms of vitamin D (vitamin D3 or D2). However, the latter is usually a minor component because natural sources of ergocalciferol are scarce, and ergocalciferol is more rapidly catabolized than cholecalciferol []. The active metabolite 1,25(OH)VD is released into the bloodstream and transported in the blood. It binds to the vitamin D binding protein in blood and on the surface of target tissues. 1,25(OH)VD mediates its biological effects by binding to intracellular vitamin D receptor (VDR), which then recruits cofactors to form a transcriptional complex that binds to vitamin D response elements []. This association regulates the expression of at least 500 genes that drive a variety of physical functions []. The VDR is found in almost all human tissues, not just those participating in the classic actions of vitamin D, such as bone, gut, and kidney. The non-classic actions of VDR can be allocated to three main categories: regulation of hormone secretion, regulation of immune function, and regulation of cellular proliferation and differentiation []. Vitamin D deficiency has been classically attributed to bone health. In the early 1900s, rickets, a consequence of vitamin D deficiency, was very common among children in industrialized cities, and observations were made that sunlight exposure or cod liver oil may help to prevent this condition []. Other musculoskeletal consequences of vitamin D deficiency include secondary hyperparathyroidism, increased bone turnover, bone loss, and risk of low-trauma fractures. Today, we understand that VDR is widely distributed throughout the human body and involved in many biological functions. Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with numerous diseases including cancers, cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes mellitus, infectious diseases, mental disorders, and autoimmune disorders such as type 1 diabetes mellitus, Crohn’s disease, and MS [, ]. These diseases are all linked to vitamin D levels that are sufficient to prevent rickets, but are still suboptimal. Curiously, as rickets is no longer a problem, one might assume that the vitamin D deficiency problem is also no longer an issue. However, now that we know that autoimmunity may be related to low vitamin D levels, and that the incidence of autoimmune diseases has increased, we must consider if there is a higher vitamin D threshold related to autoimmunity, or if the environment changed since the Industrial Revolution. Since multiple sclerosis (MS) is considered an autoimmune disease, it is of interest to review briefly the potential effects of vitamin D related to immune function. The active form of vitamin D plays an essential role in lymphocyte activation and proliferation, T-helper cell differentiation, tissue-specific lymphocyte homing, the production of specific antibody isotypes, and regulation of the immune response []. Targeted immune cell types include macrophages, dendritic cells, and T and B cells. Mora and colleagues (Fig. ) [] summarized the roles and effects of vitamin D on these immune cell types []: Macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) constitutively express VDRs, whereas VDR expression in T cells is upregulated only after activation. In macrophages and monocytes, 1,25(OH)VD positively impacts its own effects by increasing the expression of VDR and the cytochrome P450 protein, CYP27B1. Certain Toll-like receptor (TLR)-mediated signals also can increase the expression of VDRs. The active form of vitamin D induces monocyte proliferation and the expression of interleukin-1 (IL-1) and cathelicidin (an antimicrobial peptide) by macrophages, contributing to innate immune responses to some bacteria. 1,25(OH)VD decreases DC maturation, inhibiting upregulation of the expression of MHC class II, CD40, CD80, and CD86. In addition, it decreases IL-12 production by DCs while inducing the production of IL-10. In T cells, 1,25(OH)VD reduces the production of IL-2, IL-17, and interferon-γ (IFNγ) and attenuates the cytotoxic activity and proliferation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. The active metabolite of vitamin D might also promote the development of forkhead box protein 3 (FOXP3)+ regulatory ( ) cells and IL-10-producing regulatory type 1 (TR1) cells. 1,25(OH)VD blocks B cell proliferation, plasma cell differentiation, and immunoglobulin production. Notable in the context of this review, many of the mechanisms of vitamin D on immune processes have similarities to mechanisms described for interferon-beta []. Definition of Vitamin D Deficiency and Targeted Levels of Vitamin D The clinical definition of vitamin D deficiency and what constitutes optimal levels has been the subject of debate. Two organizations, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) and the Endocrine Society, have released separate recommendations regarding vitamin D requirements [, , ]. Blood levels of 25(OH)D as suggested by the IOM and the Endocrine Society and the recommended dietary allowances (RDAs) by both organizations are provided in Table  [, , ]. The foundational basis for the recommendations by these two organizations are fundamentally different. The IOM guidelines based their recommendation on a population model and focused on bone health (calcium absorption, bone mineral density, and osteomalacia/rickets) aiming to prevent vitamin D deficiency in 97.5% of the general population. Based on the model applied, no evidence was found that a serum 25(OH)D concentration > 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L) had beneficial effects at a population level. Therefore, the IOM concluded that the daily requirements for vitamin D were adequate to reach the “sufficient” 25(OH)D level of 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L), and that these levels were generally attained by most of the population [, ]. Alternatively, the Endocrine Society concluded that a level of 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L) was not sufficient. The Endocrine Society based their recommendations on a medical model taking into consideration available evidence on skeletal and extraskeletal effects of vitamin D, in addition to the few negative studies. Moreover, they took into consideration the low toxicity potential of vitamin D supplementation. In their view, serum 25(OH)D levels of ≥ 30 ng/mL (≥ 75 nmol/L) are “sufficient” for children and adults, levels of 40–60 ng/mL (100–150 nmol/L) are “ideal” (considering assay variability), and levels of up to 100 ng/mL (250 nmol/L) could be considered “safe” [, ]. The Endocrine Society advocates for screening and corrective action for individuals at risk of vitamin D deficiency. Such individuals include African American and Hispanic children and adults; pregnant and lactating women; older adults with a history of falls or nontraumatic fractures; obese children and adults (BMI > 30 kg/m); and patients with musculoskeletal diseases, chronic kidney disease, hepatic failure, malabsorption syndromes, and some lymphomas []. Furthermore, the group recommends supplementation at suggested daily intake and tolerable-upper-limit levels, depending on age and clinical circumstances (Table ) [, , , ]. The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for vitamin D and the tolerable-upper-limit levels vary with age and under certain circumstances such as those involving pregnancy, obesity, or comorbidities. A daily dose of 600–800 IU should satisfy the requirements for optimal bone health [], but a higher intake (1000–2000 IU) is needed to achieve and maintain 25(OH)D levels > 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L) []. Vitamin D supplements can be administered daily, weekly, monthly, or every 4 months to reach an adequate serum 25(OH)D concentration. For cases of extreme vitamin D deficiency, a bolus application of vitamin D has been proposed, but a steady-state serum 25(OH)D concentration is more likely to be maintained by more frequent, lower doses of vitamin D []. Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) is widely preferred over vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol), as it has proven to be the more potent form of vitamin D in all primate species, including humans []. Vitamin D supplementation at doses of 1500–2000 IU/day for adults as suggested by the Endocrine Society appears to be well tolerated, with relatively minor concerns about toxicity for most patients []. Caution should be exercised in patients with impairment of renal function, cardiovascular diseases, chronic granuloma-forming disorders (sarcoidosis or tuberculosis), or chronic fungal infections. Some patients with lymphoma have activated macrophages that produce 1,25(OH)VD in an unregulated fashion. 1,25(OH)VD stimulates intestinal calcium absorption []. Without vitamin D, only 10–15% of dietary calcium and about 60% of phosphorus are absorbed. Vitamin D sufficiency enhances absorption of calcium by 30–40% and phosphorus by 80% [, , ]. Vitamin D intoxication is characterized by hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, and hyperphosphatemia and in the long term, can lead to soft tissue and vascular calcification and nephrolithiasis []. After review of available literature, the Endocrine Practice Guidelines Committee concluded that vitamin D toxicity is a rare event caused by inadvertent or intentional ingestion of excessively high amounts of vitamin D []. Concerns were expressed for people with 25(OH)D levels of 150 ng/mL (375 nmol/L) or higher, when daily doses of vitamin D exceed 10,000 IU or when high intake of vitamin D is combined with high intake of calcium. A dose-ranging study reported that 10,000 IU/day of vitamin D3 for 5 months in healthy men did not alter their serum calcium or their urinary calcium excretion, which is the most sensitive indicator for potential vitamin D intoxication []. However, there is a paucity of evidence supporting the use of higher levels of vitamin D over a prolonged time []. Safety findings in three studies conducted in patients with MS using doses of vitamin D above 10,000 IU/day are noteworthy. One open-label trial of vitamin D in patients with MS evaluated the safety of a dose-escalation protocol from 4000 to 40,000 IU/day (mean of 14,000 IU/day). Concomitantly, patients received 1200 mg of calcium per day . a control group (allowed up to 4000 IU/day of vitamin D and supplemental calcium if desired) over 1 year []. All calcium-related measures within and between groups were normal. Despite a mean peak 25(OH)D level of 165 ng/mL (413 nmol/L), no significant adverse events occurred. The safety results were in line with a previously conducted, smaller study in 12 patients with MS also using doses of up to 40,000 IU []. In the third study, 15 patients with relapsing–remitting MS (RRMS) were supplemented with 20,000 IU/day of vitamin D3 for 12 weeks []. The median vitamin D level increased from 50 nmol/L (range: 31–175 nmol/L) at week 0–380 nmol/L (range: 151–535 nmol/L) at week 12 ( < 0.001). All patients completed the observation period without side effects, hypercalcemia, or hypercalciuria []. There are cases in the literature in which exceptionally high doses (considerably above the daily upper limit of 10,000 IU) led to vitamin D toxicity: Bell and coworkers described a 67-year-old woman with vitamin D intoxication. Because of a compounding error by the pharmacy, the woman had taken 600,000 IU (rather than the intended 600 IU) of cholecalciferol daily for more than 3 years, leading to reversible hypercalcemia and partially reversible renal impairment []. Fragoso and colleagues reported considerable vitamin D toxicity in 21 MS patients who were exposed to levels ranging from 8000 IU/day to extremely high, supra-physiological doses of 150,000 IU/day (average 87,000 IU) []. In order to assess the correlation between vitamin D and MS, a literature search of large, prospective, observational studies, epidemiological studies, and studies using new approaches such as Mendelian randomization was conducted. This article is based on previously conducted studies, and as such, does not involve any new studies of human or animal subjects performed by any of the authors. Since vitamin D was proposed as an important factor in MS development in the 1970s, numerous experimental and epidemiologic studies have been conducted to answer key questions such as Does vitamin D prevent MS? How does vitamin D impact MS activity? and Can vitamin D supplementation favorably alter the course of MS? Observational study data does suggest that adequate vitamin D levels may reduce the risk of MS and affect the course of the disease. However, study limitations restrict the extent to which inverse associations can be attributed to vitamin D, and additional studies are needed to further understand the nature of this association []. Epidemiologic studies substantiate that the prevalence of MS is greater at higher latitudes and tends to peak in areas with the lowest exposure to ultraviolet light [,,,,,]. Additionally, to some degree, diets rich in vitamin D-containing oily fish may offset this risk [, ]. In “historical” cohorts, the risk of MS decreased among people who migrate from higher to lower latitudes []. However, this latitudinal finding has appeared to decline in recent decades and may be linked to an increased trend towards avoiding sun exposure or staying indoors for longer portions of the day, even in warmer climates [, ]. An Australian case–control study examined whether leisure sun exposure, combined with 25(OH)D status impacts the risk of a first demyelinating event and whether this was related to a latitude gradient []. Independently, higher levels of sun exposure (past, recent, and cumulative), higher actinic skin damage and higher 25(OH)D levels were associated with significantly reduced risks of a demyelinating event. The investigators calculated that the differences in leisure sun exposure, serum 25(OH)D level, and skin type would additively account for a 32.4% increase in the incidence of first demyelinating events from the low to high latitude regions in Australia []. The independent association of sun exposure and MS risk suggests that UV light itself may influence MS risk. Partially supporting this is research that showed that experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE) could be prevented in mice through whole-body irradiation with UV light []. However, this research did not discriminate between vitamin D-related and nonrelated effects of UV light. The research did note that in the Northern Hemisphere, significantly more people with MS are born in May (9.1%), when there is less sunlight during pregnancy than in November (8.5%), when there is an increased amount of sunlight []. Some argue that this is an artifact of more births during certain months [] though others disagree []. Using data from two large cohorts of the Nurses’ Health Study involving more than 187,000 women (including 300 who developed MS during the study), Munger and colleagues evaluated the association between calculated vitamin D intake from diet or supplements and the risk of developing MS []. Women who had a higher intake of dietary vitamin D (approximately 700 IU/day) had a 33% lower incidence of MS compared with those with lower intake. In addition, women who used vitamin D supplements (≥ 400 IU/day) had a 41% reduced risk of developing MS compared to non-users. Having higher levels of 25(OH)D (irrespective of dietary vitamin D intake) also seems to predict a lower risk of MS onset. Using a longitudinal study design, Munger and colleagues evaluated serum vitamin D levels derived from blood samples of seven million US military personnel. Those with 25(OH)D levels greater than 100 nmol/L (40 ng/mL) had a 62% lower chance of subsequently developing MS []. Vitamin D Levels During Pregnancy and MS Risk in Offspring The Finnish Maternity Cohort is a comprehensive registry, established in 1983, that includes more than 800,000 women and more than 1.5 million serum samples. This cohort also served as a basis for examining the association of vitamin D levels during pregnancy and MS risk []. One hundred ninety-three patients with a diagnosis of MS, whose mothers were captured in the registry and had an available serum sample from the pregnancy with the affected child, were matched with 326 controls. Vitamin D levels were low in both groups, but lower in the mothers of MS patients than in controls [34.6 nmol/L (13.9 ng/mL) vs. 37.5 nmol/L (15.0 ng/mL);  = 0.006]. Moreover, MS risk was 90% higher in the offspring of vitamin D-deficient mothers [25(OH)D < 30 nmol/L (12.0 ng/mL)] compared with offspring of mothers who were not vitamin D deficient [relative risk, 1.90; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.20–3.01;  = 0.006] []. These data suggest that insufficient vitamin D levels during pregnancy may increase the risk of MS []. The association between neonatal 25(OH)D status and risk of MS was examined in a large population-based case–control study using data from the nationwide Danish MS Registry and the Danish Newborn Screening Biobank (DNSB) []. Data from 521 patients with MS and 972 controls were investigated. The analysis by quintiles revealed individuals with the highest risk of MS were in the lowest quintile group of 25(OH)D (< 20.7 nmol/L), and individuals the lowest risk were in the highest quintile group (≥ 48.9 nmol/L); with an odds ratio for highest vs. lowest group of 0.53 (95% CI 0.36–0.78). Children born with 25(OH)D levels < 30 nmol/L seemed to be at an especially high risk of developing MS. The additional benefits of higher levels of 25(OH)D were less pronounced []. Studies Utilizing Mendelian Randomization to Measure MS Risk Data on vitamin D and risk of MS have been largely based on observational studies that measure an inverse association. However, MS is identified as the primary cause of low 25(OH)D) and thus cannot be excluded with these methods. Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses use genetic associations to test the effects of biomarkers, such as 25(OH)D, on the risk of disease, because inherited alleles are not affected by most confounding variables or disease status [, ]. Thus, the possibility of confounding or reverse causation can largely be excluded. Three recent publications made use of this epidemiological approach. Mokry and colleagues applied genome-wide data on genetic variants that predicted blood 25(OH)D levels from the Canadian Multicentre Osteoporosis Study to participants in the International MS Genetics Consortium study []. They found that a genetically determined decrease in blood 25(OH)D level predicted increased MS susceptibility. An increase of 25(OH)D levels by 50% decreased the odds of getting MS by approximately 50% [, ]. Similar findings were seen from MR analyses using data from two populations, a US administrative claim database and two population-based case–control studies from Sweden []. The third publication, from the Network of Pediatric Multiple Sclerosis Centers, again investigated the US and Swedish datasets []. Genetic risk scores were used to estimate the causal association between low 25(OH)D levels and pediatric-onset MS. This data also supports independent and causal effects of decreased 25(OH)D levels on susceptibility to pediatric-onset MS []. Studies Contradicting the Association of Vitamin D Levels with MS Risk Ueda and colleagues investigated the link between vitamin D status at birth and risk of adult-onset MS in a population-based, multicenter, case–control study in Sweden []. The authors analyzed stored neonatal dried blood samples of 459 MS subjects and 663 controls (matched on sex, age, and residential area). There was no association between neonatal serum 25(OH)D quintiles and risk of MS as adults. When the findings were adjusted for confounding factors in early life (e.g., month of birth, latitude of birth, and breastfeeding), in adult life (e.g., sun exposure, intake of vitamin D-rich dairy products, fatty fish consumption, smoking, and body mass index at 20 years of age), ancestry, MS heredity, and socioeconomic group, results were not considerably affected []. Whether the study provided conclusive results was the subject of debate for two primary reasons: (1) blood samples at birth were not well preserved and may have been affected by substantial degradation of 25(OH)D; and (2) the range of 25(OH)D levels at birth was narrow and mostly low (mean = 29.7 nmol/L, median = 25.6, interquartile range = 17.0–38.4 nmol/L) []. Optic neuritis (ON) is a common first symptom of MS. Pihl-Jensen and coworkers conducted a cross-sectional study to assess whether 25(OH)D levels can predict later development of MS in acute ON by evaluating the differences in mean serum 25(OH)D levels between subjects with ON ( = 164) and those with MS ( = 948) []. Deseasonalized serum 25(OH)D levels of the ON onset group were used for statistical analyses. The majority (56.1%) of the patients had 25(OH)D levels below 50 nmol/L (mean 47.64 ± 21.48 nmol/L). There were no significant differences in 25(OH)D levels between ON subjects who developed MS and those who did not develop MS during the median follow-up time of 741 days ( = 0.279), indicating no statistically significant effect on the hazard of MS development. However, significant associations were found between 25(OH)D levels and elevated IgG index levels or CSF pleocytosis, both markers of inflammatory activity or risk of MS. The interpretation of the latter finding was difficult due to the risk of reverse causation. Although the role of using 25(OH)D levels as a predictor for the development of MS after acute ON could not be demonstrated, the study data do suggest that there may be a link between development of MS after acute ON. They also provide a rationale for additional research for a possible role of vitamin D in the early stages of MS []. Levels of Dietary Vitamin D Intake and Risk of MS–Implications for Public Health Whether a daily dose of vitamin D or a gestational dose of vitamin D per day is not yet proven []. Additionally, it is not known what level of serum 25(OH)D would prevent MS in a large majority of individuals. Most studies in this review reported 25(OH)D levels below 50 nmol/L (20 ng/mL) in a significant proportion of their investigated populations, which is below the healthy minimum level. Indicating that establishing a target in the general population general population, pregnant women, and their offspring to achieve the minimum levels of 25(OH)D may be considered an important goal for health (i.e., 50 nmol/L (20 ng/mL), according to IOM [, ] or 75 nmol/L (30 ng/mL), according to the Endocrine Society) [, ]. Effects of Vitamin D Status and MS Disease Activity Understanding how existing vitamin D levels and vitamin D exposure affect clinical relapses and MS lesion activity is critically important to this review. As such, the findings from larger studies investigating these effects are summarized below. Impact of Vitamin D Levels on Disease Activity in RRMS: Observational Studies In a prospective longitudinal study from the Netherlands, 25(OH)D was measured every 8 weeks for a mean of 1.7 years in 73 patients with RRMS []. Fifty-eight patients experienced a total of 139 exacerbations during the study period. Relapse risk was significantly reduced in those with medium [50–100 nmol/L (20–40 ng/mL)] and high [> 100 nmol/L (> 40 ng/mL)] serum vitamin D levels (vs. < 50 mol/L or 20 ng/mL) compared to those with low levels []. For each doubling of serum vitamin D concentration from baseline of 10, 20, 30, MS relapse risk decreased by 27%. Although this suggests a beneficial effect of vitamin D on MS, it must be noted that there is also a possibility that conditions associated with MS relapse had an effect on serum vitamin D levels []. Incident rate ratios (RR) for relapse in relation to serum vitamin D levels were measured in a retrospective study of 110 patients with pediatric-onset MS []. After adjusting for several factors (age, gender, race, ethnicity, disease duration, and treatment), the authors found that every 10 ng/mL (25 nmol/L) increase in 25(OH)D level was associated with a 34% decrease in relapse risk. Similar findings were seen in a prospective cohort study from Tasmania, Australia, in a group of 145 adults with RRMS, in which 25(OH)D levels were measured twice a year for a period of 3 years []. For each 10 nmol/L increase in serum vitamin D level, there was an associated 12% lower risk of MS relapse. Adjustment for potential confounders, such as timing of the blood testing, did not affect the results. Most of the participants in this study (82%) were receiving immunomodulatory therapy. The authors concluded that raising 25(OH)D levels by 50 nmol/L could decrease the hazard of a relapse by up to 50% (Fig. ) []. The EPIC natural history study was a 5-year cohort study conducted at the University of California, San Francisco which sought to determine the associations between serum or plasma vitamin D levels and MRI activity in a group of 469 white, mostly non-Hispanic patients with MS or clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) []. Sixty-four percent received disease-modifying therapy within the previous 12 months. Vitamin D levels increased significantly during the study, especially for those patients using supplements. Only 9% of patients were taking vitamin D supplements at baseline, but 43% were taking them by year 5. Patients who reported using vitamin D supplements had an 8.7 ng/mL (21.75 nmo/L) higher vitamin D level, on average, compared with those who did not. Additionally, lower vitamin D levels were strongly associated with development of new T2 lesions and with contrast-enhancing lesions on brain MRI. Each additional 10 ng/mL (25 nmol/L) increment of 25(OH)D was associated with a 15% lower risk of new T2 lesions and a 32% lower risk of enhancing lesions (Fig. ) []. Higher vitamin D levels were associated with a lower (but not statistically significantly) risk of MS relapses. Findings from this study also showed strong “within-person” effects of vitamin D levels in individual patients with MS. The authors concluded that “individuals with CIS/RRMS with higher vitamin D levels are at much lower risk of the subsequent development of new lesions and of gadolinium (Gd+)-enhancing lesions on brain MRI, even after accounting for potential confounding factors” []. More recently, Mowry and colleagues examined the association of vitamin D levels with brain volume measures and new lesions in patients with CIS ( = 65) []. The scientific rationale for these data are based on the concept that brain volume is thought to reflect neurodegeneration better than classical MRI parameters such as T2 lesion load and Gd+-enhancing lesions []. Each 25-nmol/L increase in 25(OH)D level was associated with 7.8-mL higher gray matter volume ( = 0.025). Higher levels of 25(OH)D also were associated with the composite endpoint of ≥ 3 new brain T2 lesions or ≥ 1 relapse within 1 year ( = 0.096). Despite the limitations of the small sample size, these findings suggest that higher vitamin D levels in CIS may slow neurodegeneration []. Lower vitamin D levels also correlate with other surrogates of MS disease activity, including lower odds of remaining relapse free in MS [], greater disability and disease severity in MS [, ,,], conversion from CIS to clinically definite MS (CDMS) [], and poorer nonverbal long-term memory performance []. These data were largely generated by observational studies that restrict the extent to which inverse associations can be attributed specifically to vitamin D. Properly designed and conducted clinical trials are needed to further define the nature of this association. Impact of Vitamin D Levels on Disease Activity Based on Post-Hoc Analyses from BENEFIT and BEYOND To our knowledge, no large randomized, double-blind, controlled, prospectively phase 3 trials have been conducted to study the impact of vitamin D levels on MS activity as a primary endpoint. However, in two phase 3 studies, the BENEFIT study [], and the BEYOND study [] post hoc analyses were conducted to investigate this potential link. The BENEFIT (Betaseron in Newly Emerging Multiple Sclerosis for Initial Treatment) study was a randomized trial originally designed to evaluate the impact of early versus delayed IFNB-1b treatment in patients with CIS [,,]. Patients with a first event suggestive of MS and a minimum of two clinically silent lesions on MRI were randomly assigned to receive interferon beta-1b (IFNB-1b) 250 μg ( = 292; early treatment) or placebo ( = 176; delayed treatment) subcutaneously every other day for 2 years or until diagnosis of CDMS, in which case they could switch to IFNB-1b therapy. All patients were then eligible to enter a prospective follow-up phase with open-label IFNB-1b for up to 5 years after randomization. Patients and study personnel remained unaware of initial treatment allocation throughout the study up to year 5. During the observation period, regular study visits were scheduled to collect clinical and MRI data, with visits at baseline and months 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, and 60 []. A post hoc analyses aimed to determine whether vitamin D status [serum 25(OH)D levels] would predict disease activity and prognosis up to 5 years after the first attack in early-disease CIS patients []. Serum samples were collected at baseline, 6, 12, and 24 months and levels of 25(OH)D were measured (by ELISA). Of the 468 patients included in BENEFIT, 465 patients had at least one 25(OH)D measurement, 417 had two or more, 396 had three or more, and 303 had all four measurements. 25(OH)D levels were seasonally adjusted to obtain an estimate of long-term 25(OH)D status. To minimize the possibility that lower 25(OH)D levels were a consequence, rather than the cause, of MS severity, the cumulative average 25(OH)D levels at 12 months were related to the outcomes between 12 and 60 months or between 24 and 60 months (thereby allowing inserting a 1-year lag between 25[OH]D measurements and the assessment of MS activity or progression) []. Three sets of analyses were performed: (1) continuous 50-nmol/L (20-ng/mL) increments to determine the overall linear trend; (2) quintiles to explore the dose response; and (3) categorical analysis using ≥ 50 nmol/L versus < 50 nmol/L (20 ng/mL) []. Findings indicated that patient characteristics affected vitamin D levels. Those with higher (seasonally adjusted) 25(OH)D levels tended to be younger and to have a lower body mass index (BMI), a lower number of T2 lesions, and a higher brain volume at the CIS stage, but otherwise were similar to patients with lower levels of 25(OH)D []. Over the 5-year follow-up period, 81.3% (377 patients) converted to MS according to the McDonald 2001 criteria that include MRI lesions [] and 46.6% (216 patients) converted to CDMS based on exacerbations or progression alone. The hazard of conversion decreased with increasing serum 25(OH)D and mean serum 25(OH)D levels at 12 months predicted subsequent conversions to McDonald MS ( = 0.02) and CDMS ( = 0.05) []. An increasing serum 25(OH)D level was associated with a decreasing rate of new active lesions on MRI; this effect was particularly strong in patients with both 6- and 12-month serum 25(OH)D measurements. A 50 nmol/L (20 ng/mL) increment in average serum 25(OH)D levels within the first 12 months predicted a 57% lower rate of new active lesions (RR, 95% CI: 0.43 (0.26–0.70),  < 0.001) and a 57% lower relapse rate (RR (95% CI): 0.43 (0.20–0.92,  = 0.03). In evaluating the potential progression of MS on MRI, higher levels of serum 25(OH)D were associated with less T2 lesion volume accumulation over time. For a 50 nmol/L increase in serum 25(OH)D, the relative decrease in T2 lesion volume was 20% per year ( < 0.001). Restricting results to patients with both 6-month and 12-month serum 25(OH)D measures, tended to strengthen results []. The dichotomous analysis of serum 25(OH)D levels (< 50 vs. ≥ 50 nmol/L) is shown in Fig.  []. For instance, the percentage loss of brain volume over time was lower in patients with 25(OH)D levels ≥ 50 nmol/L at the 12-month time point compared with those with serum 25(OH)D levels < 50 nmol/L ( = 0.005). Although a 50 nmol/L increase in 25(OH)D levels did not reach significance for a reduction in the average expanded disability status scale (EDSS) score ( = 0.11), patients with serum 25(OH)D levels ≥ 50 nmol/L had a significantly lower annualized change in EDSS score compared with those patients with serum 25(OH)D levels < 50 nmol/L ( = 0.004) while on IFN-b-1b. Across all analyses, associations were generally stronger for MRI than for clinical outcomes. Nevertheless, “the latter were still remarkable considering the overall low rate of relapses (0.2 per year) and small EDSS score change (median change, 0.0) in BENEFIT” []. Strengths of the BENEFIT study included (1) its longitudinal design, (2) the exclusive recruitment of patients at the CIS stage, (3) the use of repeated serum 25(OH)D measurements, (4) the large number of patients, (5) standardized treatment (e.g., early vs. late IFNB-1b), and (6) rigorous clinical and MRI assessment of all patients during a 5-year period. Limitations of the study included (1) the fact that most patients were eventually treated with IFNB-1b and some crossed over during the 2 years of the study, and (2) while a clear dose response was observed for the most sensitive MRI outcomes, the effects did not reach a plateau level, and, therefore, serum 25(OH)D levels greater than the median 69 nmol/L could have had a greater effect. According to the authors, a low 25(OH)D level early in the disease course is a strong risk factor for long-term MS activity and progression in patients with early MS who were treated with IFNB-1b []. The BENEFIT cohort had an early treatment group and a delayed treatment group. The associations of 25(OH)D levels and MS activity were more pronounced for patients in the early treatment group than for those in the delayed treatment group (Table  [] and Fig.  []), although a test for interaction between 25(OH)D levels and treatment assignment was significant only for the time to CDMS ( = 0.04) []. These results suggest that early treatment with IFNB-1b may have an additive effect along with 25(OH)D to reduce disease severity and progression in both clinical and imaging outcomes. To explore the mechanistic rationale for the potential additive effects of 25(OH)D levels and early IFNB-1b treatment, Munger and colleagues conducted a global gene expression analysis in which expression profiles were measured at various time points among participants in the BENEFIT clinical trial []. The relationship between genes or gene sets expressed in association with 25(OH)D and those associated with MS activity was examined. The numbers of Gd+-enhancing lesions served as a marker of disease activity. A 50 nmol/L increase in serum 25(OH) levels reduced the Gd+ lesion count by 55%. Adjusting for gender, age, treatment, and treatment − 25(OH)D interaction did not alter the significance of the findings. Gene expression in whole blood was studied in 295 individuals, evaluating approximately 19,000 genes. Reduced Gd+ lesion count was significantly associated with increased expression of 25(OH)D-related genes, an effect that was independent of IFNB-1b treatment. This effect was also noticed when looking at single genes that were associated with regulation of 25(OH)D levels. The authors hypothesized that there was an additive effect of 25(OH)D and IFNB-1bin reducing Gd+ lesion counts []. The second data set from randomized, double-blind, phase 3 trials in MS was derived from the BEYOND (Betaseron Efficacy Yielding Outcomes of a New Dose) study []. Compared with the BENEFIT study, the BEYOND study included patients with established MS (vs. patients with CIS) and was shorter in duration (2 vs. 5 years). It also included considerably more patients (1482 vs. 465) and was conducted in different geographical regions (North America, Western and Eastern Europe, Southern Hemisphere vs. Europe and Canada). BEYOND was a large, phase 3, prospective, multicenter, blinded, randomized clinical trial. Patients were monitored for at least 2 years. Clinical visits were scheduled every 3 months, and an MRI was performed at baseline and annually thereafter. A post hoc analysis assessed 25(OH)D levels and the subsequent MS disease course and disease progression as characterized by MRI and clinical endpoints []. Eligible patients for the vitamin D analyses included 1482 participants randomized to receive 250, or 500 μg of IFNB-1b with at least two measurements of 25(OH)D obtained 6 months apart. Serum 25(OH)D measurements were performed at baseline, 6, and 12 months. In longitudinal analyses, 25(OH)D was inversely correlated with the cumulative number of active lesions between baseline and the last MRI (average follow-up time, 2 years). A 50-nmol/L higher level of serum 25(OH)D was associated with a 31% lower rate of new lesions [relative rate (RR), 0.69; 95% CI, 0.55–0.86;  = 0.001]. This inverse association was also strong and significant in analyses restricted to patients with 25(OH)D levels > 50 nmol/L (RR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.46–0.84;  = 0.002) and was consistent in each of the four geographic regions (Fig. ) []. The lowest rate of new lesions was observed among patients with 25(OH)D levels > 100 nmol/L (RR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.37–0.78;  = 0.002). No significant associations were found between 25(OH)D levels and change in brain volume, relapse rates, or EDSS scores []. Strengths of this study include the large number of participants, the regionally diverse population with varying baseline characteristics, and the repeated measurements of 25(OH)D, which helped characterize patients’ long-term vitamin D status. The relatively short follow-up is the most important limitation of this study. This limited follow-up may explain the lack of association between serum 25(OH)D levels and measures of brain atrophy or clinical endpoints, both of which were modified by 25(OH)D in the longer BENEFIT study [, ]. Regarding targeted vitamin D levels, the authors stated: “Our observation of the lowest level of MS activity among patients with serum 25(OH)D levels above 100.0 nmol/L [40 ng/mL] is consistent with the results of a previous investigation in the US [], and suggests that the 25(OH)D levels in most patients with MS who are not receiving supplemental vitamin D may be suboptimal” []. Effects of Disease-Modifying Therapies on Vitamin D Levels in MS Patients MS disease activity may be additively affected by vitamin D and IFNB-1b []. This hypothesis is supported by investigations from the same researchers suggesting that processes regulated and triggered by 25(OH)D may be additively enhanced by IFNB-1b [], and independently by observations from Stewart and colleagues from the Menzies Research Institute in Tasmania []. In an observational cohort study, conducted in 178 patients with MS, vitamin D levels were measured every 6 months over an average of 2.2 years. Patients who took an interferon had significantly higher 25(OH)D levels than those who did not ( < 0.001). Each 10-nmol/L increase in serum vitamin D was associated with a 10% lower relapse rate. Interestingly, interferon treatment was protective only against relapse among persons with higher vitamin D levels. Among those with insufficient vitamin D, there was an increased risk of relapse despite interferon treatment. The investigators hypothesized that treatment with IFNB may increase serum vitamin D levels through enhanced responsiveness to sun exposure and recommended that persons being treated with IFNB should have vitamin D status monitored and maintained in the sufficiency range []. Also, noteworthy from these data, this group did not find similar associations for glatiramer acetate (GA) therapy and vitamin D. The notion of complementary or even synergistic effects of IFNB and vitamin D is further supported by observations from Rotstein and coworkers based on the CLIMB (Comprehensive Longitudinal Investigation of MS at Brigham and Women’s Hospital) cohort []. The CLIMB cohort is a prospective cohort study that began enrolling patients in 2000. The objective of the study was to determine whether 25(OH)D levels predicted new disease activity in MS patients treated with IFN-β ( = 96) or GA ( = 151). Separately, due to different selection criteria, a similar analysis was conducted for patients treated with fingolimod (FTY,  = 77). Serum 25(OH)D concentration was adjusted for season, and patients were divided into subgroups by 25(OH)D tertile. The primary study endpoint was ‘time to first inflammatory event’, defined as a combination of either first relapse or first Gd+ lesion, using a Cox model adjusted for age, sex, and disease duration. The results demonstrated higher 25(OH)D levels associated with a longer time to the combined first event in the IFNB subgroup [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.58;  = 0.012], but not in GA-treated participants (HR = 0.89;  = 0.50). For Gd+ lesions alone, there was a significant association observed in GA and IFNB subgroups, although the effect was more pronounced with IFNB (HR = 0.57;  = 0.039 vs. HR = 0.41;  = 0.022). No significant associations were found for relapses. There were some sampling difficulties in this cohort and, therefore, the results need to be interpreted with certain caution. For FTY, due to the mandated first-dose observation, samples were available for all patients. Higher 25(OH)D was associated with a longer time to the first event (HR = 0.48;  = 0.016) and with relapses (HR = 0.50;  = 0.046), but not with Gd+ lesions []. The large, prospective cohort and the prolonged follow-up times were strengths of this study, as well as the availability of two 25(OH)D measurements for the majority of patients. However, more regular 25(OH)D measurements would have been ideal and offered greater insights into study conclusions []. Studies Contradicting the Association of Vitamin D Levels with Disease Activity Contradictory to the aforementioned information are findings reported by researchers from Norway []. In this small prospective cohort study, 88 patients with RRMS were followed with regular MRI and 25(OH)D measurements during 6 months before and up to 18 months after initiation of IFNB. During the pre–IFNB treatment phase, higher levels of 25(OH)D were associated with reduced MRI activity; each 10-nmol/L increase in 25(OH)D was associated with 12.7% ( = 0.037) lower odds for new T1 Gd + lesions, 11.7% ( = 0.044) lower odds for new T2 lesions, and 14.1% ( = 0.024) lower odds for combined unique activity. However, there was no association between 25(OH)D and disease activity after initiation of IFNB. With clinical measures, neither the occurrence of relapses nor EDSS progression was associated with 25(OH)D levels during both study phases. Strengths of the study were the prospective design and the frequent MRI and 25(OH)D assessments during the observation period. Limitations were the relatively short time on IFNB and the small number of participants, as well as the minimal 4 nmol/L increase in serum vitamin D levels following vitamin D supplementation. In the discussion of the study results, the authors expressed their surprise about the lack of an association between 25(OH)D levels and MRI after initiation of IFNB, “as there is no evidence suggesting that the immunomodulatory effects of vitamin D are counteracted by IFNB or vice versa. A reasonable explanation is that IFNB reduced radiologic disease activity, leaving relatively little left to be reduced” by vitamin D []. When reviewing available data discussing the effects of vitamin D and MS, of key interest is whether vitamin D supplementation can favorably alter the course of MS. Unfortunately, current evidence does not offer consensus to answer this question. Studies with vitamin D alone or with vitamin D as an add-on to a disease-modifying therapy are conflicting [, ,,,,,,,,,,]. Although these studies are generally small, largely uncontrolled, and used highly variable doses of vitamin D, it can be noted that there are initial promising data arguing for vitamin D supplementation in patients with MS [, ,,,,,,]. Furthermore, recent investigations with immunological response markers suggest that vitamin D supplementation in patients with MS exhibits in vivo pleiotropic immunomodulatory effects in MS [], and lacking evidence of a treatment effect does not necessarily demonstrate proof of no effect. Studies Supporting the Benefit of Supplemental Vitamin D Researchers from Finland conducted a 1-year, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with vitamin D3 as an add-on treatment to IFNB-1b in patients with MS. Thirty-four patients were randomly assigned to the treatment group (vitamin D, 20,000 IU/week vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol), and IFNB-1b) and 32 to the control group (placebo and IFNB-1b) []. The primary outcome measure was an MRI T2 burden of disease (BOD), which tended to increase more in the placebo group (median change of 287 mm) than in the vitamin D group (median change of 83 mm); however, the difference was not statistically significant ( = 0.105) (Fig. ) []. Results for other MRI outcomes were mixed. The number of T1 Gd+ lesions decreased in both groups ( = 0.002), but the change was significantly higher in the vitamin D group ( = 0.04). New/enlarging T2 lesions at the 12-month point trended higher in the placebo group, but the differences were not statistically significant ( = 0.286). The percentage of patients with MRI activity (12-month time point) trended lower in the vitamin D group, but these differences also did not reach significance ( = 0.322). While there was no significant difference in annual relapse rate demonstrated between groups, there was a tendency toward reduced disability accumulation as measured by EDSS ( = 0.071) and toward improved timed tandem walk ( = 0.076). There were no significant differences in adverse events between the groups. The authors concluded that larger randomized, controlled trials with more than 1 year of follow-up are warranted to confirm the promising MRI results and to fully address clinical outcomes []. A study by Burton and colleagues introduced earlier in this manuscript in the context of the safety profile of higher doses of vitamin D supplementation also offers insight into the role of vitamin D supplementation and the disease course of MS []. In this open-label, controlled trial, patients were randomized to a vitamin D treatment group ( = 25, escalation protocol 4000–40,000 IU/day, mean 14,000 IU/day) or to a control group ( = 24, received vitamin D3 4000 IU/day if desired). Despite the high doses of vitamin D, no significant adverse events occurred during the 52-week study period. The annualized relapse rate during the trial year was lower in the treatment group than in the control group (0.26 vs. 0.45;  = 0.09), and more patients in the treatment group remained relapse free. Additionally, the treated patients reported a persistent reduction in T-cell proliferation compared with controls, and treatment group patients appeared to have fewer relapse events and a persistent reduction in T-cell proliferation compared to controls. Study limitations included the use of supplementation or other agents in the control group, the small sample-size, and thus the limited power []. The Danish Multiple Sclerosis Center prospectively gathered data in a cohort of 170 natalizumab-treated patients during winter 2009–2010 (baseline) with follow-up during the subsequent winter []. Patients with insufficient serum 25(OH)D levels (selected cut-off 50 nmol/L) at baseline were advised to take Vitamin D supplements according to Danish recommendations: 2000 IU for patients with levels between 25 and 50 nmol/L, 3000 IU for those with levels between 25 and 12.5 nmol/L and 4000 IU for those with levels below 12.5 nmol/L. 134 patients were included in the clinical data set. Of the 134 patients, 43 had taken vitamin D supplements due to vitamin D insufficiency (mean 25(OH)D levels: 34 nmol/L). Their levels increased significantly by 32.6 nmol/L (95% CI: 24.4–40.8 nmol/L,  < 0.0001) from baseline to follow-up. Moreover, a significant inverse relationship with the annualized relapse rate (ARR) was found: for each nmol/l increase in 25(OH)D, a 0.014 (95% CI − 0.026 to − 0.003) decrease in ARR was observed ( = 0.02). Overall, the data suggest that correcting vitamin D insufficiency by the means of vitamin D supplements in patients with MS may be beneficial []. Darwish and colleagues looked into the cognitive effects of vitamin D supplementation of patients with MS on IFNB []. At baseline, patients were stratified into a vitamin D-deficient group (25(OH)D levels < 25 ng/mL or 62.5 nmol/L,  = 39) and a vitamin D-sufficient group (25(OH)D levels > 35 ng/mL or 87.5 nmol/L). “Deficient” patients received 10,000 IU vitamin D3 daily for 3 months and reported a significant increase of 25(OH)D levels to 49.0 ± 14.6 ng/mL (122.5 ± 36.5 nmol/L). Additionally, after 3 months these “deficient” patients scored better on the Brief Visuospatial Memory test delayed recall (BVMT-DR,  = 0.02) and the montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA,  = 0.006), but not on the symbol digit modalities test (SDMT) and Stroop. The authors concluded that the lack of significant change on the SDMR and Stroop testing was due to the short disease duration and the propensity for study participants to perform within normal ranges for these tests. Alternatively, “sufficient” patients continued their usual treatment that may have included vitamin D3 supplementation at various dosages. These patients reported 25(OH)D levels at 64.2 ± 18.7 ng/mL (160.5 ± 46.8 nmol/L) at study end. Sufficient 25(OH)D levels predicted better cognitive performance on the BVMT-DR at baseline and 3 months after adjusting for all measured confounding variables. Study limitations included a small study population ( = 88), short study duration (3 months), and a quarter of the patients not returning to the month 3 visit. The authors also described not allowing true control for other sources of vitamin D as other possible confounders, such as sun exposure and dietary vitamin D []. Only available in abstract format are the results of two studies which evaluated the benefits and risks associated with high-dose vitamin D supplementation in patients treated with IFNB-1a. Although both failed to demonstrate an effect on clinical parameters, their MRI results demonstrated positive results. SOLAR is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, phase 2 study. Two hundred and twenty-nine patients with a 25(OH)D serum level below 150 nmol/L were randomly assigned to cholecalciferol at a dose of 14,000 IU per day or placebo []. All patients received subcutaneous IFNB-1a. After recruitment delays, the study design was adjusted and the percentage of patients with “disease activity free” status (defined as no relapses, no EDSS progression, and no new Gd+ or T2 MRI lesions) at week 48 were introduced as a new primary endpoint. This endpoint was not met (37.2% for cholecalciferol group vs. 35.3% for placebo group,  = 0.912). Likewise, no differences between groups for other clinical parameters such as ARR or EDSS were found. However, results regarding the MRI parameters were promising with a significant 32% reduction in the number of new, combined, unique active lesions in the cholecalciferol group ( = 0.005). Furthermore, there was a trend toward more cholecalciferol recipients being free from new T1 hypointense lesions, which became significant in those aged 18–30 years. The short duration of the trial (48 weeks) and the relatively small sample size (229 patients) may have led to the lack of significance of the clinical outcomes. For comparisons, most randomized trials of new MS drugs recruited over 800 patients to be able to demonstrate a significant effect vs. placebo. Despite the large sizes, some were not able to show a significant effect on disability progression (e.g. CONFIRM study [] TRANSFORMS []). Additionally, these data are not placebo-controlled, but rather an active comparator. Also, the power analysis is not designed to assess a minor effect and would require > 10,000 patients. Likewise, the second study was a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 2 study []. One hundred and twenty-nine patients ( = 129) were randomly assigned to receive 100,000 IU of cholecalciferol twice monthly (equivalent to a daily dose of 7143 IU) in addition to IFNB-1a over a 24-month period. Again, significant effects in favor of vitamin D supplementation were found for selected MRI parameters such as new or enlarged weighted T1 and T2 lesion, but no effect was found for clinical parameters []. A preliminary study from Iran conducted by Etemadifar and colleagues assessed the safety and efficacy of high-dose vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy in women with MS []. Fifteen pregnant women with confirmed MS and with serum 25(OH)D levels < 50 nmol/L (20 ng/mL) were randomly allocated to received 50,000 IU/week (daily dose of 7143 IU) vitamin D3 or routine care from 12 to 16 weeks of gestation until delivery. 25(OH)D levels increased significantly and no significant adverse events occurred. The women in the vitamin D group had significantly fewer relapses during pregnancy (0 vs. 5;  < 0.05), a tendency for fewer relapses up to 6 months after pregnancy (0 vs. 4; statistically nonsignificant), and a more stable EDSS than those without supplementation. The authors advocated for adding high-dose vitamin D3 supplementation during pregnancy to the routine care of women with MS. Study limitations included a small sample size, and conclusions are limited by the loss to follow-up of 37 out of 52 of the original baseline cohort []. The role of vitamin D supplementation in patients with MS was also evaluated by Jelinek and colleagues, with the authors taking a very different epidemiological approach []. This was an internet survey among 2301 patients with MS who self-reported data on geographical location, intentional sun exposure for health, supplementation with vitamin D, and other lifestyle variables, as well as self-reported doctor-diagnosed relapse rates and disability (Patient Determined Disease Steps). Survey participants were asked to respond to a health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) questionnaire. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were used for comparisons, including multiple linear regression modeling. Nearly two thirds of respondents (64.6%) lived in the Northern Hemisphere, mostly in developed countries. Most (82.3%) were female, with a median age of 45 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 38–53 years) and a median time since diagnosis of 6 years (IQR: 3–12 years), with the majority (61.6%) having RRMS. More than 80% of the patients indicated that they took vitamin D supplements, mostly between 2000 and 5000 IU daily (Table ) [], and 67% reported intentional sun exposure to raise vitamin D levels. Unadjusted regression modeling incorporating deliberate sun exposure, latitude, and vitamin D supplementation showed strong associations between sun exposure and HRQoL. However, the effect disappeared when controlling for age, disability, physical activity, and fish consumption. In contrast, the associations between supplementation of vitamin D and HRQoL were maintained when adjusting for these variables, with a dose–response effect. The beneficial effect of vitamin D supplementation on HRQoL was considered to be of “clinically significant magnitude” []. Lower annualized relapse rates were significantly associated with taking vitamin D supplementation vs. not taking supplements. The dose taken seemed to be of less importance. No effect on disability was found for either supplementation or deliberate sun exposure, but an increase of latitude by 1° (farther from the equator) predicted increased odds of moderate or high disability []. The large data set may compensate for some of the limitations of this study design. Vitamin D supplementation (along with all other measures) was self-reported and not validated with blood tests. No validated tool exists for quantifying variables like deliberate sun exposure; in this study, the question required simply a yes/no answer []. Furthermore, there might be a selection bias in terms of the patients included, as respondents to such Internet surveys are patients who are typically very “engaged” with their situation and disease. Studies Contradicting the Benefit of Supplemental Vitamin D A study by Stein and colleagues is widely discussed among those not supporting vitamin D supplementation []. In this 6-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial, patients were allocated to either high or low dose of vitamin D2. The high-dose regimen was 6000 IU twice daily, the low-dose regimen 1000 IU daily. Twenty-three patients were included (11 in the treatment arm, 12 in the control group). There were no significant differences between the groups on the two primary endpoints—cumulative number of new Gd+ lesions and change in the total volume of T2 lesions—nor were there differences on clinical outcome measures, such as number of relapses and effect on EDSS []. , in which the manuscript was published, ranked the study as providing class I evidence, but this rating is arguable. Although the study was double-blind, placebo-controlled, and randomized, the sample size was very small ( = 23). Moreover, there were withdrawals (two in the low-dose group, one in the high-dose group), and one patient from the low-dose group was partially excluded from MRI analyses due to brain surgery. Although the authors stated that the two groups were well matched, one patient (in the high-dose group) had 38 Gd+ lesions at baseline, while all other patients had between two and five Gd+ lesions at baseline. The low-dose group was, on average, 10.5 years older than the high-dose group; importantly, the number of exacerbations in MS declines over time, biasing the data in favor of the low-dose group. In addition, this study compared low-dose and high-dose vitamin D administration and did not utilize a concurrent control group of subjects that did not receive any supplemental vitamin D. Finally, even though vitamin D2 seems to be a less potent form of vitamin D than vitamin D3 in all primate species [], the 1000-IU/day regimen for the low-dose group is above what the IOM recommends in terms of daily intake [] and both groups may have benefited from vitamin D supplementation. In a 96-week, randomized, controlled trial designed to evaluate the effects of supplementation with 20,000 IU/week of vitamin D (averaged to approximately 2800 IU/day) on bone mineral density in 35 MS patients, Kampman and colleagues found that consumption of vitamin D did not result in beneficial effects on the measured MS-related outcomes, which included annualized relapse rates. However, the study was not powered to address clinical outcomes []. The authors suggested that the low annualized relapse rate seen at baseline could have contributed to the absence of significant effects in this study. Study limitations included a small sample size ( = 68), which may be inadequate for assessing effects on clinical outcomes []. Furthermore, two studies from Iran did not find a beneficial effect of vitamin D supplementation on clinical or MRI outcome measures in patients with RRMS. Shaygannejad and colleagues studied 50 patients in a 12-month, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 clinical trial []. The 25 patients in the treatment group received 4000 IU/day of vitamin D for the first 2 weeks and were thereafter escalated to 8000 IU/day in addition to their disease-modifying agent. The control group ( = 25) was treated with placebo combined with disease-modifying therapy. In a separate study, Mosayebi and colleagues evaluated the effects of vitamin D3 supplementation at a dose of 300,000 IU/month vs. placebo in a randomized, prospective study with 62 patients []. Over the 6-month observation period, no differences between groups on either EDSS or Gd+ lesion count were observed, but immune-inhibitory transforming growth factor beta and interleukin 10 were significantly higher in the vitamin D-supplemented group compared with placebo []. Several of the studies above were included in a meta-analysis conducted by James and colleagues evaluating the effect of vitamin D-related intervention trials on MS relapses []. The five studies [, ,,,] included 129 patients with high-dose vitamin D supplementations and 125 controls. Administered doses of vitamin D supplementations, study designs, patient populations, outcome parameters, and observation period were considerably variable among the assessed studies. Given these differences, the numerous limitations of each of these studies and the mixed reported study results, it is not surprising that the meta-analysis did not find a significant association between vitamin D treatment and the relative risk of relapse in MS []. In the view of the authors, “further larger and more prolonged studies…are merited” to better understand the role of vitamin D supplementation in MS []. Ongoing Studies Evaluating the Role of Supplemental Vitamin D in MS A search of recently initiated and ongoing clinical studies evaluating the role of supplemental vitamin D in MS revealed the following: The Efficacy of Vitamin D Supplementation in Multiple Sclerosis (EVIDIMS) study (NCT01440062) [, ] is a German multicenter, stratified, randomized, controlled, double-blind, clinical phase 2 study. Eighty patients with CIS or MS whose disease courses were stable while taking IFNB-1b were randomized to receive either high-dose (on average, 10,200 IU/day) or low-dose (on average 200 IU/day) vitamin D3 for 18 months as a supplement. The primary outcome measure is the number of new T2 lesions. Secondary endpoints include additional MRI and optical coherence tomography (OCT) parameters, clinical parameters, as well as cognition, fatigue, depression, and quality of life. Safety and tolerability of high-dose vitamin D supplementation are additional outcome measures. This study is ongoing, and results are expected in 2018 or 2019. The Vitamin D to Ameliorate Multiple Sclerosis (VIDAMS) study (NCT01490502) [88, 90] is a randomized, controlled, phase 3 study that aims to include 172 patients in the US. After a run-in phase of 1 month on GA, patients will be assigned to low-dose (600 IU/day) vs. high-dose (5000 IU/day) vitamin D3 as an add-on therapy to GA. This academic study is currently recruiting patients and will terminate in 2018 [, ]. Clinical and MRI parameters will also be evaluated. Evidence available to date suggests that the level of serum vitamin D affects the risk of developing MS and also modifies disease activity in MS patients. Until several years ago, evidence that higher levels of vitamin D are associated with favorable effects on MS risk and a reduction in MS activity was supported largely by observational studies. Limitations of these studies restricted confidence in a specific effect of vitamin D in MS. Newer data with Mendelian randomization analyses suggest there is a causal relationship between low vitamin D level and the risk of MS. Furthermore, post hoc evaluations from the phase 3 BENEFIT and BEYOND studies substantiate findings of observational trials. Across all trials, associations between 25(OH) levels and MS and its activity are generally stronger for MRI than for clinical outcomes, which may be due to the higher sensitivity of MRI compared to typical clinical parameters. Low or even insufficient 25(OH)D levels were common in many earlier cohorts. Patients in more recent studies have higher baseline vitamin D levels, potentially changing the immunopathology of MS and altering responses to some therapeutic drugs. In aggregate, studies suggest that vitamin D supplementation may be beneficial for patients with MS and others. However, the study limitations identified in this review recognize the need for larger controlled clinical trials to establish vitamin D supplementation as the standard of care for MS patients. Though there is increasing evidence indicating that lower vitamin D levels are associated with increased risk of MS and greater clinical and brain MRI activity in established MS, the impact of vitamin D supplementation on MS activity remains inadequately investigated. There is no consensus on “sufficient” vitamin D levels. In the view of IOM, 25(OH)D levels greater than 50 nmol/L (20 ng/mL) are sufficient. The Endocrine Society argues for 75 nmol/L (30 ng/mL) or higher, based on a medical model which takes into account skeletal and non-skeletal health. Numerous studies suggest that serum 25(OH)D levels of approximately 100 nmol/L (40 ng/mL) are the lower limit for controlling MRI and clinical activity in patients with MS. More research is needed to establish the recommended levels of vitamin D supplementation necessary to reduce the risk for MS and MS clinical activity. In conclusion, based on the data reviewed, identification and correction of vitamin D insufficiency with supplementation at recommended doses is a sensible clinical action/course/target/objective and one that provides a favorable risk–benefit profile for vitamin D for most patients with MS.

0dca2b8d-fb18-4f31-89ac-206ba885d9f7,"Rehabilitation interventions in multiple sclerosis: an overview , –() Multiple sclerosis is a complex, heterogeneous disease associated with long-term disability. Despite the availability of advanced disease-modifying and symptomatic therapies that may decrease activity and progression of disease and alleviate complaints to a certain extent, there is still a need for comprehensive rehabilitation interventions in order to reduce sequels and symptoms of the disease on personal activities and social participation to achieve the highest possible independence and the best quality of life. Timing and setting of rehabilitation interventions should be selected individually depending on disease phase, functional deficits, personal requirements, as well as specific goals. In addition, limitations and disease-specific characteristics that may influence rehabilitation outcome should be noted. Rehabilitation interventions should be considered early for maintaining functional capacity and reducing risk for losing important abilities or independence. Due to gradual failure of adaptive compensatory mechanisms along the course of disease, benefits of rehabilitation interventions are generally higher in earlier phases of MS. Inpatient and outpatient multidisciplinary rehabilitation has been shown to be beneficial in improving disability, participation and quality of life despite progression of the disease. Good evidence exists for different specific interventions improving physical and cognitive performance. Other important issues responsible for beneficial effects of comprehensive rehabilitation in MS include education, instruction, and information of patients and caregivers. Comprehensive assessment of health domains in MS patients using standardized framework and common language for describing the impact of disease at different levels, using International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) core sets may increase the knowledge of needs of these patients for more efficient and adapted rehabilitation interventions meeting these individual requirements, and promote perception and acceptance of rehabilitation as a valuable treatment option in MS. ICF core sets may increase the knowledge of more efficient and adapted rehabilitation measures meeting more properly individual requirements, and promote perception and acceptance of rehabilitation as a valuable treatment option in MS.

3dd0ca5a-ad06-422e-b966-09d061aa57ab,"Why Nearly 1 in 5 People Thought to Have MS Have Been Misdiagnosed The misdiagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS) is a problem with significant consequences for patients as well as the healthcare system. There are in the United States living with the disease. And now say nearly 20 percent of them are misdiagnosed. Most of them had another condition but had been treated for MS for years. “The diagnosis of MS is tricky. Both the symptoms and MRI testing results can look like other conditions, such as stroke, migraines, and vitamin B-12 deficiency,” , a specialist in neurology at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles and a co-lead investigator of the study, said in a statement to Healthline. “You have to rule out any other diagnoses, and it’s not a perfect science.” The study looked at 241 patients across three campuses and will be published in the May issue of the peer-reviewed journal Multiple Sclerosis and Related Disorders. Kaisey, along with co-lead investigator , interim chair of neurology and director of the Cedars-Sinai Multiple Sclerosis and Neuroimmunology Center, and researchers from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and the University of Vermont, analyzed patients who had been diagnosed by other physicians and then referred to the Cedars-Sinai or UCLA multiple sclerosis clinics over the course of a year. Investigators wanted to see how many patients were misdiagnosed with MS and identify common characteristics among those who had been misdiagnosed. The research found that almost 1 in 5 patients who came to the medical centers with a previous diagnosis of MS didn’t fulfill the criteria for that diagnosis. On average, researchers said, these people spent four years getting treatment for MS before receiving a correct diagnosis. “When we see a patient like that, even though they come to us with an established diagnosis, we just start from the beginning,” Sicotte said. The most common correct diagnosis was migraine (16 percent), followed by radiologically isolated syndrome, in which patients don’t experience symptoms of MS even though their MRI results may look like the disease. Among those misdiagnosed, 72 percent had been prescribed MS treatments. Forty-eight percent of these patients received therapies that carry a known risk of developing , a serious disease in the white matter of the brain. “I’ve seen patients suffering side effects from the medication they were taking for a disease they didn’t have,” Kaisey said. “Meanwhile, they weren’t getting treatment for what they did have. The cost to the patient is huge — medically, psychologically, financially.” Researchers estimated that the unnecessary treatments identified in this study alone cost almost $10 million. The researchers said they hope the results of this study will help improve diagnostic procedures and prevent future MS misdiagnoses. “The first step, which is what we’ve done here, is to identify the problem, so now we’re working on potential solutions,” Kaisey said. “This news is alarming and concerning,” , executive vice president of research at the National Multiple Sclerosis Society (NMSS), told Healthline. “The study was done before the most recent update to the was published in December 2017.” “We’ve made great strides over the last few decades, especially with the MRI, but this study shows we need more help with diagnosis with MS,” he said. “We are looking forward to learning if this rate is reduced in the long run as a result of the criteria diagnostic.” Because the diagnosis of MS and new treatment algorithms are complicated, it’s often helpful to have a consultation with an MS specialist to review diagnosis and treatment. For example, migraine, the most common correct diagnosis, may present an imaging signal on an MRI that could prompt the confusion. The NMSS to rule out during the diagnosis process. In 2016 researchers , including direct and indirect costs, ranged from $8,528 to $54,244 per patient per year. Data sources ranged from 1999 to 2008 and don’t include some of the newer, more costly therapies. MS therapies have significantly increased in cost. by the Food and Drug Administration in March were priced at $88,500 and $99,500. Healthline spoke with , a patient advocate, writer, and patient co-investigator for . “There is a danger in pushing for an MS diagnosis when there isn’t clear and convincing evidence, as they found through this study,” she said. “People really must be seen by a neurologist who specializes in MS and not just general neurology and have a thorough neurological exam. “When you are diagnosed with MS it changes so many things in our lives, and to undo that mark on the medical record is complex, if not impossible. Even if you have to travel great distances to have a diagnosis confirmed at an MS center, it can be worth the time and effort,” Kolaczkowski said. There are approximately 70 MS clinics in the United States. These clinics, as well as a list of neurologists who specialize in MS, can be located at the . The NMSS provides a on its website to help find an MS specialist. The offers a variety of MS-specific campuses in Arizona, Florida, and Minnesota. “But not everyone has access to an MS specialist. The society is aware of the issues of access to quality MS care and is making significant investments in this area,” Bebo noted. “It is a complicated problem which needs to be addressed,” he said. “It emphasizes the importance of doctors using the new diagnosis criteria.” Editor’s note: Caroline Craven is a patient expert living with MS.

MS Symptoms, Causes, Diagnosis Reviewed By: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease in which the body's immune system attacks its own central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord). In MS, the immune system attacks and damages or destroys myelin, a substance that surrounds and insulates the nerves. The myelin destruction causes a distortion or interruption in nerve impulses traveling to and from the brain. This can result in a wide variety of symptoms. Multiple sclerosis is estimated to affect 2.8 million people worldwide. Most people are diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 50, though it can also occur in young children and the elderly. Multiple sclerosis is three times more common in women than in men. In addition, nearly all women afflicted with MS get the condition before menopause. This could mean that hormones play an important role in the disease’s development. Usually, MS in men is more severe than it is in women. They typically get MS in their 30s and 40s, just as their testosterone levels begin to decline. Although MS is more common in women than men overall, one form of the disease contradicts this pattern. People with primary progressive (PP) MS are about as likely to be male as female. (The four main types of MS are described later). People who smoke are more likely to develop MS, and to develop it more severely and with a faster progression. MS is more prevalent among Caucasians than other ethnicities. MS is believed to have a genetic component as people with a first-degree relative with the disease have a higher incidence than the general population. We don't know exactly what causes multiple sclerosis, but it is believed to be some combination of immunologic, environmental, infectious, and/or genetic factors. Some theories have been proposed, though there is not enough evidence to establish any one cause. Theories as to what causes MS include: Exposure to chemical solvents such as amines, esters, ethers, and ketones Viruses such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and human herpes virus 6 (HHV-6) Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disorder in which the immune system mistakenly perceives its own myelin (the protective sheath around the nerves) as an intruder and attacks it, as it would a virus or other foreign infectious agent. To understand how this harms the body, it helps to understand how nerves work. A nerve can be seen by the naked eye, but it is made up of hundreds or even thousands of microscopic nerve fibers wrapped by connective tissue. Nerves conduct messages to and from the brain by way of electrical impulses. Often the nerve fibers that make up a nerve are all individually wrapped in myelin, a protective sheath that causes electric impulses to conduct down the nerve much faster than fibers that lack myelin. (The same principle is used to improve electric wires by covering them with a plastic outer layer.) In multiple sclerosis, the immune system's T cells attack the myelin sheath. By attacking myelin, the immune system in a person with MS causes inflammation and degeneration of the myelin that can lead to demyelination, or stripping of the myelin covering of the nerves. It can also cause scarring (the ""sclerosis"" in the name “multiple sclerosis”). This causes electrical impulses to travel more slowly along the nerves resulting in deterioration of function in body processes such as vision, speech, walking, writing, and memory. While multiple sclerosis is not hereditary, genetics are believed to play a role. In the U.S., the chances of developing MS are one in 750. Having a first-degree relative (parent, sibling) increases the risk to up to 5%. An identical twin of someone with MS has a 25% chance of being diagnosed with the disorder. It is thought there is an outside trigger, as genetics only makes certain people susceptible to getting MS, which is why the disease is not considered hereditary. Genes may make a person more likely to develop the disease, but it is believed that there still is an additional outside trigger that makes it happen. There are four different types of multiple sclerosis that have been identified and each type can have symptoms ranging from mild to severe. The different types of MS can help predict the course of the disease and a patient's response to treatment. The four types of MS are discussed on the next four slides. Relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RR-MS, RRMS or RMS) is the most common type of MS, affecting about 85% of MS sufferers. RR-MS is defined by inflammatory attacks on the myelin and nerve fibers causing a worsening of neurologic function. Symptoms vary from patient to patient, and symptoms can flare up (called relapses or exacerbations) unexpectedly, and then disappear (remission). Primary-progressive multiple sclerosis (PP-MS, PPMS) is characterized by steady worsening of neurologic functioning, without any relapses or remissions. There may be occasional plateaus, but overall, the progression of the disability is continuous. This form of MS occurs equally in men and women, and the age of onset is about 10 years later than in relapsing-remitting MS. Secondary-progressive multiple sclerosis (SP-MS, SPMS) is a form of MS that follows relapsing-remitting MS. Most people diagnosed with RR-MS will eventually transition to having SP-MS. After a period of relapses (also called attacks, or exacerbations) and remissions the disease will start to progress steadily. People with SP-MS may or may not experience remissions. Progressive-relapsing multiple sclerosis (PR-MS, PRMS) is the least common form of MS, occurring in about 5% of MS patients. People with PR-MS experience steady disease progression and worsening neurological function as seen in primary-progressive multiple sclerosis (PP-MS), along with occasional relapses like people with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RR-MS). Symptoms of multiple sclerosis may be single or multiple. They may range from mild to severe in intensity. They may also be long-term or short-term in duration. Multiple sclerosis is often difficult to diagnose as symptoms are so varied and can resemble other diseases. It is often diagnosed by a process of exclusion – that is, by ruling out other neurological diseases – so the diagnosis of MS may take months to years. A physician will do a complete history and neurological exam, along with tests to evaluate mental, emotional and language functions, strength, coordination, balance, reflexes, gait, and vision. Tests to Help Confirm a Multiple Sclerosis Diagnosis Cerebrospinal fluid exam (spinal tap, lumbar puncture) One of the main ways to diagnose multiple sclerosis is an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan. Characteristic areas of demyelination will show up as lesions on an MRI scan. On the left is a brain MRI scan of a 35-year-old man with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis that reveals multiple lesions with high T2 signal intensity and one large white matter lesion. The right image shows the cervical spinal cord of a 27-year-old woman representing a multiple sclerosis demyelination and plaque (see arrow). There are several aspects to treating multiple sclerosis. Modifying the disease – there are several drugs that can reduce the severity and frequency of relapses Treating exacerbations (or attacks) with high dose corticosteroids Rehabilitation both for fitness and to manage energy levels Treatment for multiple sclerosis may include drugs to manage attacks, symptoms, or both. Many medications carry the risk of some side effects, so patients need to manage their treatment with their doctors. Corticosteroids are drugs that reduce inflammation in the body and affect the function of the immune system. They are often used to manage MS attacks, but can have numerous side effects. There are several medications approved for disease modification, including the following: Many medications are used to treat and manage symptoms associated with multiple sclerosis. Here are some common multiple sclerosis symptoms, followed by the medical treatments often used to treat them. Methylprednisolone (Solu-Medrol): Solu-Medrol is given intravenously during the acute attack, sometimes followed up with an oral corticosteroid. Continued from the last slide, here are some common multiple sclerosis symptoms, followed by the medical treatments often used to treat them. : Anti-convulsants like carbamazepine (Tegretol) or gabapentin (Neurontin) are used for face or limb pain. : Anti-depressants or electrical stimulation are used for pricking pain, intense tingling, and burning. : Antibiotics are used to manage infections : Vitamin C and cranberry juice are used to prevent infections : Used for bladder dysfunction This is usually treated by increasing fluids and fiber to the diet. Often resistant to treatment. Sometimes drugs or surgery are used if tremors are severe. There has been a lot of progress over the years in managing multiple sclerosis, and research is ongoing into new therapies. There are several new avenues of current research. Scientists hope to find further associations between lifestyle and illness progression. They want to learn ways to repair and reverse the damage MS causes. And they hope to learn the ultimate cause of this disease. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease that progressively damages the nerves of the brain and spinal cord. Any sensory or motor (muscular) function in the body may be affected by the nerves damaged from MS. The cause of multiple sclerosis is unknown, but it is believed to be a combination of genetic, immunological, infectious, and/or environmental factors. There are four different types of multiple sclerosis and symptoms range from mild to severe. The different types of MS can help predict the course of the disease and, to some degree, the patient's response to treatment. What Is Multiple Sclerosis?

337be25d-abb0-44a7-9acd-6d3c9510466b,"Why People with MS Appear to Have a Greater Risk for Cancer Researchers say the high rate of smoking among people with multiple sclerosis could be one reason for the elevated risk. People with multiple sclerosis (MS) may have a greater risk for developing cancer than people in the general population, according to new research. These findings were presented last week at the fifth European Academy of Neurology (EAN) Congress in Oslo, Norway. “This study is the first to compare cancer risk in MS with non-affected siblings of MS patients. The risk assessment between these two groups is extremely interesting because they share the same genetics and environmental conditions,” , postdoctoral researcher at the Western Norway Regional Health Authority and lead researcher, said in a press release. The research was based on data from various Norwegian MS and cancer registries. Included were 6,883 people with MS who were born between 1930 and 1979, as well as 8,918 siblings and 37,919 people without MS. The overall cancer risk for people with MS was 14 percent higher than for people without MS, according to the study’s researchers. They also reported the risk was especially high for certain cancers. The increase in risk was 66 percent for respiratory cancers, 52 percent for central nervous system cancers, and 51 percent for urinary cancers. When compared with their siblings, however, people with MS didn’t have an overall higher risk for cancer. That’s because siblings of people with MS were found to have a higher risk for hematological cancers than people with MS and people in the general population. Study authors acknowledge the increased cancer risk for people with MS may be due to excessive smoking and surveillance bias. This was an observational study. Grytten cautioned that conclusions about causality can’t be made. is a medical oncologist and medical director of MemorialCare Cancer Institute at Orange Coast Medical Center in California. Jacoub told Healthline it’s important to keep in mind that the study took place in another country. That means demographic and environmental differences exist. “When making population-based studies and comparing to another place, there are inherent variables impossible to control for. Nonetheless, they had a good number of patients, and the increased rates of cancer were unusually high,” he said. According to the Cleveland Clinic Mellen Center for Multiple Sclerosis, smoking is common among people with MS. Surveys indicate that 45 to 52 percent of people with MS are current or past smokers. Smokers develop more autoimmune conditions and higher levels of co-morbidities. One of the most common co-morbidities for people with MS is chronic lung disease. The study spanned 65 years, during which time smoking rates generally declined. The puts the smoking rate at 35 percent in 1990 versus 17 percent in 2013. In the United States, cigarette smoking rates among adults fell from 43 percent in 1965 to 14 percent in 2017, according to the . Jacoub explains that in MS, as well as other immune system disorders, the immune system shifts efforts from targeting infection and other invaders to targeting the body itself. “The immune system, along with other factors, is usually able to control cancer cells and not allow them to form a tumor and create disease. If you have immune dysfunction, the ability to do that is not very effective,” Jacoub said. is a neuro-oncologist and chair of the department of translational neurosciences and neurotherapeutics at the John Wayne Cancer Institute at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in California. Kesari told Healthline the study highlights the role of inflammation in a variety of diseases, from autoimmune disorders such as MS to cancer. “The paper suggests a genetic component to MS and abnormal immune system function in siblings, who may have that as well, even though they don’t have MS. Immune system dysfunction is predisposing to cancer, mainly hematological cancers,” Kesari said. “The main thing is the connection between immune health and various disorders. Cancer, heart disease, brain function: We’re finding out the immune system is involved in dementia and other disorders of aging,” he added. “MS patients, because they’re trying to control an overactive immune system, are on drugs that suppress the immune system, which increases the risk of developing cancer as well,” Kesari said. Kesari notes people with MS tend to have more monitoring in general. Abnormalities that may turn out to be cancer are more likely to be found early. That’s the surveillance bias the study authors mentioned. There’s little difference in how people with MS are treated for cancer compared to people without MS. “Typically, we don’t manage it differently as far as chemotherapy. For people with MS, sometimes chemo will even put MS in remission and control the disease for a long time,” Jacoub said. “But there should be some hesitation and discussion when it comes to treating people with cancer and MS with immunotherapies due to the potential for ,” he continued. The study suggests that siblings of people with MS have an increased risk for developing blood cancers. According to Jacoub, this speaks to the immune system issue. “There are with autoimmune illness. This study is not enough to say siblings should seek extra screening. But doctors should be aware of the potential risk of some cancers if someone in the family has an autoimmune disease,” Jacoub said. The cautions that these finding should be considered preliminary. The paper hasn’t yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal. Other large-population studies are needed to fully understand what it means for people with MS and their families. “These studies offer hypotheses. They generate leads into more research and better understanding. Clear observation provides a powerful message,” Jacoub said. “If accurate and this can be reproduced, guidelines may be changed so that patients who are asymptomatic are screened to try to catch cancer earlier,” he said.

a4fda9bb-219d-4e01-9a1c-5a491b400638,"Disease Course, Diagnosis, Treatment Options, and Overall Wellness Edited by Susan Wells Courtney, MSAA Senior Writer Reviewed by Barry A. Hendin, MD, MSAA Chief Medical Officer The last few years have seen plenty of welcome news regarding pediatric multiple sclerosis (MS). In 2018, Gilenya (fingolimod) became the first disease-modifying therapy (DMT) approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in children and adolescents. Several other DMTs already approved for use in adults are in late stages of evaluation for pediatric MS. Researchers are investigating a role for stem-cell therapy, and are pursuing new classes of drugs that would restore the nerve-protecting myelin sheath that becomes damaged in MS. Experts report that the average time from onset of symptoms to diagnosis of pediatric MS is declining, which means that the medical community is considering the possibility of an MS diagnosis in young patients at an earlier time. Clinicians have more knowledge than ever about the course of MS in children and adolescents, risk factors for relapse, how to manage symptoms, and other aspects of medical management. Risk Factors for Pediatric MS Coming into Sharper Focus Clinical Trials: The Key to Progress in Treating Pediatric MS Support and Resources for Families Facing Pediatric MS Mary Karpinski, LMSW, reviews those encouraging developments when she meets with the parents of a young person recently diagnosed with MS, but the most reassuring message she delivers concerns something that can’t be seen on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or quantified in an annualized relapse rate. “I remind parents that children are incredibly resilient. I explain that I’ve found young people with MS to be particularly strong, and that they can get through pretty much anything so long as parents give them the building blocks to succeed, and do not let their own worries lead them to impose well-intentioned but overly restrictive limits on what their child can do.” Ms. Karpinski speaks from considerable experience. For the past 13 years she has served as the single point of access for young people with MS receiving care at the Pediatric MS Center of the UBMD Neurology/Jacobs Neurological Institute of the University at Buffalo. “I’ve been privileged to work with and assist many young people with MS as they’ve moved from childhood into adulthood. When parents first learn that their child has MS, one of the questions they inevitably ask is, ‘What will the future hold?’ I tell them about the many young people I’ve worked with who have earned college degrees, married, built meaningful careers, and had children of their own. Some have faced more challenges than others, and everyone’s path is different, but these children – and their parents – are the most inspiring people I have met,” the social worker says. This cover story examines the progress that has been made in helping these young people deal with MS, developments on the near horizon, the key unanswered questions about pediatric MS, and experts’ advice on enhancing the health and quality of life for young people with MS. Latest information about the course of pediatric MS Exploring how – and why – pediatric MS is similar to and different from MS in adults has been a major focus of researchers. These investigators are analyzing the commonalities and contrasts for insights into everything from the factors that trigger the onset of MS in young people, to the way therapies approved for use in adults are likely to affect the course of MS in children and adolescents. While relapsing-remitting MS is by far the most common form of the disease in newly diagnosed adults, it appears to be even more predominant in children and adolescents, representing 93% or more of all pediatric cases. Meanwhile, researchers at Partners Multiple Sclerosis Center in Boston have found that young people have relapses two to three times more often than adults, and that this difference persists over at least the first six years from onset of symptoms. However, there is evidence that young people generally recover from relapses more quickly than adults. Research suggests that pediatric-onset MS takes longer to diminish physical abilities than does adult-onset MS, and also is slower to develop into secondary-progressive MS. British researchers who examined long-term outcomes in more than 2,000 MS patients found that those who developed the disease before 18 years of age, took on average, 23.8 years to reach an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 4 (on the scale, 0 represents no disability, while progression toward higher numbers leading up to 10, indicates increasing disability) versus 15.5 years for people who developed MS as adults. Similarly, time to development of secondary-progressive MS was 32 years for pediatric-onset patients and 18 years for adult-onset patients. Conversely, compared to adult-onset MS, pediatric-onset MS appears to have a greater impact on cognitive function in the years following onset of symptoms. Italian investigators who studied 48 pediatric MS patients found that 31% had some degree of cognitive impairment on initial evaluation, and that this proportion increased to 38% over five years. Meanwhile, a recent study of more than 5,700 adults with MS found that those who developed the disease as children or adolescents were roughly 1.5-times more likely to have cognitive impairment in adulthood than people whose symptoms began when they already were adults, and that this increased risk was independent of the person’s age or duration of MS. Given these findings, Emmanuelle Waubant, MD, recommends neuropsychological testing of children and adolescents who are newly diagnosed with MS. “Getting a baseline is very helpful, and can help inform approaches to working with the child’s school and other aspects of comprehensive care,” explains Dr. Waubant, a professor of neurology at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) with extensive clinical and research expertise in pediatric MS. She advises follow-up testing two-to-three years later, unless a concern in the interim warrants earlier re-evaluation. Ms. Karpinski notes that the testing can help parents identify areas of strength and need – and, as a result – better understand the challenges their child may be facing, set realistic expectations, and advocate effectively for their son or daughter. She adds, however, that it is important for parents to meet with the specialist who evaluated their child to review the test results and their implications. “The reports containing the test results can be difficult to read, both in terms of the technical language employed, and sometimes, in terms of what the evaluation identified. Rather than trying to puzzle that out on their own, parents should sit with the specialist and get the background needed to avoid misunderstandings and put the results in context,” she says. Parents also need to be aware of the heightened presence of anxiety and mood disorders in young people with MS, and to include mental-health professionals in their care team, as needed, Ms. Karpinski adds. A study of 23 young people aged 6 to 17 who had MS or another demyelinating disorder found that 48% met the criteria for a psychiatric diagnosis, with almost one-third having anxiety disorders and about 10% having depression. Another study, this one involving 45 young people, found that cognitive impairment is more common among pediatric MS patients with mood and anxiety disorders than among those without a psychiatric diagnosis. Eighty percent of the study participants who had been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, a depressive disorder, or attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), had evidence of cognitive impairment. By contrast, 55% of the 20 participants who did not have a psychiatric disorder demonstrated cognitive impairment on testing. In exploring why the course of pediatric MS often differs from that of adult MS, researchers have noted that disease onset in young people is marked by a higher disease burden and more disease activity on MRI than is seen in adults. In a study of 41 individuals with pediatric-onset MS and 35 individuals who developed MS as adults, Dr. Waubant and colleagues found that the children had a median 21 T2-bright lesions, as opposed to six in adults, and had more T2-bright areas generally and focal points in enhancing lesions, indicating greater disease activity. Another study involving 19 children and 12 adults with MS found that the pediatric patients hadw more extensive acute damage to the axons that carry electrical impulses from the central nervous system’s main type of cell, the neuron. Those and other findings suggest that pediatric MS is more inflammatory in nature than adult-onset MS. Meanwhile, another age-related aspect of MS may offer important insights into factors contributing to onset of disease. While less than 1% of all cases of MS develop before age 10 to 12 years, the condition affects boys and girls in that age group in roughly equal proportion. By age 12 and older, however, the female:male ratio in pediatric MS shifts to 2.8:1, a gender split similar to that seen in adult-onset patients. Tanuja Chitnis, MD, a professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School and pediatric MS expert at Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, noted in a 2013 article that this shift suggests a role for puberty in MS risk. E. Ann Yeh, MD, MA, FCRPC, says that just 15 years or so ago, the main challenge in diagnosing pediatric MS wasn’t necessarily obtaining an MRI to see what happening in a brain. Rather, she explains, the bigger issue often was what was happening in a brain. “Pediatricians, and even child neurologists, just weren’t trained to think in terms of children having MS. We were given the impression in residency and fellowship that MS did not occur in children, or that if it did, it was so rare that MS should not be high on the list of possibilities to consider when a young person presented with symptoms that could reflect a demyelinating event,” recalls Dr. Yeh. Today, as director of the MS and Demyelinating Disorders Program at The Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids) in Toronto, the physician sees dozens of children with MS from across Ontario and nearby Canadian provinces and American states. Greater awareness that pediatric MS is a real – albeit quite uncommon – condition has contributed to significant improvements in the timeliness and accuracy of diagnosis, according to Dr. Yeh, who is also a senior associate scientist in Neurosciences & Mental Health at SickKids and a professor of pediatrics (Neurology) at the University of Toronto. Factors such as increased access to MRI and the development of a diagnostic pathway by the International Pediatric MS Study Group (IPMSSG) have been particularly important in this regard, notes Dr. Yeh, who estimates that the average child with MS is now diagnosed within about six months of symptom onset. The IPMSSG guidance is intended to help clinicians evaluate young people who present with indications of a possible acquired demyelinating syndrome, meaning symptoms suggesting that the myelin sheath that coats nerves in the central nervous system has been damaged. Such symptoms may include visual loss, double vision, sensations of tingling or numbness, weakness, abnormal or uncoordinated movements, and urinary issues, similar to adults who develop relapsing-remitting MS. Acquired demyelinating syndromes (ADS) in pediatric patients include acute disseminating encephalomyelitis (ADEM), neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD), clinically isolated syndromes (CIS), and multiple sclerosis. Beyond distinguishing between the conditions within that group of disorders, however, pediatric neurologists also need to consider other conditions that may cause the same symptoms seen with demyelinating syndromes. “The differential diagnosis for pediatric MS is quite broad, and includes a number of ‘MS mimics’ that are different from those that have to be considered when evaluating potential adult-onset MS,” notes Dr. Waubant. To help narrow that differential diagnosis, which essentially is a list of possible causes, the IPMSSG’s 2016 evaluation pathway identifies red flags that suggest a child may not have a demyelinating syndrome. The document also recommends a protocol for employing blood tests, assessment of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), imaging, and other steps to identify specific demyelinating syndromes, including MS. The IPMSSG notes that a diagnosis of pediatric MS is warranted when a child or adolescent has two or more episodes presumed to be caused by inflammatory demyelination that do not represent ADEM and that occur more than 30 days apart. The episodes must involve more than one site in the central nervous system. The group also identifies three other, less-common scenarios that justify the diagnosis. However, Dr. Waubant notes that an intriguing, related question remains unanswered. “In the last 10 years or so, we’ve tended to see more patients with pediatric MS than we did previously. Greater awareness of the condition and improved diagnosis clearly play roles in this, but we just don’t know whether – beyond those factors – there also has been an increase in the actual number of children and adolescents who are developing MS,” she explains. Dr. Yeh agrees, and notes that as physicians become more skilled at making an early diagnosis, along with greater patient access to magnetic resonance imaging, the proportion of cases of pediatric MS that go unrecognized will be reduced. According to Dr. Yeh, “We should be able to tell what’s happening.” She adds that even accounting for such issues, “the numbers do seem to be going up.” (See “Risk Factors for Pediatric MS Coming into Sharper Focus.”) Recent study-based estimates of the incidence – or number of new cases per year – of pediatric MS vary from 0.07 to 2.9 per 100,000 children. Even the higher figure in that range represents an extremely small percentage of young people, however, and it is estimated that there are fewer than 5,000 pediatric MS patients in the United States. More treatment options and more patients receiving treatment The FDA has approved 17 DMTs for use in adults with MS. Eight, including the longest-approved agents, are administered by injection, while five are taken orally, and four are infused intravenously. Only one of those medications, the oral-agent Gilenya (fingolimod), is also approved for use in children and adolescents aged 10 years and older. The FDA expanded Gilenya’s indication to include pediatric MS patients in May 2018. Even before that approval, many pediatric MS specialists prescribed DMTs for their patients in an attempt to prevent relapses and disease progression. However, they often proceeded hesitantly because of a lack of data on the agents’ optimal dosing and safety profile in children and adolescents. Recent years have seen that hesitancy yields to a more pro-active approach, according to Dr. Waubant. “There has been a trend over time to treat pediatric MS more aggressively,” she notes, explaining that several factors are propelling the trend. One, she notes, is growing evidence that early intervention in the MS-disease process can favorably impact not only a patient’s current health, but also long-term well-being. At the same time, clinical trials, observational studies, and patient registries are providing reassuring data about the safety profiles of DMTs in children and adolescents. Expanded options, particularly in terms of route of administration, also has helped. “Teenagers very often are reluctant to consider agents that require an injection, but are willing to take an oral agent,” the pediatric MS expert notes. The fact that one agent has been approved by the FDA for use in children and adolescents, and that other DMTs approved for adults are in late stages in clinical evaluation in pediatric populations, has also made both parents and payers (insurance companies) more receptive to DMTs for young patients, Dr. Waubant adds. Gilenya secured its pediatric indication on the basis of the Phase III PARADIGMS trial, which studied more than 200 young people with pediatric MS. Other pediatric studies of DMTs already approved for use in adults include ongoing Phase III trials of Aubagio (teriflunomide) and Tecfidera (dimethyl fumaric acid), an ongoing open-label trial of Lemtrada (alemtuzumab), and completed open-label trials of Tysabri (natalizumab) and Tecfidera. However, Dr. Waubant and several of her colleagues belonging to the IPMSSG note that enrollment challenges and other obstacles mean that “Phase III trials for every newly approved therapy for adult MS in the pediatric MS population are simply not feasible.” Writing in the journal earlier this year, they noted, “In the last years, convincing evidence has emerged that the biological processes involved in MS are largely shared across the age span. As such, treatments proven efficacious for the care of adults with MS have a biological rationale for use in pediatric MS given the relapsing-remitting course at onset and high relapse frequency. There are also ethical considerations on conducting clinical trials in this age group including the use of placebo owing to highly active disease. It is imperative to reconsider study design and implementation based on what information is needed.” The group went on to propose recommendations that would enable future studies to adequately assess the safety of DMT use in pediatric patients while avoiding some of the trial-design issues that made it difficult to obtain timely, meaningful results. (See ) Such studies are all the more important given the above-referenced trend toward the increased use of DMTs in children and adolescents. An analysis of 748 pediatric MS patients receiving care at practices in the US Network of Pediatric MS Centers found that 78% had received a DMT before reaching 18 years of age. However, there are indications that the more-proactive approach being taken by clinicians at pediatric MS centers is not being uniformly adopted nationwide. An analysis of claims data for 288 children and adolescents diagnosed with pediatric MS from 2010 to 2017 found that 65% did not receive a DMT in the 12 months following their diagnosis. Other research into treatment of pediatric MS is looking beyond DMTs. Several small studies have evaluated the safety and efficacy of Rituxan (rituximab) in pediatric MS. This monoclonal antibody, which depletes certain types of B cells, primarily is used in the treatment of leukemias and lymphomas. It is not approved for use in either adult or pediatric MS, but has been employed by some clinicians to treat multiple sclerosis. Investigators are also exploring the role that stem-cell therapy may play in treating pediatric MS, and are pursuing other treatments that would have remyelinating and neuroprotective effects. “One of the greatest unmet needs in pediatric MS relates to the fact that we don’t have a sufficient understanding of why there is disease progression even with adequate control of inflammation. Figuring out a way to control that progression is super important,” says Dr. Yeh. She adds that agents with mechanisms of action different from those of current DMTs will likely be needed to halt the disease progression not driven by inflammation and, hopefully, to exercise a regenerative effect. Promoting wellness for the whole person as well as for family members “Yes, MS is a part of your life, but it needn’t define your life,” Ms. Karpinski tells the young people she works with at UBMD Neurology in Buffalo. Often, she adds, parents need to hear that message more than their children do, given a parent’s increased concerns. The concerns that parents have for a child newly diagnosed with MS are often accompanied by a tendency to be over-protective, and even to feel a sense of guilt, experts say. “Parents often ask, ‘Did I do something that put my child at risk for this?’” notes Dr. Yeh. Beyond allaying parents’ unfounded fears that they are responsible for their child’s MS, she uses the question to refocus parents on ways to optimize their daughter’s or son’s health. The pediatric neurologist explains that those steps include participating in physical activity, ensuring sufficient sleep, and eating a balanced diet while avoiding extreme eating plans not supported by scientific evidence. “I particularly stress the importance of the child staying active and leading a normal life. If parents unnecessarily limit a child’s activities because of concerns about their MS, it can have a negative impact in terms of forging friendships and developing socially,” she adds. Dr. Waubant counsels parents along the same lines, and notes the importance of having a smoke-free household, and also recommends Vitamin D supplementation. In many cases, she adds, the parents’ concerns about MS extend to their newly diagnosed child’s siblings. When asked about the chances that another of their children will also develop MS, Dr. Waubant explains to parents that people who have a first-degree relative with MS have a 2% to 3% lifetime chance of having MS. “Where is my child going to be 10 years from now?” is another question Dr. Waubant hears frequently. “I explain that children with MS are less likely to have problems with physical disability than adults and, for reasons we don’t entirely understand, children are better able to recover from relapses,” the neurologist says. She also urges parents to connect with support networks for families affected by MS. (See “Support and Resources for Families Facing Pediatric MS”) Ms. Karpinski agrees that these support groups and networks are valuable resources for parents, and can help them obtain insights into handling practical issues. One example is to work with school officials to accommodate their child’s educational needs. “School districts often have many children with a diagnosis of ADHD or seizure disorder, and so they have experience with formulating educational plans centered around those conditions. But it is not unusual for a child at our clinic to be the only student in his or her district with multiple sclerosis, and educators may not appreciate the need for certain accommodations, such as extended time for test-taking or standing permission to use the restroom,” says Ms. Karpinski. After more than a decade of working with children at UBMD, Ms. Karpinski has helped several patients make the adjustment from grammar school to high school, and then to college. Along the way, she has addressed issues ranging from compliance with medication regimens to what and how a teen with MS may want to tell classmates, or a boyfriend or girlfriend, about the condition. She also has worked with patients and parents on family dynamics and practical approaches to dealing with symptoms such as fatigue and heat sensitivity. The experience, she says, has left her in awe of children with MS. “It is a privilege to work with them, and to see them flourish. They’re just amazing people, and they give me so much hope.” Support and Resources for Families Facing Pediatric MS Learning that your child has a serious, lifelong condition can be overwhelming. When that condition is so uncommon that you do not know of anyone else in the same situation, a sense of isolation can add to a parent’s anxiety. Resources including the Multiple Sclerosis Association of America (MSAA) are available to assist. Parents may call MSAA’s toll-free Helpline at , to speak to an MSAA specialist. Parents and others also can obtain information from MSAA’s Helpline by emailing , and by using the online MS Chat feature on MSAA’s website at . MSAA’s website also has numerous other resources of interest to people of all ages who are coping with the challenges of MS.

586d1b32-7378-4402-8526-c2f0e6da3309,"Multiple Sclerosis May Triple the Risk of Early Death for Younger Patients — A new study has found that people with MS have a much greater risk of dying younger. Researchers have concluded that people with multiple sclerosis in certain age groups may have a three-fold risk of an early death compared to those without the disease. In a study published by the American Academy of Neurologyresearchers from the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, Canada, reported that overall people with MS may have double the risk of dying early compared to people without the disease. The risk of an early death increased in younger MS populations. Those under 59 were at a three times higher risk compared to their non-MS counterparts. “Despite studies that show MS survival may be improving over time, the more than 2.3 million people affected worldwide by this disabling disease still face a risk of dying earlier, specifically those who are diagnosed younger,” study author Ruth Ann Marrie, M.D., Ph.D., of the University of Manitoba, said in a news release. Read More: How Occupational Therapy May Help Those with Multiple Sclerosis » Researchers collected data from 5,797 people with MS and 28,807 people without MS. They found that the median lifespan of someone in the MS group was almost 76 years, compared to 83 years for someone without MS. That change corresponds to a two-fold increased risk of death for those with MS, according to the study. The study found that for those under 59 years, there was a three-fold increase in risk of death compared to peers without MS. The risk decreases once someone is past the age of 80. There is less than a two-fold increase in risk of death in that age group. The study did conclude that people with MS have a lower risk of dying from diabetes, hypertension, and in particular, chronic lung disease than people who don’t have the disorder. That may be because people with MS make better use of health care services, according to the study. “Treating other conditions better may be a way of improving survival,” Marrie said. Related News: Treatment at the First Sign of Illness Improves MS » MS is a disease that affects more than 2.3 million people worldwide, and it is without a cure. The cause of MS is still unknown, though it’s thought that the disease is triggered by environmental factors in people that are genetically predisposed to the condition, according to the . The disorder affects the central nervous system and decreases the system’s ability to function by attacking the protective coating — myelin — on a person’s nerves. Without the central nervous system, the stream of information from the brain to other parts of the body is disrupted. The symptoms of MS are unpredictable and vary depending on the person.

2a196702-ab5e-44c9-9928-73acf63ad0bb,"Why Americans with Multiple Sclerosis Are Traveling to Russia for Treatment — An experimental treatment for MS known as HSCT is available in North America, but it’s more accessible and less expensive in Russia. People with in the United States and Canada are traveling to Russia for an experimental treatment that’s a potential cure for the disease. However, there are still a number of risks involved. Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) is a therapy for MS that has, in many cases, been shown to halt progression of the disease with a single treatment. However, in North America, the procedure is still considered experimental and isn’t widely available. It’s also costly. For individuals facing a potential lifetime of MS, the allure of a cure abroad is tantalizing. According to Bruce Bebo, executive vice president of research at the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, HSCT treatment is promising. But he cautions there still aren’t enough rigorous clinical studies on it to weigh the real risks and benefits. is a demyelinating autoimmune disease in which the body’s immune system begins to attack the myelin, the protective insulation of the nervous system. These attacks cause scarring (sclerosis) that leads to a host of neurological symptoms from tremors and loss of vision, to difficulty with speech. It’s typically diagnosed in individuals between the ages of 20 and 40. HSCT is a complex procedure that requires a bone marrow transplant similar to that used by oncologists for certain blood cancers. The treatment is an attempt to “reboot” the immune system and stop it from attacking the brain and spinal cord. “One way to think about it is that you are reeducating and creating a new immune system,” Bebo told Healthline. “It appears that in many cases when you do this, that new immune system learns that the central nervous system isn’t dangerous anymore and it doesn’t attack it anymore.” In the first step of HSCT treatment, chemotherapy is used to stimulate the production of bone marrow stem cells and promote their release into the bloodstream. This blood is then drawn and stored. The patient is then given a strong dose of more chemotherapy, most often in a hospital setting, for up to 11 days. During that time, immune cells are either dramatically weakened or killed entirely. Finally, the patient’s stored stem cells are infused back into the body, learning to leave the nervous system intact. Patients must take antibiotics to fight off infections while their immune systems are suppressed. They must also stay in the hospital for weeks at a time while their immune system rebuilds. A recent study said that the average hospital stay after the stem cell infusion lasted . That may be a small price to pay to stop a chronic illness, especially for individuals. There’s also the matter of the real price — as in dollars. “I think [the reason] people are leaving the country has to do with cost,” said Bebo. “I’m aware of many people who although they have to fight tooth and nail to get it, can get their insurance company to cover most or all the costs of this procedure in the U.S. It’s expensive.” The cost is in the six-figure range. that it could be done in the United States for about $125,000. It’s a lot cheaper to go to Mexico or Russia to get HSCT therapy, where “they will perform the therapy for a fraction of the cost,” said Bebo. There are also caveats to the treatment, dependent on the MS diagnosis. Broadly speaking, there are two major types of MS: relapsing and progressive. Relapsing, the more common form, is identified by intermittent “attacks” or exacerbations in which symptoms will worsen for a period and then dissipate. As the disease progresses, the exacerbations get worse and the overall disability of the person increases. Bebo describes progressive MS as a “slow, steady progression of disability.” It’s less common but significantly more difficult to treat. “What little evidence we have at this point suggests that people with progressive MS don’t respond to HSCT,” said Bebo. Typical drug regimens for relapsing MS, called disease modifying therapies (DMTs), also tend to be less effective for progressive MS. This “gap,” as Bebo puts it, in treatment between progressive and relapsing MS may be driving medical tourism abroad. Against doctors’ recommendations, patients may still elect to travel abroad to seek out HSCT for progressive MS. New drugs, such as Ocrevus (ocrelizumab), have been approved more recently by the FDA for the treatment of progressive MS. It’s not a trivial procedure and has been known for its . A study from 2017 concluded that while the procedure showed significant benefit against MS progression, the overall transplant-related mortality rate was about 2 percent. As the procedure has improved, so have mortality rates. An older 2002 study of 85 MS patients treated with HSCT in the group — a mortality rate of about 8 percent. “I think there are still many neurologists who remember the older studies, the high risk of mortality,” said Bebo, “and until there is a rigorous, well-controlled study that documents the effectiveness and mortality risk, then I think some neurologists are going to be hesitant to recommend the therapy.” But Bebo and his colleagues at the MS society are also enthusiastic about the growing interest and research being done on HSCT. “I do see the neurology community being more accepting of this approach than they have in the past.” However, he emphasizes that HSCT isn’t an MS panacea. Depending on the diagnosis, the procedure must find its way into established therapy methods. While HSCT is available in the United States today, it could still be years before it’s easily accessible — and affordable. “We really look forward to the day when we have results from a really well-controlled, rigorous clinical trial to really tell us once and for all what’s the full benefit of this, what are the full risks, and who is the person most likely to benefit from it,” said Bebo. Until then, people living with MS may choose to seek out treatment abroad, where the chance at a permanent cure may already be available. In the race against a chronic illness, the U.S. medical system may just be moving too slowly for the young and the desperate. — Study Looking at High-Dose Biotin as a Treatment for Multiple Sclerosis Promising Treatments and Clinical Trials for Relapsing-Remitting MS Could an Undiagnosed Sleep Disorder be Causing Your MS Fatigue?

Multiple Sclerosis: Symptoms, Management & New Research Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the brain and spinal cord. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease that affects the central : the brain and spinal cord. In MS, the body's immune system mistakenly attacks myelin, the protective coat surrounding nerve fibers. The destruction of myelin leads to ""sclerosis,"" or the formation of scar tissue. It also impairs the ability of nerve cells to transmit signals in the form of electrical impulses. MS is an . That means that ""for some reason, your immune system is acting incorrectly and it becomes intolerant to its own central nervous system,"" said Dr. Karen Blitz, director of the North Shore-LIJ Multiple Sclerosis Care Center in East Meadow, New York. It's not known what causes this condition, which can take an unpredictable and varying course among patients. People with MS can experience a variety of neurological impairments related to the functioning of the brain and spinal cord. This includes problems with vision, muscle control and sensory issues in the limbs, according to the . MS affects 400,000 Americans and about 2.5 million individuals globally, according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health. Patients are typically diagnosed between ages 20 and 40, and the disease tends to affect women more often than men. Diagnosing MS is often difficult and requires clinical detective work. ""We get a history from the patient, we examine the patient, and then we do some testing,"" Blitz said. Looking at symptoms or test results by themselves cannot conclusively point to MS, according to the . Tests for MS include neurologic exams (to test nerve function, sensation and reflexes) and . An MRI identifies scarring or lesions in the brain and spinal cord. One of the key aspects of diagnosing MS is to determine whether nerve damage is present in more than one spot, and whether that damage occurred at different times. In 2017, the International Panel on the Diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis published new guidelines —  — on the use of MRIs and cerebrospinal fluid analysis for speedy diagnosis of MS. Blood tests may be done to rule out diseases that can mimic MS. ""There are many such diseases, but some examples include Lyme disease, vasculitis, thyroid dysfunction, B12 deficiency and migraine headaches,"" Blitz said. ""Then you put all these pieces together to come up with a clinical diagnosis."" Symptoms of MS can differ in each patient, depending on which nerve fibers are affected. According to the , the symptoms include: Numbness or weakness, which can occur on one side of the body, or the legs and trunk. The sensation of an ""electric shock"" upon moving the neck, also known as Lhermitte's sign. Blurred or double vision. Also, partial or total vision loss in one eye at a time, usually with pain during eye movement Each patient's MS symptoms may progress differently. Patients usually face one of the four following disease courses, according to the U.S. National Library of Medicine: : Marked by attacks of MS symptoms (relapses), followed by periods without symptoms (remissions). The attacks do not worsen over time. About 80% of patients are diagnosed with relapsing-remitting MS. : After about 10 years of experiencing relapsing-remitting MS, the pattern can change into secondary-progressive MS. The attacks progressively worsen, with no periods of remission. : This is the second most common form of MS. With no relapses or remissions, this type is marked by constant and steadily worsening symptoms. About 10-20% of patients have primary-progressive MS. : Initially marked by constant, steadily worsening symptoms, similar to primary-progressive MS. However, this rare type also includes attacks of more severe symptoms. While most MS patients experience one of the disease courses listed above, fulminant MS is another rare form of the disease, which mostly affects children and young adults, according to . It is similar to remitting-relapsing MS, but progresses very rapidly. Anyone can develop MS. While there is no known cause, according to the Mayo Clinic, several factors may increase the risk of developing the disease. These include: Women are two to three times more likely to develop relapsing-remitting MS. Having a parent or sibling with MS puts you at higher risk of developing the disease. Many viral infections are linked to MS. This includes the Epstein-Barr virus, which causes infectious mononucleosis. White people, are at highest risk of developing MS. In particular, those of Northern European descent. At the lowest risk, are those of Asian, African or Native American descent. MS is more common in countries farther from the equator, including southern Canada, the northern United States, New Zealand, southeastern Australia and Europe. MS is less common in countries closer to the equator. Lower levels of vitamin D and low exposure to sunlight are also risk factors. Having thyroid disease, Type 1 diabetes or inflammatory bowel disease may put one at a slightly higher risk of developing MS. For people who have MS, certain lifestyle factors have also been linked to the outcome of the disease. For example, people with MS who smoke are more likely than nonsmokers to develop a more severe form of the disease, Blitz said. Additionally, ""there is good data now that exercise is another piece of the puzzle,"" she said. Patients who exercise seem to do better than those who don't. The cause of MS is unknown and there's no cure for the disease. However, there are a number of treatments and medications available to treat the symptoms and disease progression. can slow the course of MS, reduce the number of relapses and help manage major symptoms. Here are the most commonly used ones. : These reduce inflammation associated with relapse and are the most common MS drugs, according to the Mayo Clinic. Oral prednisone and intravenous methylprednisolone are two corticosteroids used. : These medications slow the progression of MS symptoms, though they can result in liver damage. Examples include Betaseron, Avonex and Rebif (none of which comes in the generic form). : Also known as the brand name Copaxone, this IV drug can hinder the immune system's attack on myelin. Side effects can include shortness of breath and flushing, according to the Mayo Clinic. : Also known as Tysabri, this is used if other drugs don't work or aren't well-tolerated. It impedes potentially damaging immune cells from migrating from the blood to the central nervous system. : Also known as Novantrone, this immunosuppressant is typically used only in advanced MS because of risks to the heart. For MS sufferers who find it difficult to tolerate the side effects from injections, or who want the convenience of a pill, there are three oral medications approved by the FDA: Tecfidera (dimethyl fumarate), Aubagio (teriflunomide) and Gilenya (fingolimod). Other MS therapies manage symptoms or address disabilities caused by the condition. Physical and occupational therapists can demonstrate flexibility- and strength-increasing exercises as well as the use of adaptive devices that help patients perform daily tasks, according to the Mayo Clinic. According to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, some complementary health practices can help to ease MS symptoms. For instance, yoga and tai chi can help with improving fatigue and mood. and may help with spasticity and pain. Marijuana-derived medications are not approved by the FDA at this time. However, Canada and some European countries have approved Sativex, a prescription mouth spray for muscle control. In 2018, the to treat both relapsing-remitting and primary-progressive MS. In clinical trials, it was shown to significantly slow disease progression in both forms. In MS patients, (a type of white blood cell) have been shown to accumulate in lesions, or areas of scarring. The drug, which is an antibody, targets and destroys specific types of B-cells in the body. As of January 2019, other promising drugs are in late-stage , according to published in the journal Lancet. is a drug for the treatment of progressive MS. In Phase 2 trials it reduced the rate of brain atrophy by about 48%. Researchers are also conducting clinical trials with pediatric MS patients to test drugs approved for use in adults. The review reported that much of current research on treating MS is focused on identifying new biomarkers for the disease, particularly those that can indicate the degeneration of neurons.

5eb2be07-cabc-407c-a9de-6ab7f7488611,"Medically reviewed by — — Understanding the typical progression of multiple sclerosis (MS) and learning what to expect can help you gain a sense of control and make better decisions. MS occurs when the body’s immune system abnormally targets the central nervous system (CNS), though it’s not considered to be an autoimmune disorder. The attack on the CNS damages the myelin and the nerve fibers that the myelin protects. The damage disrupts or distorts the nerve impulses being sent down the spinal cord. People with MS generally follow one of four disease courses that vary in severity. The first stage to consider occurs before your doctor has made a diagnosis of MS. In this initial stage, you may have symptoms that you’re concerned about. Genetic and environmental factors are thought to play a role in who gets MS. Perhaps MS runs in your family, and you’re worried about your likelihood of developing the disease. Maybe you’ve previously experienced symptoms that your doctor has told you might be indicative of MS. At this stage, your doctor can determine whether you’re at high risk for developing the condition based on your medical history and a physical exam. However, there is no definitive test to confirm the presence of MS and many of the symptoms also occur with other conditions, so the disease can be tough to diagnose. The next step on the continuum is receiving a diagnosis of MS. Your doctor will diagnose you with MS if there is clear evidence that, at two different points in time, you have had separate episodes of disease activity in your CNS. Often it can take time to make this diagnosis because other conditions must first be ruled out. These include CNS infections, CNS inflammatory disorders, and genetic disorders. In the new diagnosis stage, you will likely discuss treatment options with your doctor and learn new ways to manage everyday activities with your condition. There are different types and stages of MS. Learn more below about the different types. This is the first episode of symptoms caused by inflammation and damage to the myelin covering on nerves in the brain or spinal cord. Technically, CIS doesn’t meet the criteria for a diagnosis of MS as it’s an isolated incident with only one area of demyelination responsible for symptoms. If an MRI shows another episode in the past, a diagnosis of MS can be made. The type of MS generally follows a predictable pattern with periods in which symptoms worsen and then improve. Eventually it may progress to . According to the , around 85 percent of people with MS are initially diagnosed with relapsing-remitting MS. People with RRMS have flare-ups (relapses) of MS. Between the relapses, they have periods of remission. Over a few decades, the course of the disease is likely to change and become more complex. Relapsing-remitting MS can progress into a more aggressive form of the disease. The reports that, if left untreated, half of those with the relapsing-remitting form of the condition develop secondary-progressive MS within a decade of the first diagnosis. In secondary-progressive MS, you may still experience relapses. These are then followed by partial recoveries or periods of remission, but the disease doesn’t disappear between cycles. Instead, it steadily worsens. Approximately 15 percent of people are diagnosed with a relatively uncommon form of the disease, called primary-progressive MS. This form is characterized by slow and steady disease progression with no remission periods. Some people with primary-progressive MS experience occasional plateaus in their symptoms as well as minor improvements in function that tend to be temporary. There are variations in the progression rate over time. In addition to adults, children and adolescents can be diagnosed with MS. The reports that between 2 and 5 percent of all MS patients noticed symptoms that started before they were 18 years old. Pediatric MS follows a similar course of progression as the adult form of the disease with similar symptoms as well. However, some children experience additional symptoms, such as and . Also, the disease course may progress more slowly for younger people than it does for adults. There are a variety of treatment options available to a person diagnosed with MS. Your doctor and medical team can help you find the best combination of treatments to manage your symptoms and improve your quality of life. Prescription treatments and medical interventions include: Any time you’re making a change to your treatment plan, consult your doctor first. Even natural remedies can interfere with medications or treatments you’re currently taking. When you’re aware of what to look for in each stage of MS, you can take better control of your life and seek appropriate treatments. Researchers continue to make strides in their understanding of the disease. Improved therapeutic advances, new technologies, and FDA-approved medications are having an impact on the underlying course of MS. Using your knowledge and working closely with your doctor can make MS easier to manage throughout the course of the disease. Are there any ways to slow the progression of MS? If so, what are they? Besides a healthy diet and exercise with stretching, make sure you are taking in enough Vitamin D since MS patients have been found to be deficient. And as always, taking MS medications regularly has been shown to slow the disease progress and prevent relapse. Answers represent the opinions of our medical experts.

Multiple sclerosis, often called MS, is a disease that attacks the central nervous system (CNS), which includes the optic nerves (the nerves that transmit visual information from the retina to the brain), brain and spinal cord. People with MS can experience a wide range of symptoms, including weakness, numbness, visual loss, double vision, imbalance and difficulties with memory and multitasking. Nerve fibers are normally surrounded by a protective covering called the myelin sheath. In people with MS, the immune system inappropriately attacks and injures the myelin sheath and the nerve fiber that it’s wrapped around. As a result, communications between the central nervous system and the rest of the body are interrupted, resulting in a variety of symptoms. In the most common form of MS, the immune system strikes the CNS episodically, causing areas or patches of damage, called “lesions,” in the optic nerves, brain and spinal cord. The symptoms a patient experiences during a given episode, or relapse, depend on the location of the lesion. For example, a lesion in the optic nerve causes visual loss, while a lesion in the middle of the spinal cord causes numbness and/or weakness below the waist. Over time, some people with MS develop gradually worsening weakness, imbalance, numbness or cognitive decline, called progressive MS. A subset of individuals experience progressive MS without relapses beforehand. MS is different for each person. Some people may go through life with only minor problems, while others may become disabled. There’s no cure for MS, but there are now drugs, called disease modifying therapies (DMT), that can decrease the risk of relapses and future nervous system damage. Our goal is to help patients reach a state of “no evidence of disease activity” (NEDA), meaning complete stability in neurological function and MRI scans, when possible. - A first episode of neurological symptoms and deficits caused by a typical MS lesion, that may evolve into definite MS in the future if additional inflammatory activity occurs. MRI scans and/or spinal fluid tests can indicate if someone with CIS has a high chance of developing definitive MS. CIS is most frequently caused by inflammation in the optic nerve (causing visual loss in one eye), spinal cord (causing numbness and/ or weakness in one or more limbs, often with bladder control difficulties), or brainstem (causing symptoms such as double vision, vertigo, and gait imbalance). In most cases, doctors will prescribe medicine for people who have CIS with risk factors for future relapses. These medicines, when taken early and even before the diagnosis of MS, may keep the disease from getting worse or extend one’s time without definitive MS. – MS characterized by recurrent, self-limited episodes of new neurological symptoms, or acute worsening of existing symptoms, followed by full or partial recovery. These episodes, which are often referred to as relapses, typically last weeks to months. By definition, they have to last one day or longer, and they’re caused by the formation of new MS lesions or the expansion of existing lesions within the CNS. Patients are generally stable during the periods between relapses, which are called remissions. However, some symptoms associated with MS, such as fatigue and muscle spasms, can persist during remissions, Most people who develop MS have a relapsing-remitting course initially. RRMS occurs 2 – 3 times more often in women than men, and usually is diagnosed in young adulthood (20s to 30s). – This is a phase of MS that follows the relapsing-remitting course in some individuals. It’s marked by steadily and gradually worsening neurological disability, usually in the form of weakness and/or numbness in one or more limbs, gait imbalance, and/or memory difficulties. The secondary progressive phase typically starts after 15 – 20 years of relapsing remitting disease. Not everyone with RRMS develops SPMS. Progressive MS is considered to be active when relapses, or new inflammatory lesions detected on MRI scans, are superimposed on the gradual neurological decline. Active disease is more likely to be responsive to disease-modifying therapy. – This is a form of MS characterized, from its inception, by steadily worsening neurologic disability, without prior clinical relapses and remissions. It resembles SPMS, except for the absence of a history of episodic neurological symptoms before the gradual decline becomes evident. PPMS is equally common in men and women, and it’s generally diagnosed in mid-life (40s to 50s). As in SPMS, some people with PPMS experience relapses and/or new inflammatory MRI lesions, superimposed on the progressive disease course. In those cases, the disease is considered to be active and is more likely to be slowed down by treatment with disease-modifying therapies. Sometimes, people without symptoms of an MS attack who undergo an MRI for other reasons, such as headache or head trauma, are incidentally found to have lesions that resemble the lesions seen in MS. These people should be examined by an MS specialist and may need additional tests. If they have never had symptoms suggestive of an MS attack and their exam is normal, they do not have and cannot be diagnosed with MS. A scenario such as this is called radiologic isolated syndrome (RIS). The diagnosis of RIS is made when MRI pictures look very similar to MS, but there haven’t ever been symptoms of an MS attack. People with RIS should be under the care of an MS specialist and generally are monitored with annual MRI scans to detect future areas of inflammation in the brain and spinal cord, which sometimes don’t cause symptoms. In a five-year period, 34% of individuals with RIS will be diagnosed with MS after they develop symptoms of an MS attack. Modify your home to keep it safe and easy to get around. For example, to help prevent falls, install grab bars in the bathroom and don’t use throw rugs. Try adjusting your daily schedule so that your routine is less stressful or tiring. Be physically active and try to exercise at least five days each week, either on your own or with the help of a physical therapist. Yoga and stretching improve the quality of life for many people with MS. Get help with urination problems. At some point, most people with MS have bladder problems. Your doctor may prescribe a medicine to help you. In some cases, you may be referred to a urologist, who specializes in conditions that affect the bladder. Avoid getting overheated. Increased body temperature can temporarily make your symptoms worse. Use an air conditioner, keep your home cool, and avoid heated swimming pools and hot tubs. During warm or hot weather, exercise in an air-conditioned area rather than outdoors, and wear a cooling vest or collar when you go outside. Eat plenty of fruits, vegetables, grains, cereals, legumes, poultry, fish, lean meats and low-fat dairy products. A balanced diet for a person who has MS is the same as that recommended for most healthy adults. For more advice about coping with MS at home, contact the National Multiple Sclerosis Society at .

bec6711e-43e5-4ad8-a282-e55b0dc83a22,"Complementary & Alternative Medicines Find Programs & Services in Your Area COVID-19 Vaccine Guidance for People Living with MS     Multiple sclerosis is an unpredictable, often disabling disease of the central nervous system. Symptoms range from numbness and tingling to blindness and paralysis. The progress, severity, and specific symptoms of MS in any one person cannot yet be predicted, but advances in research and treatment are moving us closer to a world free of MS. Most people living with MS are diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 50, with more than twice as many women as men being diagnosed with the disease. There are an estimated 8-10,000 children under the age of 18 who also live with MS. Studies indicate that genetic factors could make certain individuals more susceptible to the disease, but there is no evidence that MS is directly inherited. It occurs more commonly among Caucasians, especially those of northern European ancestry, but people of African, Asian, and Hispanic backgrounds are not immune. More than 2.3 million people are affected by MS worldwide. Because the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) does not require U.S. physicians to report new cases, and because symptoms can be completely invisible, the prevalence of MS in the U.S. can only be estimated. The Society continues to advocate for the establishment of a national registry that will track the number of people living with MS and has made a commitment to re-evaluate the current prevalence estimate and investigate the process by which an updated estimate can be identified. The progress, severity, and specific symptoms of MS in any one person cannot yet be predicted. The disease varies greatly from person to person, and from time to time, in the same person. For instance, one person might experience abnormal fatigue, another might have severe vision problems, and another could develop attention and memory issues. Even severe symptoms could disappear completely and the person could regain lost functions. In the worst cases, however, people can have partial or complete paralysis. In MS, symptoms result when inflammation and breakdown occur in myelin, the protective insulation surrounding the nerve fibers of the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord). The nerve fibers themselves are also damaged. Myelin is destroyed and replaced by scars of hardened ""sclerotic"" patches of tissue. Such lesions are called ""plaques,"" and appear in ""multiple"" places within the central nervous system. This can be compared to a loss of insulating material around an electrical wire, which interferes with the transmission of signals. Life expectancy for people with MS has increased over time. We believe this is due to treatment breakthroughs, improved healthcare and life style changes. Recent research however, indicates that people with MS may live an average of about seven years less than the general population because of disease complications or other medical conditions. Many of these complications are preventable or manageable. Attention to overall health and wellness can help reduce the risk of other medical conditions, such as heart disease and stroke, that can contribute to a shortened life expectancy. In some rare instances, there are cases of MS that progress rapidly from disease onset and can be fatal. No. The majority of people living with MS do not become severely disabled. Two-thirds of people who have MS remain able to walk, though many will need an aid, such as a cane or crutches. No. MS is neither contagious nor directly inherited, although studies indicate that genetic factors might make certain individuals more susceptible to the disease. Not yet. However, advances in treating and understanding MS are being achieved daily and the progress in research to find a cure is very encouraging. In addition, many therapeutic and technological advances are helping people manage symptoms and lead more productive lives. Several FDA-approved medications are now available and have been shown to impact the underlying course of MS. What medications and treatments are available for MS?  The National Multiple Sclerosis Society recommends that people living with MS begin treatment with one of the disease modifying drugs, Avonex®, Betaseron®, Copaxone®, or Rebif® as soon as you are diagnosed with a relapsing form (the most common kind) of MS. Those drugs help to lessen the frequency and severity of MS attacks, reduce the accumulation of lesions in the brain, and slow progression of disability. Novantrone® (mitoxantrone) is approved for reducing disability and/or frequency of relapses in patients with worsening relapsing MS. This is the first therapy approved in the United States for individuals with secondary progressive MS or who are experiencing a rapid worsening of the disease. In addition, approved by the FDA for return to market, is Tysabri®, which is generally recommended for patients who have had inadequate response to, or are unable to tolerate, other approved disease-modifying MS therapies for relapsing forms of MS. Many therapies are available to treat symptoms such as spasticity, pain, bladder problems, fatigue, and weakness. People should consult with a knowledgeable physician to develop the most comprehensive approach to managing their MS. In early MS, elusive symptoms that come and go might indicate any number of possible disorders. Some people have symptoms that are very difficult for physicians to interpret, and these people must ""wait and see."" While no single laboratory test is yet available to prove or rule out MS, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a great help in reaching a definitive diagnosis. In an effort to develop a common language when discussing, evaluating, and treating MS, the Society conducted an international survey among scientists who specialize in MS research and patient care. Analysis of the responses resulted in the publication of four disease courses in 1996. In 2013, the International Advisory Committee on Clinical Trials of MS updated the based on advances in the understanding of the disease process in MS and in MRI technology: : a first episode of neurologic symptoms caused by inflammation and demyelination in the central nervous system that may or may not go on to become MS. a disease course characterized by clearly defined flare-ups (relapses) or episodes of acute worsening of neurologic function followed by remissions (with partial or complete recovery) during which no disease progression occurs. Frequency: Approximately 85% of people are diagnosed with RRMS. a disease course characterized by nearly continuous worsening from the onset of symptoms, with or without occasional relapses. The rate or progression varies over time, with occasional plateaus. Frequency: Approximately 15% of people are diagnosed with PPMS. a disease course that follows after an initial RRMS course. Following an initial period of time with RRMS, the disease becomes more steadily progressive, with or without occasional relapses.  Frequency: If left untreated, 50% of people with relapsing-remitting MS develop this form of the disease within about 10 years of initial diagnosis. © 2020 The National Multiple Sclerosis Society is a tax exempt 501(c)3 nonprofit organization.

a9e19085-52cc-42dd-a972-f64c460c187d,"Preserving Myelin Sheath Cells Could Be a Way to Attack MS Researchers say the destruction of these sheaths causes multiple sclerosis symptoms. Scientists have suggesting that myelin repair in people with multiple sclerosis may be possible as long as certain cells still survive. These cells, called oligodendrocytes, are acquired since birth and make up the myelin sheaths around the nerves that are destroyed by the disease. The destruction of the sheaths causes symptoms associated with MS. Repairing myelin may be the only way to repair damage from the disease’s progression. “People with MS do not generate cells needed for re-myelination. Instead their bodies depend upon cells given at birth,” Dr. Jonas Frisén, the lead study author and a professor of stem cell research at Karolinska Institutet in Sweden, told Healthline. “We need to save these cells.” To obtain their data, study authors relied upon nuclear bomb tests that were conducted in the United States, Soviet Union, and other countries in the 1950s and 1960s. The residue of the bomb tests released radioactive carbon into the atmosphere that spread around the globe. The residue left a lasting mark on human cells. This marker was used, postmortem, to determine the age of cells. “The results were a big surprise,” Frisén said. “This is technically difficult to approach in humans. There is no other source of a marker in the environment that is integrated in DNA and can be used for the analysis of cell generation. This is the first human study.” What the researchers found was contradictory to previous thinking. In mice models, it’s the new oligodendrocytes that repair the myelin. But in humans, it’s the old cells that come to the rescue. “These results strengthen the support to treat MS aggressively and early in the disease to prevent loss of oligodendrocytes, which are not replaced efficiently. We need to save the ones we have,” Frisén said. “This was a robust study containing about 40 MS tissues and about the same healthy tissues,” he said. The postmortem samples came from tissue banks in the United Kingdom, United States, and other countries. The study is changing the way experts think about treatment strategies. “It means that prompting new oligodendrocytes is not a viable strategy,” Frisén said. “Instead, we need to keep them alive and functioning and trigger them to repair.” “This is a very provocative paper,” Claude Schofield, PhD, director of discovery research at the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, told Healthline. “If it turns out to be true, it’s a pretty important finding.” “This will have a massive impact on how we view our approach to treating MS,” Schofield added. “More research is needed. But measuring the age of cells is not available. If we could develop chemical markers (other than nuclear isotopes) that could date cells, it is possible to recreate and do the research needed.” “This study was done postmortem with donated tissue. If we could develop markers to use with imaging techniques, we could better understand the pathology of individual MS and lead to better treatments,” Schofield said. Some cells may create longer myelin sheaths or have other unique features. These subgroups of cells were identified in a recently published in the journal Nature. The findings may be important to understanding disease progression and developing therapeutic approaches. “This is huge for MS,” Schofield said of the second study. “It will revolutionize the way we look at MS.” Schofield explains how, up until this study, we could only identify a cell by its shape and other features. But with this new methodology, we’re able to see a fingerprint of the cell and know everything about it. He likened it to the difference between a rotary phone and today’s smartphones. “Now we can find differences that we would never detect before,” he said. “In terms of understanding disease, this is the future, the most important thing going on in biology right now.” Caroline Craven is a patient expert living with MS.

7a31b320-0fb9-4fa1-a497-2a9254ab33fc,"— — (MS) is a condition where the body’s immune system attacks healthy tissue in the central nervous system (CNS). Areas affected include the: Several types of multiple sclerosis exist, but doctors don’t currently have a definitive test to determine if someone has the condition. Because there isn’t a single diagnostic test for MS, your doctor may run several tests to rule out other possible conditions. If the tests are negative, they may suggest other tests to find out if your symptoms are due to MS. However, innovations in imaging and continued research on MS in general have meant improvements in diagnosing and treating MS. The CNS acts as the communication center in your body. It sends signals to your muscles to make them move, and the body transmits signals back for the CNS to interpret. These signals could include messages about what you’re seeing or feeling, such as touching a hot surface. On the outside of the nerve fibers that carry signals is a protective casing called myelin (MY-uh-lin). Myelin makes it easier for nerve fibers to transmit messages. It’s similar to how a fiber-optic cable can conduct messages faster than traditional cable. When you have MS, your body attacks myelin and the cells that make myelin. In some cases, your body even attacks the nerve cells. vary from person to person. Sometimes, symptoms will come and go. Doctors associate some symptoms as being more common in people living with MS. These include: difficulty thinking, such as affected memory and problems focusing vision problems, including blurred vision and pain with eye movement If you have any of these symptoms, talk to your doctor. MS isn’t the only condition that results from damaged myelin. There are other medical conditions your doctor may consider when diagnosing MS that could include: , like collagen vascular disease Your doctor will start by requesting your medical history and reviewing your symptoms. They will also perform tests that can help them assess your neurological function. Your neurological evaluation will include: Your doctor may also order blood tests. This is to rule out other medical conditions and vitamin deficiencies that could be causing your symptoms. Evoked potential (EP) tests are those that measure the brain’s electrical activity. If the test shows signs of slowed brain activity, this could indicate MS. Testing EP involves placing wires on the scalp over specific areas of your brain. You’ll then be exposed to light, sounds, or other sensations while an examiner measures your brain waves. This test is painless. While there are several different EP measurements, the most accepted version is the visual EP. This involves asking you to view a screen that displays an alternating checkerboard pattern, while the doctor measures your brain’s response. (MRI) can show abnormal lesions in the brain or spinal cord that are characteristic of an MS diagnosis. In MRI scans, these lesions will appear bright white or very dark. Because you can have lesions on the brain for other reasons, like after having a stroke, your doctor must rule out these causes before making an MS diagnosis. An MRI doesn’t involve radiation exposure and isn’t painful. The scan uses a magnetic field to measure the amount of water in the tissue. Usually myelin repels water. If a person with MS has damaged myelin, more water will show up in the scan. This procedure isn’t always used to diagnose MS. But it’s one of the potential diagnostic procedures. A involves inserting a needle into the spinal canal to remove fluid. A laboratory professional tests the spinal fluid for the presence of certain antibodies that people with MS tend to have. The fluid can also be tested for infection, which could help your doctor rule out MS. Doctors may have to repeat diagnostic tests for MS several times before they can confirm the diagnosis. This is because MS symptoms can change. They may diagnose someone with MS if testing points to the following : Signs and symptoms indicate there’s damage to the myelin in the CNS. The doctor has identified at least two or more lesions in two or more parts of the CNS via an MRI. There’s evidence based on a physical exam that the CNS has been affected. A person has had two or more episodes of affected neurological function for at least one day, and they occurred a month apart. Or, a person’s symptoms have progressed over the course of one year. The doctor can’t find any other explanation for the person’s symptoms. Diagnostic criteria have changed over the years and will likely continue to change as new technology and research comes along. The most recent accepted criteria were published in 2017 as the revised The International Panel on the Diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis released these criteria. One of the more recent innovations in diagnosing MS is a tool called optical coherence tomography (OCT). This tool allows a doctor to obtain images of a person’s optical nerve. The test is painless and is much like taking a picture of your eye. Doctors know that people with MS tend to have optic nerves that look different from people who don’t have the disease. OCT also allows a doctor to track a person’s eye health by looking at the optic nerve. Is the diagnostic process different for each type of MS? Doctors have identified a number of MS types. In 2013, the International Advisory Committee on Clinical Trials of MS revised the descriptions of these types based on new research and updated imaging technology. Although the diagnosis of MS has initial criteria, determining the MS type a person has is a matter of tracking a person’s MS symptoms over time. To determine the type of MS a person has, doctors look for It’s estimated that of people with MS are initially diagnosed with , which is characterized by relapses. This means new MS symptoms appear and are followed by a remission of the symptoms. About half of the symptoms that occur during relapses leave some lingering problems, but these may be very minor. During a remission, a person’s condition doesn’t get worse. The National MS society estimates that of people with MS have . Those with this type experience a steady worsening of symptoms, usually with fewer relapses and remissions early in their diagnosis. People with this type of MS have early incidences of relapse and remission, and symptoms worsen over time. A doctor may diagnose a person with (CIS) if they have an episode of neurologic symptoms associated with MS that lasts at least 24 hours. These symptoms include inflammation and damage to myelin. Having just one episode of experiencing a symptom associated with MS doesn’t mean a person will go on to develop MS. However, if the MRI results of a person with CIS show that they might be at higher risk for developing MS, the new guidelines recommend starting disease-modifying therapy. According to the , these guidelines have the potential to reduce the onset of MS in people whose symptoms are detected in the very early stages. — — Promising Treatments and Clinical Trials for Relapsing-Remitting MS Could an Undiagnosed Sleep Disorder be Causing Your MS Fatigue?

Multiple Sclerosis: Should I Start Taking Medicines for MS? You may want to have a say in this decision, or you may simply want to follow your doctor's recommendation. Either way, this information will help you understand what your choices are so that you can talk to your doctor about them. Multiple Sclerosis: Should I Start Taking Medicines for MS? Take medicines after your first attack of multiple sclerosis or as soon as you are diagnosed. Don't take medicines now. Wait to see how the disease progresses. Your doctor may suggest medicines after your first attack or when multiple sclerosis (MS) is first diagnosed. Lasting damage to the can occur in the early stages of MS. Early treatment may prevent or delay some of this damage. Some people wait to see if their symptoms get worse before they make a decision to start taking MS medicines. Instead of medicines, you can try physical therapy, occupational therapy, and shots to help you manage your symptoms. It's hard to know the course that your MS will take. Doctors can't know for sure if your MS will get worse. A small number of people with MS have only mild disease and do well without treatment. But many get worse over time. Medicines can reduce the severity of attacks of and how often you have them. They may also reduce or delay disability. But they don't work for everyone. And there is no way to predict if they will work for you. These medicines have side effects that can range from flu-like symptoms to headaches, chest pain, flushing, infections, and allergic reactions to the injection. Some of these medicines can damage your liver or heart. These medicines are costly. Your cost will depend on your health plan coverage. Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system—the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves. It is also called MS. It can cause problems with muscle control and strength, vision, balance, feeling, and thinking. Your nerve fibers have a protective covering called . Without myelin, the brain and spinal cord can't communicate with the nerves in the rest of the body. MS slowly destroys myelin and nerve cells in the central nervous system. This causes muscle weakness and other symptoms. Most of the time, MS is not diagnosed unless a doctor can be sure you have had at least two attacks affecting at least two different areas of your . Your doctor will examine you, ask you questions about your symptoms, and do some tests. An MRI scan is often used to confirm the diagnosis. That's because the patches of damage (lesions) caused by MS attacks can be seen with MRI. MS is different for each person. You may go through life with only minor problems. Or you may become seriously disabled. Most people are somewhere in between. In general, MS follows one of four courses: Clinically isolated syndrome. The symptoms last for 24 hours or longer and go away. Relapsing-remitting. This means symptoms fade and then return off and on for many years. Secondary progressive, which at first follows a relapsing-remitting course and then becomes progressively worse. ""Progressive"" means it gets worse over time. Primary progressive. This means the disease is progressive from the start. Disease-modifying therapy means treatment to delay, change, or interrupt the natural course of the disease. For MS, this means taking medicine over a long period of time to reduce not only the number of attacks but also how bad they are. To slow down the spread of MS, your doctor may suggest medicines after your first attack or when you are first diagnosed with MS. People treated soon after being diagnosed with MS may have better results than those who delay treatment. Lasting damage to the can occur in the early stages of MS. Early treatment may prevent or delay some of this damage. Medicines for MS can be costly. They don't work for everyone. And it's hard to know who will benefit. Making a decision about starting disease-modifying therapy can be hard, especially if your symptoms have been mild. Some people wait to see if their symptoms get worse before they make a decision to start therapy. A small number of people with MS may never have more than a few mild episodes and never have any disability. But there is no way to know who will fall into this group. Medicines can't cure MS. They don't stop disease activity or reverse nervous system damage that has already happened. But drugs may reduce relapses and delay disability in many people with relapsing forms of MS. If you decide not to try disease-modifying therapy at this time, work with your doctor to monitor your health through regular checkups and periodic MRI scans to evaluate whether the disease is progressing. If new lesions are developing or existing lesions are growing, you may want to reconsider your decision and begin treatment. If you decide not to take MS medicines, there are some other things you can do. Take other medicine, such as , to relieve symptoms during attacks or relapses. Try physical therapy, occupational therapy, and other treatment you can do at home to help you manage your symptoms and adjust to living and working with MS. Do what you can to stay well. Eat a healthy diet, get plenty of rest, and try to reduce stress. Some people try alternative therapy to reduce their symptoms. Before you try any type of alternative treatment for MS, talk with your doctor about your treatment options. You can also get advice from an MS treatment center or the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. What do numbers tell us about benefits and risks of MS medicines? This section focuses on glatiramer and interferon beta, the most commonly used MS medicines. Progression from early symptoms to diagnosis of MS *Based on the best available evidence (evidence quality: ) Flushing, chest tightness, sweating, heart palpitations, anxiety, and shortness of breath (glatiramer) *Based on the best available evidence (evidence quality: ) The evidence suggests a slight positive effect for people with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. But the quality of the evidence isn't good. It is . If you have had some early symptoms of MS but don't have a clear diagnosis yet, medicine may reduce the chance that your symptoms will progress to full-blown MS. Take a group of 100 people who have had an MS-like episode but do not yet have an MS diagnosis: Without medicines, 45 to 58 out of 100 may progress to an MS diagnosis. This means that 42 to 55 may not. With MS medicines, 34 to 35 out of 100 may progress to an MS diagnosis. This means that 65 to 66 may not. Your risk of needing a hospital stay over the next 2 years may be lower if you take medicines than if you don't. : Without MS medicines, 20 people out of 100 may need to be hospitalized over the next 2 years, while 80 out of 100 may not. With MS medicines, 12 out of 100 may need to be hospitalized over the next 2 years, while 88 out of 100 may not. Many people who take MS medicines have uncomfortable side effects. : With interferon beta, 48 out of 100 may have flu-like symptoms. This means that 52 out of 100 may not. The quality of the evidence about this is . With glatiramer, 24 out of 100 may have symptoms such as flushing, chest tightness, sweating, heart palpitations, anxiety, and shortness of breath. This means that 76 out of 100 may not. The quality of the evidence about this is . Some evidence is better than other evidence. Evidence comes from studies that look at how well treatments and tests work and how safe they are. For many reasons, some studies are more reliable than others. The better the evidence is—the higher its quality—the more we can trust it. The information shown here is based on the best available evidence. The evidence is rated using four quality levels: . Another thing to understand is that the evidence can't predict what's going to happen in your case. When evidence tells us that 2 out of 100 people who have a certain test or treatment may have a certain result and that 98 out of 100 may not, there's no way to know if you will be one of the 2 or one of the 98. The National Multiple Sclerosis Society recommends that people with a definite diagnosis of MS and active, relapsing disease start treatment with medicine as soon as possible after receiving a diagnosis. Most neurologists support this recommendation and now agree that permanent damage to the nervous system may occur early on, even while symptoms are still quite mild. Early treatment may help prevent or delay some of this damage. In general, treatment is recommended until it no longer provides a clear benefit. The National MS Society also says that treatment with medicine may be considered after the first attack in some people who are at a high risk for MS (before MS is definitely diagnosed). Your doctor may suggest that you take MS medicines because: You have had symptoms that are most likely caused by multiple sclerosis, tests show you most likely have MS, and your doctor is confident that you have MS. You have just been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, and early treatment may delay damage to your central nervous system. These medicines are the only ones proved to reduce the frequency and severity of relapses and delay disability. You take the type of medicine prescribed (pills, injections, or shots). You visit your doctor regularly for blood tests and to check your progress. These drugs can make relapses less severe and reduce how often they occur. Medicines can slow the spread of the disease by limiting new areas of damage in the brain. These drugs don't work for everyone. It is hard to predict who will benefit. The long-term risks of some of these drugs are not known. Side effects of these medicines can include flu-like symptoms, headaches, diarrhea, nausea, hair thinning, depression, chest pain, anxiety, flushing, and redness and swelling at the injection site (for shots or injections). You visit your doctor regularly to check your progress. You try physical therapy, occupational therapy, and other treatment at home to adjust to living with MS. You avoid the risks and cost of medicines that you might not need or that may not work for you. You avoid taking medicine for multiple sclerosis if you end up being diagnosed with a different condition. You may have a higher chance of becoming disabled. Long-term use of steroid medicine may lead to other problems such as stomach ulcers, problems sleeping, and high blood pressure. Personal stories about treatment for multiple sclerosis These stories are based on information gathered from health professionals and consumers. They may be helpful as you make important health decisions. The MS episodes I've had were fairly mild, but I'm worried that next time the symptoms will be more severe. I don't think I'm being pessimistic by deciding to take interferon. I think I'm giving myself the best chance to live a long and healthy life. I have never been much of a risk-taker, and my health is definitely not something I want to risk. My doctor recommends that I take the medicine. Even if it turns out that I might not have needed treatment for MS, I would rather err on the side of caution by starting therapy now. I know I would really regret not doing the treatment if I had a relapse a year from now or even a few years from now. I generally try to avoid medicine when I can. My doctor really thinks it would be a good idea for me to take the medicine, but I don't want to deal with the side effects, and I'm not sure I like the idea of giving myself shots on a regular basis. I don't want to take medicine ""just in case"" I have problems with MS later. Besides, I can always reconsider if and when I have another episode. Your personal feelings are just as important as the medical facts. Think about what matters most to you in this decision, and show how you feel about the following statements. I want to try the medicine now, even though it might not work. I don't want to take the medicine if it might not work. I worry that if I don't start treatment now, I may be sorry later. I'm willing to live with the side effects of medicine. I don't know if I can handle the side effects of medicine. I want to do whatever I can to make my attacks happen less often. I want to try to handle my attacks without medicine. Now that you've thought about the facts and your feelings, you may have a general idea of where you stand on this decision. Show which way you are leaning right now. Can medicines help prevent some nervous system damage from MS? If you decide not to start medicines now, are there other things you can try? Are you clear about which benefits and side effects matter most to you? Do you have enough support and advice from others to make a choice? How sure do you feel right now about your decision? Check what you need to do before you make this decision. Here's a record of your answers. You can use it to talk with your doctor or loved ones about your decision. LaMantia L, et al. (2010).

Multiple Sclerosis Symptoms, Causes, Treatment, Diagnosis, and Life Expectancy Medical Author: Medical Editor: What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis? 5 Early Warning Signs and Symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis What Are the Common Signs and Symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis? What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis in Children and Teens (Pediatric MS)? At What Age Can Multiple Sclerosis Start? Who Has MS? What Medications Are Used for the Treatment of Multiple Sclerosis? What Drug Therapies Are Used for the Treatment and Symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis? What Is the Prognosis and Life Expectancy for MS in Adults, Teens, and Children? Is It Fatal? When Should You Seek Medical Care for Multiple Sclerosis? Multiple sclerosis is caused by damage to tissues surrounding nerve fibers. () is a condition that results from damage to myelin, the tissues surrounding nerves of the brain and . Damage to the myelin is a result of an autoimmune disease in which the body produces an immune response against its own tissues. is more common in women than in men. Symptoms and signs of are extremely variable and range from mild to severe, and may include: Some people with MS may have no symptoms to mild symptoms; about 30% of those affected will have significant disability after 20-25 years with the condition. The average age of onset for MS is about 34 years of age; but children and teens also get the condition. There is no cure for MS, but disease-modifying drugs can reduce the symptoms, delay disability, and reduce progression of the condition as seen on . The body's immune system attacks nerve sheaths, causing multiple sclerosis.. Multiple sclerosis (MS) can be thought of as an immune-mediated inflammatory process involving different areas of the () at various points in time. As the name suggests, the condition affects many areas of the central or CNS. Normal nerves are surrounded by a myelin sheath to insulate and protect them from damage. This sheath also allows effects how fast nerve signals get from the brain or spinal cord (CNS) to the affected body part. As this sheath is destroyed, the nerve conduction to that body area or part decreases or is interrupted completely. The destruction is caused by the body's immune system attacking the myelin sheath. The reason that the body's immune system attacks the sheath is not understood fully, but it is believed to be related to a combination of a genetic predisposition and acquired or environmental influences.

The signs and symptoms of MS in adults, children, and teens are similar; however, children and teens with the disease (pediatric MS) also may have and complete that adults with MS do not experience. Moreover, symptoms in people with multiple sclerosis differ from person to person. Visual, sensory, and motor signs and symptoms are all part of MS; however, there is a wide range of symptoms that can appear. Some people have mild cases of MS with little or no disability over the years. Others have more severe types of MS, requiring confinement to a wheelchair or bed. Over 30% of those affected with MS will have a significant disability after 20 to 25 years. Still, others may live their entire lives symptom-free (some individuals without multiple sclerosis symptoms are found incidentally to have multiple sclerosis lesions by MRI or individuals in whom an examination of their brain after death unexpectedly reveals that they were affected by the disease). This variability makes it difficult in some cases to diagnose multiple sclerosis. Often the signs and symptoms are mistaken as being psychiatric in origin. 5 Early Warning Signs and Symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis The of multiple sclerosis are often . Large number of people with multiple sclerosis develop optic neuritis (inflammation of the , which is an extension of the central nervous system), described as a painful vision loss. If a patient is diagnosed with optic neuritis early, treatment could change the course of the disease. Before the actual loss of vision, the patient may have visual changes described by many people as blurred or hazy vision, flashing lights, or alterations in color. The tissues around the eye and moving the eye may be painful. Most people recover over several months. Others are left with permanent visual defects. Double vision occurs when the eyes move in different directions and is another common symptom of multiple sclerosis. Multiple Sclerosis Pictures, Symptoms and Treatment What Are the Common Signs and Symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis? Multiple sclerosis commonly affects the cerebellum, the portion of the brain responsible for balance and fine motor coordination. Consequently, people with multiple sclerosis often have difficulty maintaining their balance when walking and performing delicate tasks with their hands. The unexplained dropping of a cup or other objects, or unusual weakness can occur. Electrical-type pain sensations in the chest, abdomen, arms, or legs There appears to be a relationship between multiple sclerosis, higher temperatures, and the worsening of symptoms. occur in about 5% of people with multiple sclerosis. Those with MS may complain of disturbances, , or may feel that they are experiencing changes in attention span or memory. Many symptoms of multiple sclerosis lead to other complications, such as infections of the bladder (urinary infections), kidney, or blood. Any area of the body can be involved, making this disease difficult to distinguish from other nervous system disorders. What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis in Children and Teens (Pediatric MS)? The signs and symptoms of multiple sclerosis in children and teens are similar to those experienced by adults; however, they also may have seizures and extreme or lethargy. Children with MS are considered to have the form of MS known as relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. The central nervous system is made up of the brain and spinal cord. They process information from our environment and control voluntary muscle movements to allow the body to do certain things. When you touch something hot, for example, signals are sent from sensory nerve endings in your hand up long nerves in your arm, eventually reaching the spinal cord. From there, the signal is transferred up your spinal cord to your brain, where the information is processed. Your brain then sends a signal back down the spinal cord to the nerves in your arm. These nerves cause the muscles in your arm to contract, pulling your hand away from the heat. This system works efficiently, unless there is a disease process affecting the nerve pathways in the spinal cord and brain. MS is one of the diseases that can affect these pathways. The nerves in the body are covered by a fatty substance called myelin (myelin sheath). The myelin sheath insulates the nerves and allows them to transmit information to and from the brain in a fraction of a second. If the myelin is disrupted in any way, the transmitted information is not only delayed, but it may also be misinterpreted by the brain. This autoimmune destruction of the myelin sheath leads to areas of (also known as plaques) in the brain and spinal cord. These plaques disrupt the transmission of information by nerves in the CNS and lead to the symptoms seen in MS. At What Age Can Multiple Sclerosis Start? Who Has MS? MS is more common in individuals of northern European descent. Women are more than twice as likely to develop multiple sclerosis as men. Multiple sclerosis usually affects people between the ages of 20 and 50 years, and the average age of onset is approximately 34 years. Multiple sclerosis can affect children and teens (pediatric MS). It has been estimated that 2%-5% of people with MS develop symptoms prior to age 18. What Is Multiple Sclerosis? MS Symptoms, Causes, Diagnosis Diagnosing multiple sclerosis is difficult. The vague and nonspecific nature of this disease mimics many other diseases. Doctors combine history, physical exam, laboratory work, and sophisticated medical imaging techniques to arrive at a diagnosis. More often than not, a specialist is required to make a diagnosis. Examples of tests and procedures used to diagnose MS include: A (), blood chemistry, , and often spinal fluid evaluation ( or “”) are all routine laboratory tests used to rule out other conditions and help confirm the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. An MRI, which creates an image of the brain or the spinal cord, is used to search for changes within the brain or spinal cord that are unique to multiple sclerosis. What Medications Are Used for the Treatment of Multiple Sclerosis? There are several treatment options for multiple sclerosis. Listed examples below are US FDA-approved drugs to treat multiple sclerosis. These are known as disease-modifying therapies for MS. Disease-modifying therapies have been found through clinical trials to reduce the number of relapses, delay the progression of disability, and limit new disease activity that is observed on MRI. Examples of drugs used to treat MS include: Beta interferons, for example: (Mavenclad) oral tablets is a drug used to treat two forms of multiple sclerosis; relapsing forms that include relapsing-remitting disease and active secondary progressive disease in adults. Generally, cladribine is used in people with MS who have tried other that were not tolerated well or ineffective. People with clinically isolated syndrome not take cladribine. () is a agent that has been approved by the FDA to treat multiple sclerosis. Treatment with mitoxantrone requires monitoring of cardiac function, and there is a fixed limit to the dose that can be administered to patients. It also carries the long-term risk of . For these reasons, Novantrone is typically reserved for patients with more aggressive forms of multiple sclerosis. New research and treatment methods are currently being investigated and are expected to offer some hope to people with multiple sclerosis. In particular, new research studies have shown that skin patches containing myelin peptides may be a promising therapy. Consult your healthcare team for options. What Drug Therapies Are Used for the Treatment and Symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis? In addition to drugs that target the disease process, other medications used to relieve certain symptoms of MS. Muscle relaxants, for example, () Selective reuptake inhibitor () The oral phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors, for example, (), (, Adcirca), and ) (, Staxyn ODT) What Is the Prognosis and Life Expectancy for MS in Adults, Teens, and Children? Is It Fatal? Most people with the form of MS progress to a stage where relapses become much less frequent, but they continue to accumulate disabling symptoms. This new phase of the disease is termed secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. Symptoms of this type of MS are intermittent and worsen neurologic symptoms, which can last several days or weeks before returning to their original state of health. Some people, however, are left with residual deficits (residual disability) after some attacks. A few people have a form of MS. In this type, people have relapses superimposed on a pattern of continuous progression of disability. Rarely, people with multiple sclerosis have a pure progressive () forms of the disease. Their disability progresses in the absence of attacks over time. Most people with MS usually die from diseases such as or heart attacks, especially in those who are bedridden. Currently, there is no cure for multiple sclerosis. As of yet, no true way of preventing multiple sclerosis has been found. When Should You Seek Medical Care for Multiple Sclerosis? The symptoms of multiple sclerosis are very variable and differ from patient to patient. They can also be confused with symptoms of many other conditions. You should talk with your physician if you or someone you know has any of the signs and symptoms associated with multiple sclerosis or if you have any concerning symptoms. Several of the symptoms of multiple sclerosis may be severe enough to send the patient to a hospital's emergency department. Go to the nearest Emergency Department if you have any of the following symptoms: Visual changes and painful eye movements. Optic neuritis, one of the most common early signs of multiple sclerosis, causes these symptoms. If you experience personality changes or sudden loss of strength in the arms and legs. These symptoms are common with multiple sclerosis, but they can also be signs of other serious diseases that require urgent treatment such as , infection, or chemical imbalances. Managing Symptoms of MS with Diet, Exercise, and Alternative Treatments Some people with MS explore alternative forms of therapy and treatments, including many who are already taking drugs for the disease. Some people with multiple sclerosis have benefited from: Restorative, maintenance, and preventive rehabilitation Talk to your healthcare team about alternative treatments for MS.

Symptoms like impaired vision, fatigue, pain, balance problems, and muscle control difficulty could require extended periods away from a job, or hinder your ability to look for employment. Fortunately, disability insurance can replace some of your income. According to the , approximately 40 percent of all people with MS in the United States rely on some form of disability insurance, either through private insurance or through the Social Security Administration (SSA). is a federal disability insurance benefit for those who have worked and paid into social security. Keep in mind that SSDI is different from supplemental security income (SSI). That program is for low-income people who didn’t pay enough into social security during their working years to qualify for SSDI. So, if that describes you, consider looking into SSI as a starting point. In either case, benefits are limited to those who are unable to “perform substantial gainful activity,” according to Liz Supinski, director of data science at the Society for Human Resource Management. There are limits on how much a person can earn and still collect, she says, and it’s about $1,200 for most people, or around $2,000 per month for those who are blind. “That means most people who are able to qualify for disability benefits are not working for others,” says Supinski. “Self-employment is common among both disabled workers and those with disabilities severe enough to qualify for benefits.” Another consideration is that even though you might have private disability insurance, which is usually obtained as part of workplace benefits, that doesn’t mean you can’t apply for SSDI, Supinski says. Private insurance is typically a short-term benefit and usually offers smaller amounts to replace income, she notes. Most people use that type of insurance as they’re applying for SSDI and waiting for their claims to be approved. The common symptoms of MS that can interfere with your ability to work is covered under three distinct sections of the SSA’s medical criteria: includes issues related to muscle control, mobility, balance, and coordination includes vision and speaking issues, which are common in MS includes the type of mood and cognitive issues that can occur with MS, such as difficulty with depression, memory, attention, problem-solving, and information processing To make sure the process is streamlined, it’s helpful to compile your medical paperwork, including date of original diagnosis, descriptions of impairments, work history, and treatments related to your MS, says Sophie Summers, a human resources manager at software firm RapidAPI. “Having your information in one place will help you prepare your application, and can also highlight what type of info you still need to get from your healthcare provider,” she says. Also, let your doctors, colleagues, and family know you’ll be going through the application process, Summers adds. The SSA gathers input from healthcare providers as well as the applicant, and sometimes asks for additional information from family members and co-workers to determine if you qualify as disabled based on SSA criteria. Claiming disability benefits can be a complex and lengthy process, but taking the time to understand the criteria used by the SSA can help you get closer to getting a claim approved. Consider reaching out to representatives at your local SSA field office, since they can help you apply for SSDI and SSI benefits. Make an appointment by calling 800-772-1213, or you can also at the SSA website.

c0ed75a7-cee9-4ad2-a1b3-a4f556f435d5,"People with Multiple Sclerosis Should Choose Their Friends Wisely... Here’s Why Researchers say the social network of someone with MS can have an impact on their health. The people you choose to hang out with may affect your health. In fact, you may be choosing people that help you justify unhealthy habits. For those living with multiple sclerosis, these kinds of choices can lead to worse symptoms and disabilities, according to from Harvard University. People use social networks to find support, seek information, and channel their health behavior. Researchers recently looked at the characteristics of these social networks for people living with multiple sclerosis (MS) and those at risk of developing the disease. “The characteristics of people around you affect your own disability level,” said Dr. Amar Dhand, a research author and assistant professor of neurology at Brigham and Women’s Hospital at Harvard Medical School. “The habits of people around you are very influential,” Dhand told Healthline. “If your friends exercise, take their medicine, go to the doctors, these influence your own disability report.” This is independent of age, race, and gender, researchers said. The study results were based on observations of 1,493 people who were enrolled in the Genes and Environment in Multiple Sclerosis (GEMS) project, a collection of people with a first-degree family history of MS. The purpose of the GEMS project is to identify genetic and environmental risk factors, including the social environment. The GEMS participants were asked to complete an online questionnaire assessing social networks and current neurological disability. The questionnaire was live for six weeks, with reminders sent to those who didn’t respond. The estimated time to complete the survey was 10 to 20 minutes. The questionnaire started with general questions about time of diagnosis, age, race, marital and employment status. It also asked for self-reported disability ratings on eight disability factors. These were walking, using arms and hands, vision, speaking clearly, swallowing, cognition, sensation, and bowel and bladder function. It then asked for names of those people who the participant shared important matters, socialized with, or sought support from in the past three months. The number of names listed was not limited. The next set of questions analyzed the connections between each pair of the first 10 people in the network, including the strength of ties in 3 levels — strangers, weak, or strong. People with stronger connections may visit each other, travel together, or go to dinner. The final set of questions inquired about characteristics and health habits of each of the first 10 people in their network. Experts examined the percentage of the network members with negative health habits, including smoking, sedentary lifestyle, not visiting doctors regularly, and poor compliance with prescription medications. The two areas that showed the greatest disability factors were those that did not go to a doctor regularly, and those deemed to have a negative health influence on the participant. Social isolation can also be a result of unhealthy habits. It is a predictor of mortality comparable to smoking, hypertension, and physical inactivity. “Choose your people wisely,” advised Dhand. “Be very cognizant of the people around you as to optimize your function and health wellness.” Managing social networks is in the hands of the patient. “Make your own network better,” said Dhand. “Otherwise, it can be toxic for your health.” Dhand suggests the patient explore how they are choosing their network. “Are you selecting folks that have bad habits so that you can enjoy them?” Dhand said. “Your network may be filled with bad habits, but this one person has good habits,” he added. “Converse with the ones with bad habits and ask them to change. If not, possibly watch the amount of time with them. Spend time with the healthiest people.” Social networks are not new in research. But, this new quantitative tool reveals specific social environments that could be targeted in clinical trials and eventually lead to a treatment plan. “I’d love to see this inspire a type of therapy, such as network therapy,” Dhand said, “where it’s not focused on the biology of the disease but rather a therapeutic plan to help their social networks.” This quantitative survey was designed to dig deeper than past efforts. It was also designed to be shared. A version of the instrument is available for use in the . Specific computer code is available at GitHub. “We made this social network assessment tool public. It is open source so anyone can use it in their clinic or research project,” said Dhand. “We hope this changes the model of medicine from biological to social biological.” This work was supported by National Institutes of Health (NIH) grants, the Football Players Health Study at Harvard University, and the National Multiple Sclerosis Society.

aee70d35-b1f2-4d95-9bed-8b9156b3f73c,"Economic Burden of the Out-of-Pocket Expenses for People with Multiple Sclerosis in France Economic Burden of the Out-of-Pocket Expenses for People with Multiple Sclerosis in France   , , –() People with chronic diseases in France frequently incur out-of-pocket expenses (OOPE) related to their medical care. The objective of this study was to evaluate OOPE incurred by people with multiple sclerosis (MS) with respect to direct non-medical and medical expenditure. Data were collected through a web-based survey using an online patient community platform (Carenity). The survey questionnaire contained 87 questions (numerical response or Likert scale) and took less than 30 min to complete. Participants rated their disability on a ten-point scale. In total, 376 patients, with a mean age of 48.3 years (95% confidence interval [CI] 47.2–49.5), participated in the survey. Participants estimated that they spent an average of €127 each month on OOPE for their MS, principally on physician consultations (mean annual expenditure of €75 by 183 participants), non-physician consultations (€358 by 135 participants) and non-prescription medication (mean expense of €67 per pharmacy visit by 234 patients). In total, 77% of participants who needed adaptations to their home or vehicle because of their MS contributed to the cost. No obvious relationship between OOPE and self-rated disability was observed. A total of 61.4% of participants reported that they had to choose between spending money on MS care or on their family and social life. Most patients with MS incurred significant OOPE linked to consultations, non-prescription medications or home equipment and medical equipment. These outlays could lead to dilemmas when choosing between spending on MS care or family or social life. Key Points for Decision Makers Two-thirds of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) incur out-of-pocket expenses (OOPE) associated with their pathology in spite of benefiting from ALD (Affection de Longue Durée) full reimbursement status. The OOPE estimated by patients with MS represents 7% of the per capita disposable household income in France For most patients with MS, the OOPE for medications was for over-the-counter medications, whereas OOPE for consultations related to expenses related to specialists who had tariffs above ALD reimbursement levels. Multiple sclerosis (MS) directly affects around 100,000 people in France []. As the disease progresses, it is associated with poorer quality of life, greater psychological distress and loss of professional opportunities [,,]. The multifunctional manifestations of MS require multidisciplinary management involving the hospital and community sectors, a range of healthcare professionals—from neurologists, physiotherapists and specialist MS nurses to psychologists—and social services to ensure the patient can remain as autonomous as possible at home. Public health insurance in France is not fully comprehensive, and users generally have to pay a variable proportion of their healthcare consumption. However, patients with certain chronic diseases that are costly to manage, such as MS, are eligible for full coverage for medical healthcare consumption. Therefore, in principle, patients with MS should not have to contribute financially to their care. However, since not all types of care that patients might seek are fully covered by health insurance in France, patients may incur significant out-of-pocket expenses (OOPE), as has been reported in other disease areas []. In general, France has one of the lowest levels of OOPE in industrialised countries, although these have been rising over the past two decades []. OOPE may act as a barrier to patient healthcare consumption and thus be detrimental to patients’ well-being. This has been demonstrated in a number of chronic diseases, including MS [,,,]. For example, two studies from the USA reported that higher patient contributions to the cost of care were associated with lower adherence to medication [, ]. The issue of OOPE is particularly relevant to chronic disabling diseases such as MS because patients frequently cease full-time employment because of their disease and consequently experience a reduction in their disposable income []. The objective of this study was to evaluate OOPE incurred by people with MS in relation to their disease with respect to direct medical expenditure (such as medication costs) and direct non-medical expenditure (such as home adaptation for people of limited mobility). This was a web-based survey of patients with MS conducted using an online patient community platform. Participation was voluntary. The survey was available for 8 weeks in September and October 2016. The design of the survey and exploitation of the results were supervised by a scientific committee comprising a representative from a patient advocacy group, a neurologist and a pharmaco-economist. Carenity () is an online patient community in which patients with chronic diseases (1200 disease-specific communities) can share their experiences, exchange information on their disease and request advice and information. Episodically, Carenity members have the opportunity to participate in online surveys concerning various aspects of disease perceptions for medical research purposes. Participation in these surveys is voluntary, and the data are shared anonymously and in aggregate form, which means participants cannot be identified. The MS patient community on Carenity currently has around 7000 members, of whom 78.9% are patients. The present survey was available to any patient who was a member of the Carenity MS community, was aged ≥ 18 years and was resident in France. When the survey was launched, an email was sent to all eligible members inviting them to participate, and this was followed up with weekly reminder emails during the 2 months the survey was open. In addition, members of the French MS patient association, the (LFSEP), were made aware of the survey via the Facebook page of the association and received individual emails inviting them to participate. The survey questionnaire was developed by Carenity in collaboration with the scientific committee and validated by the latter. The survey questionnaire contained a total of 87 questions and took, on average, less than half an hour to complete. Most of the questions were single or multiple choice to which participants provided either a numerical response or used a Likert scale. Skip patterns were used throughout the questionnaire. The study questionnaire is available in the online supplementary material. Data collected from participants included their age, sex and information on their level of disability. As patients may not know their Expanded Disability Status Scale score [], the reference disability measure in MS, patients self-reported their disability based on a single questionnaire used previously in surveys carried out by the LFSEP []. This scale assigns a grade of 1–10 according to the patient’s level of disability (see Table ). Reimbursement status for healthcare consumption was documented. In France, the public health service does not provide comprehensive coverage of expenditure, and patients usually must pay the residual cost of care at the point of access. In total, 95% of patients subscribe to complementary health insurance, either private (subscribed to or provided by their employer) or public (so-called Universal Complementary Health Coverage [CMUC]), which may reimburse at least part of this residual cost. However, in two cases, the public health service provides 100% coverage, meaning the patient has no outlay at the point of access to care. The first is when the patient has a long-term illness identified on a limited list (ALD [Affection de Longue Durée] status), in which case they bear no costs for the care related to the listed illness; the second is when the financial resources of the patient are below a specified threshold (CMUC). In principle, all patients with MS are eligible for ALD status and thus for full reimbursement. In addition, in France, healthcare costs do not vary according to whether the patient has complementary health insurance, either private or public (CMUC). All healthcare consumption over the previous 12 months was documented. Participants were asked whether they had been hospitalised in the previous year, either for an overnight stay or for outpatient hospital visits, and, if so, how many times they had been hospitalised. They were asked to indicate whether these hospitalisations had engendered any OOPE. Participants were provided with a checklist of types of healthcare professionals (HCPs) they might have consulted and were asked which HCPs they had in fact consulted over the previous 12 months, how many times they had consulted, whether they had any OOPE for these consultations and, if so, how much. Patients were asked whether they had paid for prescription or over-the-counter (OTC) medications obtained in the pharmacy and, if so, how much they had spent. Another set of questions probed medical equipment and modifications to the home environment. OOPE were determined over a 12-month period for each expenditure item and are presented as means (95% confidence interval [CI]) and as median (range). An ordinal rating scale was used to assess patient satisfaction with their level of reimbursement. For different categories of financial outlay, they were asked to rate whether their expenses due to MS were sufficiently reimbursed on a scale ranging from 0 (very insufficient) to 10 (fully sufficient). Scores were then categorised in three classes (score 0–3: unsatisfied; 4–7: moderately satisfied; 8–10: fully satisfied) corresponding to the three main satisfaction types. Descriptive univariate and multivariate analyses were performed using the statistical software R (3.5) and Microsoft Excel 2013. For quantitative data, the following indicators were calculated: mean, median, 95% CI, minimum, maximum, quartiles and frequency ( [%]). For qualitative data, frequency distribution ( [%]) was calculated. Multivariate analysis included subgroup analysis (type of MS, disability score) and inferential statistics: Student’s test or the Wilcoxon test (quantitative data), chi-squared test or Fisher’s exact test (qualitative data). Overall, from around 5500 patients with MS being treated, 376 patients participated in the survey. This corresponded to around 7% of the Carenity MS patient community. For these respondents, the mean age was 48.3 years (95% CI 47.2–49.5), and four in five patients were women (Table ). The mean age at diagnosis was 36.8 years, and the mean patient disability rating score was 4.7. Most patients had relapsing–remitting MS (RR-MS) (48%), 26% had secondary-progressive MS (SP-MS), 15% had primary-progressive MS (PP-MS) and 11% did not know their type of MS. Overall, 270 patients (71.8%) were taking a disease-modifying treatment for their MS (89.0% of such patients had RR-MS), principally fingolimod (18.6%), dimethylfumarate (17.4%) or natalizumab (11.9%). Reimbursement Status for Healthcare and Access to Aid The vast majority of patients (347/376; 92.3%) were registered for ALD status, giving them the right to 100% reimbursement for MS-related healthcare, and seven (1.9%) patients were registered for CMUC status. In total, 200 patients subscribed to a complementary health insurance (53.2%). Of note, 19 of the 29 patients who were not registered for ALD status (65.5%) were not receiving any disease-modifying treatment. In total, 23 patients (6.1%) had a live-in nurse, and 90 (23.9%) had a live-in professional non-medical carer. Of 376 patients, 141 (37.2%) reported receiving some sort of aid from social services because of having MS (Fig. ). This included administrative aid (e.g. handicapped person parking permit), pecuniary aid (e.g. disability pensions) or, less frequently, material aid (e.g. home modifications). However, more than 70% of the patients receiving aid considered the aid to be inadequate. Overall, 217 patients were either not working or were working part time because of their MS (57.7%) (Table ). This proportion was higher in patients with PP-MS (63.2%;  = 0.0663; not significant [NS]) or SP-MS (68.4%;  < 0.05) than in those with RR-MS (48.1%). In addition, 84 of the 147 patients who were working (57.1%) had taken time off work over the last year because of their MS. This was generally paid either by social security or by the employer, although eight patients had taken unpaid leave. The median total duration of time off work was 20 days (range 1–210), and the median duration of unpaid leave was 8 days (range 7–30). In total, 97 patients (25.8%) had been hospitalised overnight because of their MS at least once in the previous year (median number of nights 5; mean 11.4; 95% CI 8.0–14.8). In addition, 159 patients (42.3%) had attended a hospital outpatient consultation because of their MS in the previous year (mean outpatient visits in the previous year 7.9; 95% CI 6.3–9.4; median 4). Of the 201 patients who visited hospital (for an overnight stay or an outpatient consultation), 163 (81.1%) reported that they needed to pay some of the associated cost. This principally related to medical procedures that were not fully reimbursed (64 patients; 31.8%), payments for personal comfort items or private rooms (57 patients; 28.4%) or transport to or from hospital (56 patients; 27.9%). In addition, 42 patients (20.9%) lost income when they went to hospital. All but eight patients had consulted a physician for their MS at least once in the previous year, and 292 patients (76.9%) had consulted more than one type of HCP. The mean number of types of physician consulted was 2.6 (95% CI 2.5–2.7) (Table ). On average, patients attended a mean of 13 physician consultations per year. The most frequently consulted specialists were neurologists, ophthalmologists and urologists (Table ). In addition, 282 patients had consulted a paramedical HCP, and the mean number of paramedical HCPs consulted was 1.6 (95% CI 1.5–1.8) (Table ), principally a physiotherapist, an MS nurse, an osteopath or a psychologist (Table ). The frequency of consultations varied markedly, from an average of 2.0 visits per year for urinary incontinence training to a mean of 62.7 physiotherapy sessions per year (Table ). For all physician types, some patients accrued OOPE, and this was most often the case for visits to ophthalmologists (49%;  < 0.05 vs. 21% to physiotherapists) and GPs (44%;  < 0.05 vs. 21% to physiotherapists). The mean OOPE per patient who used the considered service per year was €75 (median €30) and, by specialist, ranged from €2.5 for internal medicine specialists to €71.9 for psychiatrists (Table ). Most patients (77%) also accrued OOPE from visits to other HCPs. In particular, this was the case for 89% of patients who consulted osteopaths. The mean OOPE per patient who consulted non-physicians per year was €348 (95% CI 265.4–431.5; median €100), being highest for physiotherapists and psychologists (Table ). Overall, 336 patients (86.4%) underwent at least one medical procedure or test related to their MS, an average of 5.6 (95% CI 4.9–6.3) times a year. These procedures and tests included magnetic resonance imagery, computed tomography scans, echography, electrocardiogram and blood tests. The procedures were generally fully reimbursed, and only 51 patients (15.2%) reported OOPE. The mean annual expense was €192.1 (95% CI 108.5–275.6; median €58). However, five of these 51 patients reported OOPE in excess of €500. Of the 376 included patients, 327 (87.0%) reported no outlay on prescription medication for MS when they collected this from the pharmacy. The remaining 49 patients, who included 45 patients registered for full reimbursement based on ALD status, spent an average of €62.6 (95% CI 39.0–86.1; median €32) on medication at each pharmacy visit. In addition, 234 patients (62%) had purchased OTC medication for their MS during the previous month, which was entirely at their own expense. The mean cost of these medications was €66.2 (95% CI 39.0–86.1; median €32) per visit, and 38 patients spent over €100 at each visit on OTC medication. Assuming that the costs patients incurred for OTC medication were similar each month to those reported for 1 month (€66.6; 95% CI 39.0–83.3), the total mean annual OOPE on OTC medications for patients using such support would be €794 (95% CI 699–890; median €420). In total, 75 patients (19.9%) had stayed in specialised residential accommodation over the previous 12 months, principally in functional rehabilitation clinics (75 patients). Of these 75 patients, 12 (16.0%) had to pay for all (one patient) or part (11 patients) of the residential stay costs, amounting to a mean OOPE of €331 for these patients. Three patients spent over €500 for these costs. Overall, 240 patients (64%) had benefited from home care or services in the previous 12 months, with 41% benefiting from multiple services. The services most frequently used were ambulance or medical taxis, nurse visits and domestic home care (Table ). Domestic home care, physiotherapist home visits and meal deliveries were used at least weekly, and the other services were used less frequently. The only services for which the patient paid more often than ambulance/taxi were domestic healthcare, childcare help and meal delivery (all  < 0.05 vs. ambulance/taxi). Walking aids and wheelchairs were the most frequently purchased medical equipment, and these were completely reimbursed for over half of the patients who purchased them (Fig. ). The items that incurred OOPE most often were adaptation of their home (e.g. installation of ramps or rails) or of their vehicle ( < 0.05 for both vs. walking aid). Except for medication costs, which were highest in the most disabled patients (disability grades 7–10), OOPE for patients who used the considered medical services did not vary markedly with disability (no statistical difference between disability grades 0–2 and 7–10) (Table ). The mean score for satisfaction with reimbursement was 6.7 (95% CI 6.4–7.0; median 8). The proportion of patients unsatisfied with the level of reimbursement (score 0–3) was 18.4%, and the proportion of those who were totally satisfied (score 8–10) was 51.1%. The proportion of unsatisfied patients tended to be higher in those without any complementary health insurance (27%) than in those benefiting from ALD status (18%; NS) or with voluntary complementary insurance (19%; NS) and higher in those with a high level of disability (grade ≥ 7: 21%) than in those with a low level (grade ≤ 2: 10%; NS). The types of expenses that patients considered should be better reimbursed were home care (47.6% of respondents), modifications to the home (44.9%), medical equipment (such as walking aids) (25.5%), stays in specialised residential accommodation (17.0%) and consultations (16.0%). When asked to estimate the level of their OOPE by month, in a specific question, patients claimed to spend on average €127 (95% CI 95–159; median 25). Overall, 73.7% of patients considered that their purchasing power had decreased since their diagnosis of MS (31.9% a little; 22.3% a lot; 19.4% a huge amount). In addition, 35.6% of patients reported that they had sometimes had to make choices between spending money on their MS care and spending on their family and social life, and 25.8% reported that they frequently had to make such choices. The objective of this study was to evaluate OOPE incurred by people with MS in relation to their disease. Patients estimated that they spent an average of €127 each month on OOPE for their MS, corresponding to around €1500 per year. This represents around 7% of the per capita disposable household mean income in France, which was €21,415 in 2015 []. For comparison, the annual direct per capita medical costs of MS to public health insurance in France have been estimated to range from €18,000 to 33,000 in 2016, depending on the extent of disability []. Around two-thirds of patients had OOPE associated with consultations and medication. In addition, patients reported that adaptations of the home environment and medical equipment were generally poorly reimbursed, although the associated OOPE have not been quantified. No clear relationship between the extent of OOPE and disability was observed. This survey was performed in a population participating in an online patient community forum dedicated to MS. We do not expect this population to be entirely representative of all patients with MS in France, and this limitation should be borne in mind when interpreting these findings. Although the age distribution of participants was comparable to that of all patients [], women were more represented than men (sex ratio female:male of 2.36 in the French MS population [] and 3.32 in the present survey), which is a characteristic of online users willing to share experiences related to their disease. In addition, participants were better educated than the general French population, with around half the participants having attended higher education, which is almost twice as high as the rate in an age-matched sample of the general population []. Participants in MS-specific online patient communities are likely to be more informed about MS and more inquisitive about sources of information. In the context of this survey, it is possible that participants are more aware of the aid to which they are entitled and thus may have lower OOPE than patients with MS in general. Surveys of such communities provide an opportunity to collect information on perceptions of healthcare provision and use from relatively large samples, which would be difficult to collect in an equivalent timeframe using more traditional methods []. The information provided by members of these online patient communities represents a new resource for identifying and understanding how health products are used and perceived in the real world, for developing new assessment tools for patient-reported outcomes and for fostering sociological research into health-related issues. In principle, patients with MS are eligible for ALD status that gives them access to full insurance coverage for healthcare consumption with no need for pecuniary outlay at the point of access to care. In France, healthcare costs do not vary according to complementary health insurance. ALD and CMU criteria were not intended to be used as variables for the comparisons. In practice, 92% of participants in this survey were indeed registered for ALD status. Most of the patients without ALD status were not taking a disease-modifying treatment for MS. The proportion of participating patients registered for ALD was higher than that observed for all patients with MS in France (83.3%) []. In spite of having ALD status, most patients reported OOPE related to hospitalisations, consultations and medication costs. Although, for most patients, the OOPE for medication corresponded to OTC medication, which, by definition, is not reimbursed by social security, a minority of patients also had OOPE for prescription medications, amounting to an average of €63 per year, which may correspond to approved medications that are not reimbursed. The OOPE for consultations are probably because specialists in France are free to set their consultancy fees above the tariffs reimbursed by the public health insurance, the difference being payable by the patient. Consultations with psychiatrists or psychologists were particularly associated with a high level of OOPE. In addition, certain paramedical professions, such as osteopaths, who are consulted by significant numbers of patients, are not reimbursed by public health insurance. The OOPE for hospitalisation was accounted for in part by personal comfort items, which are always charged to the patient, and for certain medical procedures that are not fully reimbursed. As well as specific medical expenditure, major areas that generate OOPE in MS include aid at home, professional carers or home help, costs of adaptation of the home for people with disabilities, transport from home to medical consultations and for expensive items such as powered mobility scooters or orthopaedic beds. Although the OOPE for this type of expenditure were not quantified in this survey, patients stated these were the types of expenditure they would like to see better reimbursed. Some of these services are, in principle, provided by social services rather than the healthcare system per se, and the findings suggest that communication between the two could be optimised to provide a seamless package of support for people qualifying for ALD status for MS or other chronic diseases. Our findings can be compared with those from a recent study of OOPE for MS care in Canada [], which reported that 44% of respondents had OOPE for medication costs, 22.8% for assistive devices, 19.0% for rehabilitation therapy and 7.9% for home-care services. Despite important differences in the organisation of healthcare between Canada and France, these findings are of the same order of magnitude. In contrast, in the USA, where universal public health insurance does not exist, 57% of patients with MS incur OOPE ≥ $US50 at each pharmacy delivery of medication, and 12% incur OOPE of ≥ $US250 []. This US study, as well as earlier studies reviewed elsewhere [], indicated that high OOPE for medication is associated with poor adherence. Although most patients (51%) considered the level of reimbursement for their MS care totally satisfactory, a significant minority were not satisfied at all. Regardless of the expressed satisfaction level, 74% considered that their spending power had diminished since they were diagnosed with MS, and 61% stated that they had to choose whether to spend money on MS care or on family and social life. This suggests the financial impact of OOPE for MS care is significant. In addition, 58% of respondents had either given up working or reduced their working hours because of their disease. In contrast, only 37% were receiving any form of disability allowance, and 71% of those who received the allowance considered it to be inadequate. The study has several limitations, including the potential lack of representativeness of the study population discussed earlier in this section. The information on OOPE over the previous year was obtained from the volunteer participants and may be susceptible to under-representation of patients with no OOPE, to perception or social desirability bias and to recall amnestic error []. However, the quantitative estimations were restricted to expenses (medications and consultations, medical tests and procedures and residential stays) that should have a standard recurring cost. Nevertheless, we could not verify the accuracy of the reported OOPE. This would only be possible through a dedicated micro-costing study, which would have its own inherent biases and limitations. We did not evaluate OOPE incurred during hospital visits; these are not documented because, in the French healthcare system, patients do not pay for these consultations or medicines. We also made no attempt to quantify OOPE related to home care, services and adaptation, even though these were the principal types of expense with which patients were dissatisfied. It would be important to attempt to measure these OOPE in a future study to appreciate the extent of the problem. There may also have been some misunderstanding relating to wording. The results of this survey indicate that, in spite of being eligible for full coverage of healthcare resource consumption, patients with MS in France still have significant OOPE related to direct medical care and also incur OOPE related to home care and services, which are necessary but not covered by health insurance. These OOPE affect the ability of patients to make free choices as to how to spend their money. Closer coordination between public health insurance and social services is needed to ensure that patients with MS receive the aid to which they are entitled and are exposed to the lowest possible financial burden from their disease.

07e35881-096e-47ee-aa85-2287e5d4bdbf,"Healthline Steps Up, Raises Thousands for Multiple Sclerosis Research — Healthline employees raised money and produced inspirational videos of participants at the Walk MS event in San Francisco. Healthline employees hit the streets of San Francisco this past weekend to raise money for research and treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS). was one of more than 70 squads that participated under blue skies in along the Embarcadero in San Francisco on Sunday. More than 30 Healthline employees, as well as some of their family and friends, walked the 3-mile course along the city’s waterfront from Justin Herman Plaza to Pier 39 and back. Mark Melnyk, a company recruiter and organizer of the team, said Healthline’s group was the second largest team at the walk. It was also the largest team the company has fielded for this event. Through individual donations and matching company funds, the team raised more than $5,000, surpassing last year’s total. “Healthline is a proud supporter of the annual Walk MS in San Francisco,” said Dean Stephens, CEO of Healthline. “This year’s involvement far exceeded last year in terms of both Healthline employee participation and funds raised. The MS community, in our view, is deeply committed to helping each other and finding a cure.” Overall, Walk MS in San Francisco raised $253,000 for the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, well above its goal of $195,000. Team Healthline also filmed two dozen videos at their booth in Justin Herman Plaza as part of their “” campaign to support those newly diagnosed with MS. The video segments featured people who participated in the walk to honor family and friends who have been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. These participants included an 18-year-old San Francisco State University student who walked on behalf of her 60-year-old father who has MS. She was joined by three sorority sisters. There was also a middle-aged man who walked Sunday in memory of his aunt and her boyfriend, both of whom died in recent years from multiple sclerosis complications. He was joined by a friend who was diagnosed with MS five years ago. Four pre-med students from California State University, East Bay in Hayward also made the trek. They weren’t walking for anybody in particular, but instead joined the fundraiser because they’re studying medicine.

One was a 25-year-old woman who was diagnosed two years ago. She said her treatments have eliminated the blurry vision and dizziness she suffered when she first developed the disease. Another was a woman who was diagnosed with MS 20 years ago. Five years ago, she began using a wheelchair to get around. She was surrounded by a half-dozen family members who formed a team in her honor to raise money for MS research.

aa6439fb-43d6-41b3-89dd-3e37342b2613,"Published: April 03, 2010. Updated: April 03, 2010 Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating disease, a non-contagious chronic autoimmune disorder of the central nervous system which can present with a variety of neurological symptoms occurring in attacks or slowly progressing over time. The prevalence of multiple sclerosis (MS) is approximately 350,000 cases in the United States and more than 2.5 million worldwide. There are at least 10,000 newly diagnosed cases of MS annually. In northern Europe, continental North America, and Australasia, about one of every 1000 citizens suffers from multiple sclerosis, whereas in the Arabian peninsula, Asia, and continental South America, the frequency is much lower. In Sub-Saharan Africa, MS is extremely rare. With important exceptions, there is a North-South gradient in the Northern hemisphere and a South-North gradient in the Southern hemisphere, with very low frequencies near the equator (between latitudes 40 degrees North and 40 degrees South. Climate, diet, geomagnetism, toxins, sunlight, genetic factors, and infectious diseases have been discussed as possible reasons for these regional differences. It has been postulated that an environmental factor during childhood might play an important role for the development of MS later in life. This was based on several studies in migrants demonstrating that if migration occurs before the age of 15, the migrant acquires his new region’s susceptibility to MS. If migration takes place after 15, the migrant keeps the susceptibility of his home country. MS occurs mainly in the Caucasian race. It is 20-fold lower in the Inuits of Canada than in other Canadians living in the same region. It is also rare in the Native American tribes of North America, the Australian Aborigine and the Maoris of New Zealand. These few examples point out that the genetic background plays an important role in the development of MS (see below). As observed in many autoimmune disorders, MS is more common in females than males; the mean sex ratio is about two females for every male. In children, who rarely develop MS, the sex ratio may reach three females for each male, whereas MS occurring in the fifth decade more commonly affects males. Onset of symptoms usually occurs between 20 to 40 years of age, rarely below 15 or above 60, although both is possible. MS is not strictly a hereditary disease. However, MS is a disease influenced by a variety of factors, one of which is the genetic background of an individual. There is no single gene known to be responsible for MS, though a few genes have been demonstrated to increase the risk of development. Although these genes are of scientific interest and continue to play a part in research, they are not enough to diagnose an individual with MS. Overall, an average one of every 25 siblings of an individual with MS will also be afflicted. Up to every second identical twin of a MS-affected person will develop MS, but only one of 20 fraternal twins. If one parent is affected by MS, only about 1 of 40 of his children will develop MS later in life. There also seems to be an association with specific HLA antigens (HLA-DR2). The ultimate cause of MS is unknown. It is hypothesised that a viral infection or other environmental factor in childhood might prime the immune system for an abnormal reaction later in life. On a molecular level, there might be a structural similarity between an unidentified infectious agent and components of the central nervous system, causing confusion in the immune system later in life (a process called “molecular mimicry”). However, so far there is no known “MS virus”. Certainly MS is not an infectious disease and not contagious. The importance of genetic factors has been discussed above. It is widely accepted that a special subset of white blood cells, called T cells, play a key role in the development of MS. Under normal circumstances, these lymphocytes can distinguish between self and non-self. In a person with MS, however, these cells recognize healthy parts of the central nervous system as foreign, and attack them as they would a virus. In MS, the part of the nervous system primarily attacked is myelin. Myelin is a fatty substance that covers the axons of nerve cells, and which is important for proper nerve conduction. Normally, there is a tight barrier between blood and brain, called the blood-brain barrier (BBB), built up of endothelial cells lining the blood vessel walls. Lymphocytes (blue) surrounding blood vessel (center) within MS lesionIn MS, the BBB breaks down; autoreactive T cells cross the BBB and trigger an inflammatory process, also mediated by other immune cells, such as cytokines and antibodies. Due to this abnormal behavior of the immune system, MS is considered to be an autoimmune disorder. The inflammatory process finally leads to a destruction of myelin called demyelination. Repair processes, called remyelination, also play an important role. This is one of the reasons why, especially in early phases of the disease, symptoms tend to decrease or disappear temporarily after days to months. Nevertheless, axonal damage and irreversible loss of neurons occur early during the course of the disease. However, due to its plasticity the brain can often compensate for some portion of the damage. MS symptoms develop as a result of multiple lesions in the brain and spinal cord, and can vary greatly between different individuals, depending on where the lesions occur. In general, relapses tend to occur more frequently during spring and summer than during autumn and winter. Infections like the common cold, influenza or unspecific diarrhea increase the risk for a relapse. In contrast, influenza vaccination is safe and does not trigger relapses as demonstrated in several recent studies. It can therefore be recommended for MS patients, especially for those at risk for influenza (e.g. healthcare workers). Tetanus vaccination is considered to be safe as well, although so far it has not been studied in that respect. In general, vaccinations with living, attenuated viruses increase the risk of relapses. Pregnancy can directly effect the susceptibility for relapse. The last three months of pregnancy offers a natural protection against relapses, whereas during the first few months after pregnancy, especially during the first six weeks, the risk for a relapse is increased 20-40%. According to current knowledge, pregnancy doesn’t seem to influence long term disability. MS does not increase the risk of bearing a handicapped child. Statistically, there is no good evidence for triggering of relapses through trauma or operations. In principle, surgical procedures require no special precautions if not dictated by existing disability. Participation in sports is possible, although extremes, such as marathon running, should probably be avoided. Emotional stress may cause a relapse, although study data has been inconsistent. Heat can transiently increase symptoms, in something known as Uhthoff’s phenomenon. This is why some patients avoid saunas or even hot showers. However, heat is not an established trigger of relapses. Extensive exposure to the sun should be avoided, since ultraviolet radiation is a strong stimulus for the immune system. Currently there are no clinically established laboratory investigations available to predict prognosis or therapeutic response, although promising approaches have been undertaken that need further confirmation, such as treatments based on the two antibodies anti-MOG and anti-MBP, and TRAIL, a TNF-Related Apoptosis Inducing Ligand. In most cases MS starts with an acute flare-up of symptoms within hours to days, called a relapse, exacerbation, bout, episode, or attack. Inflammation of an optic nerve (optic neuritis), causing painfulness of eye movement and visual deterioration frequently is the first symptom. However, not all patients with optic neuritis develop MS. Sensory disturbances such as numbness or tingling sensations are other frequent initial symptoms. In principle, MS can start with any of the symptoms mentioned in the section above. Especially in early phases of the disease, symptoms frequently decrease or resolve spontaneously within days to months. Therefore, this disease course is called relapsing remitting. New relapses can occur within weeks to many years and can include formerly experienced and/or new symptoms. However, MRI studies have shown that nerve damage can continue in relapsing remitting patients even if symptoms subside. It has long been known that “MS never sleeps”. This highlights the importance of preventive treatment if and when it is available. In many cases, the disease course changes after several years and symptoms start to deteriorate slowly with or without superimposed relapses. This course is called secondary chronic-progressive, or just secondary progressive. However, some patients stay in a relapsing remitting course for the rest of their lives. About 10% of all MS-affected individuals experience chronic progression without relapses from onset of symptoms. This course is called primary progressive and frequently comes along with weakness of the legs, gait and bladder disturbances. Degenerative processes and not inflammation are thought to play the most important role in this clinical disease course. Chronic progression from onset of symptoms with superimposed relapses is referred to as relapsing progressive. MS is suspected in a female, between 15 and 60 years old and usually of Northern European, Northern US or Canadian descent. Affected individuals may experience a wide variety of symptoms, such as vision loss, double vision, nystagmus, difficulty with speech, various kinds of tremor, clumsiness of the hands, unsteady gait, weakness, spasticity, numbness, and bladder (urgency, hesitancy), bowel, as well as sexual dysfunction. Various cognitive impairments are also common, such as difficulty performing multiple tasks at once, difficulty following detailed instructions, loss of short term memory, depression, and fatigue. Symptoms and signs may partially disappear after a few days or weeks. MS plaques appear hyperintense on T2 weighted studies. They usually are oval in shape, and appear in the periventricular region or corpus callosum. Detection of gadolinium enhancement can help differentiate active from chronic lesions and could help in establishing the temporal dissemination of the disease on follow up. A lumbar puncture, which is a procedure done to collect a sample of cerebrospinal fluid, is useful for providing evidence of chronic inflammation of the central nervous system, often indicated by oligoclonal banding. Nerve conduction studies of optic, sensory and motor nerves can provide further evidence for MS, as the process of demyelination results in reduced nerve conduction velocities. The diagnostic process is completed by several laboratory tests to exclude other diseases that can mimic MS, such as Sarcoidosis, Vasculitis, and Lyme disease). A definite diagnosis of MS requires evidence for dissemination of lesions within the central nervous system both in space and in time. This means that not only must there exist evidence of at least two distinct lesions, verifiable by clinical symptoms or by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), there must also be evidence of an occurrence of new symptoms or lesions within a time interval of at least 30 days. Diagnosis of multiple sclerosis is made using the 2005 revised McDonald diagnostic criteria [1]: Generally speaking, three parameters are used to assess the diagnosis. An attack refers to an episode of neurological disturbance that has lasted for at least 24 hours. This is usually a subjective report by the patient and should be backed by objective findings. A clinical lesion refers to a neurological lesion detected by history and physical examination. A paraclinical lesion refers to a lesion that is detected by MRI, evoked response testing or urodynamic studies. In addition to the assessment of the three parameters discussed above, the criteria require that evidence for dissemination of lesions in both space (spatial dissemination) and time (temporal dissemination). 2005 revised McDonald Diagnostic Criteria for Multiple Sclerosis Two attacks (temporal dissemination) + two clinical lesions (spatial dissemination) Two attacks (temporal dissemination) + one clinical lesion + one paraclinical lesion (spatial dissemination). One attack + one clinical lesion + evidence of spatial dissemination by MRI, CSF + evidence of temporal dissemination by MRI or evidence of second clinical attack. One year of disease progression + two of the following There is no known definitive cure for multiple sclerosis. However, several drugs have proven to be effective in its treatment. Intensive research is underway to study a variety of promising new drugs. Treatment is aimed at maintaining a maximum quality of life. Physiotherapy plays an important role. There are three primary forms of medication used to treat the symptoms: During an exacerbation, corticosteroids (such as prednisone or methylprednisolone) used at high dosages (500 mg - 2 g per day intravenously for a course of 3 to 5 days) can accelerate regression of symptoms. Subsequent tapering with pills may be reasonable in certain cases. There is clear evidence that sole treatment with oral steroids at dosages of 100 mg per day or less and subsequent tapering is inferior to intravenous high dose treatment. In principle, steroid treatment during pregnancy is possible. There is no good evidence that corticosteroids influence longterm outcome. Long-term treatment can influence the course of the disease: Interferon-beta1a or beta1b (Avonex; Betaseron [in Europe Betaferon]; Rebif) has been shown to reduce the relapse rate by about 30%, decrease the number of new MRI lesions and slow progression of disability. Interferon-beta is a cytokine that under natural conditions is produced by the body during viral infections; as a drug it is extracted either from special mammalian cells or special bacteria. All preparations must be injected into either muscle or skin every second day to once per week, depending on the preparation. Attempts to develop pills containing Interferon-beta have not been successful so far. Some of the interferons have been proven to be effective not only in relapsing remitting MS, but also in secondary progressive MS, as long as superimposed relapses occur. Main side effects include flu-like symptoms which tend to decrease during ongoing therapy and which can be alleviated, for example, by paracetamol or ibuprofen. Another frequent side effect is inflammatory skin reactions at the injection site if Intereferon-beta is injected into the skin. Regular blood monitoring is required. Glatiramer acetate (Copaxone) has also been shown to reduce the relapse rate by about 30%, decrease the number of new MRI lesions and slow progression of disability. Concerning its therapeutic effect it is approximately comparable to Interferon-beta. Glatiramer acetate consists of synthetic peptides made of four different amino acids, which are basic modules of all proteins in the human body. Once per day must be injected into the skin. Attempts to develop pills containing glatiramer acetate have also been unsuccessful. Copaxone is effective in the treatment of relapsing remitting MS. So far, beneficial effects in secondary progressive MS have not been convincingly demonstrated. Main side effects include inflammatory skin reactions at the injection site, and a rare but transient and perturbing “post-injection” reaction manifested by flushing, chest tightness, heart palpitations, breathlessness, and anxiety. A post-injection reaction does not require discontinuation of therapy. In general, Copaxone is considered to cause fewer side effects than Interferon-beta. However, most MS patients injecting Interferon-beta also tolerate their therapy well. Regular blood monitoring is required. Azathioprine is an agent available as a pill approved for the treatment of relapsing remitting MS in some countries. However, its effectiveness has not been proven as stringently as for the interferons and glatiramer acetate, and an effect in secondary progressive MS has not been demonstrated. In general, it is well tolerated. After longtime therapy the risk of cancer increases slightly (after 10 years of therapy about fourfold). Regular blood monitoring is required. There is some evidence that immunoglobulins (antibodies) are effective in the treatment of relapsing remitting MS, a large clinical trial (PRIVIG) is presently continuing. Immunoglobulins have not been proven to be effective in secondary progressive MS. The currently most effective drug in the preventive treatment of MS is Mitoxantrone. It has been proven to be effective in relapsing remitting and in secondary progressive MS. In most cases it is administered every three months intravenously. Therapy with Mitoxantrone is generally well tolerated, however, since with ongoing therapy the risk for damage of the heart muscle increases, at an average Mitoxantrone can only be administered for 3 to 4 years. This is why Mitoxantrone is only used in cases of rapid disease progression. Mitoxantrone treatment requires monitoring of the heart function during therapy. Regular blood monitoring is required. With these precautions Mitoxantrone treatment is safe. A family of cholesterol-lowering drugs, the statins, have shown anti-inflammatory effects in animal models of MS. However, so far there has not been provided sufficient evidence that statins are beneficial in the treatment of human MS patients with normal cholesterol levels. Recently, scientists found women who took vitamin D supplements were 40% less likely to develop multiple sclerosis than women who did not take supplements. However, this study does not allow to conclude that vitamin D has a beneficial influence on ongoing MS. Furthermore it could not distinguish between a beneficial effect of vitamin D and multivitamin drugs including vitamin E and various B vitamins which may also exert a protective effect. Primary progressive MS is very difficult to treat. High dose corticosteroids every three months can show some effect. In principle, there is no efficient preventive treatment for primary progressive MS available. Symptomatic therapy as described in the next paragraph and physiotherapy play an important role. A variety of medications are used to treat symptoms without influencing the inflammatory nature of the disease (symptomatic treatment): Baclofen and tizanidine can be useful against spasticity. There is no convincing evidence that cannabinoids (marijuana) can improve spasticity. The anticonvulsant drugs Gabapentin and Carbamazepine and the antidepressant amitriptyline can improve pain and tingling sensations in certain cases. SSRIs be used for depression, as well as for fatigue. Fatigue can also be influenced by amantadine and modafinil. There is also treatment for bladder disturbances available which is effective in many cases. Examples are oxybutynin and trospium chloride. Treatment with sildenafil (Viagra) or similar substances can improve male erectile dysfunction in many cases. Additional treatment options include plasmapheresis (“washing the blood”, showing similarities to dialysis) for severe, non-steroidresponsive relapses. Because of improved treatment for complications such as lung and bladder infections, the life expectancy of those diagnosed with MS is only slightly reduced. The earlier in life disease onset occurs, the slower disability progresses. This is due to more frequent chronic progressive courses with faster accumulation of disability when onset occurs at a higher age. Disability after 5 years correlates well with disability after 15 years: 2/3 of MS patients with low disability after 5 years will not markedly deteriorate during the next ten years. Further MS cases in the family do not influence disease progression. 1 of 3 patients will still be able to work after 15-20 years. Visual loss as the initial symptom is a marker for a rather good prognosis; gait disturbance, weakness or numbness for a rather poor prognosis. Rapid regression of initial symptoms, age at onset below 35, only a single symptom at onset, rapid development of initial symptoms and short duration of the last relapse indicate a good prognosis. When the initial disease course is relapsing remitting, the statistical duration until a wheelchair is needed, is 20 years. This means that many MS patients will never need a wheelchair. If the disease course is primary progressive then a wheelchair at an average will be needed after 6 to 7 years. It has to be noted that most of this longterm data was acquired before the advent of modern immunomodulatory drugs about 10 years ago, which have been shown to delay disease progression over a period of several years.

Multiple Sclerosis is a condition that affects the central nervous system. It involves an abnormal response of the body’s own immune system. MS gradually destroys the myelin, which is the protective covering of the nerve fibers. Progressive nerve damage can then lead to permanent damage. The course of MS and the symptoms vary from person to person. MS is one of the most common neurological disorders. There are approximately 2.3 million people with MS worldwide. The cause of MS is unknown and there is no cure.

Med. 2000;343:938–952 [3] National Multiple Sclerosis Society,https://www.nationalmssociety.org/What-is-MS/MS-FAQ-s Clinically Isolated Syndrome (CIS) is the first episode of neurological symptoms experienced by a person, lasting at least 24 hours. The person may experience a single sign or symptom, or more than one at the same time. Not everyone who experiences CIS goes on to develop MS, but CIS can be an indicator for it. Relapsing-Remitting MS (RRMS) is the most common form of MS, with 85% of people with MS being initially diagnosed with RRMS. People experience attacks or exacerbations of symptoms (‘relapses’), which then fade or disappear (‘remission’). Relapses can last for varying periods – from a few days up to months – and then the disease may then be inactive for months or years. Secondary-Progressive MS (SPMS) is a secondary phase of RRMS that may develop years or even decades but most people who have RRMS will transition to SPMS. In SPMS there is progressive worsening of symptoms over time with no definite periods of remission. SPMS can also be categorized by whether it is active or not active (someone who has active MS experiences relapses and/or evidence of new MRI activity). Primary-Progressive MS (PPMS) is not very common and is characterized by steadily worsening symptoms and disability from the start, rather than sudden attacks or relapses followed by recovery.

51fcecbd-d232-4861-9956-e7a5975770a1,"Investigational Agent Slows Brain Shrinkage in Progressive MS Recognizing the Frequency – and Addressing the Impact – of Swallowing Problems in MS How Impact on Quality of Life Differs by Type of MS More Sun Early in Life May Mean Lower MS Risk Later in Life Research into the causes, diagnosis, impact, and management of multiple sclerosis (MS) continues to move forward on a broad front and at a rapid pace. While many advances are announced at medical meetings, such as the annual gatherings of the American Academy of Neurology (AAN), American Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ACTRIMS), Consortium of Multiple Sclerosis Centers (CMSC), and European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS), other findings are reported in medical journals throughout the year. Below, we highlight several noteworthy studies published in recent months. Investigational Agent Slows Brain Shrinkage in Progressive MS People with progressive MS who took the investigational agent ibudilast for 96 weeks had roughly one-half the amount of brain atrophy (the shrinking or reduction in brain volume) than the amount experienced by their counterparts who were given a placebo. These results are according to a study published in August in . [Fox 2018] The study enrolled 255 individuals with progressive MS. A total of 129 study participants received an oral dose of up to 100 mg of ibudilast daily. The other 126 participants received placebo. A slight majority of individuals in both groups had primary-progressive MS (PPMS), while the remainder had secondary-progressive MS (SPMS). The main adverse events seen in the ibudilast group were gastrointestinal symptoms, headache, and depression. These occurred more often in people receiving the drug than in those receiving placebo. This Phase II trial was conducted at 28 sites, and was sponsored by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, among others. Ibudilast is an oral anti-inflammatory and potentially neuroprotective agent being developed by MediciNova. The company is also exploring the potential role of ibudilast in treating amyotrophic lateral sclerosis – also known as ALS, or Lou Gehrig’s disease – and other conditions. With limited treatment options for progressive forms of MS, this Phase II study is extremely interesting and promising. Hopefully it sets the stage for a Phase III trial examining the impact of ibudilast on MS symptoms and outcomes. Gilenya (fingolimod) reduced the annualized relapse rate in children and adolescents with MS relative to these individuals’ earlier relapse rates. This reduced relapse rate is also relative to other pediatric patients treated with interferon beta-1a (Avonex). [Chitnis 2018] This reduction in the annualized relapse rate was the main finding from the PARADIGMS study, the first global, completed, controlled, randomized study specifically designed for children aged 10 to 17 years with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. While the study was published in in August 2018, results from the trial prompted the FDA to approve Gilenya in May 2018 as the first MS treatment for pediatric patients. Gilenya was approved for use in adults with relapsing MS in 2010. A total of 215 children and adolescents participated in the PARADIGMS trial, with 107 randomized to receive Gilenya and 108 to receive interferon beta-1a. Participants in the Gilenya group received 0.5 mg of the oral agent per day (or 0.25 mg per day for those weighing 40 kg – roughly 88 pounds – or less). Participants in the comparison group received an intramuscular injection of 30 ug of interferon beta-1a per week. Both treatments were given for up to two years. The mean average age of the participants was 15.3 years, and these individuals had experienced a mean average of 2.4 relapses in the preceding two years – or more than one relapse per year. The adjusted annualized relapse rate in the Gilenya group was 0.12 versus a 0.67 rate in the interferon beta-1a group. This absolute difference of 0.55 relapses was statistically significant. Compared to their peers receiving interferon beta-1a, children and adolescents receiving Gilenya also had roughly one-half as many new or newly enlarged central nervous system (CNS) lesions identified on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A total of 89 percent of participants receiving Gilenya and 95 percent of those receiving interferon beta-1a experienced adverse events, with 16.8 percent of those taking Gilenya and 6.5 percent of those taking interferon beta-1a having serious adverse events. In the Gilenya group, serious events included convulsions in six participants, infection in four, and a reduction in white blood cell count in two. In the interferon beta-1a group, two individuals had infection and one experienced an abnormal heart rate. The availability of a treatment shown to reduce relapses in children and adolescents represents a major milestone in pediatric MS. As the PARADIGMS study’s lead author Tanuja Chitnis, MD, and her colleagues noted, the reduction in relapses, lessened accumulation of new or enlarging CNS lesions, and higher rate of serious adverse events seen with Gilenya (relative to interferon beta-1a), underscore the need for longer studies to determine the durability and safety of Gilenya in pediatric patients. Meanwhile, however, clinicians and their young patients finally have an FDA-approved treatment option. A study was designed to determine the effectiveness of group, cognitive rehabilitation (CR) therapy in women with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). The study found that these women performed better on memory assessments than their counterparts who did not participate in such sessions. [Mani 2018] Researchers assigned 17 women with RRMS and evidence of impaired cognitive function to participate in eight, two-hour sessions of cognitive rehabilitation (CR) over a four-week period. Those CR sessions focused on memory, attention, and executive function. A second control group of 17 women with RRMS and cognitive impairment attended a separate set of group sessions that did not involve cognitive rehabilitation. All participants underwent assessment of cognitive function before the start of the group sessions and three months after the sessions ended. At the three-month follow-up, the CR group had significantly greater improvement from baseline in visual and verbal memory than the control group. The CR group also outperformed the control group in an overall assessment of memory function. Further, women in the CR group did better on a card-sorting exercise that tests memory than did those in the control group. Attention was the only domain in which no significant difference was found between the groups. Cognitive impairment eventually affects up to two-thirds of people with MS. While this study had a small number of subjects and did not include men, it may have identified a valuable strategy for helping preserve or enhance memory function in people with RRMS.   Recognizing the Frequency – and Addressing the Impact – of Swallowing Problems in MS More than one-third of people receiving care at an Australian MS clinic reported swallowing problems when specifically asked about the issue on a questionnaire. [Alali 2018] Difficulty swallowing – known as dysphagia in medical terminology – was reported by 38 percent of the 103 adults with MS participating in this study. The nature and severity of the problems ranged from coughing and throat clearing, to choking on food and liquid. Patients also reported a reduced desire to eat, longer time required to eat, and mealtime anxiety. Researchers conducting the study noted that, if left untreated, swallowing problems eventually can lead to complications including malnutrition, dehydration, and pneumonia. They recommended that people with MS who have dysphagia see a speech pathologist as early as possible for evaluation and management to improve swallowing function. This study highlights the importance of promptly recognizing and addressing a common symptom of MS rather than minimizing its impact or deferring care. How Impact on Quality of Life Differs by Type of MS The symptoms that most affect health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in people with progressive MS differ significantly from those affecting people with relapsing forms of the condition. [Barin 2018] This difference between symptoms was the main finding from a study of 855 people participating in the Swiss Multiple Sclerosis Registry. Researchers used two scales with ranges from 0 to 100 to measure the impact of various symptoms in 611 people with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) and 244 people with progressive MS (PMS). They found that in individuals with RRMS, gait and balance problems were the symptoms that had the most impact. By contrast, people with progressive MS cited spasticity and paralysis as the issues that most detracted from their health-related quality of life. Fatigue, depression, dizziness, and spasticity also were frequently cited issues for people with RRMS, while the PMS group identified pain as another symptom adversely affecting their quality of life. While the findings are not surprising, given the different courses of relapsing-remitting and progressive MS, they reinforce the importance of understanding how several factors – including MS type – contribute to the disease burden that patients experience. They also underscore the need for people to talk with their clinicians, not only about the presence of various symptoms, but also about the extent to which each symptom is affecting their quality of life.  More Sun Early in Life May Mean Lower MS Risk Later in Life Growing up in a sunny area reduces the risk of developing multiple sclerosis (MS), according to a recent study by investigators in the United States and Canada. [Tremlett 2018] The researchers matched 151 people with MS with 235 similarly aged healthy controls from the Nurses’ Health Study. The investigators classified each person as having low, medium, or high exposure to ambient ultraviolet (UV-B) light at ages 5 to15 years, 16 to 20 years, and every 10 years thereafter. The classification was based on factors including the latitude, altitude, and cloud cover where a person lived. Researchers also documented hours per week of sun exposure in summer and winter. A total of 98 percent of the study subjects were Caucasian, and the mean average age of MS onset in the 151 people with MS was 39.5 years. The study found that people living in a high UV-B area before the mean average age of MS onset had a 45-percent lower risk of developing MS than people living in a low UV-B area. Additional analysis showed that having medium or high exposure at ages 5 to 15 cut the risk of MS by more than one-half, relative to people living in low-exposure areas. This study extends a line of inquiry into the association between Vitamin D levels and MS risk. Sunlight is a major source of Vitamin D, and research has shown that many people with MS have relatively low levels of the vitamin. Additionally, epidemiological research has shown MS to be more prevalent in northern countries, where individuals receive less year-round sun exposure than in lower latitudes. Given the very real dangers of sun-related skin cancer, this research is not a reason to engage in tanning for potential preventive purposes, but it does add to the knowledge base about risk factors for MS.

3d783504-eea5-435e-b3c9-c1be0bb7e856,"— Dysesthesia is a type of chronic pain triggered by the central nervous system (CNS). It’s commonly associated with multiple sclerosis (MS), a disease that causes damage to the CNS. Pain doesn’t always enter the discussion when talking about MS, but it’s actually a common symptom. Dysesthesia often involves sensations such as burning, electric shock, or a general tightening around the body. It generally occurs in the legs, feet, arms, and hands, but it can affect any part of the body. The types of dysesthesia include scalp, cutaneous, and occlusal. Scalp dysesthesia, also called burning scalp syndrome, involves pain, burning, stinging, or itching on or under the scalp. There is usually no rash, flaking, or other visible irritation. A suggests that scalp dysesthesia may be related to cervical spine disease. Cutaneous dysesthesia is characterized by a feeling of discomfort when your skin is touched. The symptoms, which can range from mild tingling to severe pain, may be triggered by anything from clothing to a gentle breeze. Occlusal dysesthesia (OD), also called phantom bite syndrome, is discomfort in the mouth when biting, usually with no obvious cause. Although OD was initially believed to be a psychological disorder, a suggests it could be associated with a condition in which the teeth of the lower and upper jaws aren’t aligned, resulting in an imbalanced bite. It’s easy to confuse dysesthesia with paresthesia or hyperalgesia, both of which can also occur with MS. Paresthesia describes sensory symptoms such as numbness and tingling, “skin crawling,” or that “pins and needles” feeling. It’s distracting and uncomfortable, but not generally considered painful. Hyperalgesia is increased sensitivity to painful stimuli. Dysesthesia is more severe than paresthesia and has no apparent stimuli. Dysesthesia can be intermittent or continuous. The sensations can be mild to intense and may include: The pain and strange sensations associated with dysesthesia may be due to sensory nerve damage. The incorrect signals from your nerves can cause your brain to stimulate strange sensations. For example, you may have painful sensations in your leg even though there’s nothing wrong with your leg. It’s a communication problem between your brain and the nerves in your leg, which stimulates a pain response. And the pain is very real. When you have burning or itching, you might usually reach for topical treatments. But because there’s no real issue with your skin or scalp, that won’t help with dysesthesia. Treatment is different for everybody. It may take some trial and error to find the best solution for you. Over-the-counter pain relievers such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) and ibuprofen (Motrin) usually aren’t effective for treating neuropathic pain like dysesthesia, according to the . Neither are narcotics or opioids. Dysesthesia is usually treated with the following medications: antiseizure agents, such as gabapentin (Neurontin), pregabalin (Lyrica), carbamazepine (Tegretol), and phenytoin (Dilantin), to calm the nerves certain antidepressants, such as amitriptyline (Elavil), nortriptyline (Pamelor), and desipramine (Norpramin), to change your body’s response to pain topical pain-relief creams that contain lidocaine or capsaicin the opioid tramadol (Ultram, ConZip, Ryzolt), rarely prescribed and usually only for people experiencing severe pain the antihistamine hydroxyzine (Atarax), for people with MS, to relieve itching and burning sensations Your doctor will start you out on the lowest possible dose and adjust upward if needed. Before starting on a new medication, ask your doctor about all the potential short- and long-term side effects. To avoid dangerous drug interactions, tell your doctor about all the medications you take. Even if it’s due to dysesthesia, scratching at your skin or scalp may break the skin. To heal the area and avoid infection, you may indeed need a topical treatment. of people with MS experience pain as a significant symptom. About people with MS who report continuous pain describe it as a burning pain that mostly affects their legs and feet. MS causes the formation of scar tissue, or lesions, in the brain and spine. These lesions interfere with signals between the brain and the rest of the body. One common type of dysesthesia experienced by people with MS is the , so called because it feels like you’re being squeezed around your chest. It can be described as a crushing or vice-like grip causing pain and tightness in your chest and ribs. Here are some other reasons a person with MS might have strange sensations or pain: injection site reaction or side effects of medication, including disease-modifying drugs Of course, your symptoms could be completely unrelated to MS. They could be due to injury or another underlying condition. Like other symptoms of MS, dysesthesia can come and go. It can also completely disappear without treatment. Also like many other symptoms of MS, when you and your doctor find the right treatment, you’ll experience dysesthesia less frequently. Dysesthesia isn’t unique to MS. Among the other conditions that affect the nervous system and may cause dysesthesia are: diabetes, due to nerve damage caused by chronic high glucose levels Guillain-Barré syndrome, a rare neurological condition in which the immune system attacks and damages part of the peripheral nervous system Lyme disease, which can cause neurologic MS-like symptoms, including itching and burning sensations HIV, due to resulting peripheral sensory and motor nerve disorders shingles, when tingling and pain occur near lesions There is that natural treatment approaches to chronic pain, such as acupuncture, hypnosis, and massage, may be beneficial. The following natural remedies may help relieve the chronic pain associated with dysesthesia: applying a warm or cold compress to the affected area taking a bath before bedtime with Epsom salts and colloidal oats using certain herbs, such as (sweet flag), (saffron), and Persistent dysesthesia can interfere with your life in a number of ways, such as: skin or scalp irritation or infection due to scratching or rubbing If your dysesthesia symptoms are interfering with your life, you should see your primary care physician or a neurologist. Other causes for your pain should be examined and ruled out. Dysesthesia doesn’t always require treatment. But if you seek help, there are a variety of options to manage it and improve your overall quality of life. — 5 Natural Remedies for MS Nerve Pain in the Legs and Feet Everything You Should Know About Diabetic Neuropathy Promising Treatments and Clinical Trials for Relapsing-Remitting MS 5 Natural Remedies for MS Nerve Pain in the Legs and Feet Medically reviewed by Although pain and MS unfortunately go hand in hand, the right treatments can help you find relief.

Latent-period stool proteomic assay of multiple sclerosis model indicates protective capacity of host-expressed protease inhibitors Latent-period stool proteomic assay of multiple sclerosis model indicates protective capacity of host-expressed protease inhibitors     , Article number:  () Diseases are often diagnosed once overt symptoms arise, ignoring the prior latent period when effective prevention may be possible. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model for multiple sclerosis, exhibits such disease latency, but the molecular processes underlying this asymptomatic period remain poorly characterized. Gut microbes also influence EAE severity, yet their impact on the latent period remains unknown. Here, we show the latent period between immunization and EAE’s overt symptom onset is characterized by distinct host responses as measured by stool proteomics. In particular, we found a transient increase in protease inhibitors that inversely correlated with disease severity. Vancomycin administration attenuated both EAE symptoms and protease inhibitor induction potentially by decreasing immune system reactivity, supporting a subset of the microbiota’s role in modulating the host’s latent period response. These results strengthen previous evidence of proteases and their inhibitors in EAE and highlight the utility stool-omics for revealing complex, dynamic biology. Both chronic and acute diseases are classically characterized by overt symptoms and their related molecular signatures. However, if these symptoms manifest gradually over time, diagnoses could be delayed and the window for effective therapeutic treatment may be missed. Thus, the latent period – the time period prior to overt symptom onset – represents an important period of disease progression. Indeed, focused characterization of a disease’s latent period can reveal biomarkers foretelling subsequent disease trajectory and severity, as well as highlight pathways for therapeutic targeting. However, the latent period’s biological significance and therapeutic potential is often hampered by an incomplete understanding of temporally significant events within this time frame. For instance, the peripheral limb weakness, decreased mental acuity, reduced bowel control, and other overt symptoms which characterize relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) flares are the consequences of autoimmune activity against myelin proteins in the central nervous system. However, events that promote the disease’s asymptomatic periods or trigger eventual relapses remain poorly understood. A commonly used mouse model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), also exhibits a latent period prior to disease manifestation. In the case of the mouse (C57BL/6J) EAE model, this period is characteristically 10–12 days, thus enabling focused study of this period. While EAE’s latent period timeframe is well-known, the biological underpinnings of how it sets up the classical disease state are far less understood. One factor that has come to be associated with MS and EAE in the past decade is the gut microbiome. Indeed, previous research has shown MS patients harbor altered gut microbial communities compared to healthy controls. In line with this evidence, EAE induction can be heavily influenced by the presence of specific microbial community members, although the host-microbiome interactions that lead to these results are not entirely delineated. Due to the gut’s proximity to microbes and its high degree of innate and adaptive immune activity, dynamically monitoring gut physiological activity prior to the manifestation of EAE stands to provide critical insights into EAE’s latent period. Stool is particularly useful due to its non-invasive collection and compatibility with large, longitudinal multi-omic studies that leverage the presence of host and microbe proteins, intact microbes, and metabolites. Furthermore, because many proteins have well-characterized functional roles in host immunity, measuring systems-level proteomic changes in latent period EAE makes stool ideal for bridging our understanding of how microbes and the host immunity interact during EAE. We designed the present study, the first report to focus on latent EAE using proteomics, to characterize changes in gut microbiota and extracellular gut proteomes during this understudied time period. We leveraged temporal 16S rRNA microbial sequencing and shotgun proteomics of mouse stool in order to measure the intricate interplay of host response, microbes, and disease. We found that microbes and extracellular proteins measured from stool were able to distinguish pre-symptomatic phases of EAE from non-diseased states to varying extents. Latent period 16S rRNA microbiome measurements did not reveal large-scale consistent patterns over time, however several genera exhibited modest changes in abundance. Shotgun proteomics revealed at least two unique latent period signatures associated with immune system suppression and subsequent inflammation. Among the protein classes driving these signatures were host-expressed protease inhibitors, which exhibited a pronounced post-immunization increase. Surprisingly, protease inhibitor levels inversely corresponded with eventual EAE symptom severity. Additionally, this work pointed to correlations between specific protease inhibitors and microbes prior to the onset of disease, providing a basis for further mechanistic studies focused on the interplay between immune regulation and microbiome composition. Lastly, we found that depleting a subset of microbes with the antibiotic vancomycin prior to immunization broadly attenuated the increased protease inhibitor levels, suggesting microbes sensitive to this antibiotic were responsible for immune system priming prior to immunization. Latent period microbe community structures do not obviously reflect immunization or EAE symptoms We induced EAE in C57BL/57BL/6J mice (n = 8) with a standard myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG 35–55) adjuvant immunization (Complete Freund’s Adjuvant/Pertussis toxin; CFA/PTX). Mice demonstrated classic symptoms of paralysis and altered balance ten days later, consistent with previous studies (Fig. ). Also consistent with prior studies, these symptoms occurred over a range of severity and varied in their onset timing (Fig. , see Supplementary Table  for EAE metrics). We collected fecal specimens from these mice over five time points spanning pre- and post-immunization states prior to disease onset (Fig. ). Using these specimens, we first assessed latent period microbial composition changes using 16S rRNA sequencing. After quality filtering (see methods), we observed 2,781 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) from all mice and time points, 91 of which were included at the L6 taxonomic level of the QIIME software output. These 91 OTUs were subsequently used for our subsequent analysis. Alpha-diversity metrics (within-ecosystem diversity) including Shannon’s diversity index and species richness exhibited no obvious trends over time, although there was significant variability (p < 0.05) with respect to day post immunization (DPI) -14 relative to other days (Fig. ). Weighted UniFrac distances (beta-diversity) comparing DPI -14 to later time points also reflected this trend in temporal variation (Fig. ). The 16 most abundant microbial taxa, which accounted for approximately 98% of 16S reads, further reflected temporal variation at all time points with respect to DPI -14. For example, we observed an increased in the overall proportion of the family S-24-7 OTUs from 30% on DPI -14 to 66% on DPI -13, and a decrease in the overall proportion of the order Clostridiales-assigned OTUs (12% on DPI -13 to 32% on DPI -14) (Fig. ). Taken together, the fairly even variance we observed in the microbiota overall and particularly on DPI -13 through DPI 7 reflect previously described temporal microbial variance in untreated laboratory mouse strains, while DPI -14 is likely reflective of their acclimation period. To preliminarily explore immunization-dependent microbial trends, we considered OTUs which significantly (p < 0.05 ANOVA) and substantially (fold-change > 1.5) between pre- and post-immunization time points, and were represented in >20% of all sampled time points (See Supplementary Table  for a list of OTU and their normalized abundance). These criteria yielded nine OTUs, 8/9 (89%) from the phylum Firmicutes. These OTUs exhibited an average fold-change of 2.6. A principle component analysis (PCA) of these data suggested pre- and post-immunization states was partially distinguished by these OTUs (Fig. ). Despite the slight alterations we observed in global microbial community structure during latent period EAE induction, individual taxa could have more relevance to eventual EAE severity. Two taxa were significantly associated with EAE severity scores (p > 0.05, Spearman). The genus exhibited an inverse correlation with EAE severity on DPI 3 (p = 0.049, r = −0.81, see Supplementary Table  for full OTU-EAE correlation statistics) while the family Erysipelotrichaceae was also inversely correlated with EAE (p = 0.03, r = −0.84), although neither correlation survived multiple-hypothesis correcting FDR, likely due to low replicate numbers and high number of variables (FDR = 0.12, 0.09, respectively). , a butyrate-producing Firmicute, was previously shown to be underrepresented among MS patients. Thus the increased abundance we observed in lower-scoring mice is consistent with previous findings. Previous studies also showed that germ-free (GF) mice colonized with the segmented filamentous bacteria had expanded Th17+ T-cell populations and increased EAE symptoms compared to controls. We did not find to be differentially present in mildly (cumulative EAE score 0–4) or severely (cumulative EAE score 5–14) diseased mice. (Fig. ). This suggests that while may determine disease presence in a binary fashion, its latent period abundance does not determine subsequent disease severity. Lastly, species and strains within the genus were previously shown to attenuate EAE symptoms, potentially by modulating anti-inflammatory cytokine levels and Th17+ t-cell generation, and we found genus-level abundances exhibited a sharp decrease in abundance post-immunization (Fig. ). Further characterization of this OTU using BLAST and MEGA7 alignment tools suggested the 16S rRNA reads likely originated from , , or a closely related species (SI. ). However, the related species, , exhibited a trend towards increased abundance post-immunization (Fig. ). These opposing trends echo our prior observation that aggregating OTUs at higher taxonomic levels can obscure contrasting species-level temporal patterns. Collectively, these results characterize EAE’s latent phase microbiome as having alterations in global structure typical of day-to-day variation, with changes to a small number of taxa post-immunization. These findings align with previous observations that some microbes could impact EAE and also highlight the dearth of microbe-EAE correlations. However, knowing the presence of specific microbes is insufficient to implicate specific host immune response pathways activated in EAE. To more directly assay alterations in host and microbial pathways potentially involved in the latent phase EAE response, we next interrogated the latent phase EAE metaproteome using stool specimens from the same mice. Extracellular stool proteins report immunization status In comparison to 16S rRNA sequencing, metaproteomic analysis of stool can provide both descriptive and functional information about a host’s gut and microbes states over time. Moreover, experimental methods which enrich extracellular proteins from stool can give focus to important immune and antimicrobial interactions. Accordingly, we measured changes to the extracellular fecal metaproteome of mice during the EAE latent period using mass spectrometry. Furthermore, we improved our ability to accurately and efficiently compare mice’s stool proteomes over prior investigations by incorporating a multiplexing quantitative label (tandem mass tag,TMT) into our established workflow (Fig. ). Using this experimental design, we now report 850 quantified proteins (FDR < 0.05) of host (288, 34%) and bacterial (562, 66%) origin (Supplementary Table , SI. ). Over half (511 total, 218 host, 293 microbes) of these proteins were quantified at every time point from at least one mouse stool sample, suggesting a large portion of detected proteins were stably present (SI. ). Despite comprising the majority of protein identifications, microbial protein abundances were on average 1.15 fold (log2) lower than host proteins (SI. ). Applying the same filtering criteria used to select immunization-depended microbe changes to the proteome (p < 0.05, fold-change > 1.5, measurements in >20% of samples). Considering the pre-immunization time points alone indicated proteins which might naturally vary over time regardless of perturbation. We observed 24 proteins (2.8% of total identifications) which met the criteria above, 22 of which were host derived (SI. ). Two gene ontology classes were significantly enriched (q < 0.01) among these proteins: phospholipase inhibitor activity (GO:0004859, q = 0.0002) which decreased on day post immunization (DPI) -13 compared to DPI -14, and exopeptidase activity (GO:0008238, q = 9.6e-8) increased on DPI 0 compared to DPI -13. These activities are both related to digestion, suggestive of normal dietary processes. Applying the above criteria to explore differences between pre- (DPI -14, -13, 0) and post-immunization (DPI 3, 7) time points yielded just 39 (5%) proteins (Table , SI. ). Despite this low number, post-immunization states were enriched in several gene ontology classes (Fig. ). In particular, host proteins related to antimicrobial activity and protease inhibition were most distinct between these two time periods. These included anti-microbial peptides (AMPs) such as the Regenerating islet-derived protein 3 (REG3, all three isoforms), Serum amyloid P, and Lypd8; and protease inhibitors such as SERPIN A3N, SERPIN A3M, PZP, and SERPIN C1 (Table ). We next considered potential signaling pathways enriched post-immunization. Given the general stability of the pre-immunization time points in all mice, we selected DPI -14 as the reference time point for further comparisons. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) of significantly altered protein abundances (p < 0.05) on DPI 3 compared to DPI -14 implicated the anti-inflammatory cytokine TGF-ß as a central signaling node, although the cytokine itself was not identified in the dataset (Fig. ). Protease inhibitors, as a class were a dominant feature of this protein network. Indeed, further analysis of the top 20 proteins with changed abundance on DPI 3 confirmed a dramatic depletion of protease-activity related proteins while simultaneously reporting increased protease inhibitors (q < 0.01), supporting the IPA findings (Fig. ). This evidence suggests mice upregulate a subset of acute-phase proteins related to inflammation reduction during early latent period. In contrast, IPA of the 34 proteins with significantly altered abundances on DPI 7 relative to DPI -14 pointed toward increased activity in STAT3, a pro-inflammatory transcription factor central to several intestinal disorders, or a related pathway (Fig. ). Reg3 AMPs were major contributors to the enrichment of this inflammatory network and were notably higher on DPI 7 compared to DPI 3 (SI. ). This finding is bolstered by previous research suggesting STAT3 activation was necessary for antimicrobial peptide expression. Together, these data suggest that latent period extracellular stool proteins reflect at least two host-response components that are highly targeted and coincide with latent period EAE: an anti-inflammatory phase marked by increased protease inhibitors (DPI 3), and an inflammation-driven phase skewed toward microbial control (DPI 7). Immunization alters host gastrointestinal protease and protease inhibitor levels The ontology analysis above suggested that increased protease inhibitor abundance and concomitant decrease in protease abundance (Fig. ) could be endpoints of an inflammation response induced by the experimental EAE immunization. Alternatively, they could reflect separate unrelated stimuli such as feeding. Proteases within the intestinal lumen canonically break down dietary proteins, but can also alter epithelial integrity, thereby regulating the intestinal environment and corresponding immune responses. In this context, host-expressed protease inhibitors play protective roles, potentially by limiting epithelial damage proteases might otherwise inflict. To further evaluate possible coordination between these antagonistic protein groups, we quantified all 29 proteases and 14 protease inhibitors from the experiment described in Fig. , of which 83% and 100% were host-derived, respectively (Supplementary Table ). All identified protease inhibitors were members of the I4 inhibitor family, which target S1 serine proteases including trypsin, chymotrypsin, mast cell protease, and granzymes. Seven (24%) of the proteases we identified belonged to the S1 family. However, the remaining protease families were made up of just 1–2 (<10%) proteases, while five (17%) had unknown family associations. Despite the diversity in observed protease families, we found that proteases and protease inhibitors which significantly changed before and after immunization (p < 0.05) did so in a roughly mutually exclusive fashion (Fig. ). Whereas significantly altered proteases decreased 1.6–28 fold (log2 0.7–4.8) upon immunization, significantly altered protease inhibitors increased 1.5- to 64-fold (log2 0.6–6.0). It is noteworthy that 71% of decreased proteases were host-expressed S1 serine proteases, consistent with host-expressed protease inhibitors targeting host-expressed proteases. This inverse relationship was particularly pronounced on DPI 3, suggesting coordinated protease and protease inhibitor expression early in the latent period. Despite the roughly binary pattern exhibited by a subset of proteases and protease inhibitors, we noted substantial variation in protease inhibitor abundances across days and mice. As mentioned above, we also noted that mice demonstrated a wide range of clinical severity (cumulative score range = 0.5–13, see Supplementary Table ). Since protease activities have known roles in regulating innate immune and gut-permeability responses, we next examined whether the protease and protease inhibitor variations we observed corresponded with EAE disease severity. Protease inhibitor abundances foreshadow EAE symptom severity Binning the mouse cohort into mild and severe EAE groups as in Figure  revealed that 71% of all protease inhibitors measured here were 1.4–8.6 fold (log2 0.5–3.1) greater on DPI 3 relative to pre-immunization time points in mildly affected mice compared to their severe counterparts (Fig. ). Accordingly, these protease inhibitor abundances were inversely correlated with disease severity. However, we note that as with the microbe-EAE correlation analysis (Supplementary Table ), many protein-EAE correlations did not exceed a multiple hypothesis corrected FDR threshold of 0.05, due to the low number of replicates per treatment group and large number of considered proteins (Fig. , see Supplementary Table  for complete statistics). Protease abundance corresponded with mild and severely afflicted mice to a much lesser degree than the protease inhibitors (Fig. ). One notable outlier was meprin-α, a M12-family metalloendopeptidase, which was significantly increased (2.4–3.1 fold increase, p < 0.05) in all mice which developed severe EAE at all pre- and post-immunization time points, supporting a notion that pre-immunization states could influence eventual disease outcomes. In line with this, meprin-α abundance, but not an isoform detected, was the only protease significantly (p = 0.02, r = 0.8) correlated with EAE cumulative severity score, although several other proteases also showed trends towards significance (Supplementary Table ). Together, these data suggest that extracellular host protease levels largely did not coincide with severity, despite their known roles in gut-related immunity modulation. In contrast, the inverse relationship between protease inhibitors’ latent period expressionand eventual EAE symptoms was strong and consistent across this protein class. This suggests that regardless a proteolytic activity’s source during the latent period, its control can be achieved through the coordinated expression of multiple protease inhibitors. This expression could modulate, or at least forecast eventual disease severity. Protease inhibitors correlate to specific microbes in early latent period EAE Microbial influence over host systems have been studied in many contexts including the activation of the kallikrein-kinin system. However, these associations remain largely unexplored in the case of protease inhibitors and more specifically, during EAE’s latent period. Identifying potential associations between proteases, protease inhibitors, and OTUs would be a critical first step in establishing a proteolysis-focused host-microbiome interaction model in EAE. To this end, we correlated protease and protease inhibitor abundances with OTU levels, focusing on DPI 3. The resulting 54 × 54 Pearson correlation matrix (SI. ) implicated 85 significant (p < 0.05) correlations, including 21 protease-OTU pairs and 9 protease inhibitor-OTU pairs (see Supplementary Table ). For example, the largely uncharacterized genus (family ) was positively correlated with the inhibitor SERPINB12 (r = 0.92, p < 0.05) and negatively correlated (r = −0.84, p < 0.05) with SERPINA1A. While little is known of , previous studies have revealed its enrichment along with another family member, , in the stools of MS patients. Our findings also revealed a significant (p < 0.05, r −0.88 to −0.84) negative correlation between and three protease inhibitors (Fig. ), but no significant correlation with proteases (not shown). Contradicting reports have found the genus , which shares the order Clostridiales with and , to be both enriched and depleted in MS patient stool. Here, was positively correlated with the abundance both SERPINA1E and SERPINA3K and, interestingly, several proteases (Fig. ). Of note, only was positively associated with both protease inhibitors and negatively with EAE. This is a result of weak correlations in the overlapping inhibitor-OTU-EAE correlations. These data further support the notion that specific taxa may have different functional impacts on host – impacts which could involve the induction or inhibition of proteolysis. Adjuvant alone, but not vancomycin, increased protease inhibitor abundance In addition to the inflammation-driven proteolysis regulation pathways explored above, the gene ontology analysis presented in Fig.  suggested a second, antimicrobial expression program engaged by the EAE immunization prior to symptom onset. These phenomena may be linked in multiple ways. As the previous section suggested, specific microbes could be associated with increased or decreased latent period levels of protease inhibitors, among other proteins. As such, we wished to directly test the dependency of latent period protease inhibitor levels on a subset microbes necessary for EAE induction. Antibiotic administration has been widely reported as a suppressor of EAE’s neurologic symptoms. Less understood is antibiotic’s ability to alter the gut immune response. Because a wide range of microbe-interacting proteins can be readily detected with our stool-based assay, we hypothesized mice protected from EAE symptoms by antibiotic treatment could reveal microbe-dependent host responses important for EAE’s progression. Specifically, if the increased protease inhibitor abundance described in Figs – depended on microbes, then antibiotic administration should reduce DPI 3 protease inhibitor levels. Alternatively, if the microbes associated with the increased inhibitor levels were resistant to antibiotics, inhibitor levels should remain high. Antibiotics can have idiosyncratic effects on the host when systemically present. To address this, we orally administered vancomycin to a separate cohort of mice (n = 8) on DPI -14 and characterized their 16S rRNA and stool proteome as previously described (Fig. ). Since vancomycin is poorly absorbed by the intestine, its action should be restricted to the gut microbiota, thereby minimizing confounding systemic effects. Moreover, vancomycin has previous been used as part of antibiotic cocktails administered to mice during EAE. We found that vancomycin pre-treatment (VT) entirely abrogated EAE induction over the fourteen days following standard EAE immunization (Fig. ). As expected, the antibiotic was a major perturbation to the gut microbiota, as measured by decreased phylogenetic diversity, richness, and Shannon index metrics (SI. ). A PCA generated from significantly altered (32/91 OTUs, p < 0.05) OTUs revealed a complete separation between pre-VT and post-VT states (SI. ). Pre- and post-VT weighted UniFrac distances also indicated increased phylogenetic distance between VT and non-VT groups (SI. ). The top 16 most abundant OTUs also mirrored this trend, revealing a depletion of the S24-7 family (47% of all 16s reads on DPI -14 to 0.2% on DPI -13) and unassigned members of the Clostroidales order (22% of 16s reads on DPI -14 to 2% on DPI -13). In parallel, VT also coincided with the emergence of the Enterobacteriaceae family (0.002% of 16S reads on DPI -14 to 55% on DPI -13) as the dominant OTU (SI. ). VT also significantly and durably reduced the abundances of the genera and to undetectable levels (SI. ). Consistent with our previous proteomic analysis of antibiotic-exposed mice, stool protein profiles of VT mice remained distinct from their pre-VT state and from non-VT mice throughout the pre-immunization and latent period time course (Fig. ), mirroring changes in OTU abundances (SI. ). Proteins upstream and downstream of the STAT-3 pathway such as CEAMCAM1, CNDP2, and SERPINB1 were downregulated following VT (SI. ). This suggests VT-sensitive microbes are associated with alterations in STAT-3 inflammatory related pathways (Fig. ). In addition to decreased inflammation pathways, we found a significant increase in intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP) after VT, which persisted through DPI 7. In contrast, IAP remained constantly low in non-VT immunized mice (Fig. ). IAP, an intestinal brush border enzyme, was previously shown to impede the translocation of microbes across the intestinal barrier, suggesting one possible mechanism for antibiotic-mediated protection. Impaired barrier integrity has previously been noted in EAE mice, supporting this notion. Just as VT mice displayed no outward signs of EAE’s classic physical impairments throughout the course of the study (Fig. ), they demonstrated only modest protein responses to EAE immunization. Little overlap was apparent from the protein networks induced by immunization with and without VT pre-treatment (Fig. , SI. ). For example, when compared to pre-immunization time points, post-immunization levels of AMPs were elevated in both VT and non-VT mice. However, we recorded significantly higher levels of Reg3-ß from VT mice on DPI 3 compared to non-VT mice (mean fold change = 4.5, p < 0.0001; Fig. ). In contrast, Reg3-α levels were equal in both groups on DPI 3, but significantly higher on DPI 7 in non-VT mice compared to VT counterparts (mean fold change = 4.2, p < 0.0001; Fig. ). Reg3-γ increased at a similar rate in both untreated and VT mice (Fig. ). These data suggest that despite exhibiting no physical symptoms, immunization triggers an active-but-alternative antimicrobial response in mice pre-treated with VT. These responses include an alternate expression profile of the three Reg3 isoforms. In line with an alternative post-immunization host response, the majority of protease inhibitors remained unchanged or even decreased over the course of the study in VT mice (Fig. ). Indeed, protease inhibitor levels in VT mice were significantly (p < 0.05, ANOVA) decreased when compared to non-VT mice at DPI 3 and 7 (Fig. ). Protease abundances were altered after VT (DPI -13) and immunization (DPI 3) (SI. ). Together these findings further support increased protease inhibitor levels in non-VT mice as being dependent on the presence of byproduct of VT-sensitive microbes while simultaneously suggesting that altering microbial communities also shifts the antimicrobial response compared to non-VT mice. These data suggests post-immunization protease inhibitor levels are responsive to a subset of intestinal microbes. However, the CFA/PTX adjuvant required for EAE induction in this model could also influence protease inhibitor responses. To better understand the adjuvant’s contribution to the protease inhibitor responses we measured, we treated six mice with CFA/PTX without adding MOG, and collected stool from DPI 0 and 3. Stool proteins quantified by label-free methods indicate that CFA/PTX alone significantly (p < 0.05) increased protease inhibitor levels on DPI 3 (SI. ). These results support systemic adjuvant administration as promoting microbe-dependent protease inhibitor increases, as measured from stool. In sum, CFA/PTX adjuvant increased protease inhibitor levels regardless of MOG presence. Additionally, abundance changes in stool proteins suggest VT induces an alternative host response to immunization, possibly by altering inflammatory pathway signaling and microbial translocation potential. This implicates vancomycin-sensitive microbes in the priming or aggravation of immune system components, driving EAE to manifest. Defining pre-symptomatic molecular determinants of disease is critical for developing new strategies for early detection, prevention, and therapies. Thus, disease models with defined and reproducible latent periods are valuable tools for identifying such molecular determinants. Further, they can help refine strategies for elucidating and prioritizing those which correspond with eventual symptoms. This study aimed to elucidate stool proteins which shape host-microbe interactions during the latent period of EAE induction, a model of relapsing-remitting MS. This first-reported stool proteome of the EAE model identified several protein classes and their associated pathways in the latent period that could be the focus of future targeted prophylactic or therapeutic studies. First, we showed the extracellular stool proteome readily differentiated pre- and post-immunization states at least as well as their underlying microbiota. Unlike the microbial enumeration, we showed that host proteins driving this differentiation provided functional evidence relevant to EAE etiology. For example, we noted AMPs were upregulated post-immunization regardless of antibiotic treatment. This suggests that regardless of whether eventual external EAE symptoms manifested, the immunization cocktail consistently triggered antimicrobial responses during latent period. We further note only modest changes to the microbiome between mice immunized adjuvant alone, versus the CFA/PTX adjuvant with MOG. Considering this, it is unlikely that this antigen substantially contributed to any effects we could measure from stool. Together, these results raise questions as whether the CFA/PTX adjuvant alone is capable of modulating the gut microbiome, and whether such a change could sensitize animals to a broader array of autoimmune disease models. We further showed that antibiotic exposure had a pronounced effect on protein expression. Specifically, latent period AMP expression patterns only partially agreed between VT and non-VT mice. While both treatment groups demonstrated increased Reg3-γ levels following immunization, VT mice showed increased Reg3-β on DPI 3 relative to non-VT mice, while non-VT mice showed increased Reg3-α on DPI 7. These discrepancies in Reg3 AMP isoforms could reflect the major differences in microbe community structures each group at the time of immunization, with a greater proportion of gram-negative microbes present in VT mice. However, Reg3-β’s noted role in limiting translocation of gram-negative microbes across the intestinal barrier should be considered when interpreting this result. Given that molecular mimicry in EAE and MS is one prevalent etiological theory, the protection from ensuing microbe-induced inflammation could reduce systemic levels of potential MOG molecular mimics. We also found that intestinal serine protease inhibitor levels increased with immunization in a manner that inversely correlated with EAE severity. This suggests that members of this protease inhibitor class could antagonize pathogenic host-host or host-microbe interactions. In support of this, oral administration of Bowman-Birk or PETIR001 serine protease inhibitors were previously shown to ameliorate EAE’s classic neurological symptoms. Given the important role protease inhibitors have in tempering systemic immune system responses, as well as self-tolerance, our findings are not entirely surprising. For example, the balance between trypsin and alpha-1-antitrypsin (SERPINA1) is well-studied in the case of viral infection and cystic fibrosis where protease-inhibitor levels protect airways from an aberrant inflammatory response. However, the consequences of altering the levels of any single specific endogenous protease inhibitor (either in the stool or peripherally) prior to EAE onset are currently unknown. Our study supports a model in which the host expresses a variety of serine protease inhibitors into the GI lumen to protect the surrounding epithelium from otherwise aberrant and toxic proteolytic activity. The upregulation of protease inhibitors, and thus the applicability of these findings, during flare and remission states in MS have yet to be determined. Based on prior studies that demonstrated the EAE model’s dependence on the microbiota, we suspected antibiotic treatment would reveal protective proteomic mechanisms, and given the increased inhibitor abundance in non-VT mice, we predicted a similar increase in VT mice. Surprisingly, we found that VT, which prevented EAE symptoms, did not alter protease inhibitor levels, which our data suggested was protective in non-VT mice. These results raise several questions about the biological underpinnings driving these findings and the potential compensatory role of protease inhibitors in EAE. One possible mechanism explaining the discrepancy between VT and non-VT mice is that specific VT-sensitive microbes (or subset of the microbiome) trigger the release of host-expressed protease inhibitors. The magnitude of their expression, at least in part could then dictate the subsequent degree of EAE severity. When these triggering microbes are removed by VT, protease inhibitor levels remain at basal levels. Alternatively, an increase microbial debris resulting from VT could also trigger an increase in “protective” proteins (e.g. IAP and AMPs) that lead to increased epithelial integrity, decrease immune system “reactivity”, and control microbial growth. Supporting this, IAP has previously been described in several capacities as anti-inflammatory through its regulation of Th17 + t-cell generating pathways – important to EAE pathology – and its role in gut epithelium integrity. Stated simply, it is possible that VT’s action prevents immune system activation prior to EAE induction, thus preventing the need for increased protease inhibitor production and secretion by the host during EAE. This suggests that protease inhibitor expression can be effective in modulating the inflammation necessary for EAE induction; however, this protection is less effective than preventing any microbe-dependent inflammation in the first place. To confirm any of these findings, future studies should examine the correspondence between protease inhibitor expression and immune cell phenotype changes. Previous findings suggest VT also reduces lamina propria-resident Th17+ T-cell populations in mice. These findings also suggested members of the vancomycin sensitive Cytophaga-Flavobacteria-Bacteroides taxonomic group (currently known as the phylum Bacteroidetes) strongly correlated with Th17+ T-cell levels. This indicates a subpopulation of vancomycin-sensitive microbes affect Th17+ T-cell generation. However, the mechanisms by which these microbes directly or indirectly influence host immunity remain unclear. Prior work has showed the Th17-dependent differentiation is influenced by the balance of proteases (cathepsin B/L) and protease inhibitors (SERPNB1). This suggests one possible mechanism microbes could use to influence the host immune state is protease activity. In support of this, previous research reported that proteases are often preferentially packed into outer membrane vesicles generated by the genus , a genus within the Bacteroidetes phylum. However, given that a majority of proteases we detected were host derived, more work must be done to isolate microbial proteases if this hypothesis is to be substantiated. While our study did not attempt to associate EAE proteome signatures to immune cell populations levels, our findings along with previous evidence point to specific immune cell activation which is dependent on latent period protease and protease inhibitor levels in the gut. In addition to the role proteases have in T-cell differentiation, experimental colitis and other research models have indicated aberrant protease activity contributes to the loss of intestinal barrier integrity and to chronic inflammation. Decreased intestinal barrier integrity has also been shown in EAE. One mechanism by which protease-protease inhibitor interactions influence EAE could involve protease activated receptors (PARs). Receptors in this family such as PAR2 have well-noted roles in gut epithelium integrity and are also present throughout the vasculature and cells residing in the CNS. Prior research has noted an upregulation of PAR2 on astrocytes of EAE mice and MS patients, suggesting these cells may be more sensitive to perturbations in trypsin-like protease activity compared to healthy controls. Our study supports this notion in that all protease inhibitors we identified as increased on DPI 3 belonged to the I4 family – a family that inhibits known PAR activators such as trypsin and tryptase. Remarkably, the abundance of several proteases remained largely unchanged over the experimental time course, while others were severely decreased. As such, the increased protease inhibitor levels we observed could reflect a response to increased protease activity. This increase in activity may result from active proteases already present or an increase in protease abundance from unidentified source such as bacteria and unicellular eukaryotes, or some combination thereof. Unchecked by protease inhibitors, such increased proteolytic activity could lead to increased microbial infiltration via weakened epithelial junctions, leading to sustained inflammation. One avenue to test this hypothesis is through characterizing the stool of germ-free animals inoculated with representative microbial community members suspected of EAE exacerbation. Using this approach along with genetic manipulation of known proteases within this selected microbial community could further elucidate the role of specific proteases in EAE, as well as the inhibitor(s) responsible for limiting their activity. However, in order to undertake the proposed line of experimentation, proteases and inhibitors must be identified from an extremely complex mixture of proteins originating from every taxonomic kingdom. Despite identifying 842 microbial proteins (including proteins only found in VT mice), which comprised 72% of our dataset, we were only able to detect five microbial proteases, a result likely due to several factors such as mass spectrometer dynamic range and database sequence exclusion. Additionally, a lack of accurate sequence annotation also likely hampered effective protease identification. Indeed, our search identified 135 (16%) microbial proteins with no attached annotation. As more microbes are sequenced and protein functions are inferred, this limitation will likely be lessened. Accurate identification of both proteins and microbes will be especially important for translating these results into more clinically tractable settings. It is currently unknown whether similar increases in gut-specific protease activity or inhibitor production are present in MS patients immediately prior to or during a flare, or more importantly, if they play a primary or compensatory role in MS severity modulation. However, previous findings in humans have hinted at their role in plasma. Given our ability to detect these events in animal models, future studies should focus on longitudinal collection of stool with the goal of characterizing the stool proteome in healthy, pre-flare, and flare conditions. Currently, we are attempting to collect such a cohort. Such a study could lead to the development of convenient at-home diagnostic tests for increased protease activity or inhibitor levels. Overall, this study both expands and reinforces our understanding of the diverse ways hosts and microbes interact during health and disease and are summarized in SI. . By leveraging multi-omic technology and time-tested physiological phenotype measurements, we were able to elucidate novel host-microbe interactions with the potential to impact future research and human health. C57BL/6J female mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory and kept in a specific pathogen-free facility at the Harvard Institute of Medicine (n = 8 for MOG/CFA/PTX and VT experiments, n = 6 for CFA/PTX only, randomly assigned) on a 12 hour light/dark cycle. Mice were all 8–10 weeks of age and cohoused, four mice from same experimental condition per cage. Mice were fed an ad-libitum diet of Picolab Rodent Diet 5053 and distilled water without added preservatives (provided by BWH animal facility). All animal experiments described in this paper were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Harvard Medical School and carried out in accordance with those approved animal experiment guidelines. Mice receiving vancomycin were housed separately from non-vancomycin treated mice. Precise mouse weight was not recorded, however signs of weight loss were assessed by lab facilities each day and no weight loss was noted during the latent period with or without vancomycin administration. EAE was induced in mice by subcutaneous immunization with 100 ug MOG 35–55 peptide emulsified in complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA, Difco Laboratories) per mouse, followed by intraperitoneal administration of 150 ng pertussis toxin (PTX, Millipore) on days 0 and 2 as previously described. Clinical signs of EAE were assessed (not blinded) at the same time each afternoon according to the following score: 0, no signs of disease; 1, loss of tone in the tail; 2, hind limb paresis; 3, hind limb paralysis; 4, tetraplegia; 5 moribund. Scoring was not blinded to experimental condition. For VT mice, Vancomycin was added to the water bottle at a concentration of 0.5 g/L (Thermo Fischer) on DPI -14 after stool pellets were collected. All control mice receiving CFA/PTX without MOG 35–55 were subjected to the same protocol as experimental mice. Fecal DNA was isolated (MoBio PowerLyzer PowerSoil Kit) and the V4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene was amplified using barcoded forward primers (515F, 806R) from the Earth Microbiome Project and http://www.earthmicrobiome.org/protocols-and-standards/16S/ . Samples were sequenced by paired end 150 base pair reads at the Harvard Medical School Biopolymers Facility using the MiSeq platform (Illumina). Sequence quality was evaluated with FastQC (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/). The median Phred quality scores were above Q30. Downstream analysis was performed in QIIME (Qualitative Insights into Microbial Ecoloy). Sequences were de-multiplexed and quality filtered in which reads are truncated if two consecutive bases fall below a quality score of Q20 (1% error), and reads that are <75% of full length are discarded. OTUs were picked using the open reference method sumaclust () and sortmeRNA. Taxonomy was determined from the Greengenes database (13.8 release; ) using a 97% similarity threshold. Diversity metrics were calculated from a rarefied table at an even depth of 1000 reads per sample. Alpha diversity was calculated with the phylogentic diversity whole tree, Shannon’s diversity, richness metrics, and beta-diversity were calculated using weighted and unweighted UniFrac distances. Further identification of the top 10 Lactobacillus OTUs analysis was performed using BLAST and MEGA7: Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis version 7.0 (MEGA). Briefly, phylogenetic relationships of the closest BLAST matches as well as other reference bacteria were use to generate a phylogenetic tree in MEGA using the neighbor joining method. Multiple stool pellets from each specific mouse were freshly collected directly into an 2 mL Eppendorf tube each day, immediately flash frozen and stored in a −80 C freezer. Pellets were collected at approximately the same time each day. Pellets from all time points were collected, an appropriate number of these pellets (1–2 pellets) were shipped on dry ice for further handling in the Elias lab. Upon arrival, samples were stored in −80c freezer. All samples were prepared in a blinded, randomized order and processed as previously described in. Briefly, sample pellets were disrupted using 500 uL urea lysis buffer (8 M urea, 100 mM NaCl, 25 mM Tris, pH 8.2) supplemented with Roche cOmplete mini protease inhibitor (04693159001 ROCHE) by vortexing. After pellet resuspension, insoluble material was pelleted at 2500× g for 10 minutes at 4 °C and the resulting supernatant was subjected to ultracentrifugation (35000 RPM [avg. RCF 43492] for 30 min. at 4C, Beckman-Coulter Optima Ultracentrifuge, rotor TLA120.2) to remove bacteria and small debris. The ultracentrifuge supernatant was subsequently reduced with 1,4 Dithiothreitol (50 mM), alkylated with Iodoacetamide (50 mM), and precipitated overnight in −20 °C freezer using trichloroacetic acid (15% total volume). Protein pellets were resuspended in 40 uL of loading buffer (75% 10 mM Tris, 25% 4x loading dye [50 mM Tris HCl, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.1% bromophenol blue]) purified using SDS-PAGE (approximately 5 mm, Invitrogen NuPAGE 4–12% Bis-Tris, MOPS running buffer, 200 V constant voltage). Excised gel bands corresponding to the entire protein specimen were excised and dehydrated in successive washes with 50% acetonitrile (ACN)/50 mM ammonium bicarbonate followed by 100% ACN. Gel pieces were then subjected to in-gel tryptic digestion as previously described using sequencing grade trypsin (Promega, V5113). After digestion, each sample was desalted using Waters Sep-Pak C18 columns. Eluted peptides were then labeled with an isobaric TMT 10-plex labeling kit following the manufacturer’s recommended protocol, and desalted again. Ratios of each tag were initially verified LC/MS3 using <10% of each specimen, and then mixed accounting for deviations from the expected 1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1 ratio, with a final concentration of approximately 1 ug/ul. 1 uL of each sample was subject to reversed-phase chromatography on a Dionex Ultimate 3000 HPLC with an in-house laser-pulled 100 um ID nanospray column packed to ~220 mm with 3 um 2A C18 beads (Reprosil). Buffer A of the mobile phase contained 0.1% formic acid (FA) in HPLC-grade water, while buffer B contained 0.1% FA in ACN. An initial two-minute isocratic gradient flowing 3% B was followed by a linear increase up to 25% B for 115 minutes, then increased to 45% B over 15 minutes, and a final increase to 95% B over 15 minutes whereupon B was held for 6 minutes and returned back to baseline (2 min) and held for 10 minutes, for a total of 183 minutes. The HPLC flow rate was 0.400 uL/minute. The HPLC was coupled to a Thermo Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer that collected MS data in positive ion mode within the 400–1500 m/z range. A top-speed MS3 method was employed with an initial Orbitrap scan resolution of 120,000. This was followed by high-energy collision-induced dissociation and analysis in the orbitrap using “Top Speed’ dynamic identification with dynamic exclusion enabled (repeat count of 1, exclusion duration of 90 s). The automatic gain control for was set to 4e5 and 1e4 for FT full MS and ITMSn, respectively. The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD012287 using ID: reviewer88334@ebi.ac.uk and password: 3woACgwT. The resulting mass spectra were searched using Proteome Discoverer 2.2. using the built-in SEQUEST search algorithm. Built-in TMT batch correction was enabled for all samples. Three FASTA databases were employed: Uniprot Swiss-Prot (taxon ID 10090, downloaded January 2017), the Human Microbiome Project database (FASTA file downloaded from on January 2017, and a database containing common preparatory contaminants. Target-decoy searching at both the peptide and protein level was employed with a strict FDR cutoff of 0.05 using the Percolator algorithm built into Proteome Discoverer 2.2. The enzyme specificity was set to tryptic with static peptide modifications set to cambamidomethylation (+57.0214 Da) and TMT (+229.1629 Da). Dynamic modifications were set to oxidation (+15.995 Da) and n-terminal protein acetylation (+42.011 Da). Only high-confidence proteins (q-val < 0.01) were used for analysis. Statistics were calculated using GraphPad Prism 7, R with statistics packages (FactoMinerR 1.36, factoextra 1.0.5, ggplot2 2.2.1, Hmisc 4.0–3, psych 1.7.8, Mfuzz 2.34.0, ggpubr 0.1.5, RColorBrewer 1.1–2, UpSetR, 1.3.3, limma 3.30.13, venneuler 1.1–0), and Qlucore Omics Explorer 3.3. Data were analyzed through the use of IPA (QIAGEN Inc., https://www.qiagenbioinformatics.com/products/ingenuitypathway-analysis). Protein abundance was normalized as a percentage of summed reporter intensity for all quantified proteins in a given sample (protein intensity/total sample intensity). Missing abundance values were imputed using the lowest value found in that sample/channel. Where necessary for meeting statistical assumptions, abundances were log2 transformed (e.g. Pearson’s correlation, ANOVA). The appropriate multiple hypothesis tests were applied to abundance comparison data using Qlucore Omics Explorer or GraphPad Prism. These included one-way ANOVA with FDR correction (Qlucore), Dunn’s non-parametric test with Kruskal-Wallis correction, and two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni’s correction (Prism). Univariate analysis was conducted using Mann-Whitney U test (Prism). Correlational p-values were corrected using false discovery rate (FDR) setting and the R package psych 1.7.8. Protein abundance heat maps were generated with Qlucore Omics Explorer 3.3 with specified p-value cutoffs, FDRs and fold changes (where appropriate) were generated using Qlucore’s built-in FDR estimator, and the values are reported in Supplementary Tables.

553c405e-6e0f-4353-a68a-5bcf635893c4,"Cover Story: Cognitive Issues with Multiple Sclerosis: Research, Strategies and Support Cover Story: Cognitive Issues with Multiple Sclerosis: Research, Strategies and Support By Susan Wells Courtney Reviewed by Jack Burks, MD Cognitive changes with multiple sclerosis (MS) are fairly common. Most studies state that approximately 50 percent of individuals with MS may have some type of cognitive dysfunction, although some estimates are as high as 60 or even 70 percent. Individuals with MS who experience cognitive issues may have trouble with functions such as attention, information-processing speed, executive functions (decision making), episodic memory, and visuospatial abilities. These deficits can affect several activities of daily living, including employment, driving, social integration, and adherence to medication regimens. Concentration and attention shifting are other examples of cognition impairments observed with MS. The study of cognitive changes with MS is both extensive and varied, yet still in its early stages. A search of peer-reviewed articles reveals findings from hundreds of recent trials within the past few years, conducted in countries all over the world, and covering a wide range of objectives – from evaluating assessment tools and looking at cognition’s impact on quality of life, to identifying potential causes and determining the effectiveness of certain treatment strategies. Why is the study of cognition in MS so complex? This is because so many variables exist with this symptom and its manifestations. For example, cognitive changes can be a difficult area to measure and to compare with controls. Researchers are looking for the optimal tests to best evaluate the presence, type, and severity of cognitive deficits in different individuals with MS. The variety of tests used in these trials is impressive; for example, these may include questionnaires, dual-task evaluations, measures of eye movements, computerized tests of cognitive function, an array of physical, mental, and emotional scales, several types of neuroimaging, and more. Acclaimed author Jeffrey N. Gingold, writer of Facing the Cognitive Challenges of Multiple Sclerosis, Second Edition (Demos Health, 2011) and Mental Sharpening Stones (Demos Health, 2008), has been able to put into words exactly what it feels like to experience a sudden lapse in cognition, where familiar surroundings are no longer familiar, and wellversed words cannot be found. In Facing the Cognitive Challenges of Multiple Sclerosis, Second Edition, Mr. Gingold talks about his work as a successful lawyer who is suddenly faced with a host of cognitive challenges, some of which arise at the most inopportune of times. At right are excerpts from the Preface of this book, touching briefly on his experience with cognitive issues from MS. Another book written by Mr. Gingold, , also provides detailed descriptions of sudden lapses in cognition. It goes on to give valuable direction and tips for managing this symptom. Other books are available on the topic of cognition and MS, including Multiple Sclerosis: Understanding the Cognitive Challenges, which is an excellent resource written by Nicholas LaRocca, PhD and Rosalind Kalb, PhD (Demos Medical Publishing, 2006). All three of these books, as well as others, may be borrowed at no charge from MSAA’s Lending Library.

Would you be able and willing to explain it to your doctor? To your friends and family? Your spouse? When I was first diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) in 1996, I envisioned being physically disabled, relegated to spending family time and a successful legal career in a permanently seated position. I never anticipated that MS would also include an invisible disability, a ‘mental wheelchair’ that would confound my recollection and distort my rational presence of mind, turning court appearances and the routine moments of life into mental quicksand.” “Without warning, many people with MS are suddenly faced with an inability to process routine thoughts. Their decision making may be stonewalled, befuddling simple conversations into a word-finding struggle. Others may lose their bearings in their own backyard or kitchen, or suddenly the face of a spouse or friend will appear unfamiliar. Then, the shroud over their memory recall lifts, defying explanation, and leaving no trace of the bait and switch. The individual’s cognitive functions have been compromised and often go undiagnosed, creating a deep chasm of unseen disability.” – Jeffrey N. Gingold, Facing the Cognitive Challenges of Multiple Sclerosis, Second Edition Even with all of these tools, many questions still remain. For instance, when an individual with cognitive issues provides self-reported evaluations, are these answers valid? The findings from a study in France suggest that cognitive dysfunction did not compromise the reliability or validity of one’s responses on quality of life questionnaires, but these types of issues need to be considered when conducting studies on the effects of cognitive problems. Further complicating this issue is the fact that medications used for symptom management may also affect cognition as a side effect, and this too must be included in the equation. Neuroimaging is vital in determining what specific areas of the brain may be affected by MS to cause cognitive problems, as well as parts of the brain that may compensate for areas that are no longer conducting nerve impulses efficiently. Many forms of imaging technology are used for this purpose and can provide important data to researchers, enabling them to theorize the different areas of the brain that may impact cognition. Some of these types of tests are used to observe the activity in parts of the brain while a patient performs a task, and these data may be compared to someone without cognitive issues performing the same task. Additionally, the type or stage of MS can exhibit different types and degrees of cognitive changes. Researchers are studying both relapsing and progressive forms of MS, as well as individuals with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) and pediatric MS. Studies are also being conducted to determine if other symptoms may impact cognition, such as depression and other changes in mood, fatigue, poor sleep, and more. And perhaps the biggest variable in evaluating cognitive issues in MS is the day-to-day variations in symptoms as well as during times of exacerbations or pseudo-exacerbations. Demographics are another area of interest, and in this category, gender may even play a role. A Spanish study found that gender may have an impact on cognitive performance, and in this instance, found that males with MS exhibited poorer cognitive performance, largely in terms of verbal auditory memory. However, a study in Finland found that male patients with severe attentional deficits benefited more from neuropsychological intervention, as compared to females in the study. Much remains to be learned about this challenging symptom, and as illustrated in this example, a variety of outcomes may be derived from this research. As researchers delve further into the effects of cognitive issues in MS and look to find the causes, another important area of study is that which evaluates the effectiveness of potential treatments. Different forms of exercise as well as various types of cognitive training/ neuro–psychological rehabilitation are two areas of potential treatments that are being studied closely. Many trials are also underway to look at the effectiveness of the different approved and experimental disease-modifying therapies in delaying, improving, or preventing cognitive symptoms. Other treatments, such as fampridine, statins, and vitamin A, are now including changes in cognition among their study endpoints. The many variables mentioned above are just examples of the great complexity involved with learning about and treating cognitive dysfunction in MS. In the pages to follow, this article will provide excerpts from published studies from around the world, aimed at evaluating this challenging symptom and its potential causes, along with various treatment strategies. Readers may also learn about current studies and hear from two professionals who work closely with individuals experiencing cognitive issues from MS. Changes in the Brain That May Lead to Cognitive Problems What leads to cognitive problems in MS? Changes in the brain caused by damage to the myelin and axons (nerves in the brain) are the primary cause of cognitive dysfunction in MS. Research is ongoing to identify the exact locations of damage that cause cognition issues in individuals with MS. Additionally, damage to different locations of the brain affect different types of cognitive function, such as attention, information-processing speed, executive function, and memory, to name a few. The hope is that through such studies, treatments may eventually be designed to target these areas and minimize or prevent any effects that MS may have on cognition. The term “cognition” refers to a group of mental processes such as information processing, language, memory, visual perception/spatial skills, calculation skills, and executive functions (LaRocca, Sorenson and Fischer, 2000). These may be described as follows: Information-processing skills affect our ability to focus, maintain, and shift our attention from one thing to another without losing track of what we were doing, as well as managing incoming information quickly. Language refers to the ability to understand and use language appropriately in daily situations. Memory is a complex set of skills that involve learning, storage of information, and the ability to retrieve that information on demand. Visual perceptual/spatial skills allow us to do things such as recognize objects, draw, assemble things, and find our way around. Performing simple and complex math skills are involved in calculation abilities. Executive-functioning abilities enable us to get through our day by overseeing and coordinating tasks such as organization, planning, sequencing, problem solving, judgment, reasoning, monitoring our own behavior, etc. The most commonly affected cognitive processes in MS are speed-of-information processing, memory, and executive functions. Other domains of cognition can also be affected depending on where lesions are located. However, rarely are all domains of cognition impacted by MS. These are structures at the base of the brain composed of nerve cells; they are responsible for body movements and coordination. They also function as a relay center for sensory impulses to the cerebral cortex. Damage in this area may cause cognitive problems. A wasting or decrease in size of part of the brain because of disease, such as MS. Brain structure connecting the cerebrum pathways to the spinal cord, which leads to nerves in the arms and legs. It also controls vital functions, movement, sensation, and nerves supplying the head and neck. The cerebellum is at the base and the back of the brain. The cerebellum is responsible for coordination and balance. This is the outer gray matter of the cerebrum, where many of the higher functions, such as volition, consciousness, conceptualization, motor activity, speech, and sensation, are carried out. This gray matter is mainly composed of nerve cells. This is the large, top portion of the brain that is divided into four lobes and is joined at the bottom by the corpus callosum. It controls and integrates motor, sensory, and higher mental functions, such as thought, reason, emotion, and memory. The four sections of lobes that make up the cerebrum are: The frontal lobes that are responsible for problem solving, judgment, and motor function. The parietal lobes that manage sensation, handwriting, and body position. The temporal lobes, including the hippocampus and limbic system, are involved with memory and hearing. The occipital lobes that contain the brain’s visual processing system. Part of the cerebrum, this is a plate of nerve fibers connecting the two cerebral hemispheres, except for most of the temporal lobes. Areas of the nervous system composed mostly of myelinated nerve fibers (those having myelin sheaths) that conduct nerve impulses. Please note that portions of the information appearing in this article are described in “Cognition, Cognitive Dysfunction, and Cognitive Rehabilitation in Multiple Sclerosis,” written by Pepping M, et al, Phys Med Rehabil Clin N Am 24 (2013) 663-672. Both acute inflammatory demyelination and axonal degeneration are thought to be the primary causes of MS-related disability. Although MS is often considered to be a disorder affecting only subcortical white matter, considerable evidence has shown that cortical demyelination can also occur, even at early stages of disease. Since both subcortical and cortical brain regions appear to be affected, this indicates that the nature of MS is diffuse (spread over a wide area), and may explain why a widespread set of cognitive issues are possible. What is notable about this data is the fact that MS damage leading to disability was at one time thought to be limited to white matter. The axons (nerves in the brain) found in white matter are insulated by myelin, which is the primary target of MS damage. However, when MS damage extends to the gray matter – consisting of dense nerve cells and myelin that is less apparent – additional disability, including cognition, can be affected. Gray matter damage is usually more widespread than the more well-defined white-matter lesions. This is why damage going beyond the white matter and extending into the gray matter is often referred to as “diffuse.” According to the authors of this article, despite the potential for diffuse brain involvement, MS lesions tend to locate in white matter, the cerebellum, and the brainstem. White-matter lesion load (or burden), the location of the lesions, and the amount of global or regional brain atrophy – which is the shrinking or reduction in brain volume – are of greatest interest in the study of cognitive dysfunction in MS. To follow are some examples of MS damage and the type of cognitive functions that they affect: Lesion load in areas near the cortex may cause problems with memory MS damage in the frontal lobe can affect executive function (which includes judgement and problem solving) Global and regional brain atrophy is particularly associated with cognitive dysfunction Additionally, in some studies, brain atrophy (reduction in tissue) was found to contribute more to cognitive impairment than the degree of lesion load. Other examples of damage that appear to affect cognitive function include: The width of the third ventricle, which was more highly associated with cognitive dysfunction than whole-brain (overall) atrophy A central role of the thalamus is to act as a relay station for the transmission of information between different areas of the brain; this could explain why atrophy in these areas has significant effects on key frontal-subcortical functions, which include thought and memory In some studies, cognitive impairment and atrophy of the thalamus were particularly linked to men – although the reason for this is not known To follow are a few brief findings from recent studies, which suggest that different areas of the brain may to play a role in cognitive symptoms with MS. As readers can see, researchers have differing opinions as to what areas or factors have the greatest impact on cognitive functioning. These reports are just a sampling of the many studies that have been published within the past few years. A study from Buffalo, New York states that there is a well-established correlation between and cognitive dysfunction in MS. The study’s findings also suggest that may play a role in MS cognitive decline. An international study reports that changes in the , are related to mobility and cognitive impairment. A study from Cleveland, Ohio indicates that in patients with MS, hippocampal volume (the is part of the temperal lobe in the cerebral cortex) was related to reduced memory and information-processing speed. These results highlight the role of the hippocampus in cognitive dysfunction in patients with MS and suggest that measures of hippocampal atrophy could be used to capture aspects of disease progression. A study in Switzerland indicates that can contribute to disability, including cognitive impairment in MS. Researchers in the United Kingdom linked , an excitatory neurotransmitter, with memory problems. Researchers in Canada report that they investigated the association between cognitive impairment and dysfunction in secondary-progressive multiple sclerosis. Other Factors that May Play a Role in Cognitive Problems in MS Other factors may be involved with the cognitive symptoms of MS. To follow is a listing of some of these factors that have been hypothesized or implicated in recent studies. From a study conducted in several countries, “While cognition can be affected during sensorimotor multiple sclerosis (MS) relapses, the relevance of isolated cognitive relapses (ICRs, i.e., those occurring in absence of new sensorimotor symptoms) remain poorly characterized. Here, we decided to explore the relationship between ICR, subjective evaluation of cognitive performance and long-term cognitive decline in a group of subjects with relapsing-remitting MS… Subjects who presented with an ICR [at six months into the study] presented with a significantly reduced cognitive performance at the follow-up evaluations compared with patients without ICR.” Researchers in Kansas City reported that patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) commonly use a variety of medications to slow disease progression, alleviate symptoms, and treat comorbid conditions. The use of multiple medications (polypharmacy) can be associated with additional fatigue and memory problems. The investigators recommend that patients and healthcare professionals weigh the risks and the benefits of using multiple medications at one time, given the potential for a possible increase in fatigue and cognitive issues. Investigators in Istanbul, Turkey explain, “According to the results of our study, heavy smokers had increased cognitive impairment when compared to nonsmokers. Extensive studies are necessary to further elucidate the relationship between smoking and cognitive impairment in MS patients.” Italian researchers suggest that the potential relationship with bacteria in the GI tracts and their potential influence on the immune system in neurological disease (such as MS), with an impact on pain and cognition. Mutual impact of gastro-intestinal tract (GIT) and central nervous system (CNS) functions has been recognized since the mid-twentieth century. They studied how the commensal gut microbiota influences systemic immune response in some neurological disorders, highlighting its impact on pain and cognition in multiple sclerosis. To follow are some recently reported study findings, helping to provide a broader understanding of the impact and variables in cognitive dysfunction as a symptom of MS, as well as help to identify the most useful methods of assessment. To follow are some recently reported study findings, helping to provide a broader understanding of the impact and variables in cognitive dysfunction as a symptom of MS, as well as help to identify the most useful methods of assessment. A German study explains, “Patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis and age-and gender-matched healthy individuals were tested with common neuropsychological tests and a , whereby a target stimulus has to be detected amongst distracting stimuli on a touch screen… [The researchers concluded that] visual search is a promising instrument for the assessment of cognitive functions and potentially cognitive changes in patients with multiple sclerosis thanks to its good discriminatory power and insusceptibility to practice effects.” Cognitive rehabilitation (discussed later) encourages people with cognitive issues to stay active and employ helpful strategies. These strategies include planning ahead and using written notes – both for memory prompts and for increased organization. In Kansas City, Missouri, researchers explain, “Eye movement difficulties in multiple sclerosis (MS) are common and may influence performance on cognitive tests… [Two] studies examined associations between a new measure of and visual/nonvisual cognitive tests. In both studies, slower eye movements were significantly associated with poorer performance on cognitive tests… Pending further research, the Speedy Eyes Test [SET], a brief, inexpensive, and nontechnical measure of speedy eye movement, may serve as a visual/oculomotor indicator of cognitive impairment in multiple sclerosis.” The University of Illinois report that performing a cognitive task, while walking, results in a reduction of walking performance among persons with MS. Any loss in function that occurs because of doing two tasks at one time is referred to as dual-task cost, or DTC. Study investigators examined walking performance, cognitive processing speed, and symptoms of fatigue, depression, anxiety, and pain as correlates of DTC of walking in MS. There were significant and large declines in gait performance with the addition of a cognitive task for velocity, cadence, and step length. Walking performance might be a target of interventions for reducing the DTC of walking in MS. As noted earlier in this article, at least 50 percent of individuals with MS experience changes in cognition. This is often a challenging symptom that can impact one’s life in many ways. For instance, some individuals with cognitive issues may reduce or discontinue their participation in outside activities, they may become less socially active, and employment is often affected. At home, problems with cognition can also affect one’s ability to perform everyday activities, as routine duties may take longer to complete, things may be forgotten, and stress may arise over these changes. Other symptoms of MS, such as fatigue and depression, may have a negative impact on cognition as well. Treatment options and studies into potential new treatments are of constant interest and concern to the MS community. In this section, the possible benefits of exercise, medications, and cognitive rehabilitation are discussed. Common Questions and Answers Regarding Cognitive Issues In MS is one of MSAA’s Client Services Specialists. When asked about cognition as a symptom of MS, she talked about the experiences she has had with callers to MSAA’s Helpline. First, Mrs. Blair provided examples of client calls and inquiries that she often receives in regards to this symptom. Common questions include: Clients may report forgetfulness, not thinking as clearly or quickly as they once did, feelings of being overwhelmed, and not knowing if this is a symptom caused by their MS. Clients ask what they can do about these symptoms and who they can see for it. They want to know if this is something that will occur in the future. Next, Mrs. Blair provided the types of information that she and other Client Services Specialists provide in response to these inquiries, as follows: – thinking, memory, decision making, and judgment – especially in relation to where the disease is causing damage and inflammation in the brain. Other MS-symptom issues can also affect one’s cognition, and these might include fatigue, problems in sleep management, and depression. The side effects of medication can also have an impact on cognition. Other factors that affect cognition include anemia, infection, and thyroid problems. This does not necessarily mean that every individual with MS will experience this symptom, as everyone’s experience and symptom presentation with MS differs, but it is something that can occur as a challenge in the disease process. Evaluating and considering all factors that could be involved in the appearance and/or worsening of this symptom is important, as other health conditions can occur in conjunction with MS and may be a contributing factor to difficulties in thinking or processing information. Talking to one’s doctor can help to distinguish the cause of these changes. In regard to symptom management and evaluations for cognitive issues, the first step would be to work with his or her neurologist in discussing what these symptoms are, what’s been noticed, what types of changes have occurred, and any other concerns one may have. A neurologist may want to recommend baseline cognitive evaluations and testing, perhaps with the support of a neuropsychologist, who is a specialist focusing on mental processes, behavior, and thinking as they relate to the structure of the brain. This type of doctor can perform different types of testing in regards to one’s current rate of processing thoughts and tasks. This testing can include a series of different tests to evaluate language, memory, organization, and similar types of functions. After an evaluation, the specialist may then recommend and work with a client to create some type of cognitive rehabilitation treatment plan. This would include identifying problem areas and working on strategies for improvement in processing. Among other methods, this can include specific tasks and activities, games, exercise, and those types of things, all tailored to meet the client’s specific needs. Mrs. Blair also notes the possible impact that cognitive issues may have on daily life: Cognitive challenges can interfere with daily tasks, such as household duties and responsibilities. For instance, memory issues and forgetfulness can cause problems when trying to complete chores or errands, making and keeping appointments, staying organized, and performing other daily activities. Cognitive issues can impact one’s employment and job responsibilities, if memory and forgetfulness start to interfere with the completion of tasks. Decision making on the job can also be affected if one’s judgment and executive function are at all compromised. Management strategies may be developed to help someone who is having trouble at work as a result of cognitive problems caused by MS. Asking for accommodations in the workplace, if needed, can be very helpful. Another option is to take advantage of vocational rehabilitation services. These are specific counseling and employment-related services for those with disabilities – to identify areas of need and ways to manage and improve upon this issue. Making lists, using files, or employing other organizational methods that help to keep things in order, both at work and a home, can assist individuals in accomplishing tasks and minimizing the effects of forgetfulness and other cognitive issues. If appropriate and as needed, asking for help to delegate tasks to others can be very helpful as well. This includes having conversations with one’s healthcare team and his or her family or support network to discuss cognitive issues, ways they can be managed, recommendations for treatment, and obstacles that may be modified to accommodate for these changes. Cognitive difficulties can be a very sensitive and complicated issue to discuss with others, but it’s important for individuals with MS and their families to know that they are not alone and there are supports in place to help people cope with this symptom. With or without MS, the positive effects of exercise on cognition are frequently mentioned in the news. The following data provide interesting information on different types of exercise when studied in individuals with MS and their effects on cognitive function. Researchers from an Illinois study explain, “The current study compared the acute effects of moderate-intensity treadmill walking, moderate-intensity cycle ergometry, and guided yoga with those of quiet rest on executive control in 24 persons with relapsing-remitting MS without impaired cognitive processing speed… The present results support treadmill walking as the modality of exercise that might exert the largest beneficial effects on executive control in persons with relapsing-remitting MS without impaired cognitive processing speed. This represents an exciting starting point for delineating the appropriate exercise stimulus (i.e., modality and intensity) for inclusion in a subsequent longitudinal exercise training intervention for improving cognitive performance in this population.” Investigators from Seattle report, “The present study adopted a randomized controlled trial design and examined the effect of a physical activity behavioral intervention on cognitive and walking performance among persons with MS who have mild or moderate disability status… The current study supports physical activity as a promising tool for managing cognitive impairment and impaired walking performance in persons with MS, and suggests that physical activity might have specific effects on cognition and non-specific effects on walking performance in this population.” Research in Seattle has also set out “to determine whether there is an association between improvements in objective measures of physical fitness and performance on cognitive tests in people with multiple sclerosis (MS)… Participants in the physically improved group demonstrated improved performance on measures of executive functioning after 12 weeks of exercise. The results of this study lend support to the hypothesis that change in fitness is associated with improved executive functioning in people with MS.” Canadian researchers have found, “Exercise may have beneficial effects on both well-being and walking ability in multiple sclerosis (MS). Exercise is shown to be neuroprotective in rodents and may also enhance cognitive function in humans. It may, therefore, be particularly useful for MS patients with pronounced neurodegeneration… “Patients with progressive MS and moderate disability were randomized to one of three exercise interventions (arm ergometry, rowing, bicycle ergometry) for 8-10 weeks or a waitlist control group… Significant improvements were seen in aerobic fitness. In addition, exercise improved walking ability, depressive symptoms, fatigue and several domains of cognitive function. This study indicated that aerobic training is feasible and could be beneficial for patients with progressive MS. Larger exercise studies are needed to confirm the effect on cognition.” As discussed in MSAA’s Winter/Spring 2013 issue of , one of the best ways to maintain cognition is to do your best to avoid new lesions by taking a disease-modifying therapy (if you have a relapsing form of MS). A number of studies with these drugs have shown some benefit on protecting cognition. Twelve disease-modifying therapies are now approved for use by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for relapsing forms of MS. Please visit MSAA’s website at for specific information on these approved therapies. People with MS and MS clinicians have hoped that medications such as those that help people with Alzheimer’s disease might also benefit people with MS. Some of the Alzheimer’s disease medications work to block the enzyme that breaks down the nerve signal messenger acetylcholine. Although early reports suggested that the medication Aricept® (donepezil) might help cognition in MS, more thorough research has not proven this drug to be of benefit. Additional studies of the Alzheimer’s medications Exelon® (rivastigmine) and Namenda® (memantine HCl) also did not demonstrate a clear benefit. Some side effects may include stomach or bowel problems, mood changes, and urinary difficulty. Others had hoped that the herbal extract ginkgo biloba would be of benefit, however, preliminary studies have not demonstrated a benefit. Many other supplements are often promoted to help memory in the general population, but hard data is very limited even for people without MS. Be sure to discuss any drugs or supplements you may be taking with your healthcare team. Treating fatigue may reduce its effects, but does it help memory? This is a difficult area to study due to the difficulties in measuring and documenting cognitive changes, as well as the subjective nature of fatigue management. Small trials of amantadine (previously Symmetrel®) used for fatigue have not been convincing for cognitive improvement. The medication Provigil® (modafinil) and Nuvigil® (armodafinil) are commonly used “off label” for MS fatigue and have also been used by some with attention disorders. Ampyra® (dalfampridine), studied in the 4-aminopyridine form also did not demonstrate improvement. Management of fatigue by both pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic means may be tried by some, and may include occupational therapy for energy-conservation techniques.” Several medications are currently being evaluated for the treatment of cognitive dysfunction in MS. Many of the approved DMTs have ongoing studies to determine their effectiveness in reducing cognitive challenges. Other medications and supplements are in study phases as well. To view current studies in this area of research and possibly look into participating in a clinical trial, readers may visit and search for “cognition and MS” for a full listing of related studies. This area of work is showing much potential for improvement in cognitive symptoms. Investigators and clinicians are able to address each type of dysfunction with various approaches to help people improve or compensate for any cognitive challenges they may experience. Cognition covers several different areas or patterns of function. In general, these categories include: attention, memory, acquisition and retrieval, information-processing speed, and executive function. The type and severity of cognitive dysfunction that an individual with MS experiences is largely dependent upon lesions occurring in certain regions of the brain, as well as areas of brain atrophy. Both the number of lesions (referred to as lesion load or burden) and atrophy (the shrinking of tissue or decrease in activity) are identified through neuroimaging techniques, such as a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). As mentioned earlier, a great deal of research continues to identify the specific areas of the brain that are affected by MS and lead to cognitive problems. Some studies have shown that brain atrophy, both regionally and globally, may contribute more to cognitive issues than the number of lesions. Noting that several areas of the brain may be affected, the effects of MS are thought to be widespread, and as a result, cognitive symptoms may be varied. For this reason, cognitive rehabilitation specialists must conduct an extensive evaluation of their patients prior to and throughout the time they are in cognitive therapy. This enables the specialists to design the most appropriate treatment plans for their clients, and to revise these plans as needed throughout the rehabilitation period. An assessment or evaluation of the individual seeking treatment will include many important details, such as which types of neurocognitive symptoms (such as memory-retrieval problems) and neurobehavioral symptoms (such as reduced awareness and problem-solving issues) he or she is experiencing. Additional details include test data, background information from the patient’s neurologist or other treating physician, and historical information providing details about the individual prior to diagnosis. The cognitive rehabilitation specialist will also note the patient’s reactivity to emotional concerns, as well as other symptoms that may have an impact on cognition (such as fatigue and pain). Identifying one’s abilities and preferences, along with learning about how he or she performs at school or at work, and in social situations, are also important while creating a customized treatment plan. Some of this information may be obtained through the family members and other individuals who are close with the patient. These people can also provide updates, letting the therapist know how the individual is doing in terms of applying the strategies and if any additional issues have been noted. Additional testing may be required to help with the treatment plan. An occupational therapist may assess an individual’s ability to perform activities of daily living. A speech-language pathologist may look for any deficits in areas of communication. Learning what the person with MS is able to do and what problems he or she may have is critical to the initial assessment. Many of the techniques used for cognitive rehabilitation and retraining in MS originated with those used to assist individuals with traumatic brain injury (TBI). While the two conditions differ in many ways and the severity of symptoms can vary greatly within either disorder, the same theories may be applied to the similar challenges of cognitive dysfunction. Whether the goals are to provide prompts that help with memory, to clear away distractions to increase attention, or to create more structure to improve executive function – or all three, along with many other strategies – these types of treatment plans are vital to improving one’s cognitive performance and ultimately increasing one’s quality of life. Senior Research Scientist, Center for Assistive Technology and Environmental Access at Georgia Tech Member, MSAA Healthcare Advisory Council What type of therapist(s) can assist with the diagnosis and treatment of cognitive issues with MS? “When an individual with MS is experiencing some type of cognitive dysfunction, he or she would most often contact a clinical psychologist, neuropsychologist, occupational therapist, and/or speech-language pathologist.” In general, how often might someone need to see a therapist, and does insurance usually pay for such appointments? “It really depends on the focus of treatment, but most often cognitive rehabilitation works best when people participate on a frequent basis. The challenge in providing services is that it mostly results in few options for insurance coverage. Most insurance companies do not cover cognitive rehab services for people who experience deficits as a result of a non-acute neurological condition, including chronic diseases such as multiple sclerosis (and others such as congestive heart failure, autism, cerebral palsy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or post chemotherapy). The research on the effectiveness of cognitive rehabilitation for MS that is used for coverage determination with most of the insurance companies reflects that it is experimental or that it does not have enough evidence to demonstrate medical necessity.” Do you have any personal thoughts or guidance that you would want to give anyone with MS who may be experiencing cognitive issues? “I would recommend for the individual to have a discussion with his or her medical provider first to review the list of medications to determine the impacts these may have on cognitive function. The medical provider can also discuss other potential sources of cognitive issues, such as nutritional deficits, poor sleep habits or sleep disorders, stress, etc. Individuals should be sure to talk with their medical provider before trying any alternative supplement that promises improvement in memory or other cognitive function. People experiencing cognitive issues should still try to maintain social connections and outlets that keep them mentally active and challenge their memory, attention, language, and problem-solving abilities.” Although occasional forgetfulness, difficulties recalling specific names, or losing things is fairly common, real problems with memory and learning can become a huge hurdle in accomplishing tasks, succeeding at school or work, and even accomplishing activities of daily living. For some people with MS, the ability to sift through several ideas and identify the most important ones becomes significantly affected. These individuals may then be greatly challenged to recognize what needs to be remembered and then be able to store this information so it is easily retrievable when details need to be recalled. One of the best methods for improving memory is to take notes; the value of doing so can’t be overstated. Notes should be taken wherever and whenever information needs to be remembered – and this can include doctor appointments, school and work, at home, and while performing various activities such as shopping or attending meetings. The notes should be well-structured and kept in the same location, so they can always be immediately accessed. Developing a system is important to make note-taking a part of the routine, and prompts should be included for both taking and reviewing notes regularly. Using a Day Planner-type of booklet or smartphone is ideal for keeping things organized. Dividing the information into smaller sections and practicing by re-reading and/or reading aloud helps to better store the information and enable one to retrieve the information when needed. When information cannot be processed quickly, many functions such as social interactions and day-to-day activities are affected. Having a conversation can become labored and uncomfortable; trying to follow directions can at times be almost impossible; and having to think of more than one or two concepts at the same time can lead to frustration and confusion. Fortunately, people who experience reduced information-processing speed may take steps to help minimize the effects of this type of dysfunction. Consciously increasing one’s attention on the task, on the person speaking, or on whatever the event may be, while reducing any distractions, are good first steps (strategies for improving attention are noted in the next section). Another helpful tip is to take notes and ask questions – when appropriate – to assist with comprehension and understanding. Additionally, using different forms of communication to reinforce the same information can also assist with speedier comprehension and retrieval. This might include seeing things visually (through attending an event, as well as viewing videos, charts, outlines, etc.), hearing the information presented either in person or on a recording, and written information, which includes asking people to email main points as a follow-up to a lecture or reviewing notes from the event. Without the ability to focus and provide uninterrupted attention, one’s ability to listen, learn, and retain information is immediately compromised. Perhaps the most important strategy for improving attention is to reduce or eliminate any distractions. This may be accomplished by looking at the area where attention is needed and evaluating potential distractions. Whether they consist of sight or sound – necessary steps should be taken to reduce or eliminate these diversions. Examples include cleaning away extra clutter from a room, reducing the number of people present during a gathering, and/or turning off the TV and other electronic devices. Earplugs or headphones may also be used if needed to reduce noise or other competing distractions. Sometimes people have thoughts that interfere with attention to the matter at hand. With this type of distraction, a good plan is to write down any ideas that might be monopolizing one’s thoughts and try to set them aside to focus on at a later time. Attention may also be improved through identifying, organizing, and scheduling tasks and activities. This type of cognitive rehabilitation enables someone to perform daily functions efficiently and minimize how often he or she needs to shift attention to switch directions or return to repeat an action. Instruction on how to become better organized and step-by-step plans on how to start and complete projects are key strategies for improving one’s ability to employ good judgement and be able to solve problems efficiently. Structuring one’s schedule with reasonable timing to complete different projects can help to avoid becoming overwhelmed with everything that needs to be done. To reduce the pressure of working under a tight deadline, individuals may want to double or triple their estimate of time required, just to avoid any extra stress. This is partly due to the fact that people with MS sometimes feel that their sense of time is diminished, and duties might be more time-consuming due to fatigue and other factors. Scheduling time to work when interruptions are at a minimum is also important. Individuals with MS who experience problems with executive function need to be flexible with their schedule. While staying on track is worthwhile, people with MS need to be prepared for changes in symptoms that may disrupt their plans for the day, week, or potentially longer. Even when not experiencing any type of changes in symptoms, schedules should be regularly re-evaluated and revised as needed. Individuals should also be aware of their own physical limits as well as the fact that they may be more easily distracted now than prior to their diagnosis. Individuals with MS who are experiencing cognitive difficulties may benefit greatly by staying aware of their limitations and continually learning new ways to counter the effects of this challenging symptom. Through the knowledge that cognitive issues could be slowing them down, causing frustration and forgetfulness, as well as other implications, individuals may be empowered by regularly learning and employing new techniques. Doing so can lead to a better quality of life and even greater success with their endeavors. Furthermore, relationships may become more positive as plans are put into place to counter any problem areas. Other urgent responsibilities, such as taking one’s medications at the correct times and dosages, may be more closely followed through planning, organization, and the added attention the individual knows is necessary. When asked about cognitive problems experienced by people with MS, MSAA Chief Medical Officer Jack Burks, MD, reflects on the many challenges that some individuals with MS may face while coping with this often unexpected symptom. At the same time, he is pleased to explain that several proven strategies, as well as new and emerging therapies, are becoming available, all of which may provide the help needed to counter these types of symptoms. Dr. Burks explains, “Many people with MS tend to focus on their physical challenges and minimize or deny their cognitive issues, although they may realize some difficulties at work, at home, or with social interactions. Their adherence to MS medications may also suffer. “When finally evaluated by neuropsycho-logical testing, they are often surprised by the degree of difficulties they experience during the tests. They often believe that if they look and feel ‘pretty good,’ drive safely, get satisfactory job performance evaluations, and can handle their checkbook, they must not be cognitively impaired. Once the problem is identified, they are initially upset. However, after they learn how to deal with the issues, they are relieved by the ability to accomplish even more. “The bottom line is that cognitive problems may exist… but so do many opportunities and strategies that are available to help people perform their cognitive tasks. This article provided insights into the enormous research efforts related to MS cognition and ideas to improve one’s daily living skills. Additionally, we are learning that MS disease-modifying therapies may also help MS cognition, which is good news of course for individuals with relapsing forms of MS. However, some medi-cations are now being studied for cognition in individuals with progressive forms of MS, which is certainly good news for individuals with this type of MS as well.” Cognitive rehabilitation and retraining offers many valuable strategies for achieving goals and attaining optimum quality of life. With this in mind, anyone who believes that he or she may be experiencing changes in cognitive function is encouraged to consult his or her neurologist about the potential benefits that this type of therapy may provide.

To date, none of the published results support a relationship between CCSVI and MS.  Jerry S. Wolinsky, MD University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston Houston, Texas Using a comprehensive approach, this team first attempted to replicate the ultrasound methods used by Dr. Zamboni in people with all major clinical types of MS, compared with people in various non-MS control groups. Then, they sought to determine whether the findings could be validated by noninvasive imaging techniques, such as an MRI machine using a powerful magnet. The team included experts in MS, as well as experts from other fields such as vascular disease and venous imaging.   RESULTS The team’s findings lend no support for altered venous outflow dynamics as common among MS patients, nor do they likely contribute to the disease process. They studied 276 people: 206 with MS and 70 non-MS. Overall, 82 subjects (29.7%) fulfilled 1 of 5 NS criteria proposed for CCSVI; 13 (4.7%) fulfilled 2 criteria required for diagnosis, and none fulfilled >2 criteria. CCSVI as defined by Zamboni criteria was present in 7.14% of non-MS and 3.88% of MS patients, a difference that is not statistically different. No significant differences emerged between MS and non-MS for extracranial or intracranial venous flow rate.   Publication: “Chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency: case-control neurosonography results.” Andrew D.

The team studied 61 people with MS (4 with CIS; 28 with relapsing-remitting MS; 19 with secondary-progressive MS; 10 with primary progressive MS) and 20 people without MS (15 healthy and 5 with other neurological conditions). Ultrasounds were performed by trained technicians who were “blinded” as to whether the participants had MS or not. Using strict interpretations of CCSVI, the team found that 21% of the MS group met two or more criteria and 20% of the non-MS group met the criteria. This difference between groups was not statistically significant. Using more broad interpretations of CCSVI, the team found that 36% of the MS group met CCSVI criteria and 40% of the non-MS group met the criteria. The difference between the groups was not statistically significant.     Publication: ""No Association of Chronic Cerebrospinal Venous Insufficiency with Multiple Sclerosis.""

This study uses an MRI scanner to generate highly detailed images of the head and neck veins in 112 people with early and later MS, 56 controls without MS, and 56 people with other neurological conditions. The team is also measuring the rate at which blood flows in the veins.   RESULTS The team used three different imaging techniques in a large group of people with MS, people without MS, and people with other neurological diseases. This study tested the CCSVI hypothesis with three complementary imaging techniques (Doppler ultrasound, four-dimensional flow magnetic resonance imaging and contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance venography. They found no significant differences between test groups in terms of stenosis, and no link or causal relationship between internal jugular venous stenosis and MS.

Dr. Banwell, a noted expert in pediatric MS, assembled a team to study CCSVI in pediatric MS patients – a population where the disease process is at a very early stage, and where advanced age and other health conditions that might affect blood flow did not exist.   RESULTS In 2013 the team published results of its study which found no difference in arterial and venous blood flow rate between 26 adolescents with MS and 26 age-matched controls without MS. Additional findings with similar conclusions were published in 2014.   Publication: “No evidence for impairment of  hemodynamics in children or young adults with pediatric-onset multiple sclerosis.” Laughlin S, Macgowan CK, Traubici J, Chan K, Khan S, Arnold DL, Marrie RA, Banwell B.

Project Title: “Determining the relationship between CCSVI and MS” Fiona Evanne Costello, MD, FRCP Hotchkiss Brain Institute Faculty of Medicine, University of Calgary Calgary, Alberta Dr. Costello’s team examined a cross-section of 120 people with MS compared to 60 healthy controls, seeking linkages between vein abnormalities and different aspects of MS activity and tissue damage.   RESULTS The team published results in 2014. They detected no differences in the proportion of venous outflow abnormalities -- as measured by ultrasonography or gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance venography -- between 120 people with MS and 60 controls without MS. This study also revealed significant methodologic concerns in the proposed diagnostic criteria for CCSVI.   Publication: Validity of the diagnostic criteria for chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency and association with multiple sclerosis.

Project Title: “Chronic Cerebrospinal Venous Insufficiency in relation to Multiple Sclerosis” Carlos Torres, MD The Ottawa Hospital Ottawa, Ontario Dr. Carlos Torres led a team employing powerful MRI and Doppler ultrasound technology to explore vein anatomy and look for iron deposits in the brains of 50 people who have MS and 50 age-matched healthy volunteers.   RESULTS The team published results in 2016, finding that asymmetry of internal jugular veins (IJVs) appeared in 75% of the people they studied, regardless of whether they had MS or not. They found that stenosis (narrowing) and asymmetry of the IJVs was present in people without MS. Overall, they determined that their findings do not support the theory of CCSVI.   Publication: Extracranial Venous abnormalities: A true pathological finding in patients with multiple sclerosis or an anatomical variant?

Unique to this study is the inclusion of family members, such as identical twins of MS patients who have not developed MS, in control groups.   RESULTS The team published findings in 2013 suggesting no association between CCSVI and MS. They found that CCSVI occurs rarely in both people with MS and in people without MS. They also reported that extracranial venous narrowing of greater than 50% was a frequent finding in people with MS, unaffected siblings, and unrelated healthy controls.   Publication: Prevalence of extracranial venous narrowing on catheter venography in people with multiple sclerosis, their siblings, and unrelated healthy controls: a blinded, case-control study.

Doctors at are experts at identifying the different types of multiple sclerosis, or MS, in children. This chronic disorder of the central nervous system leads to damage in the brain and spinal cord. It is considered to be an autoimmune disorder, meaning the body’s immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue. In MS, the immune system attacks the protective coating of nerves, called the myelin sheath, throughout the central nervous system. Scar tissue called sclerosis—or lesions—forms at the sites of the damaged myelin. This disrupts nerve impulses traveling to and from the brain and spinal cord. The resulting neurological symptoms vary from person to person, depending on the amount of damage to the myelin and the part of the central nervous system that is affected. Although MS most commonly occurs , it can also affect children and teens. Approximately 2 to 5 percent of people with MS begin to experience symptoms before age 18. Symptoms and Causes of Multiple Sclerosis in Children No one knows what causes MS, though experts believe that genetics and environmental factors play a role in its development. Whereas the genetic factors related to MS are very complex, the risk of a child being diagnosed with MS is somewhat increased if the child has several family members who have the disease. No two people with MS experience exactly the same symptoms. In addition, symptoms can change or fluctuate over time. Some people may have tremors, fatigue, and muscle tightness, also called spasticity. Others may have sudden vision loss or paralysis, which may be temporary or permanent. MS can also cause forgetfulness or difficulty concentrating, as well as problems with bladder and bowel function. The symptoms of MS in children are similar to those in adults, but younger children are more likely than adults to have difficulty with balance and coordination of movements. Some develop numbness, and others have itching or irregular sensations, such as a “pins and needles” feeling or burning pains in the arms and legs. Most of these symptoms are the direct result of damage to the myelin in the central nervous system, which is why doctors consider them to be the main symptoms of MS. Secondary symptoms can arise from neurological changes. Bladder dysfunction, for example, may cause an increase in urinary frequency. This can lead to a child needing frequent bathroom breaks. Another frequent symptom is fatigue, which can interfere with daily activities. The times when a child experiences new, abrupt MS symptoms are referred to as relapses, or flare-ups. These can be followed by a period when the child does not have symptoms, which is called remission. By tracking the course of the condition over time, doctors can determine which type of MS is affecting your child. The first time a child experiences neurological symptoms that last at least 24 hours and are determined to be caused by inflammation and damage to the myelin sheath, this episode, or “attack,” is known as a clinically isolated syndrome. These attacks are the same as those that occur with MS, but a diagnosis of MS is not made until there are at least two attacks. Some children may experience only one attack and not go on to develop MS. Depending on the results of testing, such as an MRI scan, our doctors can determine if your child is in the early stages of MS and likely to experience another attack. If symptoms recur, the condition is then referred to as relapsing-remitting MS. Children with relapsing–remitting MS have attacks that alternate with periods of remission. When symptoms appear, it’s described as a relapse. The child is considered to be in remission when symptoms subside, with or without treatment. Most children are diagnosed as having relapsing-remitting MS. Typically, symptoms develop over the course of days and then spontaneously improve over weeks or months. Relapses can occur at any time, even after years of remission. Children often experience more frequent relapses than adults who have early MS, but they usually enter remission more quickly. Heat, fever, infection, fatigue, and stress can increase the severity of symptoms. The severity of a child’s symptoms may change from day to day, and even from hour to hour. Each of these variations in symptom severity is not considered to be a relapse. A symptom must last for more than 24 hours to be considered a relapse. As they age into adulthood, children with relapsing-remitting MS may transition into secondary-progressive MS. This is when the disease begins to progress more steadily, without alternating periods of relapse and remission. Adults usually transition to secondary-progressive MS about 7 to 10 years after diagnosis. However, children with MS transition more slowly, entering this stage about 20 years after diagnosis. With the availability of MS therapies, this transition may be even further forestalled. Primary-progressive MS is when the condition’s neurological dysfunctions occur without relapses or remissions. Children are almost never diagnosed with this form of MS. If a child experiences the onset of progressive neurologic dysfunction without relapse, it might not be MS but another disorder.

Multiple Sklerose: Kognitive Defizite haben hohe Relevanz für den Alltag Multiple Sklerose: Kognitive Defizite haben hohe Relevanz für den Alltag Dtsch Arztebl 2017; 114(37): [12]; DOI: 10.3238/PersNeuro.2017.09.15.02 Der Erhalt der kognitiven Leistungsfähigkeit stellt eine der Herausforderungen bei Patienten mit multipler Sklerose dar. Immunmodulatorische Arzneimittel und nichtpharmakologische Maßnahmen können einen positiven Einfluss haben. Neben den klassischen physischen Symptomen, die im Rahmen einer multiplen Sklerose (MS) auftreten, existieren „verborgene Symptome“, zu denen kognitive Veränderungen, Fatigue und emotional-affektive Aspekte wie Depression und Angststörungen zählen. Die Betitelung als „verborgen“ oder „soft“ führt oftmals zu Irritationen, sind diese Beeinträchtigungen doch für die Patienten oftmals zentral und deutlich sichtbar. Mittlerweile gilt es als unbestritten, dass sich die Trias „Fatigue, Depression/Angst und kognitive Störungen“ stark negativ auf die Lebensqualität betroffener Patienten und ihre Berufsfähigkeit auswirkt () . Verborgene Symptome der MS und ihr Einfluss auf Lebensqualität und Berufsfähigkeit Eine kürzlich erschienene Studie zum Einfluss der kognitiven Leistungsfähigkeit auf den Grad der Arbeitsfähigkeit konnte sehr deutlich zeigen, dass die Arbeitsfähigkeit eine direkte Funktion der kognitiven Leistung ist. Dieser Effekt blieb über verschiedene kognitive Domänen hinweg stabil, sodass dieser enge Zusammenhang als gesichert angesehen werden kann (). Ein weiteres starkes Argument dafür, die Kognition im Rahmen der MS als gewichtig anzusehen, lässt sich aus der jüngsten Publikation zur Schätzung der Kostenbelastung durch MS in Europa ableiten (). Hier zeigt sich sehr deutlich, dass Kognition neben Fatigue einen wesentlichen Beitrag zur Belastung leistet, da diese Symptome von Beginn an unabhängig vom Behinderungsgrad präsent sein können und die Produktivität der Patienten negativ beeinflussen. Die Folgekosten in Anbetracht der Betroffenheit oftmals noch sehr junger Patienten sind enorm und schließen vor allem häufige Arbeitsausfälle und Frühverrentung ein. Es sei daher bereits an dieser Stelle betont, dass eine Sensibilisierung seitens der behandelnden Ärzte (vor allem Neurologen und Hausärzte) für die unsichtbaren Symptome dringend angezeigt ist, um durch den Einsatz frühzeitiger Immun- und symptomatischer Therapie das kognitive Netzwerk so lange wie möglich funktionstüchtig zu halten. Die kognitiven Veränderungen bei Patienten mit MS fokussieren sich auf 3 wesentliche Bereiche: kognitive Verlangsamung (Einschränkung in der Informations­verarbeitungs­geschwindig­keit), Beeinträchtigungen der exekutiven Funktionen (z. B. eingeschränktes Multitasking, eingeschränkte mentale Flexibilität). Als hat sich die herausgestellt. Diese Verlangsamung lässt sich oftmals bereits zum Krankheitsbeginn mit sensitiven Testverfahren objektivieren und führt häufig dazu, dass auch andere kognitive Teilleistungen in Mitleidenschaft gezogen werden. Zudem ist eine gute kognitive Geschwindigkeit in unserer Hochleistungsgesellschaft von besonderer Bedeutung: Wer in kurzer Zeit viel leistet und dabei noch eine gute Qualität abliefert, hat beruflichen Mitstreitern etwas voraus. Wer aber für eine gute Qualität doppelt so viel Zeit benötigt, fällt rasch aus dem Rahmen. Letzteres ist genau das, was MS-Patienten nicht selten passiert. Gibt man im testpsychologischen Kontext genügend Zeit, sind die Patienten häufig in der Lage, 100 % Qualität zu erbringen. In zeitgebundenen Testverfahren sieht man häufig ein Scheitern, weil die Quantität einfach in der vorgegebenen Zeit nicht erreicht werden kann. Neben der Verlangsamung treten Probleme der auf, und zwar dahingehend, dass die Aufmerksamkeit nicht anhaltend auf dem gleichen Niveau gehalten werden kann, sondern . Das eingeschränkte Multitasking wirkt sich zudem negativ auf die Leistungsfähigkeit im Alltag aus, da nicht mehr parallel, sondernabgearbeitet werden können. Somit haben die kognitiven Domänen, die bei der MS im Speziellen beeinträchtigt sind, eine hohe Alltagsrelevanz und stellen zu jedem Zeitpunkt der Erkrankung eine beachtliche Belastung für die Betroffenen dar. Zur Evolution der kognitiven Veränderungen über die Zeit liegen nur wenige Daten aus longitudinalen und cross-sektionalen Studien vor. Diese aber sprechen kongruent für eine deutlichere Progression in den ersten 5 Jahren nach Krankheitsbeginn und eine Abschwächung im weiteren Verlauf (, ). In jedem Fall unterscheidet sich der Verlauf sehr deutlich von dem der klassischen neurodegenerativen Erkrankungen. Dies ist ein wesentlicher Punkt in der Kommunikation mit den Patienten, da oftmals die Angst im Vordergrund steht, dement zu werden. Letztere Sorge führt häufig zu einer generellen Ablehnung, den eigenen kognitiven Status erheben zu lassen. Daher ist eine frühzeitige Aufklärung der Patienten hinsichtlich der Entwicklung von kognitiven Teilleistungsstörungen sehr wichtig. Die Frage nach den konkreten Ursachen für das Auftreten kognitiver Störungen bei MS kann nicht mit Sicherheit beantwortet werden. Dennoch haben sich im Laufe der letzten 20 Jahre Hypothesen aus Studienergebnissen ableiten lassen: Zum einen zeigen bildgebende Daten, dass es nicht primär auf die Anzahl der Läsionen in der weißen und grauen Substanz ankommt, sondern vielmehr auf die Lokalisation (, ). Liegen auch nur wenige Läsionen in für die Kognition strategischen Hirnregionen, kann daraus ein kognitives Defizit resultieren. Neben der Lokalisation der Läsionen spielt die Hirnatrophie eine entscheidende Rolle. Es gilt als gesichert, dass das kortikale Gesamthirnvolumen bei kognitiv beeinträchtigten Patienten kleiner ist als bei Personen mit intakter Kognition (). Darüber hinaus gibt es Evidenz dafür, dass eine frühzeitig auftretende atrophische Veränderung in den ersten beiden Jahren nach Diagnosestellung als Prädiktor für einen ungünstigen kognitiven Verlauf in den Folgejahren zu werten ist (). Mit Korrelationskoeffizienten von 0,5 und größer stellt die zum kognitiven Status dar. In diesem Zusammenhang sei explizit auf den Thalamus verwiesen, da es Evidenz dafür gibt, dass MS-Patienten bereits in frühen Krankheitsstadien eine thalamische Atrophie entwickeln können () und dass sowohl Struktur als auch Funktion des Thalamus maßgeblich die kognitive Leistungsfähigkeit beeinflussen (). Aus den kernspintomografisch gefundenen Resultaten lässt sich gesamthaft ableiten, dass sich ein struktureller und funktioneller Schaden negativ auf die kognitive Leistungsfähigkeit auswirkt und therapeutische Ansätze möglichst frühzeitig zum Einsatz kommen sollten, solange das Netzwerk noch Ressourcen zur Kompensation besitzt. Aufgrund der Bedeutsamkeit der kognitiven Leistungsfähigkeit für das Berufs- und Sozialleben der Patienten ist eine regelmäßige angeraten. Diese Dokumentation dient dazu, dem Patienten zum einen zu signalisieren, dass er von seiner Therapie profitiert und auch hinsichtlich der Kognition stabil ist, zum anderen sollte ein sich deutlich verschlechternder kognitiver Status auch immer Anlass dazu geben, die gegenwärtige Therapie kritisch zu überdenken. Ein empfehlenswertes Instrument, um den kognitiven Status im Rahmen der klinischen Routine zu erfassen, ist die (). Sie besteht aus 3 Testverfahren: dem VLMT (verbaler Lern- und Merkfähigkeitstest) () und dem Die Durchführungszeit für die gesamte Screeningbatterie liegt bei circa 20 Minuten. Steht dafür nicht ausreichend Zeit zur Verfügung, empfiehlt es sich, zumindest den SDMT regelmäßig einmal pro Jahr durchzuführen. Die Durchführung nimmt nur 90 Sekunden in Anspruch, und die Aussagekraft des Tests ist dabei äußerst gut. Vor allem das Defizit in der kognitiven Prozessierungsgeschwindigkeit und im Arbeitsgedächtnis kann mit diesem Verfahren sehr zuverlässig erfasst werden. Selbstverständlich ersetzen Screeninginstrumente keine elaborierte neuropsychologische Untersuchung. Sie sollen eher dazu dienen, eine Sensibilisierung für die Kognition zu entwickeln, und können bei deutlich abfallender Leistung im Vergleich zum individuellen Vortest frühzeitig eine kognitive Verschlechterung aufzeigen. Die Behandlung der kognitiven Störungen bei MS ist eine , da es keine wirksame, evidenzbasierte symptomatische Therapie gibt, die jedem betroffenen Patienten empfohlen werden könnte. Zu den verlaufsmodifizierenden Immuntherapien liegen nur wenige Daten zur Kognition vor. Für die Interferone und Glatiramerazetat konnte gezeigt werden, dass sie sich nicht nachteilig auf die kognitive Leistungsfähigkeit auswirken, sondern Patienten unter der Therapie deutlich besser abschneiden als solche unter Placebo (–). Zu Natalizumab liegen Ergebnisse aus 2 Studien vor, die eine signifikante Verbesserung der kognitiven Leistungsfähigkeit in entscheidenden Domänen dokumentieren (, ). Fingolimod und Dimetylfumarat () wirken sich ebenfalls stabilisierend auf die Kognition aus, konnten aber in bisherigen Studien keine klinisch relevante Verbesserung zeigen. Eine solche Verbesserung konnte jüngst eindrücklich für Daclizumab vorgestellt werden. Im direkten Vergleich zum Interferon beta-1a i.m. schnitten die Patienten über einen Zeitraum von 144 Wochen deutlich besser ab. Hinzu kam, dass die Leistung im SDMT nach dem genannten Beobachtungszeitraum als klinisch relevante Verbesserung im Vergleich zur Baseline-Untersuchung zu werten ist (). Zur symptomatischen Behandlung der kognitiven Teilleistungsstörungen muss leider konstatiert werden, dass es keine hinreichende Evidenz für die Wirksamkeit der untersuchten Medikamente gibt, zu denen Modafinil, 4-Aminopyridin, Amantadin, L-Amphetamin, Methylphenidat, aber auch Antidementiva wie Donepezil, Rivastigmin und Memantin zählen (, ). Zu den ist zu sagen, dass sich moderates Ausdauertraining positiv auf die kognitive Leistungsfähigkeit auswirkt und eine Studie zur Frage der Intensität gezeigt hat, dass intensives, moderates und leichtes Training sich gleichsam positiv auswirken. Dies bedeutet, dass Patienten sich durchaus auch körperlich fordern können, sie aber die Trainingsintensität ihrer jeweiligen Verfassung anpassen sollten. Wichtig ist, dass überhaupt körperliche Aktivität durchgeführt wird (, ). Neben sportlicher Aktivität ist auch Hirnleistungstraining eine Maßnahme, von der viele Patienten profitieren (, ). Das Training sollte allerdings spezifisch auf die jeweiligen im Vordergrund stehenden Defizite zugeschnitten sein und nicht einen Rundumschlag darstellen im Sinne von „viel hilft auch viel“. Kognitive Defizite sind ernst zu nehmende Symptome der MS mit hoher Relevanz für den Alltag und die Berufsfähigkeit der Betroffenen. Das Erheben des kognitiven Status sollte bereits im Rahmen der Diagnosestellung erfolgen, um einen Verlauf über die Zeit und einen Vergleich zu einem Ausgangswert bei deutlicher Verschlechterung dokumentieren zu können. Es gibt Evidenz dafür, dass eine frühzeitige Immuntherapie auch als Benefit im Hinblick auf die kognitive Leistungsfähigkeit über die Zeit zu werten ist. Eine deutliche kognitive Verschlechterung kann Anzeichen eines Schubes sein (kognitive Schübe sind keine Chimäre!). Eine deutliche kognitive Verschlechterung (z. B. > 4 Punkte im SDMT) sollte in der Gesamtschau mit anderen Befunden (vor allem MRT) Anlass dazu geben, die bestehende Therapie kritisch zu überdenken. Prof. Dr. phil. Dipl.-Psych.

2098dd21-a88a-4c70-a492-b8d41dc0ac32,"What’s New in MS Research: Highlights from the 2018 ECTRIMS Annual Meeting What’s New in MS Research: Highlights from the 2018 ECTRIMS Annual Meeting For more than three decades, multiple sclerosis (MS) experts from around the world have gathered in a European city each fall to share the results of their research at the annual meeting of the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS). This year’s gathering was held in Berlin, Germany, October 10-12, where the findings were presented from hundreds of studies on topics ranging from the safety and effectiveness of investigational medications to the role of diet in controlling symptoms of MS. Along with the annual meetings of organizations such as the American Academy of Neurology (AAN), the Americas Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ACTRIMS), and the Consortium of Multiple Sclerosis Centers (CMSC), the ECTRIMS meeting is an important forum for researchers and clinicians to compare notes, generate hypotheses, make plans for future research, and discuss how best to translate study findings into improved patient care. This ECTRIMS 2018 research update article highlights more than 30 studies with important implications for people with MS. While these studies represent only a small sampling of the research presented at ECTRIMS, they were selected for their relevance to the current and potential near-term management of MS, and with a view toward addressing a variety of topics. Accordingly, the study findings reported below are organized into eight categories: We hope this information will be of interest and value. For additional information about MS, symptoms, and symptom management, as well as MSAA’s programs and services, please visit or call . Questions for MSAA’s Client Services department may be emailed to . And as always, please note that your healthcare provider remains your best source of information on the medical and overall management of your MS, and should be consulted with any questions you may have or before making any changes to a treatment regimen or other aspects of your approach to living with MS. For readers who are not familiar with study protocol, to follow is a helpful listing that provides a brief explanation of the different clinical trial phases. Phase I studies are primarily concerned with assessing the drug’s safety. This initial phase of testing in humans is done in a small number of healthy volunteers, and is designed to determine what happens to the drug in the human body – how it is absorbed, metabolized, and excreted. Once a drug has been shown to be safe, it must be tested for efficacy. This second phase of testing may last from several months to two years, and involve up to several hundred patients. Phase II studies are often “double-blinded,” meaning that the participants, medical staff, and investigators are not told who is receiving the drug and who is receiving the placebo. In a Phase III study, a drug is usually tested in several hundred to several thousand patients, usually in multiple medical facilities around the world. Phase III studies typically last two or more years. Only after a Phase III study is successfully completed can a pharmaceutical company request FDA approval for marketing the drug. Phase IV clinical trials are conducted after a drug has been approved. Participants are enrolled to further monitor safety and side effects, while evaluating long-term efficacy. Ongoing decline in relapse rate seen in long-term study of Gilenya People with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) who took Gilenya (fingolimod) for five years or more had low rates of disease activity during that period, with gradually decreasing relapse rates, researchers reported. The investigators drew on data from LONGTERMS, an open-label, single-arm, extension study assessing the ongoing safety, tolerability, and efficacy of 0.5 mg of Gilenya in RRMS patients who had participated in earlier clinical trials of the disease-modifying therapy (DMT). The LONGTERMS study evaluated 754 patients. Sixty-seven percent of study subjects were women, and the mean time since MS diagnosis was 4.8 years. The annualized relapse rate in the population declined from 0.26 at one year to 0.16 at five years and to 0.14 for those patients for whom data were available at the 10-year mark. Of the 697 patients for whom five-year data was available, 78 percent were free from confirmed disability progression in the six months prior to assessment. The most common adverse events reported were viral upper respiratory tract infections, headache, and hypertension. The most common serious adverse events were MS relapse, basal cell carcinoma, and pneumonia.  Charting rise in treatment-satisfaction scores with switch to Aubagio Patients switching to Aubagio (teriflunomide) from other disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) showed improvements in treatment satisfaction up to 96 weeks after switching, researchers reported. Investigators drew on data from the Phase III TENERE study extension and the non-interventional TAURUS-MS I study. Both studies employed the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM), which was administered at baseline and every 24 weeks thereafter in the TENERE extension study, and at baseline and at weeks 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 in TAURUS-MS I. More than 650 patients from the two studies switched to 14 mg/day of Aubagio after having been on other DMTs. From baseline (initiation of Aubagio) to week 96, Global Satisfaction scores increased for patients from both studies. The average change from baseline was 9.1 in TENERE and 15.3 in TAURUS-MS I, with both changes being statistically significant. Tecfidera altered composition of gut microbiome in 12-week study  Tecfidera (delayed-release dimethyl fumarate) altered the gut microbiome in relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) patients who took the oral disease-modifying therapy (DMT) over 12 weeks. The gut microbiome – the milieu of bacteria and other microbes found in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract – is a major component of the body’s immune system. Recent research suggests that the composition of the microbiome, as defined by the presence and number of various microbes, may affect the course of MS. In a study involving 36 patients with RRMS, 17 types of microbes were significantly altered in MS patients compared with 165 healthy controls. In particular, people with MS had lower levels of compared to the healthy controls. Twenty-seven of the study participants received Tecfidera, while nine received an injectable DMT. At two weeks, subjects receiving Tecfidera reported a worsening of GI symptoms compared to baseline, but this impact on symptoms was not seen at 12 weeks. Meanwhile, at 12 weeks, the Tecfidera patients had an increased abundance of . Similar alterations were not seen in the participants receiving an injectable DMT. Researchers continue to investigate not only the role of the gut microbiome in MS, but also the impact that individual microbes may have on disease course. As those investigations continue, this study adds to the understanding of the interplay between MS medications and the composition of the microbiome. As the investigators note, “It could therefore be speculated that direct effects on the gut microbiome are part of the therapeutic actions” of Tecfidera. Exploring treatment outcomes in African Americans relative to Caucasian Americans Do treatment outcomes on disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) differ between African Americans (AA) and Caucasian Americans (CA)? A team of researchers posed that question in the context of the widely held view that African Americans often have a more aggressive form of MS than Caucasian Americans, and therefore may require more efficacious therapies.   To find answers, those investigators conducted a retrospective analysis of the CombiRx study, a randomized controlled trial that evaluated combined use of interferon beta-1a and glatiramer acetate in relapsing-remitting MS. The CombiRx study followed patients for three years. Eighty-eight percent of the study’s 1,008 patients identified as Caucasian Americans, and 7 percent identified as African Americans. At the start of the study, the AA participants had worse disability and a higher total burden of brain/spine lesions than CA participants. Once on treatment, however, there was no difference in outcomes between the two groups. While that finding is welcome news, the researchers noted that there is a need to study larger numbers of African-American patients to further explore the relative efficacy of DMTs in the AA and CA populations. They added that research into the causes of disparity in disease burden prior to treatment also is warranted. Support for early initiation of Betaseron in clinically isolated syndrome Starting Betaseron (interferon beta-1b) sooner rather than later in clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) yields benefits up to 15 years after initiation of the disease-modifying therapy (DMT), researchers report. Investigators in the BENEFIT 15 study monitored long-term outcomes in people who had CIS and at least two lesions on MRI that were suggestive of MS. In an earlier, related study, those individuals were randomly assigned to receive Betaseron (early-treatment group) or placebo. After either two years or conversion to clinically definite MS (CDMS), patients in the placebo group were offered Betaseron (delayed-treatment group). Of the 468 participants who had been randomized in the initial study, 261 enrolled in a follow-up study 15 years later. One hundred and sixty one were in the early-treatment group and 100 were in the delayed-treatment group. In the delayed-treatment group, Betaseron had been initiated an average 1.5 years after randomization. The annualized relapse rate in the full analysis set was 0.18 over 15 years. Notably, however, the risk of relapse in the early-treatment group was 19-percent lower than in the delayed-treatment group, and the risk for conversion to clinically definite MS by Year 15 was 31-percent lower. The researchers concluded that their results “support a sustained benefit of early intervention in reducing the risk of relapse and conversion to CDMS.” Tracking the efficacy of interferon beta-1a for up to 10 years With many people with MS now on disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) for several years, there is an increasing focus on the long-term safety and effectiveness of those medications. Researchers recently evaluated the ongoing efficacy of one of the first DMTs, subcutaneous interferon beta-1a, in 1,240 individuals receiving care at four MS centers throughout Italy. (In the United States, subcutaneous interferon beta-1a is available as Rebif.) The primary endpoint of their study was the proportion of patients with no evidence of disease activity (NEDA-3) as measured by clinical relapse, confirmed disability progression, and MRI for brain/spine lesions. Seventy-one percent of the study participants were women, and the participants’ mean age at the start of treatment was 34.6 years. The patients were followed for an average of approximately 7.5 years. Seventy-four percent of patients remained on treatment at two-year follow-up, just under half were still on therapy at the 5-year mark, and 28 percent were on the medication after 10 years of follow-up. At two years, 44 percent of patients did not have evidence of disease activity, while 25 percent were free of disease activity at five years and 19 percent were at 10 years. The researchers concluded that those percentages constitute “further evidence of sustained interferon beta-1a efficacy in modifying the natural course of MS.” Plegridy use in real-world setting consistent with clinical trial findings A post-approval, real-world analysis of Plegridy (peginterferon beta-1a) in 963 patients with relapsing-remitting MS yielded safety and efficacy findings consistent with those from the pre-approval clinical trials of the DMT. The interim analysis from the Plegridy Observational Program included data on 242 newly diagnosed individuals and 721 people who had been diagnosed one year or longer before study entry. The newly diagnosed (ND) patients generally were younger than their non-newly diagnosed (NND) counterparts (mean age 37.7 years versus 46.0 years) and had less disability, but had experienced more relapses in the prior year. Treatment discontinuation rates were similar for the two groups (31 percent for ND patients versus 32 percent for NND patients). The most commonly cited reasons for treatment discontinuation in both groups were adverse effects and lack of efficacy. The most frequently reported adverse effects were redness at the injection site and influenza-like illness. Eighty-two percent of newly diagnosed individuals and 85 percent of those who were non-newly diagnosed were relapse-free up to two years after starting Plegridy.   Glatiramer acetate slows disability progression for up to 10 years Glatiramer acetate, which is marketed as Copaxone and in generic formulations, including Glatopa, showed enduring benefit over the course of 10 years of therapy, making it a cost-effective option for long-term treatment of relapsing-remitting MS, according to British investigators. The researchers drew on clinical data and cost-effectiveness models to assess the impact of glatiramer acetate (GA) on patient health and health-system economics. The analysis included 752 people treated with GA and another 898 people with MS who were not treated. The investigators found that, relative to no treatment, GA use led to a 17-percent reduction in disability progression as measured by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). Further, among people treated with GA, there was only a 1.2-percent difference in Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores in six-year and 10-year data. The study’s authors concluded that the 10-year analysis “continues to support the long-term efficacy of GA in terms of disability, based on EDSS, and utility with no apparent evidence of a waning in treatment effect” making it highly cost-effective based on prevailing prices in the United Kingdom.   Reductions in relapse rate, MRI disease activity after three-to-five years of Ocrevus Two studies of people with relapsing-remitting MS show that use of the disease modifying therapy (DMT) Ocrevus (ocrelizumab) for three-to-five years is associated with reductions in annualized relapse rate (ARR) and several MRI measures of disease activity, according to researchers. The studies followed patients who had participated in the Phase III OPERA I and OPERA II trials that led to FDA approval of Ocrevus. In those 96-week studies, patients were randomized to receive either Ocrevus or interferon beta-1a. Upon completion of the Phase III trials, patients were able to enter an open-label extension study in which they would either continue on Ocrevus, if they had been assigned to receive that medication initially, or switch from interferon beta-1a to Ocrevus if they had been in the comparator group. Among those who received Ocrevus during the initial two-year trial and for three years afterwards in the open-label extension, the annualized relapse rate (ARR) declined from 0.13 in the year before the open-label extension to 0.07 at Year 3 of the extension (or five years, in total, from starting Ocrevus). For individuals who switched from interferon beta-1a to Ocrevus, the ARR decreased from 0.20 in the year before switching to 0.07 at three years post-switch. At five-year follow-up, the proportion of people with clinically defined disability progression was lower in those who had been on Ocrevus for five years than for those who had taken the medication for three years. Meanwhile, in people who switched from interferon beta-1a to Ocrevus, the adjusted number of T1 gadolinium-enhancing lesions on MRI was 0.48 lesions/scan prior to switching medications, and decreased to rates of 0.007, 0.004, and 0.004 after one, two, and three years, respectively, on Ocrevus. Individuals on Ocrevus for the full five-year period maintained low numbers of lesions on MRI. Compared to patients who started Ocrevus after two years on interferon beta-1a, those treated with Ocrevus from the outset had less brain atrophy as measured by whole brain volume, grey matter volume, and white matter volume on MRI. No MRI disease activity in most study subjects after six years on Lemtrada Most people with relapsing-remitting MS who began therapy with Lemtrada (alemtuzumab) after having received subcutaneous interferon beta-1a in a clinical trial were free of MRI indications of disease activity six years after switching medications, researchers reported. The TOPAZ trial followed 143 patients who initially had received subcutaneous interferon beta-1a in the Phase III CARE-MS study. These individuals entered an initial extension study in which they switched to Lemtrada, which was given in doses of 12 mg/day for five days at baseline, and then 12 mg/day for three days 12 months or more later. The participants were then eligible to enter TOPAZ, an additional five-year extension study. In TOPAZ, investigators had the option of giving these patients additional courses of alemtuzumab or another disease-modifying therapy as they thought necessary. Eighty-two percent of the participating patients completed Year 2 of TOPAZ (Year 6 after starting Lemtrada). Fifty-seven percent did not receive an additional dose of Lemtrada or another DMT during those six years. The annualized relapse rate at Year 6 after Lemtrada initiation was 0.19 percent. Further, 69 percent of patients were free of MRI disease activity, and 89 percent did not have new gadolinium-enhancing lesions. Meanwhile, safety results were consistent with those seen in Lemtrada-treated patients in the initial CARE-2 study and its two-year extension. Overall, researchers noted, Lemtrada improved clinical and imaging outcomes in patients who switched to the medication after receiving subcutaneous interferon beta-1a, and those improvements were sustained over six years in the absence of further treatment. Assessing the long-term safety and effectiveness of Tysabri An analysis of more than 6,100 people with relapsing-remitting MS who have taken Tysabri (natalizumab) for several years shows the long-term effectiveness of the medication and indicates that its safety profile remains consistent with ongoing use, researchers reported. Investigators drew on data from the Tysabri Observational Program (TOP) to characterize the Tysabri patient population and assess the medication’s impact on relapses and other measures of MS activity. At the time of the analysis, the program included 6,149 participants. Their median exposure to Tysabri was 38 doses, and median follow-up time was slightly over five years. Fifty-two percent of patients had discontinued the medication. The patients’ annualized relapse rate declined by 89 percent while on Tysabri, from 1.99 prior to starting the medication to 0.21. The greatest reduction was seen in the approximately 10 percent of patients who had not taken another disease-modifying therapy (DMT), but those who had taken one or two prior DMTs saw ARR reductions of 93 percent and 87 percent, respectively. Fourteen percent of these individuals experienced at least one serious adverse effect, with infections/infestations being the most commonly reported issues.   Evobrutinib shows favorable impact on lesion count, relapse rates Evobrutinib, or M2951, is an orally administered compound being investigated as a potential treatment for immune-mediated diseases including MS, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Evobrutinib is an inhibitor of Bruton’s Tyrosine Kinase (BTK), an enzyme that plays an important role in the development and function of immune cells, including B lymphocytes and macrophages. At the ECTRIMS 2018 meeting, researchers announced 24-week results of a double-blind, randomized, 48-week, Phase II study of evobrutinib in patients aged 18 to 65 years with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) or secondary-progressive MS (SPMS) with relapses. In the study, 267 participants were randomized to receive evobrutinib 25 mg daily, 75 mg daily, 75 mg twice daily, placebo, or open-label Tecfidera (dimethyl fumarate 240 mg twice-daily. (The Tecfidera group served as a reference arm in the study, and no formal comparisons were made between people in that group and those receiving evobrutinib or placebo.) The study’s primary endpoint was the sum of T1 gadolinium-enhancing lesions at weeks 12, 16, 20, and 24. The annualized relapse rate (ARR) at 24 weeks was a key secondary endpoint, as were safety assessments. The primary analysis comparing the evobrutinib groups to the placebo group was planned to occur when all randomized patients either reached 24 weeks of treatment or had discontinued the study before that point. Ninety-one percent of patients completed 24 weeks of therapy. The study met its primary endpoint, with patients in the evobrutinib 75-mg once-daily and 75-mg twice-daily groups having significantly fewer gadolinium-enhancing T1 lesions than placebo patients at each time point studied. For weeks 12-24, the mean total of such lesions was 3.85 in the placebo group, 4.06 in the evobrutinib 25 mg once-daily group, 1.69 in the evobrutinib 75 mg once-daily group, and 1.15 in the evobrutinib 75 mg twice-daily group. The evobrutinib 75 mg once-daily and 75 mg twice-daily groups also had greater reductions in the ARR than placebo. No treatment-associated infections or significant reductions in lymphocyte counts were observed in those receiving evobrutinib. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events, occurring in more than 5 percent of patients, included increased liver-enzyme levels in patients receiving 75 mg of evobrutinib twice daily, but these changes were reversible and did not cause symptoms. French study details impact of biotin on disability measure, walking speed   Biotin is a vitamin involved in energy metabolism and fatty acid synthesis, including the activation of an enzyme in myelin synthesis. In the MS-SPI study, a high-dose, pharmaceutical-grade biotin known as MD1003 reversed MS-related disease disability in 13 percent of patients with progressive multiple sclerosis (PMS). To assess the efficacy and safety of MD1003 in a real-world setting, as opposed to in a clinical trial such as MS-SPI, researchers monitored outcomes in primary-progressive MS (PPMS) and secondary-progressive MS (SPMS) patients at a clinic in France. From January 2016 through May 2018, 220 individuals with progressive MS who were receiving care at the clinic in Toulouse, France, received 300 mg/day of the oral medication. At the ECTRIMS 2018 meeting, researchers presented data on the first 91 patients to complete one year of follow-up. Those patients’ mean age at baseline was 59.5 years. Sixty-two percent were females, and 70 percent had SPMS. The mean Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score at baseline was 5.9, and their mean timed 25-foot walk time was 50.7 seconds. At the end of one year of treatment with MD1003, 23 percent of the participants had an improvement in their EDSS score and 23 percent had a 20 percent or greater improvement in the time it took them to walk 25 feet. During the one-year period, 11 percent of patients had active disease, such as a clinically defined relapse, a gadolinium-enhancing T1 lesion on MRI, or both. Researchers said, “This real-world study supports the growing body of evidence that MD1003 is an effective and safe treatment for PMS.”  Gauging the impact of ozanimod on early and advanced relapsing-remitting MS Ozanimod is a once-daily, oral immunomodulator that targets two cell-surface receptors, sphingosine 1-phosphate receptors 1 and 5, suspected of playing a role in multiple sclerosis. The agent was evaluated in two Phase III studies, SUNBEAM and RADIANCE. In SUNBEAM, individuals with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) received ozanimod on a daily basis (either ozanimod HCl 1 mg or 0.5 mg) or a weekly injection of interferon beta-1a for 12 months or longer. In RADIANCE, the participants were randomized to the same treatments, but for 24 months. More than 2,600 people participated in the trials. A post hoc analysis presented at the 2018 ECTRIMS meeting examined how outcomes in SUNBEAM and RADIANCE differed between patients with early RRMS and advanced RRMS. The designation of early MS was based on a composite baseline profile that included three years or less from diagnosis, an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score ≤3.5, and use of one or no disease-modifying therapies (DMTs). The early MS group consisted of 1,392 patients, while there were 1,267 people in the advanced MS group. Thirteen hundred and ninety-two patients were included in the early MS group. Key differences between the two groups at baseline included median years since diagnosis (0.5 years for the early group and 5.7 for the advanced group), median EDSS (2.0 versus 3.5), mean relapses within the last year (1.4 versus 1.2), and mean count of gadolinium-enhancing lesions (1.77 versus 1.67). In both the early and advanced RRMS groups, the annualized relapse rate (ARR) was lower in those who received ozanimod than in patients who received interferon. In the early group, the ARR was 0.149 for those on 1 mg of ozanimod HCI, 0.200 for the ozanimod HCI 0.5 mg patients, and 0.285 for the interferon group. The annualized relapse rates in the advanced RRMS group were 0.217 for ozanimod HCI 1 mg, 0.277 for ozanimod HCI 0.5 mg, and 0.363 for interferon. MRI measures of disease activity also favored ozanimod over interferon. In both the early and advanced RRMS groups, individuals receiving either dose of ozanimod had lower mean numbers of gadolinium-enhancing lesions and new/enlarging T2 lesions at 12 months than patients receiving interferon. Surveying real-world experience with treating MS with rituximab Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody approved by the FDA to treat rheumatoid arthritis and several forms of cancer. Because it depletes B cells, which are key components of the immune system, some neurologists prescribe rituximab to treat MS, although it currently does not have FDA approval specifically for use in MS. Investigators at the University of Colorado’s Rocky Mountain MS Center examined the safety and effectiveness of rituximab in 125 people with MS. The participants had an average age of 44 years and had an MS disease duration of slightly more than 10 years. Seventy-two percent were female; 62 percent had relapsing-remitting MS. With an average follow-up of 40.6 months, most individuals had six or seven rituximab infusions. While on rituximab, 16 percent of participants had infections requiring an emergency department visit, and 11 percent had infections necessitating hospitalization. Thirty-seven percent of patients had an infusion reaction on their first infusion that required interrupting the infusion, but that percentage fell to 14 percent on the second infusion. None experienced an infusion reaction that required hospitalization. Two individuals (1.6 percent of the total) were diagnosed with cancer after starting rituximab. While on rituximab treatment, 5 percent of patients had a clinical relapse, 2 percent had an enhancing lesion on MRI, and – based on detailed analysis – 8 percent of those with available MRI data had a new lesion on T2 imaging. Those findings prompted the researcher to conclude that rituximab appears to be a safe and effective option for long-term MS treatment. Two trials to examine the monoclonal antibody ofatumumab in relapsing-remitting MS Two Phase III trials will assess the safety and efficacy of the human monoclonal antibody ofatumumab relative to Aubagio (teriflunamide) in people with relapsing-remitting MS. Like Ocrevus (ocrelizumab), ofatumumab targets the CD20 marker on the surface of B cells. The identically designed ASCLEPIOS I and ASCLEPIOS II trials have enrolled a combined total of 1,884 patients in 37 countries. Study participants will be randomized to receive either 20 mg subcutaneous injections of ofatumumab every four weeks (following an initial regimen of three 20-mg subcutaneous doses per week in the first 14 days) or 14 mg of Aubagio taken orally once daily. Annualized rate of confirmed relapses is the primary endpoint for both trials. Secondary outcomes include confirmed disability worsening and MRI-related measures. Enrollment for both studies has been completed. Both employ an adaptive design in which study duration is not fixed over a specified period of time but rather is dependent on reaching a pre-specified number of events. Phase II study to explore impact of opicinumab in targeted population Early-phase research into investigational agents often identifies patient groups that have a better response to treatment than other patient types. That was the case in the Phase II SYNERGY study of opicinumab. Opicinumab is a human monoclonal antibody active against LINGO-1, a protein that exercises an effect on the differentiation and regeneration of central nervous system cells. SYNERGY investigated the infused medication’s safety and efficacy as an add-on therapy to disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) in MS. The study found that a patient subpopulation (defined by disease duration and baseline MRI findings) was associated with an enhanced response to treatment. The Phase II AFFINITY trial is following up on those findings by taking a closer look at the impact of opicinumab in that patient population. At the ECTRIMS 2018 meeting, researchers provided an overview of the AFFINITY study’s design and demographics. AFFINITY is a randomized, placebo-controlled trial that will evaluate the efficacy and safety of 750 mg of opicinumab administered intravenously every four weeks compared to placebo as an add-on to DMTs. The trial will last for 72 weeks. The population being studied encompasses people aged 18-58 years with relapsing-remitting or secondary-progressive MS who have had MS for 20 years or less and who have Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores between 2.0 and 6.0. Further, the study’s inclusion criteria specify a clinical relapse in the last four to 24 months or brain MRI evidence of disease activity in the past two years. Because opicinumab is being studied as an add-on therapy, patients must be stable on interferon beta, dimethyl fumarate, or natalizumab for at least six months. Further, the patients must have brain imaging findings indicative of lower myelin content and more preserved tissue integrity in brain T2 lesions. The study’s main endpoint is Overall Response Score, an integrated assessment of disability improvement and worsening based on the EDSS and other measures. The study began in September 2017, and remains open to enrollment. Study investigators noted that AFFINITY is expected to enroll approximately 240 participants at roughly 150 sites in about 25 countries. Cladribine is an oral medication approved for use in several countries for the treatment of relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). It is not approved for that use in the United States. The medication has an unusual dosing pattern in that it is taken for up to 20 days over the course of two years. It also has an unusual mechanism of action: it targets the immune system’s B cells and T cells, leading to a reduction in the total count of those cells followed by a distinct pattern of “reconstitution” as new B cells and T cells are produced. At the ECTRIMS 2018 meeting, researchers presented an update on the safety profile of Cladribine Tablets in people with RRMS who took the medication as a monotherapy (without use of other MS agents at the same time). The study assessed data from three clinical trials and a patient registry, and reported information collected through May 2017. The analysis included data on 923 patients who received cladribine at a dose of 3.5 mg/kg and 641 patients who received placebo. It focused on the incidence of adverse events per 100 patient-years. The cladribine group had an average age of 36.5 years at study enrollment; two-thirds of the cladribine patients were women. The rate of serious treatment-emergent adverse events per 100 patient years through May 2017 was 3.88 for the cladribine group and 2.24 for the placebo group. Adverse events occurring at a higher rate in the cladribine group than in the placebo group included abnormally low levels of lymphocytes (a white blood cell) and serious infections, including serious herpes zoster. Study authors concluded that the updated safety profile “was generally consistent with that from two years prior,” adding, “No new major safety findings were identified in the updated dataset, where patients were followed for up to 10 years.”  Elezanumab: Phase I trial supports the need for larger studies A small, early-stage study of a monoclonal antibody directed at a new target in MS showed the medication to be well-tolerated, but did not demonstrate a clear-cut impact on symptoms, highlighting the need for further testing in a larger population, the study’s authors said. Elezanumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against repulsive guidance molecule A (RGMa), which has been shown to inhibit key processes in neurologic regeneration and functional recovery following inflammation or trauma. A Phase I placebo-controlled, 29-week study randomized 20 people with MS to one of three treatment groups or to a placebo group. Elezanumab was administered intravenously every four weeks for a total of four doses. Patients in the three active treatment groups received an initial “loading” dose followed by maintenance doses of either 150 mg, 600 mg, or 1800 mg of elezanumab. Twenty-five percent of all participants reported headaches. Most individuals receiving elazanumab did not report a clinically significant improvement in, or worsening of, MS symptoms. However, testing showed that as levels of elezanumab in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) increased, levels of free soluble RGMA decreased, while total RGMA (both free and antibody-bound) increased in step with CSF elezanumab exposure. Investigators concluded that, “Additional long-term studies are required to elucidate elezanumab efficacy in a more robust patient population.” Survey results reveal people with multiple sclerosis want more information on preventing brain atrophy Cognitive changes are a common symptom of multiple sclerosis, affecting more than half of those living with the condition. A new survey examines the topic of brain volume loss, known as brain atrophy, in people with multiple sclerosis. The survey, conducted by the Multiple Sclerosis Association of America (MSAA) and sponsored by Celgene, included more than 1,300 people with multiple sclerosis or someone responding on their behalf. Based on the survey findings that were presented at ECTRIMS 2018, maintaining cognitive function is the second most common concern for respondents. Only the prevention of physical disability progression was reported more often (45 percent). The survey findings also suggest that there is a high level of interest in better understanding how brain atrophy may impact disease progression. Sixty-three percent of respondents reported that they have not talked to any member of their medical team about brain atrophy, and only 20 percent reported being moderately or very satisfied with the amount of information available on potential ways to prevent brain atrophy. These study results indicate that additional education on the topic of brain atrophy is an area of interest to the MS community. Global initiative seeks to improve shared decision-making and communication between healthcare professionals, patients, and care partners Navigating Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a global initiative that aims to improve outcomes for people with MS through the global adoption of strategies that optimize therapeutic decision-making. This initiative also aims to improve the way that healthcare professionals, patients, and care partners communicate around benefit and risk in the management and treatment of their disease. In order to better understand the potential barriers to effective communications and shared-decision making, the Navigating MS Steering Committee developed and distributed a survey to MS healthcare professionals and people with MS to identify potential and perceived barriers to successful shared-decision making in MS practice. A total of 73 neurologists, 104 nurses, and 1,184 individuals with MS have responded to the survey. Differences in the perception of neurologists, nurses, and people with MS regarding the adequacy of resources required for successful shared-decision making was demonstrated in the data received. Four main areas of contention were identified: lack of education, resources, time, and variable involvement of the interdisciplinary (healthcare) team. Nurse respondents indicated a perceived proficiency with shared-decision making and adequacy of education and training to fulfil this role. However, 73 percent of people with MS who responded indicated a strong preference for engagement with the neurologist in discussing the benefits and risks of treatment options. There was no clear consensus regarding the degree to which decision-making is accurately a collaborative process within the interdisciplinary team. Half of the nurses stated that the decisions were shared, although people with MS reported a lot of ambiguity and variation in how actively involved they were in the decision-making process. Despite neurologists stating the main barrier to shared-decision making was lack of time, 49 percent of people with MS strongly disagreed that time was a barrier to shared-decision making, with 60 percent of nurses reporting clinic timeframes as adequate. The disagreement in perceptions among clinicians and people with MS demonstrates an ongoing need to educate both healthcare professionals and patients on best practices in adopting a shared-decision making approach to discussions around treatment decisions. The Navigation MS initiative has received funding from Biogen, Celgene, EMD Serono, Genentech, Novartis, and Sanofi Genzyme.  It might seem paradoxical that people who experience fatigue should exert themselves in order to have more energy, but that is exactly what researchers found when conducting a study of 60 individuals with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis and fatigue. The 47 females and 13 males participating in the study had an average age of 30 years and a baseline mean Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) score of 56.7. They were divided into two groups, balanced by age, gender and FSS score. People in the first group walked on a treadmill three times a week for six weeks, with the pace increasing from easy to brisk during each session and the duration of exercise increasing from 10-15 minutes initially to 25-32 minutes by the end of the study. People in the second group did not exercise but instead received amantadine, a medication used to treat movement disorders. While the people who did not exercise had no meaningful change in their FSS scores over the 12-week course of the study, those assigned to the exercise group saw their mean FSS score improve to 35.67 (versus 56.7 for all at the start of the study) at six weeks and to further improve to 29.11 at 12 weeks. The researchers concluded, “A specially designed walking exercise program with gradual increments in time and speed for 12 weeks can improve fatigue in RRMS patients. A long-term follow-up is recommended to verify the maintained effect on such improvement.”  Securing the long-term benefits of activity in MS: “Keep going!” Is the improvement in quality of life typically seen in exercise and activity programs for people with MS sustained after those programs end? That is the question a team of investigators posed in a study of 56 women with MS. Their answer: Yes, over the short term; and no, over the long term. The women, who had an average age of 34.5 years, were divided into groups, with some assigned to exercise and others to engaging in leisure-time activities such as making crafts. The women completed surveys to measure their sleep quality, fatigue, and depression, if any, at the start of the study and at several points afterward. Women in both groups showed improvement in sleep, fatigue, and depression at the end of the study and four weeks after its conclusion. By the 20-week mark after the study, however, MS symptoms had begun to increase, leading the researchers to comment that “continuous exercising appears to be of utmost importance for keeping symptoms of depression, fatigue, and sleep disturbances stably low.” There is growing evidence that diet plays a role in the MS disease course, but researchers continue to debate how best to study the issue in a scientifically rigorous manner. One practical concern is whether sufficient numbers of people with MS will be able to adhere to restrictive diets long enough for studies to yield valid results. A six-month pilot study involving 36 women with MS provides encouraging news in this regard. The study assigned 18 of the women to the intervention group – and to following a restrictive, modified Mediterranean diet for six months. The women in this group participated in training sessions with a nutritionist and attended monthly meetings to assess and encourage their adherence to the diet. The other 18 participants acted as a control group; they participated in educational seminars. All 18 women in the intervention group completed the study, with a 90.3-percent mean self-reported rate of adhering to the study diet. At the time of the ECTRIMS meeting in early October, 14 of the 18 women in the control group had completed the six-month study, three more were on track to finish in the weeks just ahead, and there was only one anticipated drop out. Sixteen of the 18 women in the intervention group reported that their overall health had benefited from following the study diet, with 14 women reporting benefit in terms of specific MS symptoms. The intervention group subjects also showed greater improvement than the women in the control group on measures of fatigue and MS impact. The researchers concluded, “It is feasible to enroll MS patients into a rigorous dietary intervention study requiring significant commitment and randomization and reasonable to expect high adherence to this type of dietary program utilizing educational methods to promote adherence.” They added, “Larger-scale clinical trials to assess the role of diet for symptom management and even as a disease modifier in MS are feasible and warranted.” Exploring the impact of a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet on MS The benefits of a ketogenic diet – a high-fat, low-carbohydrate eating plan – have long been promoted by some people with MS and their physicians, while others have said that there has not been adequate research to support the approach. A recent pilot study sought to add to the knowledge base on the subject by assessing how following a ketogenic diet for six months affected 20 people with relapsing-remitting MS. Researchers reported that no subjects experienced worsening diseases – as assessed by clinical symptoms and brain MRI – while on the diet. Further, fatigue and depression scores improved from baseline, and body-mass index and insulin levels declined. While additional data is being collected, those findings prompted the investigators to conclude that ketogenic diets appear to be “safe, feasible, and well-tolerated” in people with relapsing-remitting MS. Despite the old saying, misery doesn’t actually appear to love company  The more social support a person with MS enjoys, the less pain is likely to interfere with his or her life – even as the intensity of pain increases. That is the bottom-line finding of a study involving 196 people with MS who reported experiencing pain. Study participants had an average age of almost 54 years; 82 percent were women and 18 percent were men. Researchers assessed the participants’ degree of social support, pain intensity, and pain interference at the start of the study and again after an average of roughly 3.5 years. As would be expected, as the intensity of pain changed, so did the extent to which pain caused interference in a person’s life. However, the study also found that “higher levels of perceived social support [are] associated with subsequent improvements over time in pain interference in individuals with MS and pain, even when controlling for changes in pain intensity.” In simpler language, the more friends, family members, and other meaningful relationships a person has in his or her life, the less he or she will experience interference from pain, even when the pain is intensified. Conversely, the investigators found that “lower levels of social support prospectively predict increases in pain interference.” Commenting that their findings “are consistent with other research indicating multiple health benefits from the presence of social support,” the study’s authors noted the importance of investigating means to enhance such support for people with MS who are experiencing pain. Pain and sleep issues are top reasons for cannabis-based product use in people with MS Roughly one in five people with MS surveyed by researchers at a Canadian hospital reported using cannabis-based products (CBP) on a regular basis, with pain and sleep problems as the most commonly cited reasons for use. Investigators at the University of British Columbia MS clinic distributed surveys on CBP use to 600 patients attending the clinic from January to March 2018. Two hundred and fifty-nine participants completed and returned the survey. Seventy-five percent of the respondents were female, and the most common age range of respondents was 45 to 55 years. Sixty-one percent of respondents reported never using CBP, and another 16 percent said they rarely did so. Of the remainder, 15 percent reported daily use, 4 percent said they used CBP weekly, and 3 percent said they used CBP on a monthly basis. Researchers noted that responder bias might cause overestimation of CBP use. Seventy-one percent of regular CBP users said they sought relief from pain with a cannabis-based product. Help with sleep also was cited by 71 percent of respondents. Other reported reasons for use included mood (44 percent), spasticity (40 percent), tremor (11 percent), and bladder dysfunction (9 percent). Ninety-five percent of regular users said they had obtained relief of symptoms from CBP. More than half (52 percent) had discussed their CBP use with a neurologist; 35 percent had not tried other symptomatic medications. With the increasing liberalization of state laws regarding use of cannabis-based products for both medical and recreational purposes, CBP is likely to be an increasingly accessible option for more and more people with MS. Reassurance on use of DMTs in women pursuing pregnancy “How will this medication affect my ability to conceive, and to deliver a healthy baby?” It’s a question MS clinicians hear frequently when talking with women of child-bearing age about starting a disease-modifying therapy (DMT). A recent retrospective analysis by Israeli researchers provides reassuring news with regard to this important concern. The investigators examined data on 125 women with relapsing-remitting MS who had a total of 219 live births between 2002 and 2017. They divided the women into three groups: those who were not treated with a DMT in the three months prior to becoming pregnant; those who were treated in the three months prior to pregnancy; and those who were treated during pregnancy. After adjusting for factors including age, disease severity, and known fertility problems, the researchers found that use of DMTs shortly before and during pregnancy did not affect fertility or pregnancy outcomes. They found no significant differences between women in the three groups in terms of the need for fertility treatment and time to pregnancy, pregnancy outcomes, complications during pregnancy, or incidence of relapses during pregnancy or in the first year following delivery. The investigators concluded, “The decision regarding DMTs treatment in RRMS patients during child-bearing years should not be influenced by the question of pregnancy in the near future.” However, treatment discussions along with pregnancy planning should always be discussed with one’s healthcare team in advance. Additionally, none of the DMTs have been approved by the FDA for use during pregnancy and certain DMTs may present more of a risk than others. Sexual dysfunction common in women with clinically isolated syndrome   More than one-half of women with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), a common precursor to MS, experience sexual dysfunction. That is the main finding of a small study in which Egyptian researchers gathered data from August 2011 to June 2017. Noting that sexual dysfunction has been reported in between 40 percent and 80 percent of women with multiple sclerosis, the investigators sought to determine the frequency of the condition in CIS. They had 43 women with CIS complete the Multiple Sclerosis Intimacy and Sexuality Questionnaire (MSIQ-19), as well as instruments assessing fatigue, cognitive function, anxiety, and depression. Fifty-six percent of the women reported at least one manifestation of sexual dysfunction. Eight cited a lack of sexual interest or desire, five reported less intense orgasms, and four said they experienced inadequate vaginal lubrication. Beyond those primary aspects of sexual dysfunction, women also reported that symptoms of CIS – such as urinary and bowel problems and difficulty with concentration – interfered with their sexual function. Lack of confidence about sexuality and fear of rejection also was reported to contribute to sexual difficulties. Fatigue and depression were significant predictors of sexual dysfunction. Further, women who reported sexual dysfunction were older than those who did not report such difficulties (27.5 years versus 23.1 years), but the two groups did not differ in terms of occupation, educational level, or location of brain/spine lesions on MRI. The investigators noted that four patients reported experiencing sexual dysfunction before the emergence of neurological symptoms of MS. As researchers continue to “fill in the gaps” on the many facets of CIS, this study points to the importance of patients talking frankly with clinicians about the full range of issues they may be experiencing. Is menopause a turning point for MS disease course? Relapse rates declined but disability increased in the years following menopause among 148 women with relapsing forms of MS, suggesting that “natural menopause could be a turning point to a less inflammatory, progressive phase of disease,” according to researchers. Those findings and conclusions are from an observational study conducted at 16 MS centers across Italy. Women were followed for a period of roughly 3.5 years before and after natural menopause, meaning menopause not brought about by surgical removal of the ovaries. Ninety-three percent of the women received disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) during that period. The annualized relapse rate (ARR) for the women declined from 0.22 before menopause to 0.13 following menopause. However, their scores on the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) increased from a median of 2.0 at menopause to 2.27 two years later and to 2.46 four years after menopause. On the EDSS, an increasing score reflects increased disability. The investigators noted that the findings are in keeping with the results of earlier research they have conducted with a smaller group of women. The impact of endocrine (or hormonal) factors on MS is a focus of considerable research, and studies such as this one suggest avenues for further investigation, while also helping clinicians and patients better anticipate changes that may await across one’s lifespan.  Promising results for stem cell therapy in “aggressive MS”  Clinicians long have faced a challenge in treating “aggressive MS” – a term used when one’s MS is marked by frequent relapses and rapid progression of disability. An international study presented at the ECTRIMS 2018 meeting offers hope that removing, treating, and re-infusing a patient’s own hematopoietic (blood-tissue forming) stem cells may be a safe and effective first-line therapy for this uncommon but extremely debilitating type of MS. The study involved 20 patients treated in the United Kingdom, Sweden, Canada, Italy, and the United States. None had received more than three months of standard DMT treatment before undergoing autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, or AHSCT (with autologous signifying that the cells came from the patient, rather than from a donor). The patients, who ranged in age from 19 to 52 years, had a median EDSS score of 6.5 prior to treatment. They were followed for a median time of 30 months after transplantation. The median improvement in their EDSS score from pre-treatment to last follow-up was 2.5, which was a statistically significant difference. None had a clinical relapse following transplant. Three patients had new lesions on MRI at their first follow-up visit, but no other new or gadolinium-enhancing lesions were seen on later scans. The investigators reported that, “There were routine toxicities, but no treatment-related mortality.” The researchers added that the study results demonstrate the potential role of AHSCT as a first-line treatment for aggressive MS. Additional studies will continue to provide answers on the potential benefits and risks of this intriguing experimental treatment. Low immunization rates against respiratory disease in people with MS Pneumonia and influenza pose serious threats in the setting of MS, but more than 70 percent of people with MS in an Argentine study had not been vaccinated against either illness, researchers reported. The investigators noted that age, smoking, severe disability, and use of immunosuppressive medications all increase the risk of respiratory infections, adding that people with MS have a risk three-times higher than that of the general population for contracting community-acquired pneumonia. Against that backdrop, the researchers conducted an online survey of 220 people with MS and 62 healthy controls. The proportion of people not receiving either the pneumococcal pneumonia or influenza vaccine was high in both groups – 71.4 percent of people with MS and 79 percent of the healthy controls. Among the unvaccinated patients with MS, 80 percent were on a DMT medication, 31 percent smoked or had only recently stopped smoking, 22 percent were aged 50 years or older, and 11 percent had severe disability. The investigators concluded that the low vaccination rates combined with the high prevalence of risk factors among MS patients underscores the need to develop consensus policies on immunization in people who have MS. Impact of magnetic stimulation on balance in people with MS Using a coil held over a person’s head to direct magnetic stimulation to the brain improved balance and walking ability in people with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and a related movement disorder, according to a group of Egyptian researchers. The investigators studied 43 people with RRMS and truncal ataxia, a condition that can diminish balance and the ability to walk. In the first phase of their study, half of the participants received actual magnetic stimulation while the other half received a sham treatment. In the study’s second phase, all subjects received 12 sessions of magnetic stimulation over four weeks every third month, for a total of 48 sessions. Each session lasted several minutes. The Berg Balance Scale (BBS) and 10-Minute Walk Test (10MWT) were used to measure the impact of treatment, with patients assessed before, during, and at the completion of treatment. The researchers reported that from the pre-treatment baseline to the last session, participants saw a 36-percent improvement in the 10MWT and a 46-percent improvement in BBS score. These individuals also saw improvement on an imaging assessment of white matter in the brain. The investigators said that the adverse effects of treatment were mild and transitory, with two people reporting nausea, two experiencing dizziness, and three having headaches. Based on these findings, the researchers said that non-invasive, high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation has a long-term beneficial effect on improving balance in people with MS and ataxia.

Following cell surface binding, ocrelizumab selectively depletes CD20-expressing B-cells through antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, complement-dependent cytotoxicity and apoptosis. The precise mechanisms through which ocrelizumab exerts its therapeutic clinical effects in multiple sclerosis are not known but involve immunomodulation through the reduction in the number and function of CD20-expressing Bcells. Components of MS pathology potentially affected by this mechanism include reductions in: auto-antigen presentation, secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, production of autoantibodies, and formation of meningeal lymphoid follicle-like structures. Ocrelizumab affects cell types in the middle of the B-cell lineage, including pre-B cells, mature and memory B cells, but not lymphoid stem cells or plasma cells. The capacity for B cell reconstitution and preexisting humoral immunity are thought to be preserved. The average half-life of ocrelizumab in the body is approximately 28 days. Following administration, B-cells are rapidly depleted and can remain undetectable for a prolonged and variable period of time ranging from 6 months to more than 12 months. Q: How can we apply prior experience with rituximab? Significant anecdotal off-label experience with rituximab has accumulated in large MS centers around the world including the Mellen Center, for treating both MS and neuromyelitis optica (NMO). Uncontrolled case series have reported excellent efficacy and safety when rituximab has been used to treat MS. Though ocrelizumab targets the same immunologic mechanism and is administered in a similar fashion to rituximab, ocrelizumab is a different antibody. In vitro characterization of ocrelizumab demonstrated enhanced antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and reduced complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) as compared with rituximab. Ocrelizumab binds to a different, but overlapping, epitope of the extracellular domain of CD20 as compared with rituximab. As of March 2017, ocrelizumab is FDA approved to treat relapsing and primary progressive forms of MS. Ocrelizumab is an infrequently administered intravenous medication, given in the outpatient (office or hospital-based infusion room) setting. In Phase III studies of RRMS, ocrelizumab was administered as follows: Followed by ocrelizumab 600mg IV x 1 every 6 months In a Phase III study of ocrelizumab in PPMS, total dose and frequency was similar to the above protocol except follow-up doses every 6 months were divided as 300mg IV each separated by 14 days. The efficacy of ocrelizumab was demonstrated in two double-blind, double-dummy, Phase 3 studies (OPERA I and OPERA II) evaluating the efficacy and safety of ocrelizumab vs IFN beta1a SC in adult patients with RRMS. In those studies, treatment with ocrelizumab significantly reduced the relapse rate vs IFN beta-1a by 46% in OPERA I (p<0.0001) and by 47% in OPERA II (p<0.0001). Ocrelizumab treatment also significantly reduced the time to onset of disability progression vs IFN beta-1a, and suppressed new T2 lesions (by 77% in OPERA I and 83% in OPERA II) and gadolinium-enhancing lesions (by 94% in OPERA I and 95% in OPERA II). We do not anticipate restricting use of ocrelizumab to patients who have experienced breakthrough disease on other disease modifying therapies. Ocrelizumab was evaluated for efficacy in PPMS in a randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled Phase 3 trial (ORATORIO). A total of 732 patients were randomized to receive ocrelizumab 600 mg IV or placebo every 24 weeks. Treatment with ocrelizumab significantly reduced the risk of progression of clinical disability sustained for ≥12 weeks (as measured by the Expanded Disability Status Scale) by 24% compared with placebo (p=0.0321). Ocrelizumab also significantly reduced the risk of progression of clinical disability sustained for ≥24 weeks by 25% vs placebo (p=0.0365). Subgroup analyses of patients in ORATORIO with (n=193) vs without gadolinium-enhancing lesions (n=533) at baseline showed that efficacy tended to be stronger in patients with baseline gad enhancement (HR for disability progression 0.65, 95% CI 0.40, 1.06) than without gad enhancement (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.62, 1.13). This result is consistent with the results of other disease modifying therapies tested in PPMS, the common theme of which is that younger patients and those with evidence of active inflammation in the form of new T2 or gadoliniumenhancing lesions are the most likely to benefit from therapy. Q: What are the major adverse effects of ocrelizumab: The most common adverse events observed in the Phase III studies of ocrelizumab were mildto-moderate infusion-related reactions. The incidence of adverse events, including serious infections, was similar between ocrelizumab and placebo. Particular events of interest: Mild to moderate infusion reactions were observed in approximately 25% of patients at the time of first infusion. Moderate infusion reaction was defined as requiring minor local or noninvasive management (usually additional medication or change in infusion rate). The incidence of infusion reactions decreased substantially with subsequent infusions in the clinical trials (to 10% or less). Infusion reactions may typically include itching. Severe infusion reactions (requiring urgent medical management) occurred very rarely in the clinical trials. Ocrelizumab must be administered in physician office or inpatient setting by nurses who have experience and qualification to infuse the drug, under supervision by physicians who have experience managing infusion reactions. The rate of common infections was similar between ocrelizumab and placebo or Rebif, with upper respiratory infection, nasopharyngitis, urinary tract infection, occurring each up to 15% of the time in ocrelizumab vs. 10% of the time in the placebo group. No opportunistic infections were identified. Ocrelizumab should not be utilized in patients with active acute or chronic infections. Ocrelizumab might reactivate Hepatitis B infection. For this reason checking for Hepatitis B infection prior to initiating ocrelizumab is important. Neoplasms occurred rarely across all treatment arms in all 3 Phase III clinical trials. The rates of events overall are consistent with what is expected in an MS patient population. Breast cancer occurred in 6 of 781 females treated with ocrelizumab and none of the 668 females treated with interferon beta 1a or placebo. Longer-term data are required to effectively assess the impact of ocrelizumab on rates of malignancy. We recommend patients adhere to usual age-appropriate malignancy screening recommendations. Infusion reactions are expected related to the mechanism of action of ocrelizumab (cytolysis), and those standard infusion reactions may be differentiated from those with features of mast cell or basophil activation (signifying potential progression to anaphylaxis). Features such as itching cannot be used to differentiate between the two. Patients who develop a non-life-threatening mild to moderate SIR can usually be managed by temporary discontinuation of drug infusion alone. Once all symptoms have resolved, most patients will tolerate a slower infusion rate (one-half the rate at which the reaction occurred) with additional antihistamines plus acetaminophen. Patients with even mild symptoms of mast cell/basophil activation (eg, urticaria and dyspnea) should in most cases not resume infusion or be retreated, because reexposure to the causative agent could result in a fulminant and severe anaphylaxis. No definitive guidance is available on the effect of ocrelizumab on pregnancy. Theoretically, the drug could pass to the fetus and have an effect on the fetus. We will counsel woman to use effective contraceptive methods while on ocrelizumab and wait at least 5 months (based on the half-life of the drug) since their last ocrelizumab infusion before attempting to conceive. Q: Should we monitor CD19 counts in a patient on ocrelizumab? We do not expect to routinely monitor B-cell (CD19) counts in patients receiving ocrelizumab or altering the administration schedule based on CD19 counts. The return of B-cells may affect some patients’ abilities to receive other therapies after ocrelizumab, so checking CD19 counts may occasionally be useful to monitor the return of B-cells after treatment. Q: Is any routine monitoring required for patients on ocrelizumab? We routinely check MRI scans of the brain at least every 12 months in patients on therapies for both safety and efficacy monitoring. Q: Is PML a concern in patients treated with ocrelizumab? Although no cases of PML related to ocrelizumab have been reported in MS patients, the experience is limited to patients enrolled in clinical trials. There have been cases of PML reported in association with rituximab therapy in other diseases including rheumatoid arthritis. In addition, there may be other rare complications of rituximab in MS patients which has not yet been recognized. Live vaccines should be avoided for patients within 6 months of any ocrelizumab infusion, potentially longer based on B-cell reconstitution. Because rituximab may reduce the generation of new antibodies, the efficacy of vaccines is probably reduced during rituximab therapy. Therefore, clinically indicated vaccines should be given one month or more before starting rituximab. If vaccines are needed during rituximab treatment, they ideally should be given about 1 month prior to the next treatment course. An ongoing study will assess the effectiveness of standard vaccines in patients being treated with ocrelizumab. Kappos L, Li D, Calabresi PA, et al.

Multiple-Sklerose-Register in Deutschland Multiple Sclerosis Registry in Germany – Results of the Extension Phase 2005/2006 Dtsch Arztebl 2008; 105(7): ; DOI: 10.3238/arztebl.2008.0113 ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; Unter Federführung der Deutschen Multiple Sklerose Gesellschaft (DMSG), Bundesverband e.V. wurde 2001 ein flächendeckendes MS-Register eingerichtet. Ziel war es, epidemiologische Daten zur Zahl an multipler Sklerose (MS) erkrankter Menschen, zur Verlaufsform der Erkrankung und zur Versorgungssituation in Deutschland zu erhalten. Nach Abschluss der zweijährigen Pilotphase wurden der Basisdatensatz modifiziert und neue Zentren rekrutiert. Diese Zentren erhoben zwischen 2005 und 2006 insgesamt 5 821 Datensätze. Nach einer zweistufigen Qualitätskontrolle konnten 5 445 Datensätze (93,5 %) ausgewertet werden. Im Durchschnitt dauerte es 3,5 Jahre, bis die Diagnose gestellt wurde. Mehr als 70 % der Patienten wurden immuntherapeutisch behandelt. Demgegenüber wurden symptomatische Therapien wesentlich seltener verordnet. Zum Stichtag 31. Dezember 2006 nahmen 57 Zentren am MS-Register teil: 29 Akutkliniken, 11 Rehabilitationskliniken, 13 Schwerpunktpraxen und 4 regionale MS-Zentren. Das MS-Register liefert wertvolle Informationen über die Versorgungssituation von MS-Patienten. Diese Daten liefern die Grundlage für gezielte Maßnahmen zum Ausgleich von Unter- und Fehlversorgung und tragen dazu bei, die Lebenssituation von MS-Patienten zu verbessern. Dtsch Arztebl 2008; 105(7): 113–9 DOI: 10.3238/arztebl.2008.0113 multiple Sklerose, Register, Epidemiologie, Datenbanken, Therapie, Erwerbsfähigkeit Die multiple Sklerose (MS) ist eine chronisch-entzündliche Erkrankung des zentralen Nervensystems. Sie ist die Erkrankung, die im jungen Erwachsenenalter am häufigsten zu einer dauerhaften Behinderung führt. In Deutschland sind schätzungsweise 120 000 bis 140 000 Patienten davon betroffen; die genaue Zahl ist nicht bekannt. Ebenso wenig weiß man über die Verteilung auf die einzelnen Verlaufsformen oder den Schweregrad der dauerhaften Behinderung (). Trotz der hohen volkswirtschaftlichen Bedeutung mit Krankheitskosten von 40 000 Euro pro Patient und Jahr () ist die Versorgungssituation von MS-Patienten nur unzureichend bekannt. Deshalb ist auch unter gesundheitsökonomischen Aspekten und im Hinblick auf den zielgerichteten Einsatz begrenzter Ressourcen ein flächendeckendes Register wünschenswert. Eine systematische Erhebung existiert für Deutschland bisher nicht. Aus diesem Grund wurde unter Federführung der Deutschen Multiplen Sklerose Gesellschaft (DMSG), Bundesverband e.V. im Jahr 2001 ein MS-Register initiiert, das Querschnittsdaten zur Häufigkeit der Erkrankung und deren Unterformen in Deutschland liefern soll. Ferner erhofft man sich Aufschluss über die Verteilung innerhalb der einzelnen Schweregrade, den Einfluss der Erkrankung auf die Berufs- und Arbeitsfähigkeit und die Versorgung mit immunmodulierenden, symptomatischen und nicht medikamentösen Therapien. Nach der zweijährigen Pilotphase, an der 3 223 Patienten () teilnahmen, werden nun die Ergebnisse der Extensionsphase präsentiert. In der Pilotphase wurden alle MS-Patienten eingeschlossen, die in der Zeit vom 7. Januar 2002 bis 31. Dezember 2003 in den teilnehmenden Zentren behandelt wurden und die nach ausführlicher Aufklärung einer zentralen Auswertung des erhobenen Basisdatensatzes schriftlich zustimmten. Die Art der Datenerhebung, -speicherung und -auswertung erfolgte gemäß den aktuell gültigen Datenschutzbestimmungen der Bundesländer. Beteiligt waren 5 Zentren mit besonderer Erfahrung in der Betreuung von MS-Patienten, die unterschiedliche Versorgungsstufen und geografische Gegebenheiten aufwiesen und verschiedene Regionen Deutschlands repräsentierten (). Basierend auf den Erfahrungen der Pilotphase wurde die Eingabemaske () modifiziert. Dabei wurden Parameter entfernt, wenn sie entbehrlich schienen, oder ergänzt, wenn sie unvollständig waren, und präzisiert, wenn die Eingaben missverständlich aufgefasst werden konnten. Damit war der Basisdatensatz zum einen verschlankt, zum anderen aber auch ausreichend präzise und eindeutig. Das vollständige Erhebungsinstrument ist bei den Autoren erhältlich. Die Dokumentation erfolgte vor Ort in den Zentren durch die behandelnden Ärzte. Zur zentralen Qualitätskontrolle und Auswertung wurden die Datensätze pseudonymisiert und alle 3 Monate auf Datenträger zur MS-Forschungs- und Projektentwicklungs-gGmbH Hannover (MSFP) gesandt. Dort wurden Vollständigkeit (Alter, Geschlecht, Behinderungsgrad und Diagnosesicherheit) und Inkonsistenzen überprüft und auffällige Datensätze zur Korrektur zurückgegeben. Doppelte Datensätze, die im Erhebungszeitraum entweder in einem Zentrum mehrfach (Längsschnittuntersuchung) oder in mehreren Zentren konsekutiv (zum Beispiel bei akut-stationärer und nachfolgender rehabilitativer Behandlung) erhoben wurden, konnten anhand eines eindeutigen Schlüssels sicher identifiziert werden. Für die Querschnittsanalyse wurde nur der jeweils letzte Datensatz verwendet. In der zweijährigen Pilotphase wurden 3 458 standardisierte Basisdatensätze dokumentiert, von denen nach der Qualitätskontrolle 3 223 (93,2 %) für die weiteren Analysen verwendet werden konnten (). Seit dem 15. März 2005 nehmen kontinuierlich neue Zentren am Register teil. Zum Stichtag 31. Dezember 2006 hatten 57 Zentren ihre Bereitschaft zur standardisierten Dokumentation erklärt (). Von 35 Zentren wurden bisher insgesamt 5 821 Datensätze erhoben (). Nach der Qualitätskontrolle standen 5 445 Datensätze zur Verfügung (93,5 %). Die übrigen teilnehmenden Zentren lieferten die Daten erst nach dem Stichtag, sodass diese für die Auswertung noch nicht berücksichtigt werden konnten. Da nicht alle Datensätze bezüglich aller Parameter komplett waren, ergeben sich für die einzelnen Auswertungen unterschiedliche Bezugsgrößen. Das durchschnittliche Alter (± Standardabweichung) zum Zeitpunkt der Erhebung betrug 44,2 ± 11,5 Jahre, im Mittel waren die Patienten 12,7 ± 9,2 Jahre erkrankt. Das Alter bei Krankheitsbeginn war 31,4 ± 10,2 Jahre (7 bis 75 Jahre), überwiegend manifestierte sich die MS zwischen dem 20. und 40. Lebensjahr (70 %), trat aber auch bei 9 Patienten erstmals vor dem 10. Lebensjahr (0,2 %) und bei 44 Patienten nach dem 60. Lebensjahr (0,9 %) auf. 4,9 % der Patienten erkrankten erstmals nach dem 50. Lebensjahr. Bei der Diagnosestellung waren die Patienten 34,8 ± 10,7 Jahre alt. Damit dauerte es durchschnittlich 3,4 ± 5,5 Jahre, bis die Diagnose „MS“ gestellt wurde. Dieser Zeitraum war auch bei Neudiagnosen ab dem Jahr 2000 nahezu unverändert (3,6 Jahre). Frauen waren 2,5-mal häufiger betroffen als Männer (72 versus 28 %). Ein schubförmiger Verlauf war bei 55 % zu verzeichnen, 32 % litten an einer sekundär chronisch-progredienten Verlaufsform, und 9 % hatten von Krankheitsbeginn an einen chronisch-progredienten Verlauf. Bei 1 % handelte es sich um eine Erstmanifestation. Der klinische Zustand war bei 16,9 % der Patienten im letzten Jahr stabil geblieben, wohingegen 17,1 % mehr als einen Schub beziehungsweise eine rasche Progression aufwiesen. Die Mehrzahl der Patienten (56,0 %) hatte eine langsame Progression beziehungsweise weniger als einen Schub pro Jahr. Die Verteilung der EDSS („Expanded Disability Status Scale“), die international standardmäßig zur Quantifizierung des Behinderungsgrades verwendet wird (), zeigt die . Die mediane EDSS betrug 3,5; 51 % der Patienten waren noch uneingeschränkt gehfähig (EDSS < 4), 28 % benötigten eine Gehhilfe, um 100 m weit zu gehen (EDSS ≥ 6), und 6 % waren ständig auf den Rollstuhl angewiesen (EDSS ≥ 8). Die Wahrscheinlichkeit, einen Behinderungsgrad von 4,0 beziehungsweise 6,0 auf der EDSS in Abhängigkeit vom Lebensalter zu erreichen, ist in dargestellt. Daraus lässt sich beispielsweise ablesen, dass 60 % der Patienten im Alter von 50 Jahren und 40 % der Patienten im Alter von 60 Jahren noch keine Gehhilfe benötigten, um 100 m weit zu gehen. Voll berufstätig waren nur noch 1 183 Patienten (27,9 %), 1 671 Patienten (39,4 %) waren vorzeitig berentet, 6,0 % arbeitslos gemeldet, nur 0,7 % führten MS-bedingt eine Umschulungsmaßnahme durch. Der Anteil der vorzeitig Berenteten war stark vom Lebensalter abhängig (). Die zeigt die Abhängigkeit vom Behinderungsgrad: Es ist auffällig, dass der Verbleib im Erwerbsleben zwar vom Schweregrad der körperlichen Behinderung abhing, aber ein nicht unerheblicher Teil (14,8 %) der vorzeitig Berenteten eine EDSS < 3,5 aufwies, also noch uneingeschränkt gehfähig war. Immunmodulatorische und symptomatische Therapiemaßnahmen 71 % der Patienten wurden immunmodulatorisch behandelt, dabei wurden am häufigsten die Interferone eingesetzt (). Die Eskalationstherapie mit Mitoxantron wurde ebenfalls vergleichsweise häufig angewendet. Andere Therapieoptionen inklusive intravenöse Immunglobuline wurden nur selten genutzt. 670 Patienten (20 %) wurden nicht immunprophylaktisch behandelt, dazu zählten vor allem sekundär chronisch-progrediente Patienten mit langsamer Progression. Allerdings wiesen auch 98 der immuntherapeutisch unbehandelten Patienten (14,9 %) eine rasche Progression beziehungsweise häufige Schübe auf. gibt einen Überblick über die Behandlung häufiger MS-Symptome. Vor allem die schnelle Erschöpfbarkeit („Fatigue“) und kognitive Störungen, obwohl oft vorhanden, blieben größtenteils unbehandelt. Demgegenüber wurden Schmerzen und Depression vergleichsweise häufig medikamentös therapiert. Ein erheblicher Anteil der Patienten, die an Spastik oder Blasenstörung litten, war weder mit medikamentösen noch mit nicht medikamentösen Maßnahmen versorgt. Nach dem erfolgreichen Abschluss der Pilotphase konnte in der nun folgenden zweiten Phase des Projekts die Datenerhebung ausgeweitet und in knapp zwei Jahren 5 445 neue Datensätze registriert werden. Charakteristisch für die MS ist das unvorhersehbare und rezidivierende Auftreten von Krankheitssymptomen („schubförmiger Verlauf“), mit dem bei 90 bis 95 % der Fälle die Erkrankung beginnt. In 5 bis 10 % der Fälle kommt es zu einer schleichenden Verschlechterung insbesondere des Gehvermögens („primär chronisch-progredienter Verlauf“). Nach etwa 10 bis 15 Jahren geht die MS bei 30 bis 40 % der Patienten nach initial schubförmigen Verlauf in die chronische Phase über („sekundär chronisch-progredienter Verlauf“) (). Die vorliegenden Ergebnisse zeigen im Vergleich mit der Pilotphase () einen höheren Anteil chronisch-progredienter Patienten und eine Verschiebung zu höheren Behinderungsgraden. Dieses Resultat dürfte in erster Linie durch die zunehmende Rekrutierung von Rehabilitationskliniken, aber auch niedergelassenen Praxen bedingt sein. Die hier dargestellten Ergebnisse entsprechen denen aus populationsbasierten epidemiologischen Untersuchungen (–) und unterstreichen, dass mit der Ausweitung des Registers zunehmend repräsentative Daten gewonnen werden. Während in früheren Untersuchungen zum natürlichen Krankheitsverlauf 50 % der Patienten nach einer Krankheitsdauer von etwa 15 Jahren auf eine Gehhilfe angewiesen waren, um 100 m zurückzulegen (EDSS 6,0) (, ), deuten neuere Untersuchungen mit einer medianen Zeit von 20 beziehungsweise 29 Jahren bis zur EDSS 6,0 nun eine weitaus günstigere Prognose der MS an (, –). Da der genaue Beginn der Erkrankung oftmals schwer festzulegen ist, ist eine Betrachtung, bei der man die Abhängigkeit des Schweregrades der Behinderung vom Lebensalter zugrunde legt, für die individuelle Beratung der Patienten hilfreicher. Im Alter von 50 Jahren beziehungsweise von 60 Jahren konnten noch 60 % beziehungsweise 40 % der Patienten eine Strecke von 100 m noch ohne Hilfe gehen, vergleichbar den Ergebnissen aus British Columbia, Kanada (). Im MS-Register war ein Großteil der Patienten bereits über mehrere Jahre immuntherapeutisch behandelt, sodass diese prognostisch günstigen Zahlen nicht den natürlichen Krankheitsverlauf, sondern eher den Verlauf unter der derzeitigen Versorgung mit krankheitsmodifizierenden Medikamenten und verbesserten symptomatischen Therapiemaßnahmen widerspiegeln. Trotz verbesserter technischer Möglichkeiten und neuer Diagnosekriterien, die prinzipiell die Diagnosestellung innerhalb eines Monats nach Symptombeginn erlauben (), ist die durchschnittliche Zeit von der Erstmanifestation bis zur Diagnosestellung mit 3,4 Jahren wie in der Pilotphase vergleichsweise lang. Dies betrifft auch die ab dem Jahr 2000 diagnostizierten Patienten. Es bleibt abzuwarten, ob durch die intensivere Aufklärung über Verlauf und frühe Behandlungsmöglichkeiten und mit der weiteren Umsetzung der diagnostischen Kriterien die Diagnose künftig früher gestellt und damit eine längere diagnostische Unsicherheit vermieden werden kann – wie es die Daten des NARCOMS-Register der nordamerikanischen MS-Zentren für andere Länder belegen (). Hier sei besonders an Hausärzte, Augenärzte, Orthopäden und Urologen appelliert, junge Patienten mit nicht eindeutig durch eine periphere Ursache erklärbaren neurologischen Ausfällen rasch einer neurologischen Diagnostik zuzuführen, um bei subklinisch aktivem Verlauf frühzeitig mit der erforderlichen Behandlung beginnen zu können (, ). Nach einer Krankheitsdauer von knapp 13 Jahren bezogen fast 40 % der Patienten bei einem mittleren Alter von 44 Jahren Rentenleistungen aufgrund einer Erwerbsminderung. Nur 28 % der Patienten waren noch in Vollzeit berufstätig. Ähnliche Zahlen sind auch aus anderen Untersuchungen bekannt (, , ) und – wie bei dem höheren Anteil schwerer betroffener MS-Patienten zu erwarten – ungünstiger als in der Pilotphase (). Der relativ niedrige Anteil an Arbeitslosen in der Gruppe der MS-Patienten im Vergleich zu der Arbeitslosenquote von 10 bis 12 % in der Gesamtbevölkerung dürfte widerspiegeln, dass in den Fällen schwerer Vermittelbarkeit bei eingeschränkter Leistungsfähigkeit die Indikation zur Berentung großzügig gestellt wird. Obwohl der Anteil der vorzeitig Berenteten erwartungsgemäß mit dem Ausmaß der körperlichen Behinderung zunahm (, , ), waren immerhin 15 % der erwerbsunfähigen Patienten noch uneingeschränkt gehfähig. Dies bedeutet, dass noch andere Faktoren als die körperliche Funktionseinschränkung für die vorzeitige Berentung verantwortlich sein müssen. Insbesondere kognitive Einschränkungen und die Fatigue-Symptomatik werden mit der EDSS nicht adäquat abgebildet, und gerade diese beiden Faktoren sind wahrscheinlich ein wesentlicher Grund für die eingeschränkte berufliche Leistungsfähigkeit (). Daher ist es dringend notwendig, die Ursachen zu identifizieren, die zum vorzeitigen Ausscheiden aus dem Arbeitsprozess führen und gezielte therapeutische Strategien zu entwickeln, um langfristig die berufliche Leistungsfähigkeit bei guter Lebensqualität zu erhalten (). Eine verlaufsmodifizierende Behandlung wurde – in Übereinstimmung mit der Pilotphase und dem NARCOMS-Register () – bei mehr als 70 % der Patienten durchgeführt. Knapp die Hälfte der Patienten erhielt eine immunmodulatorische Basistherapie (Interferon-b und Glatiramerazetat) nach dem Stufenschema der Multiple Sklerose Therapie Konsensusgruppe (MSTKG) (, , ). Der im Vergleich zur Pilotphase höhere Anteil von Mitoxantron- und regelmäßigen Steroid-Pulstherapien erklärt sich mit dem höheren Anteil chronisch-progredienter Patienten, bei denen diese Therapieformen die einzig verfügbaren Optionen sind. Da Natalizumab erst Mitte 2006 zugelassen wurde, sind bisher nur wenige Behandlungen damit dokumentiert. Andere Immuntherapeutika, auch intravenöse Immunglobuline, wurden nur selten angewendet. Art und Häufigkeit der eingesetzten Substanzen sprechen also dafür, dass die evidenzbasierten Empfehlungen der MSTKG, die mittlerweile in die Leitlinien der Deutschen Gesellschaft für Neurologie übernommen wurden (), tatsächlich im klinischen Alltag umgesetzt werden. Dennoch werden viele Patienten, trotz vorhandener Krankheitsaktivität, das heißt rasche Progression und/oder mehr als ein Schub pro Jahr, nicht immunprophylaktisch behandelt. Noch auffälliger ist die Unterversorgung mit symptomorientierten Therapiemaßnahmen: hier wurden die meisten Patienten, insbesondere bei kognitiven Störungen, Fatigue oder Ataxie, nicht zielgerichtet behandelt. Damit ist für MS-Patienten im Allgemeinen und besonderes im Hinblick auf die Therapie der Symtome (, –) eine deutliche Unterversorgung festzustellen. Die Gründe hierfür sind vielfältig. Eine Erklärung könnte darin liegen, dass Patienten in den Zentren mit der Frage nach einer geeigneten Therapiemöglichkeit vorgestellt wurden und die Behandlung möglicherweise erst nach der Dokumentation geändert wurde, also noch nicht erfasst ist. Hierüber können nur Folgeuntersuchungen Aufschluss geben. Eine andere Schlussfolgerung wäre, dass Patienten, die an multipler Sklerose erkrankt sind, in Deutschland häufiger eine Therapie ablehnen beziehungsweise eine Behandlung frühzeitiger abbrechen als in anderen europäischen Ländern, obwohl sie grundsätzlich indiziert wäre. Daher ist eine umfassende Aufklärung und Beratung über Nutzen und Risiken einer Behandlung und die Vereinbarung realistischer Therapieziele dringend notwendig (). Für einige Symptome der multiplen Sklerose wie beispielsweise Fatigue oder kognitive Störungen gibt es entweder keine eindeutig wirksamen Therapiemaßnahmen oder aber keine Versorgungsstrukturen, die zum Beispiel eine ambulante neuropsychologische Behandlung erlauben würden. Hier besteht dringender Bedarf an weiterer klinischer Forschung, aber auch an strukturellen Anpassungen, um eine adäquate Versorgung von MS-Betroffenen sicherzustellen. Bei der vorliegenden Erhebung wurden nicht nur die Neuerkrankungen registriert, sondern alle Patienten, die im Erhebungszeitraum ein Zentrum aufgesucht hatten. Diese Vorgehensweise ist bei einer chronischen Erkankung wie der multiplen Sklerose mit hoher Prävalenz und vergleichsweise niedriger Inzidenz () sinnvoll, weil gerade zu Krankheitsbeginn eine hohe diagnostische Unsicherheit und starke psychische Belastungen bei den Betroffenen bestehen. Die Erhebung ist nicht populationsbezogen, sondern zentrumsbasiert, sodass ein Selektionsbias vorliegen könnte. Die wünschenswerte, vollständige Erfassung hätte die Teilnahme aller an der Versorgung von MS-Patienten Beteiligten vorausgesetzt und wäre nur mithilfe einer gesetzlichen Verpflichtung wie zum Beispiel in Dänemark möglich. Die mit populationsbasierten epidemiologischen Studien vergleichbaren demografischen Daten lassen aber den Schluss zu, dass die Ergebnisse dennoch repräsentativ für die Gesamtheit der MS-Population sind. Das MS-Register beschreibt nur die Versorgungssituation von MS-Patienten im Querschnitt; Informationen über den Krankheitsverlauf vor Therapieeinleitung liegen nicht vor. Somit können also keine Aussagen über eine differenzielle Wirksamkeit der Therapien getroffen werden. Dies wird erst bei den geplanten Verlaufsuntersuchungen möglich sein. Trotz dieser Einschränkungen liefert das MS-Register wertvolle Informationen über die Versorgungssituation von MS-Betroffenen, die die Grundlage für gezielte Maßnahmen zum Ausgleich von Unter- und Fehlversorgung bilden und so die Lebenssituation von MS-Patienten in Deutschland insgesamt verbessern können. Das deutsche MS-Register bildet die Basis für ein europaweites MS-Register im Rahmen eines von der EU geförderten Projektes, das derzeit in Trägerschaft der Europäischen MS-Plattform (EMSP) durchgeführt wird. Das Projekt wird in Trägerschaft der MS-Forschungs- und Projektentwicklungs gGmbH (MSFP) mit der DMSG, Bundesverband e.V., durchgeführt. Finanziert wird das MS-Register von der Deutschen-Multiple-Sklerose(DMS)-Stiftung, die offizielle Stiftung der DMSG. Die DMS-Stiftung erhält freie Spenden von Privatpersonen, Organisationen und der pharmazeutischen Industrie. Eine Einflussnahme auf die Inhalte der geförderten Projekte erfolgt nicht.

This project aimed at collecting epidemiological data and information on health care provision for MS patients in Germany. Methods: After a 2-year pilot phase, the original sample was modified, and new centers were recruited, resulting in the registration of a total of an additional 5821 patients in 2005 and 2006. Following a 2 stage process of quality control, standardised data sets of 5 445 patients (93.5%) were able to be analysed. Results: Mean duration from onset of disease to diagnosis was 3.5 years. More than 70% of patients received immunomodulatory drugs, whereas symptomatic treatments were less commonly administered. The number of participating centers as at 31. December 2006 was 57 (29 neurological hospitals, 11 rehabilitation units, 13 specialized practitioners, and 4 regional MS centers). Discussion: The MS registry provides valuable data on the health care situation of MS patients, and may help to improve service provision and overall quality life for these patients in Germany.

Unkonventionelle Therapien der multiplen Sklerose: Nutzen unklar Unkonventionelle Therapien der multiplen Sklerose: Nutzen unklar Dtsch Arztebl 2005; 102(30): A-2102 / B-1774 / C-1678 Zusammenfassung Die meisten MS-Patienten setzen unkonventionelle Therapien ein. Vor allem spezielle Diäten werden vielfach angewandt. Der Nutzen dieser Therapien ist unsicher, die möglichen Risiken weitgehend unbekannt. Die Datenlage ist spärlich, es existieren Hinweise auf günstige Auswirkungen ungesättigter Fettsäuren. Die Einnahme von Vitamin D ist mit einem geringeren Erkrankungsrisiko assoziiert. Für eine nach Krankheitsbeginn einsetzende Therapie mit Vitamin D gibt es keine ausreichende Basis. Spekulativ ist die günstige Wirkung einer Zufuhr verschiedener Mineralstoffe, Selen, Antioxidanzien, Fischöl oder Vitamine. Viele Patienten geben eine subjektive Besserung von Spastik, Ataxie oder Schmerzen unter Cannabinoiden an, auch wenn objektive Parameter unverändert bleiben. Die hyperbare Oxygenation zeigte in mehreren Studien heterogene Ergebnisse. Keine dieser Therapiestrategien kann empfohlen werden. Schlüsselwörter: multiple Sklerose, alternative Therapie, Ernährung, hyperbare Oxygenation, Cannabis Summary Alternative and Complementary Therapies in Multiple Sclerosis Most MS patients adopt unconventional therapies, although the scientific evidence is scarce. The efficacy of these therapies is unproven, and possible risks are largely unknown. Frequently, particular diets are used. Possibly, unsaturated fatty acids may prove beneficial. Long-term supplementation of vitamin D is associated with a decrease in the incidence of MS. There is, however, insufficient evidence to indicate the influence of Vitamin D on the course of the disease. The effects of various minerals, selenium, antioxidant compounds, fish oil or vitamins remain speculative. Many patients use cannabis to alleviate spasticity and pain. Hyperbaric oxygenation has been the subject of several studies with heterogeneous results. None of these therapies can be recommended. Key words: multiple sclerosis, alternative therapys, diet, hyperbaric oxygenation, cannabis Zur Therapie der multiplen Sklerose (MS) stehen mit Beta-Interferonen, Glatiramerazetat, Mitoxantron und Corticoiden wirksame Arzneistoffe zur Verfügung. Allerdings führt kein Medikament zu einer Heilung. Die Therapieeffekte sind aber nur moderat, und der langfristige Nutzen ist noch nicht ausreichend untersucht (). Zudem verläuft die Erkrankung auch unter diesen Therapien langfristig oft progredient. Für Subgruppen, insbesondere für Patienten mit chronisch progredientem Krankheitsverlauf, ist die Wirksamkeit dieser Arzneimittel nicht nachgewiesen. Deswegen überrascht es nicht, dass viele Patienten mit unkonventionellen Heilverfahren experimentieren. Aus der großen Zahl der unkonventionellen Therapien, die bei MS angewendet werden (), beschränken die Autoren sich in dieser Übersicht auf Maßnahmen, über die wissenschaftliche Untersuchungen vorliegen oder die zumindest eine rationale Basis haben. Unkonventionelle Therapien Die Abgrenzung unkonventioneller versus konventioneller Therapien ist schwierig. Weder das Kriterium des wissenschaftlichen Wirkungsnachweises noch die Rationalität oder Irrationalität einer Therapie haben eine hohe Trennschärfe (). Zudem beruhen viele konventionelle symptomatische Therapien ebenfalls auf anekdotischer Evidenz und nicht auf großen Therapiestudien (). So ist beispielsweise Physiotherapie zur Behandlung von MS-Symptomen allgemein akzeptiert, obwohl valide klinische Studien über den langfristigen Nutzen fehlen. Die Autoren benutzen die pragmatische Definition der Cochrane Collaboration: „Komplementäre und alternative Medizin ist ein weiter Bereich therapeutischer Ressourcen [. . .] unterschiedlich zu denen des politisch dominanten Gesundheitssystems einer bestimmten Gesellschaft [. . .] Die Grenzen zwischen komplementärer und alternativer Medizin und dem dominanten System sind nicht immer scharf oder festgelegt“ (). Stellenwert unkonventioneller Therapien bei MS-Patienten Unkonventionelle Verfahren werden von den meisten MS-Patienten im Verlauf der Erkrankung eingesetzt (, , ). Dabei sind regionale Gegebenheiten von Bedeutung. So werden zum Beispiel in Nordamerika häufig Gebete eingesetzt (), was in Europa weniger populär ist. In einer deutschen Erhebung gaben 64 Prozent der Patienten an, unkonventionelle Therapien anzuwenden (), vor allem Frauen, schwer Erkrankte und religiöse Patienten. Das wichtigste Motiv der Patienten ist weniger Misstrauen gegenüber der Schulmedizin, sondern der Wunsch, keine Chance zu verpassen und aktiv in den Krankheitsprozess einzugreifen. Die meisten Patienten führen unkonventionelle Therapien in Eigenregie durch, der behandelnde Arzt wird häufig nicht informiert (, , ). Die Effekte der unkonventionellen Therapien werden von den Patienten übereinstimmend als positiv beurteilt. Nebenwirkungen werden selten angegeben (, ). In einer kanadischen Befragung berichteten fünf Prozent der Anwender über Nebenwirkungen, dagegen 72 Prozent über positive Effekte (). Abzuratende unkonventionelle Therapien Weder der Nutzen noch die Risiken unkonventioneller Therapien sind wissenschaftlich gesichert. Allgemein werden unkonventionelle Therapien als risikolos angesehen. Tatsächlich gibt es nur wenige Fallberichte über relevante Nebenwirkungen bei MS (). Erfahrungsgemäß ist es weder sinnvoll noch erfolgversprechend, Patienten, die eine unkonventionelle Therapie durchführen und von ihrer Wirkung überzeugt sind, abzuraten, solange die wissenschaftlich indizierte Therapie weitergeführt wird. Allerdings sind verschiedene unkonventionelle Therapien kostspielig. So kostet zum Beispiel der von der Firma Seviton vorgesehene Jahresbedarf an diversen Nahrungsergänzungsmitteln 2 029,35 Euro (). Das hält viele Patienten aber nicht ab oder motiviert vielleicht sogar, diese und noch weit höhere Summen auszugeben. Die Auswirkungen auf die Lebensqualität sind schwer einschätzbar. Manche Maßnahmen sind aufwendig und teuer, was aber oft nicht als belastend, sondern im Gegenteil als stabilisierend erlebt wird. Abgeraten werden sollte von Therapien, bei denen Komplikationen bekannt sind, die schmerzhaft oder grundsätzlich gefährlich sind. Aufgrund der Gefahr einer Immunreaktion müssen parenterale Behandlungen bei MS kritisch beurteilt werden. Dies trifft insbesondere auf die Frischzellentherapie zu, von der in seltenen Einzelfällen lebensgefährliche allergische Komplikationen bekannt sind (), ebenso auch die gelegentlich bei Ataxie praktizierte Injektion homöopathischer Zerebellumextrakte. Ein Zusammenhang zwischen Quecksilber und MS ist spekulativ. Die schmerzhafte und kostspielige Entfernung von Amalgamplomben ist nicht gerechtfertigt, zumal dabei relativ hohe Mengen Quecksilber freigesetzt werden (). Es gibt kaum Daten über Phytotherapeutika und MS. Wie alle Pharmaka können auch Phytotherapeutika Nebenwirkungen hervorrufen (). Bei parenteraler Anwendung homöopathischer Pflanzenextrakte wurden Fälle einer akuten MS-Variante beschrieben (). Echinaceaprodukte werden trotz negativer Therapiestudien häufig zur Infektabwehr eingesetzt. Da immunstimulierende Wirkungen in vitro nachgewiesen sind (, ), führen viele Hersteller MS als Kontraindikation auf, obwohl klinische Daten hierzu fehlen. Dasselbe trifft für Bienen- oder Schlangengiftinjektionen, hyperbare Oxygenation, Ozontherapie oder Eigenblutbehandlung zu. Diese Behandlungen könnten bei der MS wegen des Risikos allergischer Reaktionen oder der Bildung toxischer Radikale gefährlich sein. Nahrungsergänzungsmittel Zahlreiche Nahrungsergänzungsmittel, die von jedem in den Verkehr gebracht werden können, werden als unkonventionelle Heilmittel eingesetzt. Obwohl Qualität oder Verunreinigungen kaum überprüfbar sind, sind die Präparate in der Regel unbedenklich. Bei niedrigen Herstellungskosten vieler Substanzen und hohen Preise sind die Gewinnspannen groß. Ungesättigte Fettsäuren Es gibt epidemiologische Hinweise auf einen Zusammenhang der MS-Inzidenz mit dem Konsum gesättigter Fette tierischer Herkunft (). In Tierexperimenten wurden immunmodulatorische und antiinflammatorische Effekte mehrfach ungesättigter Fettsäuren, vor allem der w-3-Fettsäuren beobachtet, die bei MS günstig sein könnten (, ). Aus den essenziellen Fettsäuren a-Linolensäure (w-3) und Linolsäure (w-6) werden andere Fettsäuren gebildet, die Vorstufen verschiedener Leukotriene und Prostaglandine sind. Diese Vorgänge sind komplex und unterliegen zahlreichen Regelmechanismen (, ). Die traditionelle Vorstellung, w-3-Fettsäuren (zum Beispiel im Fischöl) wirkten „antiinflammatorisch“ und w-6-Fettsäuren (zum Beispiel Arachidonsäure) „proinflammatorisch“, ist grob vereinfachend (). Ein optimales Verhältnis von w-3 zu w-6 Fettsäuren wird mit etwa 1 : 5 angegeben. In den meisten Industrienationen ist dieses Verhältnis zugunsten der w-6 Fettsäuren verschoben (1 : 15 bis 1 : 19). Die wichtigste w-6 Fettsäure, Linolsäure (zum Beispiel in Sonnenblumenöl) ist in Tiermodellen der MS wirksam (, , , ). Neben epidemiologischen Befunden bildete dies die Basis für drei kleine Therapiestudien mit Linolsäure (, , ). In keiner wurden günstige Effekte auf Schubrate oder Grad der Behinderung nachgewiesen. Eine Metaanalyse ergab allerdings, insbesondere für die Untergruppe der gering behinderten Patienten (EDSS-0-2), ein signifikant positives Ergebnis (). Größere Studien mit Linolsäure wurden – vermutlich wegen des fehlenden kommerziellen Potenzials – nie durchgeführt. Eine Studie mit dem Öl der Nachtkerze (evening primrose), das reich an a-Linolensäure (w-6) ist, zeigte keine positiven Effekte (). Im Vergleich mit w-6 sind w-3 Fettsäuren (zum Beispiel Fischöl) bei MS schlechter untersucht, und die Resultate sind uneinheitlich (). In der Nurses’ Health Study war kein Zusammenhang zwischen Inzidenz der Erkrankung und Konsum von w-3-Fettsäuren erkennbar (). Zwei kleine Pilotstudien (, ) suggerieren positive Effekte von w-3-Fettsäuren auf den Krankheitsverlauf der MS. Die größte und methodisch beste kontrollierte Studie bei 292 Patienten () ergab positive Trends, aber keine signifikanten Unterschiede zwischen Fischöl und Placebo. Demgegenüber können hohe Dosen von w-3-Fettsäuren (> 3g/d) Nebenwirkungen (unter anderem Blutungskomplikationen, Fischgeruch) hervorrufen (). Deswegen sollte eine hochdosierte Therapie mit w-3-Fettsäuren unter ärztlicher Kontrolle erfolgen. Der Nutzen ungesättigter Fettsäuren bei MS ist trotz Hinweisen aus epidemiologischen und experimentellen Studien ungesichert. Die Empfehlung der Deutschen Gesellschaft für Ernährung, den Konsum mehrfach gesättigter Fette einzuschränken und ein bis zwei Fischmahlzeiten pro Woche zu konsumieren, ist schon aufgrund der kardiovaskulären Wirkungen der w-3- Fettsäuren gerechtfertigt (). Für eine zusätzliche Einnahme von Fischölen oder anderen Fettsäurepräparaten gibt es keine Evidenz. Calcium und Vitamin D Seit langem wird über Zusammenhänge der geografischen Verteilung der MS mit Sonnenlichtexposition und Vitamin D spekuliert (). Vitamin D hat vielfältige Effekte auf das Immunsystem und günstige Wirkungen in Tiermodellen der MS (, ). Teilnehmerinnen der prospektiven Nurses’ Health Study, die Vitamin-D-Präparate zu sich nahmen, hatten ein um 40 Prozent geringeres MS-Erkrankungsrisiko (). Effekte einer Vitamin-D-Therapie bei manifester MS wurden hier nicht untersucht. Bei MS-Patienten wird angesichts der hohen Rate an Osteoporose infolge Vitamin-D-Mangel, Inaktivität und Cortisontherapien die Indikation zu einer Prophylaxe mit Calcium und Vitamin D weit gestellt (). Unsicher ist, ob der Krankheitsverlauf dadurch beeinflusst wird. Bisherige Interventionsstudien mit Vitamin D oder Calcium sind klein, methodisch schwach und im Ergebnis widersprüchlich (,). Vitamin B12 Beziehungen zwischen Vitamin B12 und MS werden seit mehr als 50 Jahren angenommen (, ). MS-Patienten haben häufig einen manifesten B12-Mangel (–, ). Jedoch waren zwei kleine Therapiestudien mit Vitamin B12 enttäuschend (, ), sodass es für eine Behandlung der MS mit Vitamin B12 keine rationale Basis gibt. Bei suspekten Symptomen sollte ein Vitamin B12-Mangel ausgeschlossen werden, weil das klinische Bild eines Vitamin B12-Mangels von MS-Symptomen maskiert oder imitiert werden kann (). Selen und andere Antioxidanzien Oxidative Prozesse spielen in der Pathogenese der MS eine wichtige Rolle (). Es werden zahlreiche antioxidativ wirksamer Substanzen von MS-Patienten eingenommen, unter anderem die Vitamine A, C, E, Selen, Coenzym Q, Alpha-Liponsäure oder Anthocyane (zum Beispiel Rotweinextrakte). Die Wirksamkeit bei MS ist spekulativ. Da einige Antioxidanzien immunstimulierende Wirkungen haben, sind auch negative Effekte denkbar (). Deswegen sollte vom Konsum dieser Substanzen abgeraten werden. Als potentes Antioxidans könnte Selen günstige Effekte ausüben. Untersuchungen zur Häufigkeit von Selenmangel bei MS ergaben divergierende Ergebnisse (, , , ). Trotz nachvollziehbarer theoretischer Überlegungen liegen bislang keine klinischen Daten vor, die den Einsatz von Selen rechtfertigen. In einer Therapiestudie mit Selen, Vitamin C und Vitamin E stieg zwar die Aktivität der Glutathionperoxidase in Blutzellen an (), ein Effekt auf den Krankheitsverlauf war methodisch bedingt nicht erkennbar. Epidemiologische Studien zeigten keinen klaren Zusammenhang zwischen Vitamin E und MS-Inzidenz (, , , ). Die Supplementierung mit den Vitamine A, C, und E ist ungefährlich, wenn die empfohlenen Höchstmengen nicht überschritten werden. Klare Hinweise für positive Effekte dieser Vitamine bei MS existieren nicht. Spezielle Diäten Enthusiastischen Erfahrungsberichten zum Trotz wurde ein Nutzen einer bestimmten Ernährung bei MS bisher nicht nachgewiesen (). Fast alle Diäten sind wissenschaftlich nicht untersucht. Erwähnt sind hier nur drei populäre Varianten der zahlreichen „MS-Diäten“. Ausgehend von der Tatsache, dass die MS erst seit der Industrialisierung bekannt ist, spekulierte Evers, dass „denaturierte“, das heißt verarbeitete Nahrung für die Entstehung der MS verantwortlich sei. Die Evers-Diät beruht darauf, jedes Lebensmittel so natürlich wie möglich zu belassen. Gekochte, gebackene, oder sonst in irgendeiner Weise verarbeitete Speisen werden vermieden (). Ernährungsphysiologisch betrachtet handelt es sich um eine Variante der ovo-lakto-vegetabilen Ernährung. Die Einhaltung der Diät ist aufwendig. Wissenschaftliche Daten zugunsten der Evers-Diät liegen nicht vor. Fratzer entwickelte auf dem Boden pathophysiologischer Theorien eine komplexe Therapie, deren zentraler Punkt die Modifikation der Fettzufuhr ist (, ). Daneben werden verschiedene Nahrungsergänzungsmittel verabreicht. Durch eine Änderung der Relation der w-3- zu w-6-Fettsäuren in der Ernährung soll die Produktion von Arachidonsäure und pro-inflammatorischer Zytokine verringert werden. Eckpunkt der Fratzer-Diät ist eine fettarme Kost mit besonderer Beschränkung der Linolsäure (also der Fettsäure, für die die besten Studienergebnisse vorliegen). Auch für die Fratzer-Diät gilt, dass es außer einer Fragebogenaktion () keine wissenschaftlichen Daten gibt. Wichtigstes Ziel der Swank-Diät ist eine maximale Reduktion der Zufuhr gesättigter Fettsäuren (, ). Zusätzlich werden Pflanzenöl und Lebertran eingenommen. 144 Anwender der Swank-Diät wurden bis zu 34 Jahre nachuntersucht (). Bei den Patienten, die sich streng an die Diät hielten, wurden positive Auswirkungen auf die MS beobachtet. Die Studie war weder kontrolliert noch randomisiert, und die Patientenauswahl nicht repräsentativ, sodass diese Studie nicht Basis einer Therapieempfehlung sein kann. Cannabis Anerkannt sind Cannabinoide zur Appetitstimulation bei Tumorkachexie und AIDS sowie bei chemotherapieinduziertem Erbrechen. Cannabinoide vermitteln über spezifische Rezeptoren im Gehirn (CB1) und an Zellen des Immunsystems (CB2) vielfältige Wirkungen, die sich auf Symptome und Verlauf der MS auswirken könnten. Cannabis wird, meist illegal, von MS-Patienten häufig (bis zu 16 Prozent) angewendet (, , ). Bei therapeutischer Anwendung wurden bisher keine bleibenden Gesundheitsschäden bekannt (). Cannabinoide sind bei Tiermodellen der MS und Spastik wirksam (, , , ). Die meisten Therapiestudien sind klein und haben zweifelhafte Bewertungskriterien, die auf der Selbsteinschätzung der Patienten beruhen. Auch ist eine echte Verblindung wegen der psychischen Wirkungen nicht möglich. Eine Trennung von psychischen und somatischen Wirkungen ist bei Symptomen, wie Schmerz oder Allgemeinbefinden schwierig. Placeboeffekte sind wegen des positiven Vorurteils vieler Patienten unvermeidlich. Einzelberichte und kleine Fallserien wiesen auf positive Auswirkungen von Cannabinoiden auf MS-assoziierte Spastik hin (, , ). Zwei kleine (, ) und eine größere randomisierte Studie mit 667 Patienten () zeigten aber keine Änderung der Spastik unter Cannabinoiden. In der CAMS-Studie () verbesserte sich die Gehstrecke, es trat eine subjektive Verbesserung von Schmerz, Schlaf, Muskelspasmen und Spastik ein. Wesentliche Nebenwirkungen waren nicht erkennbar. Insgesamt bestätigt die CAMS-Studie Ergebnisse früherer Arbeiten, dass Cannabinoide hauptsächlich das subjektive Empfinden der Patienten positiv beeinflussen (insbesondere die Schmerzwahrnehmung). Günstige Auswirkungen auf MS-assoziierte Schmerzen wurden auch in zwei weiteren Studien berichtet (, ). In Bezug auf Tremor fand trotz einzelner positiver Berichte (, ) eine kleine kontrollierte Studie keine Besserung unter Cannabinoiden (). Viele Patienten unter Cannabinoiden berichten von einem verbesserten Allgemeinbefinden. Allerdings ist die Wirksamkeit durch kontrollierte Studien nicht belegt. Deshalb können Cannabinoide bei MS nicht allgemein empfohlen werden. Bei einzelnen MS-Patienten mit schweren Symptomen, die auf übliche Maßnahmen nicht ansprechen, kann ein individueller Behandlungsversuch mit Cannabinoiden, das entweder als Fertigarzneimittel über die internationale Apotheke (Marinol) oder als Rezepturmedikament (Dronabinol) erhältlich ist (), versucht werden (, ). Hyperbare Oxygenation (HBO) Aufgrund viel versprechender Experimente bei Tiermodellen und positiver Fallberichte wurden neun kontrollierte klinische Studien mit HBO bei 504 MS-Patienten durchgeführt. Die Ergebnisse sind in einer Metaanalyse zusammengefasst (). Bis auf zwei Studien (, ) waren die Untersuchungen negativ (, ) oder wiesen sogar auf eine klinischer Verschlechterung hin (). Sowohl die Risiken als auch die Kosten der HBO sind beträchtlich, sodass von dieser Therapie bei MS abgeraten werden sollte. Fazit Für keine der unkonventionellen Therapien liegt ausreichend wissenschaftliche Evidenz vor, um sie empfehlen zu können. Die klinischen Studien sind überwiegend klein und methodisch mangelhaft. Die Studienergebnisse sind aber keinesfalls durchgehend negativ, es gibt zahlreiche Hinweise auf die Wirksamkeit mancher Therapien. Einige Untersuchungen deuten darauf hin, dass sich unkonventionelle Therapien weniger auf objektiv messbare Befunde der MS auswirken als vielmehr auf Selbstwahrnehmung, psychisches Wohlbefinden und Lebensqualität. Diese Hypothesen sollten mit geeigneten Zielkriterien in größeren Studien geprüft werden.

A: Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD) is an inflammatory, demyelinating, antibody-mediated disease of the central nervous system (CNS) that predominantly targets the optic nerves, brainstem and spinal cord. The term neuromyelitis optica was first described by Devic and Gault in 1894 (1). The disease was, therefore, previously referred to as Devic’s disease. It was considered for years as a variant of multiple sclerosis but, more recently, demonstrated to represent a distinct clinical and pathophysiologic entity. Moreover, the identification of a serum autoantibodies specific for the aquaporin-4 (AQP4) (2), a water channel present on astrocytic foot processes heavily expressed in the optic nerves, brainstem, and spinal cord, unified a spectrum of NMO-related disorders and distinguished them from multiple sclerosis (MS). NMOSD encompasses patients who fulfill the diagnostic criteria below and are either AQP4 seropositive or AQP4/myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) seronegative (testing discussed below). A: The reported incidence and prevalence of NMOSD are dependent on geographical location and ethnicity. The prevalence in the United States and Europe range between 3.9-4.1/100,000 but higher in African and Asian populations. Females are more affected than males (3:1–9:1) (3). The median age at presentation is 39 years, but 18% of cases occur in children or the elderly (4). It is generally regarded as a non-familial disease. A: NMOSD has three cardinal manifestations: optic neuritis, transverse myelitis, and area postrema syndrome. Optic neuritis is often associated with severe bilateral vision involvement, and incomplete recovery. Transverse myelitis in NMOSD is typically complete with profound bilateral motor weakness, prominent dysesthesias, a sensory level, and sphincter dysfunction (5). Other useful clinical clues include pain, pruritis, and tonic spasms (brief recurrent, usually painful episodes of increased muscle tone with abnormal posturing of the affecting limb). NMOSD transverse myelitis is often disabling and associated with poor recovery despite treatment. The third common presentation is area postrema syndrome, which is characterized by nausea, vomiting with or without hiccup, and patients are often evaluated first by gastroenterologists. It may occur in isolation, have other accompanying brainstem features, or evolve into a myelitis episode. Other less common presentations include symptomatic diencephalic syndrome (narcolepsy, autonomic dysfunction, anorexia and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion), symptomatic cerebral syndrome with presentation similar to posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) or acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), myalgia and hyperCKemia. A: NMOSD is commonly associated with organ specific autoimmune disease myasthenia gravis (pernicious anemia, autoimmune thyroiditis, ulcerative colitis and type 1 diabetes) and non-organ specific autoimmune disease or their autoantibody biomarkers such as systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjogren syndrome, and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (6). The presence of any core manifestations of NMOSD in any patient with these diseases is likely due to NMOSD rather than neurological manifestations of connective tissue disease and should promote testing for AQP4-IgG. NMOSD can rarely be a paraneoplastic presentation. A: Although NMOSD has distinct immunopathogenesis and treatment options, both NMOSD and MS may have similar clinical presentations and imaging features. It is essential to differentiate NMOSD and MS, especially in patients with both optic nerve and spinal cord involvement, as some MS therapies (e.g. interferon beta, natalizumab, fingolimod) can exacerbate NMOSD. Optic neuritis is generally more severe, and recovery poorer in NMOSD than in MS, with complete remission in only 32%. Transverse myelitis in NMOSD is usually extensive, with complete clinical remission in only 17% of attacks (7). Unlike MS, the disability in NMOSD is mostly driven by relapses rather than disease progression. MRI of the brain is usually normal or shows changes that differ from MS (See below). The longitudinally extensive cord lesions (typically 3 vertebral segments long) characteristic of NMO are rarely seen in MS (MS lesions are usually one vertebral segment long).  CSF may show a striking lymphocytic pleocytosis or a neutrophilic predominance, whereas a CSF pleocytosis >50 cells/mm3 is rare in multiple sclerosis. Oligoclonal bands are found in only 15-30% with NMO versus 90% with MS (8). A: Brain MRI is abnormal in 55-80% of patients with NMOSD, but only 10% to 20% will satisfy Barkhof MS criteria (9). Typical brain involvement in NMOSD occurs at regions of high AQP4 expression (periaqueductal, hypothalamic, and periventricular regions) but can also involve the deep and subcortical white matter. Different patterns of white matter involvement have been reported in NMOSD, such as marbled appearance of the acute callosal lesion, involvement of the entire thickness of the corpus callosum (arch bridge appearance), tumefactive lesion and spindle-like appearance following white matter tracts. On occasion, lesions ascending from the spinal cord into the brainstem can occur. In addition, different patterns of enhancement have been reported to be typical for NMO, such as pencil-thin linear ependymal enhancement (thin ependymal enhancement of lateral ventricular surfaces), leptomeningeal enhancement, and cloud-like poorly marginated enhancement. Cases of PRESS have also been reported in association with NMOSD. MRI findings of NMOSD optic neuritis include extensive T2 hyperintense lesions, commonly bilateral, extending over the posterior part of the optic nerve or involving the optic chiasm, with enhancement usually extending more than half the length of the nerve (11). Imaging of the acute myelitis of NMOSD typically reveals a longitudinally extensive T2-hyperintense lesion spanning three or more contiguous vertebral segments. However, lesions are short in 14% of first myelitis episodes (92% long at relapse) (10). Extensive cord edema, central cord involvement with necrosis and cavitation, and a long segment cord atrophy are other common features with NMOSD. A: Patients suspected of having NMOSD should be tested for AQP4-IgG antibodies. AQP4-IgG binds to AQP4, which is located on the end-feet of astrocytes, initiating a cascade of immune-mediated inflammation resulting in secondary demyelination. Blood testing is recommended for AQP4-IgG and should be performed during the attack, before immunotherapy. Of available AQP4-Ab assays, the live cell-based assay has the highest sensitivity (76.7%) and specificity (99.8%) (12). The older-generation enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique is less sensitive and more prone to yield false-positive results. With the most sensitive assays, testing is negative in 10-25% of clinically diagnosed NMO. Up to 25% of patients with seronegative NMOSD will have antibodies to myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG-IgG). Please refer to the Mellen Center Approach (MCA) on Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody disorders for more information on that topic. CSF findings in NMOSD typically include a mixed pleocytosis (lymphocytes, neutrophils, and monocytes) with a median cell count of 19 cells/μl (range: 6-380) and elevated protein, especially in the setting of relapse. Positive oligoclonal bands are found in less than 30 % of patients with AQP4-IgG. Testing for AQP4-IgG in the CSF is less useful and is not the preferred method. A: We test any patient with any of these clinical presentations: longitudinally extensive or severe transverse myelitis, severe unilateral, recurrent, or bilateral optic neuritis. We also test AQP4-IgG in patients with intractable vomiting, hiccup, vertigo, unusual brain or brainstem lesions or undiagnosed inflammatory CNS disorder. Q: What are the criteria for the diagnosis of NMOSD? A: Revised consensus criteria published in 2015 base the diagnosis of NMOSD on the presence of core clinical characteristics, AQP4 antibody status, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) neuroimaging features (13). Positive test for AQP4-IgG using best available detection method (cell-based assay strongly recommended) Diagnostic criteria for NMOSD without AQP4-IgG or NMOSD with unknown AQP4-IgG status 1. At least two core clinical characteristics occurring as a result of one or more clinical attacks and meeting all of the following requirements: a. At least one core clinical characteristic must be optic neuritis, acute myelitis with longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis (LETM), or area postrema syndrome b. Dissemination in space (two or more different core clinical characteristics) c. Fulfillment of additional MRI requirements, as applicable 2. Negative tests for AQP4-IgG using best available detection method, or testing unavailable Area postrema syndrome: Episode of otherwise unexplained hiccups or nausea and vomiting Symptomatic narcolepsy or acute diencephalic clinical syndrome with NMOSD-typical diencephalic MRI lesions Symptomatic cerebral syndrome with NMOSD-typical brain lesions Additional MRI requirements for NMOSD without AQP4-IgG and NMOSD with unknown AQP4-IgG status 1. Acute optic neuritis: Requires brain MRI showing (a) normal findings or only nonspecific white matter lesions,  (b) optic nerve MRI with T2-hyperintense lesion or T1-weighted gadolinium enhancing lesion extending over more than one-half the optic nerve length or involving optic chiasm 2. Acute myelitis: Requires associated intramedullary MRI lesion extending over ≥3 contiguous segments (LETM)  ≥3 contiguous segments of focal spinal cord atrophy in patients with history compatible with acute myelitis 3. Area postrema syndrome: Requires associated dorsal medulla/area postrema lesions 4. Acute brainstem syndrome: Requires associated periependymal brainstem lesion Q: What is the expected course and prognosis of NMOSD? A: Approximately 90% of NMOSD patients have a relapsing course, with around 50% have their first relapse within 1 year and 90% within 5 years (14). Predictors of relapsing course include older age of onset, longer interval between first and second clinical attack, female gender, and less severe motor disability with the index event (15). If untreated, 50% of patients with relapsing NMOSD become blind in one or both eyes and require ambulatory help within 5 years of disease onset. Q: What are the differences between pediatric and adult onset NMOSD? A: Approximately 4% of NMOSD cases are reported to be pediatric onset. The age of onset is typically around 10–12 years, with the youngest reported patient with NMOSD was 16 months old. The marked female predominance seen in adult-onset disease is less evident (∼3:1 female: male ratio compared with up to 9:1 for adults). As in adults, AQP4 IgG seropositivity is usually associated with a severe, relapsing course, but is sometimes monophasic. In pediatric cases, the brain tends to be more involved, and brain lesions are commonly symptomatic, most common are encephalopathy, intractable nausea, hiccups, diplopia, and vertigo. With regard to spine MRI, both long and short segment myelitis were reported. However, LETM is less specific for NMOSD in children as 15% of pediatric MS patients have LETM. Other clinical, neuroimaging, and laboratory characteristics of pediatric NMOSD are similar to those of adult-onset disease. The International Panel for NMO Diagnosis (IPND) suggested that adult criteria are utilizable in pediatric with a caveat that LETM is probably less specific and can be observed in children with MS or ADEM. Current therapeutic options are similar to those of NMOSD for adults (see below). However, there is no FDA approved drug for pediatric patients with NMOSD. Q: What is the general approach to an NMO relapse? Is it different from an MS relapse? A: At the Mellen Center we treat NMO relapses urgently because of the rapidity, severity, as well as potential irreversibility of relapses in this disorder. Brainstem and cervical cord involvement may lead to fulminant neurogenic respiratory failure. We also make sure the patient is started on long term disease therapy as well (See below). Intravenous corticosteroids are our initial treatment for an acute attack. The typical Mellen Center regimen is methylprednisolone 1000mg IV as a single daily dose on 3-5 consecutive days followed by an oral prednisone taper of one to 6 months depending on the severity of the attack and the maintenance immunotherapy plan. Patients with severe myelitis or brainstem symptoms should be given steroids in an inpatient setting.  We consider plasmapheresis as an early second line treatment with a low threshold in those with no or minimal response to corticosteroids or if the attack is severe. Q: Other than medication, what types of support are needed in an NMO relapse? A: Other considerations during an NMO relapse with spinal cord involvement include attention to skin hygiene, DVT prophylaxis, symptomatic treatment for painful spasms, and early physical therapy.  Patients with cervical cord and/or brainstem involvement may require close monitoring of pulmonary mechanics and cardiac telemetry. Tonic spasms following transverse myelitis can often effectively be treated with a low dose of carbamazepine. Central neuropathic pain is also more frequent in NMOSD and early involvement of a local pain team is helpful if typical neuropathic agents are not effective. A: Given the natural history of NMOSD, long-term immunotherapy is indicated as soon as the diagnosis is made to prevent recurrent relapses and disability accrual. Unlike MS where the risk of relapses diminishes with age, patients with NMOSD require long term immunotherapy-for decades and any decision to stop chronic immunotherapy must be taken with caution. Until recently, there was no approved medication for NMOSD, and all of the medications were used off label. In June 2019, the FDA approved eculizumab (Soliris) for treatment of adult patients with NMOSD who are seropositive for AQP4 IgG antibodies (16). Rituximab has been widely used off label as first-line treatment to prevent relapses in NMOSD, driven by robust effects in several retrospective studies and a recent small randomized control trial  (17). Azathioprine and mycophenolate mofetil have been used for years but prospective data in support of their efficacy are lacking. Other therapies, such as methotrexate, mitoxantrone, cyclo- phosphamide, and cyclosporine have less supporting data for use in NMOSD. Inebilizumab and Satralizumab showed positive outcomes in phase III with reduction in relapse rates between 70–90% but are not yet licensed or available outside of clinical trials at the time of this review. At the Mellen Center, we treat all patients with AQP4-Abs at their first attack with long-term immunosuppression. We also recommend initiating therapy with Eculizumab or Rituximab as a first line therapy for AQP4-IgG-seropositive NMOSD. Rituximab has the potential benefits of infrequent administration, cost effectiveness and long-term efficacy and tolerability. Table 2 summarizes current treatment options.

Prevention of mitochondrial impairment by inhibition of protein phosphatase 1 activity in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis Prevention of mitochondrial impairment by inhibition of protein phosphatase 1 activity in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis   ,     , Article number:  () Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease caused by progressive loss of motor neurons (MNs) and subsequent muscle weakness. These pathological features are associated with numerous cellular changes, including alteration in mitochondrial morphology and function. However, the molecular mechanisms associating mitochondrial structure with ALS pathology are poorly understood. In this study, we found that Dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) was dephosphorylated in several ALS models, including those with SOD1 and TDP-43 mutations, and the dephosphorylation was mediated by the pathological induction of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) activity in these models. Suppression of the PP1-Drp1 cascade effectively prevented ALS-related symptoms, including mitochondrial fragmentation, mitochondrial complex I impairment, axonal degeneration, and cell death, in primary neuronal culture models, iPSC-derived human MNs, and zebrafish models in vivo. These results suggest that modulation of PP1-Drp1 activity may be a therapeutic target for multiple pathological features of ALS. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive and selective loss of motor neurons (MNs). The clinical symptoms of ALS include muscle weakness, dysphagia, and speech problems, and the disorder eventually leads to death from dyspnea within three to 5 years of diagnosis. Most ALS cases are sporadic, and roughly 10% of them are familial forms caused by various genetic mutations in specific genes, including superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), transactive response DNA-binding protein-43 (TDP-43), and chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9orf72). Mutations in these genes are also found in the sporadic form of ALS. For example, hexanucleotide repeat expansion of C9orf72 was identified in a large proportion of both familial and sporadic forms of ALS patients, suggesting that somatic or de novo mutations in causative genes may also be responsible for sporadic ALS. Although the causes of ALS may differ, most ALS cases exhibit common pathological features with biochemical/cellular hallmarks such as protein aggregations, abnormal Ca buffering, glutamate excitotoxicity, glial activation, disruption of RNA metabolism, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Therefore, it has been postulated that multiple cellular changes are involved in the progression of ALS symptoms, making it difficult to develop effective treatments. Although riluzole and edaravone are the drugs for ALS currently approved by FDA, their efficacies are modest in clinical trials, and their pharmacological targets appear to be different. It is, therefore, of great importance to develop novel treatments targeting several of the common pathological features responsible for the complex nature of ALS pathology. Mitochondrial dysfunction is commonly found in both familial and sporadic ALS cases, suggesting that mitochondria may serve as an important hub for ALS pathophysiology. For example, it has been reported that mitochondria were morphologically fragmented and functionally deteriorated from the pre-symptomatic period in patients and mouse models of ALS (SOD1 G93A). C9ORF72-associated poly(GR) compromises mitochondrial function and induces mitochondrial fragmentation, leading to DNA damage and an increase in cell death. In sporadic ALS cases, mitochondrial morphological abnormalities have been detected in the anterior horn of the spinal cord. Mitochondria are essential for cellular ATP production, and MNs require large amounts of energy from the mitochondria in order to function. Thus, it has been suggested that MNs are one of the most vulnerable types of cells to mitochondrial dysfunction. On the other hand, the morphological changes in the mitochondria in ALS pathology may hint at additional links between mitochondria and MN function. The morphological dynamics of mitochondria are homeostatically controlled by the balance between continuous fission and fusion, and this is necessary for the maintenance of mitochondrial quality. Mitochondrial dynamics are controlled by large GTPase dynamin-related proteins, including Dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), Mitofusin1/2 (MFN1/2), and Optic atrophy 1 (Opa1). Recently, it was reported that the expression of Drp1 was induced in the spinal cord of SOD1 G93A model mice, and the suppression of Drp1 inhibited mutant SOD1-induced mitochondrial fragmentation and cell death in vitro, suggesting that alteration of Drp1 activity may mediate at least some aspects of MN degeneration in ALS. However, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying the Drp1 function and ALS pathology are yet to be described. In an attempt to identify novel therapeutic targets for ALS, we examined whether Drp1-dependent mitochondrial dynamics are an effective target for ALS therapy and explored the upstream mechanism modulating Drp1 activity in ALS models. To this end, we identified that Drp1 is pathologically dephosphorylated in SOD1 G93A mice, and the blockade of Drp1 activity prevents cell death induced by the expression of mutant SOD1 or TDP-43. Furthermore, we identified PP1 as a phosphatase responsible for the dephosphorylation of Drp1 and found that the inhibition of PP1 activity suppresses neurotoxicity in several ALS models. Based on our observations, we propose that pathological induction of PP1 plays a key role in the progression of cellular events associated with ALS, providing novel therapeutic targets for ALS. SOD1 G93A transgenic mice were maintained as a hemizygous line by mating with wild type C57BL/6J mice. To distinguish between SOD1 G93A and WT mice, pups were genotyped with DNA obtained from their toes, using the PCR method. To create the ALS zebrafish models, embryos from () zebrafish, whose MN axons exhibit EGFP, were microinjected with 1.76 ng RNA (SOD1 G93A and TDP-43 Q331K), synthesized by T7 RNA polymerase. Embryos were treated with Mdivi-1 (2.5 nM, Sigma, Cat. 338967-87-6), I-2 (200 nM, Millipore, Cat. 14-162), or Okadaic acid (100 nM, Sigma, Cat. O8010) 24 h after microinjection, and then once again the following day. The animal models were randomly assigned to experimental groups. The Cerebral cortices were dissected from WT rat or mouse embryos (E16~17) and chopped using a micro scissor. The tissues were incubated in 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA at 37 °C for 10 min and then centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 1 min. The dissociated cells were washed with HBSS and re-suspended in complete medium, containing Neurobasal medium (Invitrogen, Cat. 21103) supplemented with B27 (GIBCO BRL, Cat. 17504044), L-glutamic acid (GIBCO BRL), L-glutamine (GIBCO BRL), and penicillin–streptomycin (GIBCO BRL). The cells were plated onto poly-D lysine pre-coated coverslips (2 × 10 cells/well) and cultured in complete medium. After 3 days, the complete medium was replaced with incomplete medium, containing Neurobasal medium supplemented with B27, L-glutamine, and penicillin–streptomycin. On 4 days in vitro, 50 μM Mdivi-1 or I-2 (NEB, Cat. P0755L) were treated for 24 or 72 h. In some cases, shDrp1 (5'-GAA GAG TGT AAC TGA TTC A-3’) or shFis1 (5'-CAG CGG GAT TAT GTC TTC T-3’) sequences were inserted into the BglII/HindIII site of the p-Super GFP vector. shPP1α (5'-GCA GCT GAC AGA GAA CGA GAT-3’), shPP1β (5'-GCT AAA CGA CAG TTG GTA ACC-3’) or shPP1γ (5'-GGG TAT GAT CAC AAA GCA AGC-3’) sequences were inserted into the PacI site of the FUGW-GFP vector, and the resultant vectors were cotransfected with ALS-related mutants (SOD1 G93A, TDP-43 Q331K). Three days after transfection, the pyknotic and activated caspase-3 labeled cells were counted. Differentiation of iPSCs into MNs was performed as described by Lopez-Gonzalez et al.. Briefly, iPSCs were plated and expanded in an mTSER1 medium (Stem Cell Technologies Cat. 5875) in Matrigel-coated wells (Corning Cat. 354230). Twenty-four hours after plating, the culture medium was replaced with neuroepithelial progenitor (NEP) medium, containing DMEM/F12 (Invitrogen Cat. 12660-012):neurobasal medium (Invitrogen Cat. 21103049) at 1:1, 0.5 × N2 (Thermo-Fisher Cat. 17502-048), 0.5 × B27 (Thermo-Fisher Cat. 17504-044), 0.1 mM ascorbic acid (Sigma Cat. A4403), 1 × Glutamax (Invitrogen35050061), 3 μM CHIR99021 (Stem Cell Technologies Cat. 72054), 2 μM DMH1 (Stem Cell Technologies Cat. 73634), and 2 μM SB431542 (Stemgent Cat. 040010-10). After 6 days, NEPs were dissociated with accutase, split 1:6 into Matrigel-coated wells, and cultured for 6 days in motor neuron progenitor induction medium (NEP) with 0.1 μM retinoic acid (Sigma Cat. R2625) and 0.5 μM purmorphamine (Calbiochem Cat. 540220). Motor neuron progenitors were dissociated with accutase to generate neurosphere suspension cultures. After a further 6 days, the cultures were dissociated into single cells, plated on laminin-coated plates/coverslips (TTE laboratories Cat. WN354087) in a motor neuron differentiation medium containing 0.5 μM retinoic acid, 0.1 μM purmorphamine, and 0.1 μM Compound E (Stem Cell Technologies Cat. 73954) for 2 weeks and then in the same medium without Compound E for up to 3 weeks. iPSC-derived motor neurons from controls lines 35L11, 37L20, and 24L2, and TDP-43 mutant lines 292 (M337V), 290 (Q343R), and 36L10 (A90V) were treated from 1 week after plating with I-2 for an additional 2 weeks, with the medium changed twice a week. After that, the cells were fixed for imaging analysis. The lumbar region of the spinal cord was collected from WT and SOD1 G93A mice and sonicated in a lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 10% Glycerol, 1% Triton-X100 and 1 mM EDTA). After protein quantification using the BCA method, 30 µg of protein was loaded per well and separated by SDS-PAGE. The loaded protein was transferred to a PVDF membrane, and this membrane was incubated in a blocking solution (3% BSA/1 ×TBST) for 1 h. The membrane was incubated with primary antibody diluted 1:1000 with blocking solution overnight at 4 °C, then washed three times in 1xTBST and incubated with secondary antibody diluted 1:5000 with 5% Skim Milk/1xTBST. The antibodies used were anti-Drp1 (BD, Cat. 611113), anti-phospho Drp1 S616 (Cell signaling, Cat. 3455), anti-Fis1 (Abcam, Cat. Ab96764), anti-PP1α (Santa Cruz, Cat. sc-443), anti-phospho-PP1α (Cell Signaling, Cat. #2581), PP1β (Santa Cruz, Cat. sc-373782), PP1γ (Santa Cruz, Cat. sc-6109), and anti β-actin (Sigma, Cat. A5441). The secondary antibodies used were anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. The membrane was washed three times in 1xTBST, and the signals expressed by the protein were visualized using an ECL kit (Thermo, Cat. 32106). SOD1 G93A mice of each pathological stage were perfused in 4% paraformaldehyde, and the lumbar regions of the spinal cord were dissected. The tissues were post-fixed overnight at 4 °C. The fixed tissues were soaked in 30%sucrose/1× PBS for cryo-protection. The lumbar regions of the spinal cord were cut serially into sections 40 μm thick on a cryostat, and these were transferred into 50% glycerol in PBS. The sections were blocked in 1xPBS containing 3% BSA and 0.2% Triton-X100 for 30 min at room temperature. After blocking, tissues were incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C and washed three times in 1× PBS. The primary antibodies used were phospho-DRP1 S616 (Cell Signaling, Cat. 3455), DRP1 (BD, Cat. 611113), and ChAT (Millipore, Cat. AB144P). The tissues were incubated with fluorescence-labeled secondary antibody and Hoechst33342 (10 μg/ml; Sigma, St. Louis, MO) for 30 min at room temperature and washed three times in 1× PBS. They were then mounted on slides and observed using a fluorescence or confocal microscope (Zeiss, Goettingen, Germany). PP1 activity was measured by the ProFluor Ser/Thr PPase assay kit (Promega, Cat. V1260). This assay is based on the dephosphorylation of a phosphorylated bisamide rhodamine 110 peptide substrate. In order to carry out a PP1 activity assay of the lumbar spinal cord, the tissue was sonicated in a lysis buffer (5 M NaCl, 1 M Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 0.5 M EDTA, 0.5 M EGTA, 0.2 M NaVO, 0.1 M PMSF) and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min. Following centrifugation, the supernatant was divided into two tubes and treated with either 0.2 nM (for PP2A inhibition) or 1 μM okadaic acid (for PP1 inhibition). The level of PP1 activity of each sample was measured based on the absorbance at 488 nm of nonphosphorylated S/T PPase R110 substrate and then normalized by protein levels (BCA assay). Relative PP1 activity was calculated as the value of phosphatase activity level (treated with 0.2 nM okadaic acid) minus the value of background phosphatase activity (treated with 1 μM okadaic acid). Assay of NADH dehydrogenase and complex I activity of mitochondria In order to carry out a histological assay of NADH dehydrogenase, the lumbar spinal cord was snap-frozen in pre-chilled isopentane and sectioned using a cryostat. Phosphate buffer (0.343 g NaHPO in 100 ml HO) and NBT (250 mg nitro blue tetrazolium in 100 ml HO) were prepared. The sections were incubated in a solution containing 5 mg NADH, 1 ml saline, 1 ml phosphate buffer, and 4 ml NBT with 2 ml distilled water. After incubation for 30 min at room temperature in humidity chamer, the sections were rinsed in distilled water and observed using a microscope. The mitochondrial complex I activity of the lumbar spinal cord and cultured neurons was measured using a microplate assay kit (Abcam, Cat. Ab109721) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Measurement of mitochondrial membrane potential (∆Ψ) and velocity Cultured cortical neurons were incubated with 500 nM TMRM (tetramethylrhodamine, methyl ester; Invitrogen, Cat. T668) for 30 min at 37 °C. The signal of TMRM was imaged using a Carl Zeiss Observer Z1 with x630 magnification, and its intensity was measured using ImageJ. All samples or animals were assigned randomly, and the experiment was performed in a blinded fashion. The data were tested for differences between multiple groups using one-way ANOVA followed by Scheffe’s or Tukey’s multiple comparisons tests for post hoc comparisons. Differences between the means of two groups were tested using the two-sided Student’s -test. All animal maintenance and experimental procedures were approved by members of the Laboratory Animal Research Center at Korea University College of Medicine. The use of hiPSCs was approved by the Institutional Review Board and Ethics Committee at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). Changes in mitochondrial fission proteins in ALS models We first explored whether molecules responsible for the morphological dynamics of mitochondria are altered in SOD1 G93A (G93A) ALS model mice. Although the expression level of Drp1 protein remained unaltered, the phosphorylation level of Drp1 S616 was significantly reduced at the onset period (when the mice were 100 days old) (Fig. ). The expression level of Fis1, a receptor for Drp1, also markedly increased during this period (Fig. ). Immunohistochemical labeling of the lumbar spinal cord with a phosphorylation-specific antibody against Drp1 S616 demonstrated that the reduction of Drp1 S616 phosphorylation mainly occurred in the MNs of G93A mice (Fig. ). Next, we overexpressed G93A or TDP-43 Q331K (Q331K) associated with ALS in primary neurons and found that these pathogenic mutants caused dephosphorylation of Drp1 (Fig. ). Collectively, these results suggest that pathogenic stimuli associated with ALS cause dephosphorylation of Drp1. Prevention of Drp1 signaling reduces ALS-related neurodegeneration It has been reported that phosphorylation of Drp1 S616 is controlled by cdk5, which prevents the oligomerization and subsequent mitochondrial localization of Drp1 in neurons. Dephosphorylation of Drp1 S616 and the induction of Fis1 expression appear to promote Drp1-dependent mitochondrial fission, which is associated with neurodegeneration. In keeping with this, we found that the overexpression of mutant G93A in primary cortical neurons promoted mitochondrial fragmentation. However, suppression of Drp1 activation by transfection with shDrp1 or shFis1, and treatment with a chemical inhibitor (Mdivi-1), consistently prevented the mitochondrial fragmentation induced by ALS-related mutations, suggesting that Drp1-Fis1 signaling is necessary for ALS-related mitochondrial fragmentation (Fig. and Supplementary Fig. ). Next, we tested whether a blockade of Drp1-Fis1 would prevent neurodegeneration. Following transfection with ALS-related mutant genes (SOD1 G93A and TDP-43 Q331K), neuronal death was enhanced, as assessed by activated caspase-3 immunoreactivity (Fig. ) and pyknotic nuclei (Supplementary Fig. ). Blocking Drp1 activation effectively prevented this cell death. Finally, we tested the effects of a blockade of Drp1 activity in vivo using an ALS zebrafish system (Fig. ). Degeneration of motor axons induced by transient overexpression of SOD1 G93A or TDP-43 Q331K was readily detectable in the models, but the blockade of Drp1 activity through treatment with Mdivi-1 effectively prevented this axonal degeneration. These results indicate that Drp1 activation contributes to ALS-related neurodegeneration in vivo. PP1 is involved in Drp1 dephosphorylation in G93A mice Because dephosphorylation of Drp1 was found to be one of the events associated with enhanced mitochondrial fission and neurodegeneration in the ALS models, we explored the upstream phosphatase(s) responsible for this dephosphorylation, under the assumption that upstream phosphatase activation may cause the Drp1-dependent mitochondrial defects found in ALS models (Fig. ). The blockade of PP1 by either of two selective inhibitors, cantharidin or inhibitor-2 (I-2), promoted the phosphorylation of Drp1 S616 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. ). Furthermore, the dephosphorylation of Drp1 was completely blocked by I-2 treatment in cortical neurons through G93A overexpression (Fig. ). These observations suggest that the activation of PP1 is responsible for the Drp1 dephosphorylation associated with ALS pathology. Moreover, we found that the lumbar spinal cord of G93A mice exhibited significantly higher PP1 activity in the symptomatic period than in the pre-symptomatic period, and the enhanced PP1 activity was maintained until the end stage (Fig. ). It has been reported that PP1 activity is regulated by its phosphorylation status, and dephosphorylation is required for its activation. Western blot analysis showed that PP1α was activated in the pre-symptomatic period of ALS (Fig. ) and the phosphorylation of PP1 was decreased in the ChAT+ neurons of G93A mouse at pre- and post-symptomatic period, as well as in mSOD1 or TDP43 expressing cortical neurons (Supplementary Fig. ). Collectively, these results demonstrated that pathologic induction of PP1 activity may cause Drp1 activation and subsequent induction of cell death in ALS models. PP1 inhibition rescues neurons from neurodegeneration To test whether PP1 inhibition is sufficient for the prevention of Drp1-dependent mitochondrial fission in the ALS model, we first examined whether PP1 inhibition prevented ALS-related mutant-dependent mitochondrial fragmentation. PP1 has three catalytic isoforms, α, β and γ, and I-2 can inhibit the action of all of them. Therefore, in order to explore their importance, the effects of specific shRNA against each isoform on mitochondrial fission were tested. Interestingly, the suppression of PP1α, γ, and I-2, but not PP1β, prevented the excessive fission of mitochondria in G93A and Q331K-overexpressed primary cortical neurons (Fig. and Supplementary Fig. ). Next, we tested whether suppression of PP1 prevented SOD1 G93A and TDP-43 Q331K-induced cell death. PP1 suppression by I-2 and shPP1γ reduced the number of active caspase-3-positive or pyknotic cells in the ALS-related mutant gene-overexpressed neurons (Fig. ). On the other hand, we found that the suppression of PP1α by shRNA significantly enhanced cell death. Yet the suppression of PP1 β and γ by shRNA significantly reduced the number of pyknotic cells in SOD1 G93A- or TDP-43 Q331K-overexpressed neurons (Fig. ). These results indicate that different PP1 isoforms may mediate different outcomes in ALS pathology via different substrate specificities. Furthermore, we also found that I-2 prevented the ALS-related mutant-induced retardation of axonal growth in zebrafish models (Fig. ). Expression of SOD1 G93A and/or TDP-43 Q331K reduced axonal growth, whereas I-2, shPP1α, and shPP1γ each restored axonal growth to a level equal to the control. Interestingly, this growth-restoring effect was not observed in Mdivi-1 treatments, suggesting that retardation of axonal growth was not entirely dependent on Drp1 activation and that PP1 may have additional targets for the progression of ALS-related axonal degeneration/growth retardation. Blockade of PP1 restores mitochondrial respiratory functions Because the mitochondrial bioenergetics is expected to influence axonal growth, we tested whether PP1 activity is also associated with the alteration of mitochondrial respiratory complex activities (Fig. ). It has been reported that complex I activity is primarily affected in G93A mice, and we confirmed that NADH dehydrogenase, which represents mitochondrial complex I activity, was substantially reduced in the lumbar spinal cord of G93A mice, compared to WT (Fig. ). Next, we tested whether a blockade of PP1 or Drp1 activity rescued the impairment of mitochondrial function induced by the overexpression of SOD1 G93A or TDP-43 Q331K, which rapidly reduced complex I activity and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP; Fig. ). However, I-2 effectively prevented the reduction of mitochondrial complex I activity and MMP in the mutant-overexpressed neurons, while Mdivi-1 treatment failed to rescue these functional impairments of the mitochondria. These results suggest that pathological PP1 activity impaired mitochondrial respiration via a Drp1-independent route as well as through Drp1-mediated mitochondrial impairments. Blockade of PP1 activity alleviates ALS pathology in vivo and in a human iPSC model Next, we tested whether PP1 inhibition can effectively prevent ALS-related neurodegeneration in a zebrafish model. PP1 inhibition by treatment with I-2 or okadaic acid (OA) prevented the axonal defects induced by SOD1 G93A or TDP-43 Q331K mutations (Fig. ). Interestingly, I-2 restored the motor axonal length of mutant-expressing MNs to a level equivalent to the control, which was significantly superior to the effects of axonal elongation by the Mdivi-1 treatment (Fig. ). Finally, we also tested whether these preventive effects of I-2 could be observed in a human iPSC-derived MN model in vitro. First, we differentiated multiple iPS cell lines from controls and TDP43 mutants (mTDP-43;A90V, Q343R, M337V) into spinal MNs as described. PP1 suppression induced by I-2 treatment over 2 weeks inhibited mitochondrial fragmentation, although in the periods between administrations of I-2, the mTDP group exhibited noticeable mitochondrial shortening (Fig. ). As anticipated, the number of active caspase-3-positive neurons and pyknotic cells was lower in the I-2-treated mTDP group, suggesting that inhibition of PP1 by I-2 suppresses neuronal toxicity in several ALS-associated models. The prevention of pathological PP1 activity could, therefore, be a viable therapeutic target. Recent large-scale genetic analyses have revealed that genes mediating many different biological cascades are associated with ALS, suggesting that many different pathways should merge into a common ‘hub’ cascade to exhibit common symptoms such as MN death, axonal degeneration, and mitochondrial defects. In this study, we identified that dephosphorylation of Drp1 is mediated by pathological activation of PP1 induced by SOD1 G93A or TDP-43 Q331K overexpression in cellular models, and in mouse models with the G93A mutation. Blocking the PP1-Drp1 cascades effectively prevented mitochondrial defects and subsequent neurodegeneration in various ALS models. The gain-of-function mutation of SOD1 is proposed to impair protein misfolding-mediated clearance pathways, including ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis, protein aggregations, and autophagy, in addition to causing mitochondrial dysfunction. On the other hand, TDP-43 is an RNA-binding protein that may trigger defects in mRNA processing, with multiple consequences including defective nucleocytoplasmic transport, mitochondrial deficits, and abnormalities in mitophagy. Given that these different causative mutations commonly compromise mitochondrial function, which can be prevented by the blockade of PP1-Drp1 cascades, these form an important common biological hub for ALS pathology, and may be important therapeutic targets against the multiple pathological features of ALS. Further analysis with different ALS models caused by other types of mutation is necessary to expand upon this intriguing notion (Fig. ). Mitochondrial defects have been considered important mediators in the progression of multiple neurodegenerative diseases, including ALS. In ALS models, the mitochondria are hyper-fragmented, and their axonal transport, ATP synthesis, and mitophagic removal are greatly affected. Drp1 has been proposed as a key player in this mitochondria-related ALS pathology because several causative gene mutations associated with ALS promote Drp1 activity. The induction of Drp1 activity is apt to promote cell death signaling via multiple mediating processes. Thus, the inhibition of Drp1 led to the exhibition of therapeutic effects in the G93A mouse model. Our current observations further confirmed this notion in SOD1 mutations and extended it to include ALS models with the TDP-43 mutation. Notably, we observed the dephosphorylation of Drp1 S616 sites in several ALS models, and Drp1 S616 has been widely considered as an activating phosphorylation site. However, we previously found that phosphorylation of Drp1 S616 by cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) inhibited the translocation of Drp1 to the mitochondria in neurons, resulting in reduced mitochondrial fission. Given that CDK5 is specifically expressed in post-mitotic neurons, this cascade appeared to be specific to neurons at that particular stage. In this respect, the dephosphorylation of Drp1 S616 in the neurons of ALS models appears to promote Drp1 activation. We found that a blockade of dephosphorylation prevented Drp1-related ALS symptoms, which supports our current hypothesis. While Drp1 inhibition proved to be clearly beneficial, there were nonetheless several reasons for us to seek upstream targets, such as PP1, for ALS therapy. Previously, we observed that a blockade of Drp1 activity in normally developing chick MNs resulted in an increase in programmed cell death and the impairment of axonal growth. Considering that mitochondrial fusion and fission are essential events for cellular homeostasis, there is a narrow range in which mitochondrial dynamics must be maintained for optimal survival. In concurrence with our previous observations in developing MNs, we also found that the suppression of Drp1 activation had little benefit for axonal growth. It should also be noted that Drp1 performs many functions in addition to mitochondrial fission. Drp1 can interact with many different proteins localized at different subcellular locations, thereby being involved in many biological processes such as peroxisomal fragmentation, vesicle endocytosis/recycling, MMP changes, and cytoskeletal remodeling. Indeed, restoration of Drp1 activity to a normal physiological level in the long-term may be difficult to achieve, meaning that alternative robust and druggable targets for ALS therapy are highly desirable. Here we identified PP1 as an upstream phosphatase responsible for the dephosphorylation of Drp1 and tested whether regulation of PP1 activity is beneficial for the suppression of ALS-related pathological consequences. PP1 is a serine/threonine phosphatase and exists as a cellular holoenzyme composed of catalytic and regulatory subunits. It is required for many cellular functions, including cell division, apoptosis, cytoskeletal organization, protein synthesis, and metabolism. Moreover, it has been reported that PP1 activity is associated with several neurodegenerative diseases. For instance, the dephosphorylation of mutant leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) by PP1 is increased in Parkinson’s disease. Previous studies reported that, in Alzheimer’s disease, tau phosphorylation was induced by GSK3β, which is activated by PP1, and I-2 prevented amyloid-β oligomer (AβO)-induced defects in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-containing vesicle transport. In this study, we found that PP1 activity was increased in the SOD1 G93A ALS mouse model before the onset of the disease, and the blockade of PP1 activity prevented mitochondrial defects. Importantly, the PP1 blockade prevented axonal degeneration and restored the complex I activity of the mitochondria in the ALS model, results that were not achieved by the inhibition of Drp1 in our model. We found that the different PP1 isoforms may mediate different consequences of ALS-related pathologies because selective inhibition of each isoform resulted in different outcomes with respect to mitochondrial fragmentation, axonal growth, and cell survival. Das et al. reported that Sephin1, a novel inhibitor of PP1 and PPP1R15α (GADD34) binding, prevented the aggregation of mutant SOD1 G93A protein and MN death in an ALS model, improving motor deficiency in SOD1 G93A mice. They proposed that Sephin1 inhibited the phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2α) without affecting PP1 catalytic activity. On the other hand, we observed that the inhibition of PP1 activity improved ALS-related pathologies and failed to observe any dephosphorylation of eIF2 α induced by I-2 treatment (Supplementary Fig. ). Therefore, PP1 may affect the propagation of ALS-related pathologies in catalytic activity-dependent or -independent manners. While PP1 appears to affect ALS pathology via Drp1 dephosphorylation, it must also have other substrates. For instance, mitochondrial complex I, which is composed of 44 subunits, is a pacemaker of the mitochondrial respiratory system. Thus, impairment of complex I is often reported in ALS models. Complex I deficiency represents severe defects within the mitochondrial system and induces ALS impairment of mitochondrial metabolism. Some subunits in complex I, which are closely linked to its activity, are regulated by (de)phosphorylation. Therefore, although we cannot completely rule out the possibility that the pathological effect of PP1 activation is also mediated by Drp1, we favor the idea that pathological induction of PP1 activity may impair other cellular processes, including mitochondrial complex activity, independently of Drp1, via dephosphorylation of its target protein(s). Unbiased identification of PP1 targets and the further assessment of the precise molecular targets of PP1 should be addressed in the future to clarify this and related issues. Wijesekera, L.

High-dimensional detection of imaging response to treatment in multiple sclerosis High-dimensional detection of imaging response to treatment in multiple sclerosis   , , Article number:  () An to this article was published on 16 July 2019 Changes on brain imaging may precede clinical manifestations or disclose disease progression opaque to conventional clinical measures. Where, as in multiple sclerosis, the pathological process has a complex anatomical distribution, such changes are not easily detected by low-dimensional models in common use. This hinders our ability to detect treatment effects, both in the management of individual patients and in interventional trials. Here we compared the ability of conventional models to detect an imaging response to treatment against high-dimensional models incorporating a wide multiplicity of imaging factors. We used fully-automated image analysis to extract 144 regional, longitudinal trajectories of pre- and post- treatment changes in brain volume and disconnection in a cohort of 124 natalizumab-treated patients. Low- and high-dimensional models of the relationship between treatment and the trajectories of change were built and evaluated with machine learning, quantifying performance with receiver operating characteristic curves. Simulations of randomised controlled trials enrolling varying numbers of patients were used to quantify the impact of dimensionality on statistical efficiency. Compared to existing methods, high-dimensional models were superior in treatment response detection (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.890 [95% CI = 0.885–0.895] vs. 0.686 [95% CI = 0.679–0.693],  < 0.01]) and in statistical efficiency (achieved statistical power = 0.806 [95% CI = 0.698–0.872] vs. 0.508 [95% CI = 0.403–0.593] with number of patients enrolled = 50, at  = 0.01). High-dimensional models based on routine, clinical imaging can substantially enhance the detection of the imaging response to treatment in multiple sclerosis, potentially enabling more accurate individual prediction and greater statistical efficiency of randomised controlled trials. The value of any therapy is ultimately determined by its impact on patients’ lives. Both clinical and investigational measures are merely surrogates of impact, the former favoured owing to its perceived directness. Nonetheless, under two circumstances the imaging response to an intervention may be more important than the clinical. First, when imaging changes precede clinical manifestations they can provide grounds for earlier intervention. Oncologists, for example, rarely wait for an imaging relapse to become clinically obvious. Second, when the impact on quality-of-life is difficult to quantify, an imaging response may obtain greater real-world accuracy. In focal brain injury, for example, though the behavioural effects of prefrontal damage obvious on imaging can be devastating, even sophisticated neuropsychological testing often fails to detect them. Both these circumstances apply to multiple sclerosis. Imaging changes precede clinical deterioration, support the diagnosis and predict the prognosis of multiple sclerosis, and are surrogates for relapses. Clinical measures neither capture all affected functional domains nor the progression of disability. Furthermore, a divide exists between detecting an individual response in routine clinical care, and detecting an “average” response within clinical trials. A means of detecting an imaging response to treatment is therefore needed: the question is how best to achieve it. The conventional approach identifies a small set of univariate “biomarkers”, such as the number of lesions and volume, indexing their response to therapy within univariate or low-dimensional, multivariate statistical models. But brain pathology here extends beyond visible lesions, involves grey and white matter, and interacts with the complexity of the brain’s functional anatomy in a way that only a large number of features could adequately characterise. Indeed, multivariate patterns of grey matter atrophy are both complex and clinically relevant. Low-dimensional models that ignore this complexity are therefore bound to be insensitive to treatment effects. Until recently, the difficulty of extracting multiple imaging features and evaluating them within high-dimensional multivariate models has limited the application of complex modelling to this problem. But automated tissue segmentation and anatomical parcellation can now quantify regional brain atrophy at high spatial resolution, and white matter lesion segmentation, coupled with tractography, can define complex patterns of grey matter disconnection, yielding a high-dimensional, multivariate “fingerprint” of the brain. Conventional, low-dimensional models can now be compared with the proposed, high-dimensional models, quantifying the impact on the sensitivity and specificity for detecting a treatment response. Crucially, this approach is applicable to real-world, heterogeneous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. Where the biological signal is high-dimensional, conveyed in the interactions between many features, it becomes resistant to noise and baseline variability, given sufficient data and the right modelling technique. The ability to use real-world, heterogeneous MRI data would make it possible for high-dimensional modelling to be readily introduced into clinical practice and interventional clinical trials. Recent publications have shown the value of high-dimensional modelling based on brain lesion patterns in predicting conversion to multiple sclerosis, future disease activity and treatment responders, establishing the theoretical basis for the work described in this paper. Given that brain morphology is also important in the prediction of clinical outcomes, one can hypothesise that the addition of the latter would benefit the detection of imaging response to treatment, and we test this hypothesis. Here we examined an unselected cohort of relapsing-remitting patients with multiple sclerosis treated with natalizumab, and imaged with standard-of-care MRI. Our aim was to compare the performance of conventional low- and the proposed, high-dimensional models in detecting the imaging response to the treatment in the real-world clinical setting, and by simulating a randomised, clinical trial. We further sought to define the potential applications of such models. The best high-dimensional model (ERT classifier) yielded a significantly superior performance than the best, conventional, low-dimensional model (ERT classifier): high-dimensional ERT model AUC = 0.890 (95% confidence intervals (CIs): 0.885–0.895) vs. low-dimensional ERT model AUC = 0.686 (95% CIs: 0.679–0.693) ( < 0.01) (Fig. ). This reflected an individual accuracy of 86.5% (95% CIs: 85.9–87.0), a sensitivity of 77.7% (95% CIs: 77.2–78.3) and a specificity of 77.8% (95% CIs: 77.3–78.2) for the best high-dimensional model (ERT classifier), compared with an accuracy of 66.4% (95% CIs: 65.8–66.9), a sensitivity of 61.8% (95% CIs: 61.2–62.4) and a specificity of 66.8% (95% CIs: 66.2–67.5) for the best, conventional, low-dimensional model (ERT classifier). The superiority of the high-dimensional approach was consistent across both types of machine learning classifiers (Fig. , Table ). Similar results were obtained with data balanced by subsampling (see ). High-dimensional models that incorporated volume and disconnectome dimensions simultaneously achieved similar performance to those reported above (results not shown). Null models constructed by randomly permuting the order of values in each feature time series before computing slopes, and thus trajectories, could not reliably detect the intervention, confirming that the observed performance was not due to differences in scan timing (Table ). The imaging features that were found to be most valuable for detecting the imaging response to treatment (Fig. ) and those that comprised the best high-dimensional model based solely on regional brain volume trajectories and the best high-dimensional model based solely on regional brain volume disconnectome trajectories (Fig. ) were consistent with known patterns of lesion and parenchymal change in multiple sclerosis. They were also concordant in the direction of their effects (Fig. ). The number of scans used for confounder regression and the number of scans used specifically for the detection of imaging response to treatment were 563 (124 patients) and 485 (103 patients), respectively. None of confounders could reliably be predicted using the confounder adjusted imaging-derived parameters, confirming the absence of residual covariate effects following confounder regression (Table ). The class distribution was 33.1% class 0 (pre-treatment) and 66.9% class 1 (post-treatment), while the robust performance metrics of balanced -scores and Matthews Correlation Coefficients also confirmed the superiority of the high-dimensional models (Tables and ). In simulated randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of the intervention, the best high-dimensional model not only produced larger odds ratios, but the odds ratios also scaled better with increasing numbers of patients enrolled (Fig. ). Since the treatment effect size here was fixed, the improved odds ratios reflected better statistical efficiency. A linear fit to the data showed an increase in the odds ratio, for every additional patient enrolled, of 0.3 for the best high-dimensional model, compared with only 0.05 for the best, conventional, low-dimensional model. In particular, mean odds ratios with 59 patients enrolled were 5.83 (95% CIs: 5.17–6.49) and 10.6 (95% CIs: 9.38–11.7) for the conventional, low- and the proposed, high-dimensional approaches, respectively, diverging to 7.35 (95% CIs: 6.71–8.00) vs. 36.8 (95% CIs: 33.3–40.3) with 124 patients enrolled (Fig. ). As would be expected, enrolling more subjects in a given RCT increased the sensitivity with which an effect could be captured. However, Fig. showed that this resulted in an early plateau in performance using conventional, low-dimensional methods, while the steep gradient in the odds ratio was strikingly persistent even at  = 124 with the proposed, high-dimensional methods. Therefore, while one could achieve higher sensitivity in an RCT by increasing the number of subjects enrolled, the benefits were much more limited with the conventional, low-dimensional approaches. The advantages of the proposed, high-dimensional methods were also apparent in the relation between the number of patients enrolled in the RCT and the power of the study (Fig. ). For example, here we saw that the statistical power achieved by the proposed, high- and the conventional, low-dimensional models, respectively, were 0.806 [95% CI = 0.698–0.872] compared with 0.508 [95% CI = 0.403–0.593] with  = 50, at a significance level of  = 0.01 (Fig. ). Thus, in an RCT with 50 subjects enrolled, the risk of making a type II error, in terms of hypothesis testing, was very significant with the conventional, low-dimensional approaches, while a statistical power greater than 0.80 could be achieved at the same with the high-dimensional method. Although this difference became smaller when the number of subjects enrolled in the RCT was increased beyond 100, the individual-level prediction capability of the conventional, low-dimensional approaches lagged increasingly more behind the proposed, high-dimensional methods (Fig. ). This study has revealed a substantial difference between the performance of conventional, low- and the proposed, high-dimensional models of imaging response to treatment in multiple sclerosis. We now turn to the interpretability, generalisability, and potential real-world applications of our results. A natural concern when dealing with high-dimensional models is that they might ground their decision-making in imaging changes that are not physiologically meaningful. But neither changes in tissue loss nor degree of cortical disconnection can be easily misinterpreted, especially when they are shown to be reversals of familiar patterns of pathological change (Fig. ). Pseudoatrophy, a phenomenon associated with immunomodulatory drugs such as natalizumab, occurs in the first 6 to 12 months of treatment, not over the greater than 5-year period here examined, and would be expected to produce the opposite pattern of change. Care must be taken in interpreting high-dimensional models of imaging response. Any imaging-based model will naturally be sensitive to changes in proportion to their visibility on MR, not their physiological impact. While the two go mostly hand-in-hand, especially when the signal of interest is rate of tissue loss or disconnection, it is important to establish an ultimate link to clinical outcomes. But this is feasible only after a sensitive and robust imaging response model is built, for a model trained directly on clinical outcomes would inevitably conflate the two sources of variability: that between treatment and imaging changes and that between imaging changes and measured clinical outcomes. Furthermore, a model of the imaging response to treatment is independently valuable in multiple sclerosis, indeed with any disseminated parenchymal pathology, owing to the many areas of life impact conventional clinical measured do not adequately capture. The power of high-dimensional inference carries a risk: the danger of finding a solution that is not generalisable beyond the data on which the model has been trained. Contemporary machine learning counters this risk by using out-of-sample testing as the fundamental metric of performance, and algorithmic characteristics that penalise purely local solutions. Key aspects of our source data and modelling approach have further reduced this risk. First, our patient sample was not just large but also unselected, including everyone on our natalizumab register who has been treated at our centres over an interval of 15 years. Second, we deliberately kept our parameterisations of temporal change and of anatomy relatively crude. The trajectories used to estimate the former are dichotomised from purely linear models, and the anatomical features used to describe the latter are discretised into large brain regions. In the context of machine learning inference, the ratio of input features to number of cases was therefore kept conservative. All performance estimates were obtained with out-of-sample testing, and we included metrics robust to the class imbalance naturally observed within this clinical pathway. Demonstrating robust performance in the face of imbalanced data, without potentially unrealistic weighting or subsampling, strengthens the generalisability to real-world clinical contexts. How well the approach will extend to other treatments in multiple sclerosis needs dedicated investigation, but since our input features capture the major aspects of imaging any treatment could conceivably modify—the patterns of lesional change and regional atrophy—similar performance can reasonably be expected. Indeed, where the treatment is less potent, or its effects dispersed over a wider interval, the integrative power of high-dimensional methods should amplify their benefit. Detecting an imaging response to treatment is a foundational component of an array of possible applications with a focus either on individual patients or on population mechanistic or therapeutic aspects. Each presumes the prior availability of data of comparable range and scale to that achieved here, from which an adequately generalising model can be constructed, and against which new, unlabelled data can be tested. The insensitivity of our approach to scanner parameters—including the use of routine, clinical-grade acquisitions—enables the generation of such datasets by pooling heterogeneous data across disparate clinical units, without the need for costly and logistically difficult MR sequence optimisation. High-dimensional modelling can thus be readily brought into practice. A question which can be addressed in future studies is whether the regional brain volume and disconnectome trajectories that were detected as the “most important” are truly the most important outcomes or are indirect measures of other changes or methodological issues such as the anisotropy of the clinical scans. However, while high-quality, isotropic imaging is bound to produce better “fingerprints” of response and may alter the contribution of brain areas thereby more reliably quantified, imaging only practicable in specialist academic centres is here shown to be unnecessary (even if always desirable) and would likely maintain or amplify the advantage of our approach. Where the pattern of detected change is convincingly an arrest or reversal of the pathological, it may be used as an independent measure of response to treatment in a specific patient, collaterally with clinical measures. Such a use is logically identical with counting the number of new lesions or other established radiologist-derived metrics, differing only in its sensitivity. As with any other radiological metric, corroboration by subsequent clinical evolution would be an important part of its development. Second, the pattern of detected change may be used to interpret individual clinical changes with greater precision. For example, where the pattern of cortical disconnection or atrophy is shown to impinge heavily on areas of the brain concerned with cognition, motor clinical measures are likely to be much less sensitive than cognitive ones, and ought to be commensurately weighted. Determining the specific contribution of any one factor within a given population of patients naturally depends on our ability to model the many confounding factors that contribute to the outcome of interest. Where the variability introduced by confounders is treated simply as noise the sensitivity for detecting the effect of the factor we seek is commensurately reduced. In a randomised controlled trial of an intervention, a better model of the imaging outcome thus enhances our ability to detect a true imaging response to treatment, and should be used where this is an independent outcome of interest. Such a model would also enhance our ability to identify incidental factors that interact with the treatment, enabling us better to identify biological features that modulate treatment responsiveness. Where the outcome of interest is purely clinical, capturing its high-dimensional imaging correlates allows us to weight the predicted clinical eloquence of the treatment effect, enhancing its detection. The imaging response is here used to deconfound the clinical from the interaction between disease patterns and the underlying functional anatomy. Naturally, these applications will require more than the imaging response models on which they are all founded, but our objective here is to outline the horizon of possibilities our general approach discloses. The clinical implication of applying high-dimensional modelling to predict the imaging response to a treatment to patients with multiple sclerosis is that individual patients may be counselled about their probability of responding to a specific therapy prior to treatment initiation, or soon after, thereby increasing the possibility of initiating the most effective treatment for their individual disease profile. Pharmacological companies may use the individual prediction of treatment response provided by this technology to select patients who are more likely to respond to a specific therapy, with consequent reduction in the sample size and cost of the trial. Therefore, the future impact of this technology is to improve patient management and treatment, and facilitate the testing of drug efficacy and monitoring of treatment response. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the value of modelling routine imaging data with high-dimensional techniques that closely reflect the complexity of the brain, not only as a tool for illuminating diseases mechanisms, but as a practical, real-world means of determining the power of therapeutic interventions to change them, both for individual patient care and interventional studies. We identified relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis patients treated with natalizumab at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK, according to local, standard-of-care protocols, for whom at least one full-brain scan pre- or post-initiation of natalizumab was available. This yielded imaging data from 124 patients (563 scans from 2001 to 2016), acquired using routine, clinical MRI protocols with six different 1.5 T or 3 T scanners (Siemens, Philips, and GE), all of which were irrevocably anonymised. Clinical characteristics of the patients corresponded to the standard clinical indications for initiating natalizumab in the UK, where natalizumab is licensed as a second-line treatment, and were typical of such cohorts (Table , Supplementary Table ). Our analysis used T1-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) scans, having an average voxel resolution of 1 × 1 × 6 mm, which is typical of routine, standard-of-care, brain MR imaging in the UK. Acquisition and other instrumental parameters varied both across and within patients. The study had ethical and institutional approval at University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust for consentless analysis of fully-anonymised, routinely collected data and was performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations. To construct models of imaging response, we extracted a rich, multivariate set of parameters from each image—an imaging “fingerprint”—and monitored their evolution over the available time series. To minimise bias and maximise practicability, all processing was fully automated. We implemented well-established solutions to each of the three necessary steps: anatomical registration and regional brain parcellation, lesion segmentation and brain disconnection estimation (“disconnectome”) (Fig. ). In brief, the Geodesic Information Flows (GIF) method was applied to each T1-weighted image to generate a set of 144 regions-of-interest, both natively and in standard Montreal Neurological Institute 152 (MNI152) stereotactic space. The GIF method has previously been successfully used for the parcellation of anisotropic brain MR images. In parallel, focal white matter lesions were segmented from the FLAIR images in conjunction with the T1 data using a dual-modality approach, combining patch match and expectation maximisation algorithms, also both natively and in MNI152 space. The resultant lesion masks were checked and validated by a neurologist (RC) and a neuroradiologist (FB): all were found to be satisfactory. Finally, we computed whole-brain, voxel-wise, probabilistic maps of disconnection in MNI152 space using the Brain Connectivity and Behaviour toolkit. This toolkit estimates the probability of disconnection of each brain region by combining the localisation of the white matter damage with a probabilistic tractographic atlas. Each white matter lesion is thus projected to the brain regions connected by the tracts it disrupts (see Fig. ). The outputs from these steps were total lesion volume, number of lesions, total brain volume, and a high-dimensional imaging “fingerprint” of 288 variables, incorporating regional brain volumes within the GIF parcellation, and their estimated degrees of disconnection (Table ). To facilitate the extraction of the signal of interest—the specific effect of the intervention—it is desirable to minimise variability arising from other factors with a bearing on the appearance of the brain. The covariates of age, gender, scanner manufacturer, magnetic field strength, disease duration, Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score, and voxel size (T1 and FLAIR) were therefore regressed out of all the imaging-derived parameters using BayesReg. Such cofounder removal is kin with the covariance adjustment widely used in trials and observational studies. Total lesion volume, total brain volume and regional brain volumes were normalised by the total intracranial volume. To confirm that the confounders were successfully removed, we separately fitted multivariate models attempting to predict them and confirmed that they could not. All subsequent analyses used regional and global parameters deconfounded in this way. Our objective is to detect a difference—before and after the start of treatment—of the of the imaging-derived parameters. The rate of change is simply quantified by the of a line fitted to two or more points dispersed over time. We therefore performed—independently for each variable—linear regression on the sets of available scans before and after the start of treatment, taking the slope as a measure of the rate of change of the relevant parameter over time (Fig. ). For example, the normalised volume of the thalamus, indexed on each of the pre-treatment scans, was linearly regressed against time to yield a pre-treatment slope, and the same was done on the post-treatment scans to yield a post-treatment slope. The process was replicated for each area and each patient, and for both volumes and disconnections, yielding two sets of slopes for each patient—before and after treatment—for each of the 288 variables and their derived low-dimensional aggregates. For some patients only a pre-treatment ( = 16) or post-treatment ( = 60) slope was available for reasons of data non-availability. The accuracy of slope estimates will inevitably vary with the number and timing of individual scans. To minimise any resultant confounding effects, we converted each slope to a trajectory by taking its sign, yielding +1 for a positive slope, and −1 for a negative slope (Fig. ). Where a slope is exactly 0, e.g. for ordinal or bounded variables, a third class denoting no change (slope = 0) was introduced. Note that the cost of minimising potential bias here is loss of some information on the relatively reliability of each slope estimate, reducing our ability to reject noise arising from variability over short intervals. A potential reduction in sensitivity is, however, preferable to retaining information that might be a source of bias. Equally, though greater sensitivity could be achieved by explicitly modelling global, disease non-specific effects of an intervention such as pseudoatrophy, the risk of introducing bias motivates us to desist. Since only relatively weak, population-level lateralisation of the impact of multiple sclerosis on the brain has been observed, and there are no grounds for expecting lateralised treatment effects, we collapsed trajectories across homologous regions of each hemisphere, taking the sum of the trajectories for each pair. This increases the compactness of our models without likely substantial loss of information. To quantify the effect of dimensionality on our ability to detect an imaging response to treatment, we evaluated the performance of conventional, low- and the proposed, high-dimensional models in detecting whether a set of trajectories belonged to the pre- or post-treatment period. The outcome was, therefore, our ability to differentiate between measurements made in the pre- vs. post-treatment period. We used two different classifiers: support vector machines (SVM) and extremely randomised trees (ERT) implemented in scikit-learn. They were chosen as representative of two different, widely used architectures that exhibit different degrees of flexibility, the latter greater than the former, allowing us to explore the effects of maximal model capacity independently of the input dimensionality. Cross-validation was performed using bootstrapping (500 iterations), fully holding-out each test set, and randomly allocating 80% of the cases for training and 20% for testing at each iteration (Supplementary code snippet ). The randomisation and bootstrapping were carried out at the subject level and were constrained to prevent the selection of the same patient’s data for both training and testing at the same time, in the case of patients who had both pre- and post-natalizumab trajectories available ( = 27). The parameters of the two classifiers were tuned manually (with the same bootstrapped, out-of-fold, cross-validated setup described above and shown in Supplementary code snippet ), the final settings are given in Table . We used the greedy, forward-stepwise feature selection algorithm shown in Supplementary code snippet which utilises the mean bootstrapped, out-of-fold, cross-validation AUC as the performance measure. This approach is preferable over the use of feature importances that can be obtained from classifiers such as randomised trees. Unlike the latter which measure feature importances based on the in-fold data they see during training, the importance of each feature in our method is measured using bootstrapped, out-of-fold, cross-validation, thus giving unbiased performance estimates. The selection of low- and high-dimensional features, and in the case of the latter, the selection of regional volume, and regional disconnectome features were carried out separately. Our final predictors were then the trajectories of the number of lesions, total lesion volume, and total brain volume (for the conventional, low-dimensional case), and a high-dimensional “imaging fingerprint”, which incorporated the trajectories of 23 lesion- and 20 tissue-derived features extracted from MR images acquired at pre- or post-treatment patient visits. Once the selection of regional volume and the disconnectome features was completed, the best high-dimensional model was then constructed as one which provided a weighted average of the predictions made by the best high-dimensional model based solely on regional brain volume trajectories, and the best high-dimensional model based solely on regional brain disconnectome trajectories. This approach was chosen over one which incorporates both dimensions simultaneously as it allows us to test the performance of models that incorporate only volumetric and disconnectome metrics, while providing a clearer understanding of which volumetric and disconnectome measures contribute more to imaging response detection. Feature selection was carried out once and the same features were subsequently used throughout. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to quantify the detection performance of each model, qualified statistically by the area under the ROC curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. Two-sided, two-sample Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests were used for statistical validation and significance values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Performance values were aggregated with respect to bootstraps in terms of the mean and the standard error. We also investigated the performance of conventional, low-dimensional and the proposed, high-dimensional models to detect the imaging response to treatment in simulated, RCTs of the intervention enrolling varying numbers of patients (ranging from 19 to 124 in number). Each RCT was simulated by randomly choosing a subset of patients and evaluating the association between classifier output and imaging response with Fisher’s exact test. The procedure was repeated 500 times, yielding for each a mean odds ratio and an achieved power given a significance threshold of  = 0.01, both with 95% confidence intervals. Statistical power calculations were performed with the G*Power software. Further information on research design is available in the linked to this article.

A: Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody disorders (MOGAD) is an idiopathic, inflammatory, demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS). MOG is a glycoprotein uniquely expressed in oligodendrocytes in the CNS. MOG antibodies were originally thought to be involved in multiple sclerosis (MS), but subsequent studies found it to be a distinct disease. MOGAD have many similarities to neuromyelitis optica but several studies have demonstrated they have unique clinical features, treatment response, and prognosis. MOGAD were initially identified in NMOSD antibody negative patients. Pathologically NMOSD is classified as am astrocytopathy, while MOGAD are classified as oligodendrogliopathies. A: The exact incidence and prevalence of MOGASD is not known. The typical age of onset is in the 20-30s, but it can occur in both pediatric and older patents. Recent studies  show an equal prevalence in males and females. Most patients are Caucasian. MOG IgG associated disorders are generally regarded as a non-familial disease. A: MOGAD have several clinical presentations. One of the most common presentations is similar to neuromyelitis spectrum disorder (NMOSD) with recurrent optic neuritis, transverse myelitis, or both. In one adult clinical cohort study the combination of optic nerve, spinal cord, or a combination accounted for >90% of cases.  The associated optic neuritis can be unilateral or bilateral. Another common presentation is that of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM). ADEM can present with typical symptoms of encephalitis including decreased consciousness, headache, and behavioral changes. Seizures can also occur in the context of MOGAD associated ADEM presentations and occur at varying rates. Other presentations include brainstem syndrome and short segment transverse myelitis. In general, older patients are more likely to present with optic neuritis and younger patients are more likely to present with encephalomyelitis. A: In patients that present with an isolated myelitis many have a longitudinally extensive lesions (≥3 contiguous vertebral segments). Longitudinally extensive lesions were seen in 84.4% of patients with isolated myelitis and 55.6% of patients with myelitis plus optic neuritis at MOGAD presentation. There is no known unique radiographic pattern for MOG, but leptomeningeal enhancement, thalamic lesions, pontine lesions, deep white matter lesions, tumefactive, poorly defined lesions, and cortical lesions were more common in MOGAD than NMOSD or non-MOG antibody cases. The lesions also typically have dramatic improvement or resolution over time. The MRI findings in the setting of ADEM are the typical diffuse signal changes in the cortical and deep grey matter and subcortical and deep white matter on T2-weighted and FLAIR images. There have also been reports of scattered linear or nodular enhancement in active lesions with restricted diffusion. A: There is significant clinical overlap  with NMOSD. MOGAD has been reported to account for 40% of seronegative NMOSD. Compared to NMO aquaporin 4 IgG (AQP4-IgG) patients, MOG patients are younger, lack the female predominance, more frequently have a monophasic course, more often present with ADEM and often have a better outcome. The optic nerve is more commonly affected in MOG disease and more likely to have simultaneous affection of both optic nerves. In a UK series seizures were more frequently observed in MOG (14.7%) compared to AQP4 IgG patients (1%). Pathologically NMOSD is classified as an astrocytopathy, while MOG IgG associated disorders are classified as oligodendrogliopathies. A: Although the clinical presentation is closer to NMOSD there still is overlap with MS as optic neuritis and myelitis are common in all three conditions. The underlying immunopathological features of MOGAD are more closely related to MS than NMO. Since MOG is a more ubiquitous protein than AQP4 and expressed on CNS myelin sheaths there is more associated demyelination similar to MS. MOGAD patients are slightly younger and have less of a female predominance than MS. Although MOG patients often will have abnormalities on brain MRI these lesions have a distinct appearance that is different from MS lesions. Q: What are the unique features in pediatric patients with MOGAD? A: In the pediatric population, MOG IgG is often associated with an ADEM presentation preceded by infection. Pediatric patients are also more likely to have transient titer elevation which predicts a monophasic course. Persistent elevation predicts a recurrent course; therefore pediatric patients should be monitored. A: Recently developed cell based assays are available to test for the presence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) targeting MOG. Specifically a live cell-based methodology is preferred because it was shown to have a superior positive predictive value to the fixed cell assays. The exact sensitivity and specificity depends on the assay and are still being defined. CSF can have lymphocytic pleocytosis, normal or mildly elevated protein, and rare oligoclonal bands.  It is not helpful to test for MOG in the CSF. A: Recently proposed diagnostic criteria for MOG IgG associated disorders must meet the 3 following criteria: Laboratory finding: serum positive MOG-IgG by cell based assay Clinical findings of any of the following presentations: Optic neuritis, including chronic relapsing optic neuropathy (CRION) Brain or brainstem syndrome compatible with demyelination A: We consider  testing any patient with any of these clinical presentations: ADEM, optic neuritis, transverse myelitis. We will also test MOG IgG in patients with brain or brainstem lesions atypical for MS. A: In patients who test positive and presented with an optic neuritis or transverse myelitis we do not routinely re-test MOG IgG. For patients that present with an initial presentation of ADEM, especially in the pediatric population seropositivity can be transient and repeat testing may be of value. In one cohort 8 (4 adults and 4 children) of 51 patients had transient positivity and only 1 adult of those 8 patients had a relapse. This finding suggests that in patients with an ADEM presentation it would be reasonable to re-test for MOG IgG 6 months after initial presentation to aide with determining likelihood of recurrent disease. If a patient has an initial positive test and converts to negative this is more likely to indicate a monophasic course; whereas persistent positive results predicts recurrence. In a patient who presented with a syndrome typical of MOG IgG disease who tested negative at presentation we often consider retesting 6 months after initial testing or in the setting of recurrent disease. Q: What is the expected course and prognosis of MOGAD? A: MOG IgG may present as a monophasic or relapsing condition. In the context of ADEM as the presenting symptom it can be monophasic, especially in the pediatric population. There are now many reports of recurrent disease in the setting of positive MOG IgG. High and persistent MOG antibody titers are more likely to predict a relapsing course. The rate of relapsing disease varies by series, but has been reported to be as high as 72-88%. The overall prognosis of MOG is favorable compared to AQP4 positive disease with better recovery and less disability. Q: What is the general approach to a MOGAD relapse? A: The current approach to relapses is the same as an in NMOSD. Intravenous corticosteroids are our initial acute treatment. The typical Mellen Center regimen is methylprednisolone 1000mg IV as a single daily dose on 3-5 consecutive days followed by a prolonged steroid taper. We use varying taper regimens anywhere from 2-6 months depending on the severity of presentation and planned long term regimen. We consider plasmapheresis or IVIG as a second line treatment for patients not steroid responsive. Most reported cases showed excellent response to treatment with full recovery. A: There is limited data on long term management of recurrent MOG IgG associated disorders and there are no randomized trials to guide therapy. As with acute treatment our approach is similar to NMOSD maintenance therapy. There have been successful reports with the use of rituximab, mycophenolate mofetil, IVIG, and azathioprine.

Until recently, ALS was classified primarily within the neuromuscular domain, although new imaging and neuropathological data have indicated the involvement of the non-motor neuraxis in disease pathology. In most patients, the mechanisms underlying the development of ALS are poorly understood, although a subset of patients have familial disease and harbour mutations in genes that have various roles in neuronal function. Two possible disease-modifying therapies that can slow disease progression are available for ALS, but patient management is largely mediated by symptomatic therapies, such as the use of muscle relaxants for spasticity and speech therapy for dysarthria.

Información sobre el coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). “I approach even the most complex patients with the understanding that all disorders are treatable.” I approach even the most complex patients with the understanding that while few disorders are ""curable"", all disorders are treatable. The most effective approach often begins with attentive listening and proactive planning. I work closely with a team of dedicated, rigorous multi-disciplinary specialists to provide a comprehensive approach to complex neurological care. Our goal is to increase both the quality and the duration of life for children and adults affected by serious neurological disorders. Although I see children and adults with a wide range of neurological disorders, my primary areas of clinical and scientific expertise include genetic and inflammatory disorders of the brain and spinal cord. Many of these disorders are associated with a high level of disability and require complex care strategies that necessitate the involvement of multiple specialists. I make every effort to incorporate the medical priorities of the patient and caregiver in devising the medical plan. My goal is to provide both information and guidance to patients and families making complex medical decisions.

Sotirchos, E. S., Bhargava, P., Eckstein, C., Van Haren, K., Baynes, M., Ntranos, A., Gocke, A., Steinman, L., Mowry, E. M., Calabresi, P. A. To study the safety profile and characterize the immunologic effects of high- vs low-dose cholecalciferol supplementation in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS).In this double-blind, single-center randomized pilot study, 40 patients with relapsing-remitting MS were randomized to receive 10,400 IU or 800 IU cholecalciferol daily for 6 months. Assessments were performed at baseline and 3 and 6 months.Mean increase of 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels from baseline to final visit was larger in the high-dose group (34.9 ng/mL; 95% confidence interval [CI] 25.0-44.7 ng/mL) than in the low-dose group (6.9 ng/mL; 95% CI 1.0-13.7 ng/mL). Adverse events were minor and did not differ between the 2 groups. Two relapses occurred, one in each treatment arm. In the high-dose group, we found a reduction in the proportion of interleukin-17(+)CD4(+) T cells (p = 0.016), CD161(+)CD4(+) T cells (p = 0.03), and effector memory CD4(+) T cells (p = 0.021) with a concomitant increase in the proportion of central memory CD4(+) T cells (p = 0.018) and naive CD4(+) T cells (p = 0.04). These effects were not observed in the low-dose group.Cholecalciferol supplementation with 10,400 IU daily is safe and tolerable in patients with MS and exhibits in vivo pleiotropic immunomodulatory effects in MS, which include reduction of interleukin-17 production by CD4(+) T cells and decreased proportion of effector memory CD4(+) T cells with concomitant increase in central memory CD4(+) T cells and naive CD4(+) T cells.This study provides Class I evidence that cholecalciferol supplementation with 10,400 IU daily is safe and well-tolerated in patients with MS and exhibits in vivo pleiotropic immunomodulatory effects. Acute Flaccid Myelitis of Unknown Etiology in California, 2012-2015 Van Haren, K., Ayscue, P., Waubant, E., Clayton, A., Sheriff, H., Yagi, S., Glenn-Finer, R., Padilla, T., Strober, J. B., Aldrovandi, G., Wadford, D. A., Chiu, C. Y., Xia, D., Harriman, K., Watt, J. P., Glaser, C. A. There has been limited surveillance for acute flaccid paralysis in North America since the regional eradication of poliovirus. In 2012, the California Department of Public Health received several reports of acute flaccid paralysis cases of unknown etiology.To quantify disease incidence and identify potential etiologies of acute flaccid paralysis cases with evidence of spinal motor neuron injury.Case series of acute flaccid paralysis in patients with radiological or neurophysiological findings suggestive of spinal motor neuron involvement reported to the California Department of Public Health with symptom onset between June 2012 and July 2015. Patients meeting diagnostic criteria for other acute flaccid paralysis etiologies were excluded. Cerebrospinal fluid, serum samples, nasopharyngeal swab specimens, and stool specimens were submitted to the state laboratory for infectious agent testing.Case incidence and infectious agent association.Fifty-nine cases were identified. Median age was 9 years (interquartile range [IQR], 4-14 years; 50 of the cases were younger than 21 years). Symptoms that preceded or were concurrent included respiratory or gastrointestinal illness (n=54), fever (n=47), and limb myalgia (n=41). Fifty-six patients had T2 hyperintensity of spinal gray matter on magnetic resonance imaging and 43 patients had cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis. During the course of the initial hospitalization, 42 patients received intravenous steroids; 43, intravenous immunoglobulin; and 13, plasma exchange; or a combination of these treatments. Among 45 patients with follow-up data, 38 had persistent weakness at a median follow-up of 9 months (IQR, 3-12 months). Two patients, both immunocompromised adults, died within 60 days of symptom onset. Enteroviruses were the most frequently detected pathogen in either nasopharynx swab specimens, stool specimens, serum samples (15 of 45 patients tested). No pathogens were isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid. The incidence of reported cases was significantly higher during a national enterovirus D68 outbreak occurring from August 2014 through January 2015 (0.16 cases per 100,000 person-years) compared with other monitoring periods (0.028 cases per 100,000 person-years; P<.001).In this series of patients identified in California from June 2012 through July 2015, clinical manifestations indicated a rare but distinct syndrome of acute flaccid paralysis with evidence of spinal motor neuron involvement. The etiology remains undetermined, most patients were children and young adults, and motor weakness was prolonged. View details for Serum autoantibodies to myelin peptides distinguish acute disseminated encephalomyelitis from relapsing- remitting multiple sclerosis. Multiple sclerosis (Houndmills, Basingstoke, England) Van Haren, K., Tomooka, B. H., Kidd, B. A., Banwell, B., Bar-Or, A., Chitnis, T., Tenembaum, S. N., Pohl, D., Rostasy, K., Dale, R. C., O'Connor, K. C., Hafler, D. A., Steinman, L., Robinson, W. H. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) and relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) share overlapping clinical, radiologic and laboratory features at onset. Because autoantibodies may contribute to the pathogenesis of both diseases, we sought to identify autoantibody biomarkers that are capable of distinguishing them. METHODS: We used custom antigen arrays to profile anti-myelin-peptide autoantibodies in sera derived from individuals with pediatric ADEM (n = 15), pediatric multiple sclerosis (Ped MS; n = 11) and adult MS (n = 15). Using isotype-specific secondary antibodies, we profiled both IgG and IgM reactivities. We used Statistical Analysis of Microarrays software to confirm the differences in autoantibody reactivity profiles between ADEM and MS samples. We used Prediction Analysis of Microarrays software to generate and validate prediction algorithms, based on the autoantibody reactivity profiles. RESULTS: ADEM was characterized by IgG autoantibodies targeting epitopes derived from myelin basic protein, proteolipid protein, myelin-associated oligodendrocyte basic glycoprotein, and alpha-B-crystallin. In contrast, MS was characterized by IgM autoantibodies targeting myelin basic protein, proteolipid protein, myelin-associated oligodendrocyte basic glycoprotein and oligodendrocyte-specific protein. We generated and validated prediction algorithms that distinguish ADEM serum (sensitivity 62-86%; specificity 56-79%) from MS serum (sensitivity 40-87%; specificity 62-86%) on the basis of combined IgG and IgM anti-myelin autoantibody reactivity to a small number of myelin peptides. CONCLUSIONS: Combined profiles of serum IgG and IgM autoantibodies identified myelin antigens that may be useful for distinguishing MS from ADEM. Further studies are required to establish clinical utility. Further biological assays are required to delineate the pathogenic potential of these antibodies. Identification of Naturally Occurring Fatty Acids of the Myelin Sheath That Resolve Neuroinflammation Ho, P. P., Kanter, J. L., Johnson, A. M., Srinagesh, H. K., Chang, E., Purdy, T. M., Van Haren, K., Wikoff, W. R., Kind, T., Khademi, M., Matloff, L. Y., Narayana, S., Hur, E. M., Lindstrom, T. M., He, Z., Fiehn, O., Olsson, T., Han, X., Han, M. H., Steinman, L., Robinson, W. H. Lipids constitute 70% of the myelin sheath, and autoantibodies against lipids may contribute to the demyelination that characterizes multiple sclerosis (MS). We used lipid antigen microarrays and lipid mass spectrometry to identify bona fide lipid targets of the autoimmune response in MS brain, and an animal model of MS to explore the role of the identified lipids in autoimmune demyelination. We found that autoantibodies in MS target a phosphate group in phosphatidylserine and oxidized phosphatidylcholine derivatives. Administration of these lipids ameliorated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis by suppressing activation and inducing apoptosis of autoreactive T cells, effects mediated by the lipids' saturated fatty acid side chains. Thus, phospholipids represent a natural anti-inflammatory class of compounds that have potential as therapeutics for MS. Acute flaccid myelitis: cause, diagnosis, and management. Murphy, O.

Acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) is a disabling, polio-like illness mainly affecting children. Outbreaks of AFM have occurred across multiple global regions since 2012, and the disease appears to be caused by non-polio enterovirus infection, posing a major public health challenge. The clinical presentation of flaccid and often profound muscle weakness (which can invoke respiratory failure and other critical complications) can mimic several other acute neurological illnesses. There is no single sensitive and specific test for AFM, and the diagnosis relies on identification of several important clinical, neuroimaging, and cerebrospinal fluid characteristics. Following the acute phase of AFM, patients typically have substantial residual disability and unique long-term rehabilitation needs. In this Review we describe the epidemiology, clinical features, course, and outcomes of AFM to help to guide diagnosis, management, and rehabilitation. Future research directions include further studies evaluating host and pathogen factors, including investigations into genetic, viral, and immunological features of affected patients, host-virus interactions, and investigations of targeted therapeutic approaches to improve the long-term outcomes in this population.

Cellucci, T., Van Mater, H., Graus, F., Muscal, E., Gallentine, W., Klein-Gitelman, M. S., Benseler, S. M., Frankovich, J., Gorman, M. P., Van Haren, K., Dalmau, J., Dale, R. C. OBJECTIVE: Autoimmune encephalitis (AE) is an important and treatable cause of acute encephalitis. Diagnosis of AE in a developing child is challenging because of overlap in clinical presentations with other diseases and complexity of normal behavior changes. Existing diagnostic criteria for adult AE require modification to be applied to children, who differ from adults in their clinical presentations, paraclinical findings, autoantibody profiles, treatment response, and long-term outcomes.METHODS: A subcommittee of the Autoimmune Encephalitis International Working Group collaborated through conference calls and email correspondence to consider the pediatric-specific approach to AE. The subcommittee reviewed the literature of relevant AE studies and sought additional input from other expert clinicians and researchers.RESULTS: Existing consensus criteria for adult AE were refined for use in children. Provisional pediatric AE classification criteria and an algorithm to facilitate early diagnosis are proposed. There is also discussion about how to distinguish pediatric AE from conditions within the differential diagnosis.CONCLUSIONS: Diagnosing AE is based on the combination of a clinical history consistent with pediatric AE and supportive diagnostic testing, which includes but is not dependent on antibody testing. The proposed criteria and algorithm require validation in prospective pediatric cohorts. Genetic and phenotypic spectrum associated with IFIH1 gain-of-function. Rice, G. I., Park, S., Gavazzi, F., Adang, L. A., Ayuk, L. A., Van Eyck, L., Seabra, L., Barrea, C., Battini, R., Belot, A., Berg, S., Billette de Villemeur, T., Bley, A.

M., Orcesi, S., Vanderver, A. L., Hur, S., Crow, Y. J. IFIH1 gain-of-function has been reported as a cause of a type I interferonopathy encompassing a spectrum of autoinflammatory phenotypes including Aicardi-Goutires syndrome and Singleton Merten syndrome. Ascertaining patients through a European and North American collaboration, we set out to describe the molecular, clinical and interferon status of a cohort of individuals with pathogenic heterozygous mutations in IFIH1. We identified 74 individuals from 51 families segregating a total of 27 likely pathogenic mutations in IFIH1. Ten adult individuals, 13.5% of all mutation carriers, were clinically asymptomatic (with seven of these aged over 50 years). All mutations were associated with enhanced type I interferon signaling, including six variants (22%) which were predicted as benign according to multiple in silico pathogenicity programs. The identified mutations cluster close to the ATP binding region of the protein. These data confirm variable expression and non-penetrance as important characteristics of the IFIH1 genotype, a consistent association with enhanced type I interferon signaling, and a common mutational mechanism involving increased RNA binding affinity or decreased efficiency of ATP hydrolysis and filament disassembly rate.

S., Engelen, M., Van Haren, K. X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is the most common genetic peroxisomal disorder with an estimated prevalence of 1:15,000. Approximately two-thirds of males with ALD manifest the inflammatory demyelinating cerebral phenotype (cALD) at some disease stage, in which focal, inflammatory lesions progress over months to years. Hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation can permanently halt cALD progression, but it is only effective if initiated early. Although most cALD lesions progress relentlessly, a subset may spontaneously arrest; subsequent reactivation of these arrested lesions has not been previously detailed.We describe a novel arresting-relapsing variant of cALD.Salient clinical and radiographic studies were reviewed and summarized for cALD patients with episodic deteriorations.We report a series of five unrelated men with spontaneously arrested cALD lesions that subsequently manifested signs of clinical and radiologic lesion progression during longitudinal follow-up. In three of five patients, functional status was too poor to attempt transplant by the time the recurrence was identified. One patient experienced reactivation followed by another period of spontaneous arrest.These cases emphasize the need for continued clinical and radiologic vigilance for adult men with ALD to screen for evidence of new or reactivated cALD lesions to facilitate prompt treatment evaluation. Randomized Clinical Trial of First-Line Genome Sequencing in Pediatric White Matter Disorders. Vanderver, A., Bernard, G., Helman, G., Sherbini, O., Boeck, R., Cohn, J., Collins, A., Demarest, S., Dobbins, K., Emrick, L., Fraser, J., Masser-Frye, D., Hayward, J., Karmarkar, S., Keller, S., Mirrop, S., Mitchell, W., Pathak, S., Sherr, E., van Haren, K., Waters, E., Wilson, J. L., Zhorne, L., Schiffmann, R., van der Knaap, M. S., Pizzino, A., Dubbs, H., Shults, J., Simons, C., Taft, R. J. Genome sequencing (GS) is promising for unsolved leukodystrophies, but its efficacy has not been prospectively studied.A prospective time-delayed cross-over design trial of GS to assess the efficacy of GS as a first-line diagnostic tool for genetic white matter disorders took place between 12/01/2015 - 09/27/2017. Patients were randomized to receive GS immediately with concurrent standard of care (SoC) testing, or to receive SoC testing for four months followed by GS.34 individuals were assessed at interim review. The genetic origin of two patient's leukoencephalopathy was resolved before randomization. Nine patients stratified to the immediate intervention group and 23 patients to the delayed-GS arm. The efficacy of GS was significant relative to SoC in the Immediate (5 of 9 [56%] vs. 0 of 9 [0%]; Wild-Seber p <0.005) and Delayed (control) arms (14 of 23 [61%] vs 5 of 23 [22%]; Wild-Seber p <0.005). The time to diagnosis was significantly shorter in the immediate-GS group (log rank test, p=0.04). The overall diagnostic efficacy of combined GS and SoC approaches was 26 of 34 (76.5% [95% CI=58.8% to 89.3%]) in less than 4 months, greater than historical norms of less than 50% over 5years. Owing to loss of clinical equipoise, the trial design was altered to a single-arm observational study.In this study, first-line GS provided earlier and greater diagnostic efficacy in white matter disorders. We provide an evidence-based diagnostic testing algorithm to enable appropriate clinical GS utilization in this population. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. MRI Surveillance of Boys with X-linked Adrenoleukodystrophy Identified by Newborn Screening: Meta-analysis and Consensus Guidelines. Mallack, E. J., Turk, B. R., Yan, H., Price, C., Mlis, M. D., Moser, A. B., Becker, C., Hollandsworth, K., Adang, L., Vanderver, A., Van Haren, K., Ruzhnikov, M., Kurtzberg, J., Maegawa, G., Orchard, P. J., Lund, T. C., Raymond, G. V., Regelmann, M., Orsini, J. J., Seeger, E., Kemp, S., Eichler, F., Fatemi, A. Among boys with X-Linked adrenoleukodystrophy, a subset will develop childhood cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy (CCALD). CCALD is typically lethal without hematopoietic stem cell transplant before or soon after symptom onset. We sought to establish evidence-based guidelines detailing the neuroimaging surveillance of boys with neurologically asymptomatic adrenoleukodystrophy.To establish the most frequent age and diagnostic neuroimaging modality for CCALD, we completed a meta-analysis of relevant studies published between January 1, 1970 and September 10, 2019. We used the consensus development conference method to incorporate the resulting data into guidelines to inform the timing and techniques for neuroimaging surveillance. Final guideline agreement was defined as >80% consensus.One hundred twenty-three studies met inclusion criteria yielding 1,285 patients. The overall mean age of CCALD diagnosis is 7.91years old. The median age of CCALD diagnosis calculated from individual patient data is 7.0years old (IQR: 6.0 - 9.5, n=349). Ninety percent of patients were diagnosed between 3 and 12. Conventional MRI was most frequently reported, comprised most often of T2-weighted and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI. The expert panel achieved 95.7% consensus on the following surveillance parameters: (1) Obtain an MRI between 12 and 18 months old. (2) Obtain a second MRI 1 year after baseline. (3) Between 3 and 12years old, obtain a contrast-enhanced MRI every 6 months. (4) After 12years, obtain an annual MRI.Boys with adrenoleukodystrophy identified early in life should be monitored with serial brain MRIs during the period of highest risk for conversion to CCALD.

P., Gallentine, W., Kohlenberg, T. M., Frankovich, J., Jiang, Y. H., Van Haren, K. Phenotypic and biological characterization of rare monogenic disorders represents 1 of the most important avenues toward understanding the mechanisms of human disease. Among patients with SH3 and multiple ankyrin repeat domains 3 (SHANK3) mutations, a subset will manifest neurologic regression, psychosis, and mood disorders. However, which patients will be affected, when, and why are important unresolved questions. Authors of recent studies suggest neuronal SHANK3 expression is modulated by both inflammatory and hormonal stimuli. In this case series, we describe 4 independent clinical observations of an immunotherapy responsive phenotype of peripubertal-onset neuropsychiatric regression in 4 girls with pathogenic SHANK3 mutations. Each child exhibited a history of stable, mild-to-moderate lifelong developmental disability until 12 to 14 years of age, at which time each manifested a similar, subacute-onset neurobehavioral syndrome. Symptoms included mutism, hallucinations, insomnia, inconsolable crying, obsessive-compulsive behaviors, loss of self-care, and urinary retention and/or incontinence. Symptoms were relatively refractory to antipsychotic medication but improved after immunomodulatory treatment. All 4 patients exhibited chronic relapsing courses during a period of treatment and follow-up ranging from 3 to 6 years. Two of the 4 girls recovered their premorbid level of functioning. We briefly review the scientific literature to offer a conceptual and molecular framework for understanding these clinical observations. Future clinical and translational investigations in this realm may offer insights into mechanisms and therapies bridging immune function and human behavior. Acute Flaccid Myelitis of Unknown Etiology in California, 2012-2015. Van Haren, K., Ayscue, P., Waubant, E., Clayton, A., Sheriff, H., Yagi, S., Glenn-Finer, R., Padilla, T., Strober, J. B., Aldrovandi, G., Wadford, D. A., Chiu, C. Y., Xia, D., Harriman, K., Watt, J. P., Glaser, C. A. There has been limited surveillance for acute flaccid paralysis in North America since the regional eradication of poliovirus. In 2012, the California Department of Public Health received several reports of acute flaccid paralysis cases of unknown etiology.To quantify disease incidence and identify potential etiologies of acute flaccid paralysis cases with evidence of spinal motor neuron injury.Case series of acute flaccid paralysis in patients with radiological or neurophysiological findings suggestive of spinal motor neuron involvement reported to the California Department of Public Health with symptom onset between June 2012 and July 2015. Patients meeting diagnostic criteria for other acute flaccid paralysis etiologies were excluded. Cerebrospinal fluid, serum samples, nasopharyngeal swab specimens, and stool specimens were submitted to the state laboratory for infectious agent testing.Case incidence and infectious agent association.Fifty-nine cases were identified. Median age was 9 years (interquartile range [IQR], 4-14 years; 50 of the cases were younger than 21 years). Symptoms that preceded or were concurrent included respiratory or gastrointestinal illness (n=54), fever (n=47), and limb myalgia (n=41). Fifty-six patients had T2 hyperintensity of spinal gray matter on magnetic resonance imaging and 43 patients had cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis. During the course of the initial hospitalization, 42 patients received intravenous steroids; 43, intravenous immunoglobulin; and 13, plasma exchange; or a combination of these treatments. Among 45 patients with follow-up data, 38 had persistent weakness at a median follow-up of 9 months (IQR, 3-12 months). Two patients, both immunocompromised adults, died within 60 days of symptom onset. Enteroviruses were the most frequently detected pathogen in either nasopharynx swab specimens, stool specimens, serum samples (15 of 45 patients tested). No pathogens were isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid. The incidence of reported cases was significantly higher during a national enterovirus D68 outbreak occurring from August 2014 through January 2015 (0.16 cases per 100,000 person-years) compared with other monitoring periods (0.028 cases per 100,000 person-years; P<.001).In this series of patients identified in California from June 2012 through July 2015, clinical manifestations indicated a rare but distinct syndrome of acute flaccid paralysis with evidence of spinal motor neuron involvement. The etiology remains undetermined, most patients were children and young adults, and motor weakness was prolonged.

View details for Incidence, Risk Factors and Outcomes Among Children With Acute Flaccid Myelitis: A Population-based Cohort Study in a California Health Network Between 2011 and 2016. Kane, M. S., Sonne, C., Zhu, S., Malhotra, A., Van Haren, K., Messacar, K., Glaser, C. A. BACKGROUND: Acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) is defined as an acute onset of limb weakness with longitudinal spinal gray matter lesions. Reporting bias and misdiagnosis confound epidemiologic studies of AFM. We mitigated these confounders by using a large data set to assess AFM incidence, risk factors and outcomes in a fixed population.METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted within Kaiser Permanente Northern California population among children 1-18 years. Cases met radiographic and clinical criteria for AFM and were confirmed by two clinicians. Clinical and demographic data were assessed.RESULTS: A total of 28 patients met study criteria for AFM between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2016, an overall rate of 1.46 per 100,000 person-years. Incidence increased from 0.30 to 1.43 cases/per 100,000 person-years between 2011 and 2016, respectively. Median age was 9 years. Risk factors included male sex, Asian ancestry and history of asthma, atopic dermatitis or head injury. Risk factors associated with poliomyelitis were absent. Prodromal illness was common; enterovirus was the most common pathogen detected (n = 5). Among the 27 patients with 12-month follow-up, most demonstrated some improvement, 11 (41.0%) had full recovery, but several had significant deficits with one death reported after the study period.CONCLUSIONS: We employed a closed-population study to generate AFM incidence, risk and outcome data. Our findings support previous reports of male sex and atopy as risk factors. Interval increase in incidence, predisposing Asian ancestry and history of head injury were unique findings to this study. Overall prognosis was better than prior reports, but recovery was incomplete in several patients.

View details for View details for Allogeneic HSCT for adult-onset leukoencephalopathy with spheroids and pigmented glia. Gelfand, J. M., Greenfield, A. L., Barkovich, M., Mendelsohn, B. A., Van Haren, K., Hess, C. P., Mannis, G. N. Adult-onset leukoencephalopathy with spheroids and pigmented glia (ALSP) is an autosomal dominant leukoencephalopathy caused by mutations in colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R). Here we report clinical and imaging outcomes following allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in two patients with ALSP at the University of California, San Francisco between January 2016 and December 2017. Patient 1 proceeded to transplantation at age 53 with a haplo-identical sibling donor. Patient 2, whose sister and mother had died of the disease, proceeded to transplantation at age 49 with a 12/12 human leukocyte antigen-matched unrelated donor. Both patients received reduced intensity conditioning regimens. At 28 and 26 months post-HSCT, respectively, both patients were alive, without evidence of graft-versus-host disease, with major infection at 1 year in one and new-onset seizures in the other. In both cases, neurological worsening continued post-HSCT; however, the progression in cognitive deficits, overall functional status and gait impairment gradually stabilized. There was continued progression of parkinsonism in both patients. On brain MRI, within 1 year there was stabilization of T2/FLAIR abnormalities, and after 2 years there was complete resolution of abnormal multifocal reduced diffusion. In summary, after >2 years of follow-up, allogeneic HSCT in ALSP led to interval resolution of diffusion MRI abnormalities, stabilization of T2/FLAIR MRI abnormalities, and partial clinical stabilization, supportive of treatment response. Allogeneic HSCT may be beneficial in ALSP by providing a supply of bone marrow-derived brain-engrafting myeloid cells with donor wild-type CSF1R to repopulate the microglial niche. Pneumonia Prevention Strategies for Children With Neurologic Impairment. Lin, J. L., Van Haren, K., Rigdon, J., Saynina, O., Song, H., Buu, M. C., Thakur, Y., Srinivas, N., Asch, S. M., Sanders, L. M. Children with neurologic impairment (NI) face high risk of recurrent severe pneumonia, with prevention strategies of unknown effectiveness. We evaluated the comparative effectiveness of secondary prevention strategies for severe pneumonia in children with NI.We included children enrolled in California Children's Services between July 1, 2009, and June 30, 2014, with NI and 1 pneumonia hospitalization. We examined associations between subsequent pneumonia hospitalization and expert-recommended prevention strategies: dental care, oral secretion management, gastric acid suppression, gastrostomy tube placement, chest physiotherapy, outpatient antibiotics before index hospitalization, and clinic visit before or after index hospitalization. We used a 1:2 propensity score matched model to adjust for covariates, including sociodemographics, medical complexity, and severity of index hospitalization.Among 3632 children with NI and index pneumonia hospitalization, 1362 (37.5%) had subsequent pneumonia hospitalization. Only dental care was associated with decreased risk of subsequent pneumonia hospitalization (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 0.64; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.49-0.85). Exposures associated with increased risk included gastrostomy tube placement (aOR: 2.15; 95% CI: 1.63-2.85), chest physiotherapy (aOR: 2.03; 95% CI: 1.29-3.20), outpatient antibiotics before hospitalization (aOR: 1.42; 95% CI: 1.06-1.92), clinic visit before (aOR: 1.30; 95% CI: 1.11-1.52), and after index hospitalization (aOR: 1.72; 95% CI: 1.35-2.20).Dental care was associated with decreased recurrence of severe pneumonia. Several strategies, including gastrostomy tube placement, were associated with increased recurrence, possibly due to unresolved confounding by indication. Our results support a clinical trial of dental care to prevent severe pneumonia in children with NI. Clinical Subpopulations in a Sample of North American Children Diagnosed With Acute Flaccid Myelitis, 2012-2016. Elrick, M. J., Gordon-Lipkin, E., Crawford, T. O., Van Haren, K., Messacar, K., Thornton, N., Dee, E., Voskertchian, A., Nance, J. R., Munoz, L. S., Gorman, M. P., Benson, L. A., Thomas, D. L., Pardo, C. A., Milstone, A. M., Duggal, P. Importance: Acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) is an emerging poliolike illness of children whose clinical spectrum and associated pathogens are only partially described. The case definition is intentionally encompassing for epidemiologic surveillance to capture all potential AFM cases. Defining a restrictive, homogenous subpopulation may aid our understanding of this emerging disease.Objective: To evaluate the extent to which the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) case definition of AFM incorporates possible alternative diagnoses and to assess the plausibility of a case definition that enriches the biological homogeneity of AFM for inclusion in research studies.Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective case analysis of children younger than 18 years diagnosed as having AFM between 2012 and 2016 using the CDC case definition. Group 1 included patients recruited from the United States and Canada based on the CDC case definition of AFM. Group 2 included patients referred to the Johns Hopkins Transverse Myelitis Center for evaluation of suspected AFM. Patients' records and imaging data were critically reviewed by 3 neurologists to identify those cases with definable alternative diagnoses, and the remaining patients were categorized as having restrictively defined AFM (rAFM). Clinical characteristics were compared between patients with rAFM (cases) and those with alternative diagnoses, and a case description distinguishing these AFM groups was identified. Interrater reliability of this description was confirmed for a subset of cases by a fourth neurologist. Data were analyzed between May 2017 and November 2018.Main Outcomes and Measures: Proportion of patients with possible alternative diagnosis.Results: Of the 45 patients who met the CDC AFM case definition and were included, the mean age was 6.1 years; 27 were boys (60%); and 37 were white (82%), 3 were Asian (7%), 1 was Hispanic (2%), and 4 were mixed race/ethnicity (9%). Of the included patients, 34 were classified as having rAFM, and 11 had alternate diagnoses (including transverse myelitis, other demyelinating syndromes, spinal cord stroke, Guillain-Barre syndrome, Chiari I myelopathy, and meningitis). Factors differing between groups were primarily asymmetry of weakness, lower motor neuron signs, preceding viral syndrome, symptoms evolving over hours to days, absence of sensory deficits, and magnetic resonance imaging findings. A case description was able to reliably define the rAFM group.Conclusions and Relevance: We present an approach for defining a homogeneous research population that may more accurately reflect the pathogenesis of the prototypical poliomyelitis-like subgroup of AFM. The definition of rAFM forms a blueprint for inclusion criteria in future research efforts, but more work is required for refinement and external validation. Safety, tolerability, and efficacy of fluoxetine as an antiviral for acute flaccid myelitis. Messacar, K., Sillau, S., Hopkins, S. E., Otten, C., Wilson-Murphy, M., Wong, B., Santoro, J. D., Treister, A., Bains, H. K., Torres, A., Zabrocki, L., Glanternik, J. R., Hurst, A. L., Martin, J. A., Schreiner, T., Makhani, N., DeBiasi, R. L., Kruer, M. C., Tremoulet, A. H., Van Haren, K., Desai, J., Benson, L. A., Gorman, M. P., Abzug, M. J., Tyler, K. L., Dominguez, S. R. OBJECTIVE: To determine the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of fluoxetine for proven or presumptive enterovirus (EV) D68-associated acute flaccid myelitis (AFM).METHODS: A multicenter cohort study of US patients with AFM in 2015-2016 compared serious adverse events (SAEs), adverse effects, and outcomes between fluoxetine-treated patients and untreated controls. Fluoxetine was administered at the discretion of treating providers with data gathered retrospectively. The primary outcome was change in summative limb strength score (SLSS; sum of Medical Research Council strength in all 4 limbs, ranging from 20 [normal strength] to 0 [complete quadriparesis]) between initial examination and latest follow-up, with increased SLSS reflecting improvement and decreased SLSS reflecting worsened strength.RESULTS: Fifty-six patients with AFM from 12 centers met study criteria. Among 30 patients exposed to fluoxetine, no SAEs were reported and adverse effect rates were similar to unexposed patients (47% vs 65%, p = 0.16). The 28 patients treated with >1 dose of fluoxetine were more likely to have EV-D68 identified (57.1% vs 14.3%, p < 0.001). Their SLSS was similar at initial examination (mean SLSS 12.9 vs 14.3, p = 0.31) but lower at nadir (mean SLSS 9.25 vs 12.82, p = 0.02) and latest follow-up (mean SLSS 12.5 vs 16.4, p = 0.005) compared with the 28 patients receiving 1 (n = 2) or no (n = 26) doses. In propensity-adjusted analysis, SLSS from initial examination to latest follow-up decreased by 0.2 (95% confidence interval [CI] -1.8 to +1.4) in fluoxetine-treated patients and increased by 2.5 (95% CI +0.7 to +4.4) in untreated patients (p = 0.015).CONCLUSION: Fluoxetine was well-tolerated. Fluoxetine was preferentially given to patients with AFM with EV-D68 identified and more severe paralysis at nadir, who ultimately had poorer long-term outcomes.CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class IV evidence that for patients with EV-D68-associated AFM, fluoxetine is well-tolerated and not associated with improved neurologic outcomes.

To characterize the phenotype of pediatric Bickerstaff's brainstem encephalitis (BBE) and evaluate prognostic features in the clinical course, diagnostic studies, and treatment exposures.We systematically reviewed PubMed, Web of Science, and SCOPUS databases as well as medical records at theLucile Packard Children's Hospital to identify cases of pediatric BBE. Inclusion required all of the following criteria: age20years, presence of somnolence or alterations in mental status at the time of presentation or developed within 7 days of presentation, ataxia, and ophthalmoplegia.We reviewed 682 manuscripts, identifying a total of 47 pediatric BBE cases. We also describe five previously unreported cases. The phenotype of these pediatric patients was similar to previously published literature. Sixty-eight percent of patients demonstrated positive anti-GQ1b antibody titers, yet the presence of these antibodies was not associated with longer times to recovery. Patients with neuroimaging abnormalities featured a longer median time to recovery, but this was not statistically significant (p=0.124). Overall, patients treated with any form of immunotherapy (intravenous immunoglobulin, steroids, or plasmapheresis) demonstrated shorter median time to resolution of symptoms compared to supportive therapy, although this trend was not statistically significant (p=0.277). Post-hoc t tests revealed a trend towards use of immunotherapy against supportive care alone (p=0.174).Our study identified clinical, radiologic, and treatment features that may hold prognostic value for children with BBE. The role of immunotherapy remains under investigation but may prove of utility with further, randomized controlled studies in this rare disease.

View details for Postmortem Whole Exome Sequencing Identifies Novel EIF2B3 Mutation With Prenatal Phenotype in 2 Siblings Song, H., Haeri, S., Vogel, H., van der Knaap, M., Van Haren, K. We describe 2 male siblings with a severe, prenatal phenotype of vanishing white matter disease and the impact of whole exome sequencing on their diagnosis and clinical care.The 2 children underwent detailed clinical characterization, through clinical and laboratory testing, as well as prenatal and postnatal imaging. Biobanked blood from the 2 siblings was submitted for whole exome sequencing at Baylor Laboratories.Both male children had abnormal prenatal neuroimaging and suffered precipitous, fatal neurologic decline. Neuropathologic findings included subependymal pseudocysts, microcalcifications, and profound lack of brain myelin and sparing of peripheral nerve myelin. A novel homozygous mutation in the EIF2B3 gene (c.97A>G [p.Lys33Glu]) was found in both children; both parents were heterozygous carriers. The family subsequently conceived a healthy child via in vitro fertilization with preimplantation mutation screening.These histories expand the prenatal phenotype of eIF2b-related disorders and poignantly illustrate the impact that unbiased genomic sequencing can have on the diagnosis and medical decision making for families affected by childhood neurodegenerative disorders.

L., Bernard, G., van Haren, K., Vanderver, A., Global Leukodtystrophy Initiative Leukodystrophies are a broad class of genetic disorders that result in disruption or destruction of central myelination. Although the mechanisms underlying these disorders are heterogeneous, there are many common symptoms that affect patients irrespective of the genetic diagnosis. The comfort and quality of life of these children is a primary goal that can complement efforts directed at curative therapies. Contained within this report is a systems-based approach to management of complications that result from leukodystrophies. We discuss the initial evaluation, identification of common medical issues, and management options to establish a comprehensive, standardized care approach. We will also address clinical topics relevant to select leukodystrophies, such as gallbladder pathology and adrenal insufficiency. The recommendations within this review rely on existing studies and consensus opinions and underscore the need for future research on evidence-based outcomes to better treat the manifestations of this unique set of genetic disorders.

D., van der Knaap, M. S., Goldbach Mansky, R., Moser, A. B., Jones, R. O., Vanderver, A. Aicardi Goutires Syndrome (AGS) is a heritable interferonopathy associated with systemic autoinflammation causing interferon (IFN) elevation, central nervous system calcifications, leukodystrophy and severe neurologic sequelae. An infant with TREX1 mutations was recently found to have abnormal C26:0 lysophosphatidylcholine (C26:0 Lyso-PC) in a newborn screening platform for X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, prompting analysis of this analyte in retrospectively collected samples from individuals affected by AGS.In this study, we explored C26:0 Lyso-PC levels and IFN signatures in newborn blood spots and post-natal blood samples in 19 children with a molecular and clinical diagnosis of AGS and in the blood spots of 22 healthy newborns. We used Nanostring nCounter for IFN-induced gene analysis and a high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC MS/MS) newborn screening platform for C26:0 Lyso-PC analysis.Newborn screening cards from patients across six AGS associated genes were collected, with a median disease presentation of 2months. Thirteen out of 19 (68%) children with AGS had elevations of first tier C26:0 Lyso-PC (>0.4M), that would have resulted in a second screen being performed in a two tier screening system for X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD). The median (95%CI) of first tier C26:0 Lyso-PC values in AGS individuals (0.43M [0.37-0.48]) was higher than that seen in controls (0.21M [0.21-0.21]), but lower than X-ALD individuals (0.72M [0.59-0.84])(p<0.001). Fourteen of 19 children had elevated expression of IFN signaling on blood cards relative to controls (Sensitivity 73.7%, 95%CI 51-88%, Specificity 95%, 95% CI 78-99%) including an individual with delayed disease presentation (36months of age). All five AGS patients with negative IFN signature at birth had RNASEH2B mutations. Consistency of agreement between IFN signature in neonatal and post-natal samples was high (0.85).This suggests that inflammatory markers in AGS can be identified in the newborn period, before symptom onset. Additionally, since C26:0 Lyso-PC screening is currently used in X-ALD newborn screening panels, clinicians should be alert to the fact that AGS infants may present as false positives during X-ALD screening. Acute flaccid myelitis: A clinical review of US cases 2012-2015. Messacar, K., Schreiner, T. L., Van Haren, K., Yang, M., Glaser, C. A., Tyler, K. L., Dominguez, S. R. This review highlights clinical features of the increasing cases of acute flaccid paralysis associated with anterior myelitis noted in the United States from 2012 to 2015. Acute flaccid myelitis refers to acute flaccid limb weakness with spinal cord gray matter lesions on imaging or evidence of spinal cord motor neuron injury on electrodiagnostic testing. Although some individuals demonstrated improvement in motor weakness and functional deficits, most have residual weakness a year or more after onset. Epidemiological evidence and biological plausibility support an association between enterovirus D68 and the recent increase in acute flaccid myelitis cases in the United States. Ann Neurol 2016. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis: Updates on an inflammatory CNS syndrome. Pohl, D., Alper, G., Van Haren, K., Kornberg, A. J., Lucchinetti, C. F., Tenembaum, S., Belman, A. L. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is an immune-mediated demyelinating CNS disorder with predilection to early childhood. ADEM is generally considered a monophasic disease. However, recurrent ADEM has been described and defined as multiphasic disseminated encephalomyelitis. ADEM often occurs postinfectiously, although a causal relationship has never been established. ADEM and multiple sclerosis are currently viewed as distinct entities, generally distinguishable even at disease onset. However, pathologic studies have demonstrated transitional cases of yet unclear significance. ADEM is clinically defined by acute polyfocal neurologic deficits including encephalopathy. MRI typically demonstrates reversible, ill-defined white matter lesions of the brain and often also the spinal cord, along with frequent involvement of thalami and basal ganglia. CSF analysis may reveal a mild pleocytosis and elevated protein, but is generally negative for intrathecal oligoclonal immunoglobulin G synthesis. In the absence of a specific diagnostic test, ADEM is considered a diagnosis of exclusion, and ADEM mimics, especially those requiring a different treatment approach, have to be carefully ruled out. The role of biomarkers, including autoantibodies like anti-myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein, in the pathogenesis and diagnosis of ADEM is currently under debate. Based on the presumed autoimmune etiology of ADEM, the current treatment approach consists of early immunotherapy. Outcome of ADEM in pediatric patients is generally favorable, but cognitive deficits have been reported even in the absence of other neurologic sequelae. This review summarizes the current knowledge on epidemiology, pathology, clinical presentation, neuroimaging features, CSF findings, differential diagnosis, therapy, and outcome, with a focus on recent advances and controversies. Magnetic Resonance Imaging Spectrum of Succinate Dehydrogenase-Related Infantile Leukoencephalopathy Helman, G., Caldovic, L., Whitehead, M. T., Simons, C., Brockmann, K., Edvardson, S., Bai, R., Moroni, I., Taylor, J. M., Van Haren, K., Taft, R. J., Vanderver, A., van der Knaap, M. S. Succinate dehydrogenase-deficient leukoencephalopathy is a complex II-related mitochondrial disorder for which the clinical phenotype, neuroimaging pattern, and genetic findings have not been comprehensively reviewed.Nineteen individuals with succinate dehydrogenase deficiency-related leukoencephalopathy were reviewed for neuroradiological, clinical, and genetic findings as part of institutional review board-approved studies at Children's National Health System (Washington, DC) and VU University Medical Center (Amsterdam, the Netherlands).All individuals had signal abnormalities in the central corticospinal tracts and spinal cord where imaging was available. Other typical findings were involvement of the cerebral hemispheric white matter with sparing of the U fibers, the corpus callosum with sparing of the outer blades, the basis pontis, middle cerebellar peduncles, and cerebellar white matter, and elevated succinate on magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). The thalamus was involved in most studies, with a predilection for the anterior nucleus, pulvinar, and geniculate bodies. Clinically, infantile onset neurological regression with partial recovery and subsequent stabilization was typical. All individuals had mutations in SDHA, SDHB, or SDHAF1, or proven biochemical defect.Succinate dehydrogenase deficiency is a rare leukoencephalopathy, for which improved recognition by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in combination with advanced sequencing technologies allows noninvasive diagnostic confirmation. The MRI pattern is characterized by cerebral hemispheric white matter abnormalities with sparing of the U fibers, corpus callosum involvement with sparing of the outer blades, and involvement of corticospinal tracts, thalami, and spinal cord. In individuals with infantile regression and this pattern of MRI abnormalities, the differential diagnosis should include succinate dehydrogenase deficiency, in particular if MRS shows elevated succinate. Ann Neurol 2016 ANN NEUROL 2016;79:379-386. Emerging Treatments for Pediatric Leukodystrophies Helman, G., Van Haren, K., Escolar, M. L., Vanderver, A. The leukodystrophies are a heterogeneous group of inherited disorders with broad clinical manifestations and variable pathologic mechanisms. Improved diagnostic methods have allowed identification of the underlying cause of these diseases, facilitating identification of their pathologic mechanisms. Clinicians are now able to prioritize treatment strategies and advance research in therapies for specific disorders. Although only a few of these disorders have well-established treatments or therapies, a number are on the verge of clinical trials. As investigators are able to shift care from symptomatic management of disorders to targeted therapeutics, the unmet therapeutic needs could be reduced for these patients. A novel outbreak enterovirus D68 strain associated with acute flaccid myelitis cases in the USA (2012-14): a retrospective cohort study Greninger, A. L., Naccache, S. N., Messacar, K., Clayton, A., Yu, G., Somasekar, S., Federman, S., Stryke, D., Anderson, C., Yagi, S., Messenger, S., Wadford, D., Xia, D., Watt, J. P., Van Haren, K., Dominguez, S. R., Glaser, C., Aldrovandi, G., Chiu, C. Y. Enterovirus D68 was implicated in a widespread outbreak of severe respiratory illness across the USA in 2014 and has also been reported sporadically in patients with acute flaccid myelitis. We aimed to investigate the association between enterovirus D68 infection and acute flaccid myelitis during the 2014 enterovirus D68 respiratory outbreak in the USA.Patients with acute flaccid myelitis who presented to two hospitals in Colorado and California, USA, between Nov 24, 2013, and Oct 11, 2014, were included in the study. Additional cases identified from Jan 1, 2012, to Oct 4, 2014, via statewide surveillance were provided by the California Department of Public Health. We investigated the cause of these cases by metagenomic next-generation sequencing, viral genome recovery, and enterovirus D68 phylogenetic analysis. We compared patients with acute flaccid myelitis who were positive for enterovirus D68 with those with acute flaccid myelitis but negative for enterovirus D68 using the two-tailed Fisher's exact test, two-sample unpaired t test, and Mann-Whitney U test.48 patients were included: 25 with acute flaccid myelitis, two with enterovirus-associated encephalitis, five with enterovirus-D68-associated upper respiratory illness, and 16 with aseptic meningitis or encephalitis who tested positive for enterovirus. Enterovirus D68 was detected in respiratory secretions from seven (64%) of 11 patients comprising two temporally and geographically linked acute flaccid myelitis clusters at the height of the 2014 outbreak, and from 12 (48%) of 25 patients with acute flaccid myelitis overall. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that all enterovirus D68 sequences associated with acute flaccid myelitis grouped into a clade B1 strain that emerged in 2010. Of six coding polymorphisms in the clade B1 enterovirus D68 polyprotein, five were present in neuropathogenic poliovirus or enterovirus D70, or both. One child with acute flaccid myelitis and a sibling with only upper respiratory illness were both infected by identical enterovirus D68 strains. Enterovirus D68 viraemia was identified in a child experiencing acute neurological progression of his paralytic illness. Deep metagenomic sequencing of cerebrospinal fluid from 14 patients with acute flaccid myelitis did not reveal evidence of an alternative infectious cause to enterovirus D68.These findings strengthen the putative association between enterovirus D68 and acute flaccid myelitis and the contention that acute flaccid myelitis is a rare yet severe clinical manifestation of enterovirus D68 infection in susceptible hosts.National Institutes of Health, University of California, Abbott Laboratories, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Leukodystrophies are a heterogeneous, often progressive group of disorders manifesting a wide range of symptoms and complications. Most of these disorders have historically had no etiologic or disease specific therapeutic approaches. Recently, a greater understanding of the pathologic mechanisms associated with leukodystrophies has allowed clinicians and researchers to prioritize treatment strategies and advance research in therapies for specific disorders, some of which are on the verge of pilot or Phase I/II clinical trials. This shifts the care of leukodystrophy patients from the management of the complex array of symptoms and sequelae alone to targeted therapeutics. The unmet needs of leukodystrophy patients still remain an overwhelming burden. While the overwhelming consensus is that these disorders collectively are symptomatically treatable, leukodystrophy patients are in need of advanced therapies and if possible, a cure.

Leukodystrophies are inherited disorders whose primary pathophysiology consists of abnormal deposition or progressive disruption of brain myelin. Leukodystrophy patients manifest many of the same symptoms and medical complications despite the wide spectrum of genetic origins. Although no definitive cures exist, all of these conditions are treatable. This report provides the first expert consensus on the recognition and treatment of medical and psychosocial complications associated with leukodystrophies. We include a discussion of serious and potentially preventable medical complications and propose several preventive care strategies. We also outline the need for future research to prioritize clinical needs and subsequently develop, validate, and optimize specific care strategies.

De Novo Mutations in the Motor Domain of KIF1A Cause Cognitive Impairment, Spastic Paraparesis, Axonal Neuropathy, and Cerebellar Atrophy Lee, J., Srour, M., Kim, D., Hamdan, F. F., Lim, S., Brunel-Guitton, C., Decarie, J., Rossignol, E., Mitchell, G. A., Schreiber, A., Moran, R., Van Haren, K., Richardson, R., Nicolai, J., Oberndorff, K. M., Wagner, J. D., Boycott, K.

KIF1A is a neuron-specific motor protein that plays important roles in cargo transport along neurites. Recessive mutations in KIF1A were previously described in families with spastic paraparesis or sensory and autonomic neuropathy type-2. Here, we report 11 heterozygous de novo missense mutations (p.S58L, p.T99M, p.G102D, p.V144F, p.R167C, p.A202P, p.S215R, p.R216P, p.L249Q, p.E253K, and p.R316W) in KIF1A in 14 individuals, including two monozygotic twins. Two mutations (p.T99M and p.E253K) were recurrent, each being found in unrelated cases. All these de novo mutations are located in the motor domain (MD) of KIF1A. Structural modeling revealed that they alter conserved residues that are critical for the structure and function of the MD. Transfection studies suggested that at least five of these mutations affect the transport of the MD along axons. Individuals with de novo mutations in KIF1A display a phenotype characterized by cognitive impairment and variable presence of cerebellar atrophy, spastic paraparesis, optic nerve atrophy, peripheral neuropathy, and epilepsy. Our findings thus indicate that de novo missense mutations in the MD of KIF1A cause a phenotype that overlaps with, while being more severe, than that associated with recessive mutations in the same gene.

A., Feikin, D., Glaser, C. In August 2012, the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) was contacted by a San Francisco Bay area clinician who requested poliovirus testing for an unvaccinated man aged 29 years with acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) associated with anterior myelitis (i.e., evidence of inflammation of the spinal cord involving the grey matter including anterior horn cell bodies) and no history of international travel during the month before symptom onset. Within 2 weeks, CDPH had received reports of two additional cases of AFP with anterior myelitis of unknown etiology. Testing at CDPH's Viral and Rickettsial Disease Laboratory for stool, nasopharyngeal swab, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) did not detect the presence of an enterovirus (EV), the genus of the family Picornaviridae that includes poliovirus. Additional laboratory testing for infectious diseases conducted at the CDPH Viral and Rickettsial Disease Laboratory did not identify a causative agent to explain the observed clinical syndrome reported among the patients. To identify other cases of AFP with anterior myelitis and elucidate possible common etiologies, CDPH posted alerts in official communications for California local health departments during December 2012, July 2013, and February 2014. Reports of cases of neurologic illness received by CDPH were investigated throughout this period, and clinicians were encouraged to submit clinical samples for testing. A total of 23 cases of AFP with anterior myelitis of unknown etiology were identified. Epidemiologic and laboratory investigation did not identify poliovirus infection as a possible cause for the observed cases. No common etiology was identified to explain the reported cases, although EV-D68 was identified in upper respiratory tract specimens of two patients. EV infection, including poliovirus infection, should be considered in the differential diagnosis in cases of AFP with anterior myelitis and testing performed per CDC guidelines.

J., Lopez, J., Van Haren, K., Wilkes, J., Sheng, X., Nelson, C., Korgenski, E. K., Srivastava, R., Bonkowsky, J. L. Inherited leukodystrophies are progressive, debilitating neurological disorders with few treatment options and high mortality rates. Our objective was to determine national variation in the costs for leukodystrophy patients and to evaluate differences in their care.We developed an algorithm to identify inherited leukodystrophy patients in deidentified data sets using a recursive tree model based on International Classification of Disease, 9th Edition, Clinical Modification, diagnosis and procedure charge codes. Validation of the algorithm was performed independently at two institutions, and with data from the Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS) of 43 US children's hospitals, for a 7-year period between 2004 and2010.A recursive algorithm was developed and validated, based on six International Classification of Disease, 9th Edition, Clinical Modification, codes and one procedure code that had a sensitivity up to 90% (range 61-90%) and a specificity up to 99% (range 53-99%) for identifying inherited leukodystrophy patients. Inherited leukodystrophy patients comprise 0.4% of admissions to children's hospitals and 0.7% of costs. During 7 years, these patients required $411 million of hospital care, or $131,000/patient. Hospital costs for leukodystrophy patients varied at different institutions, ranging from two to 15 times more than the average pediatric patient. There was a statistically significant correlation between higher volume and increased cost efficiency. Increased mortality rates had an inverse relationship with increased patient volume that was not statistically significant.We developed and validated a code-based algorithm for identifying leukodystrophy patients in deidentified national datasets. Leukodystrophy patients account for $59 million of costs yearly at children's hospitals. Our data highlight potential to reduce unwarranted variability and improve patient care.

Aspirin can reduce stroke-like events and seizure episodes and prevent further brain injuries in these patients. Although a few cases of intracranial hemorrhage in patients with Sturge-Weber syndrome have been reported, prior reports have not discussed this complication with regard to particular therapies. The authors present a toddler with Sturge-Weber syndrome who developed a subdural hematoma in the setting of a mechanical fall with minor head trauma. They discuss the possible role of aspirin in contributing to, or perhaps protecting against, intracranial hemorrhage in patients with Sturge-Weber syndrome. Further data are needed to establish the utility of aspirin in Sturge-Weber syndrome.

Fahr's Disease: Pediatric Presentation of a Rare Neurodegenerative Disorder View details for Fahr's Disease: Pediatric Presentation of a Rare Neurodegenerative Disorder View details for Although the genetics and biochemistry of leukodystrophies have been extensively explored, the immune response in these disorders has received relatively little attention. Both the disease course and its response to treatment may be highly dependent on the immune system. In this review, we compare three common leukodystrophies, each with a different immune response: (1) X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, which demonstrates a severe, lymphocytic inflammatory response; (2) metachromatic leukodystrophy, which yields a histiocytic response; and (3) vanishing white-matter disease, in which no inflammation is typically seen. We highlight the biochemical, pathologic, and clinical differences, while focusing on the immune response in each disease. We also review the response of leukodystrophies to immunomodulatory therapies and interventions such as hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation. Future studies may delineate specific inflammatory markers as possible candidates for therapeutic intervention.

P., van Kollenburg, B., Bertrand, G., Van Haren, K., Scheper, G. C., Powers, J. M., van der Knaap, M. S. Leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter (VWM) is an autosomal-recessive disorder in which febrile infections may provoke major neurologic deterioration. Characteristic pathologic findings include cystic white matter degeneration, foamy oligodendrocytes, dysmorphic astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, oligodendrocytosis, and apoptotic losses of oligodendrocytes. VWM is caused by mutations in eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 2B (eIF2B). eIF2B plays an important role in the regulation of protein synthesis. Mutant eIF2B may impair the ability of cells to regulate protein synthesis in response to stress and perhaps even under normal conditions. An overload of misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum activates the unfolded protein response (UPR), a compensatory mechanism that inhibits synthesis of new proteins and induces both prosurvival and proapoptotic signals. We have studied the activation of the UPR in VWM through the immunohistochemical expression of its upstream components PERK and phosphorylated eIF2alpha (eIF2alphaP) and combined immunohistochemical and Western blot analysis of the downstream effector proteins activating transcription factor-4 (ATF4) and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) in 4 VWM brains and 3 age-matched controls. We demonstrate activation of the UPR in glia of patients with VWM. Our findings may point to a possible explanation for the dysmorphic glia, the increased numbers of oligodendrocytes, and the apoptotic loss of oligodendrocytes in VWM.

P., PETERSON, D. R., van der Knaap, M. S., Powers, J. M. Vanishing white matter disease (VWM) is a progressive cavitating disease of central white matter due to a deficiency of the translation initiation factor eIF2B. Oligodendrocytes appear to be numerically increased in some white matter areas, while decreased in others. We compared oligodendrocytes of cerebral, cerebellar, and pontine white matter from 5 VWM patients with those of age-matched controls by light microscopy and immunohistochemistry using antibodies to activated caspase-3, bak, bax, bcl-2, survivin, and Ki-67, as well as by the TUNEL technique. Oligodendrocytes were identified morphologically and quantified using an ocular grid. We observed statistically significant increases in their densities at all sites; Ki-67-labeled oligodendrocytes were identified in 2 of 5 patients. Apoptotic oligodendrocytes were documented in 3 of 5 patients, while bcl-2 and survivin labeling was observed in 2 of 5 and 2 of 2 patients, respectively. There was a trend toward an increase in apoptotic labeling of oligodendrocytes that was strongest in the cerebrum, the major locus of VWM, in the youngest and most severely affected patients. These data conclusively demonstrate increased oligodendrocytic densities in VWM; the increase is not an artifact of white matter contraction. Our data also document that oligodendrocytes undergo apoptosis, perhaps in conjunction with major neurologic crises, and that a subset of oligodendrocytes are able to persist and proliferate. Conflicting proliferative, cell-death, and survival signals impact the oligodendrocytes of VWM. View details for",85,Relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis,-12.407588958740234,174

The most effective approach often begins with attentive listening and proactive planning. I work closely with a team of dedicated, rigorous multi-disciplinary specialists to provide a comprehensive approach to complex neurological care. Our goal is to increase both the quality and the duration of life for children and adults affected by serious neurological disorders. Although I see children and adults with a wide range of neurological disorders, my primary areas of clinical and scientific expertise include genetic and inflammatory disorders of the brain and spinal cord. Many of these disorders are associated with a high level of disability and require complex care strategies that necessitate the involvement of multiple specialists. I make every effort to incorporate the medical priorities of the patient and caregiver in devising the medical plan. My goal is to provide both information and guidance to patients and families making complex medical decisions.

Sotirchos, E. S., Bhargava, P., Eckstein, C., Van Haren, K., Baynes, M., Ntranos, A., Gocke, A., Steinman, L., Mowry, E. M., Calabresi, P. A. To study the safety profile and characterize the immunologic effects of high- vs low-dose cholecalciferol supplementation in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS).In this double-blind, single-center randomized pilot study, 40 patients with relapsing-remitting MS were randomized to receive 10,400 IU or 800 IU cholecalciferol daily for 6 months. Assessments were performed at baseline and 3 and 6 months.Mean increase of 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels from baseline to final visit was larger in the high-dose group (34.9 ng/mL; 95% confidence interval [CI] 25.0-44.7 ng/mL) than in the low-dose group (6.9 ng/mL; 95% CI 1.0-13.7 ng/mL). Adverse events were minor and did not differ between the 2 groups. Two relapses occurred, one in each treatment arm. In the high-dose group, we found a reduction in the proportion of interleukin-17(+)CD4(+) T cells (p = 0.016), CD161(+)CD4(+) T cells (p = 0.03), and effector memory CD4(+) T cells (p = 0.021) with a concomitant increase in the proportion of central memory CD4(+) T cells (p = 0.018) and naive CD4(+) T cells (p = 0.04). These effects were not observed in the low-dose group.Cholecalciferol supplementation with 10,400 IU daily is safe and tolerable in patients with MS and exhibits in vivo pleiotropic immunomodulatory effects in MS, which include reduction of interleukin-17 production by CD4(+) T cells and decreased proportion of effector memory CD4(+) T cells with concomitant increase in central memory CD4(+) T cells and naive CD4(+) T cells.This study provides Class I evidence that cholecalciferol supplementation with 10,400 IU daily is safe and well-tolerated in patients with MS and exhibits in vivo pleiotropic immunomodulatory effects. Acute Flaccid Myelitis of Unknown Etiology in California, 2012-2015 Van Haren, K., Ayscue, P., Waubant, E., Clayton, A., Sheriff, H., Yagi, S., Glenn-Finer, R., Padilla, T., Strober, J. B., Aldrovandi, G., Wadford, D. A., Chiu, C. Y., Xia, D., Harriman, K., Watt, J. P., Glaser, C. A. There has been limited surveillance for acute flaccid paralysis in North America since the regional eradication of poliovirus. In 2012, the California Department of Public Health received several reports of acute flaccid paralysis cases of unknown etiology.To quantify disease incidence and identify potential etiologies of acute flaccid paralysis cases with evidence of spinal motor neuron injury.Case series of acute flaccid paralysis in patients with radiological or neurophysiological findings suggestive of spinal motor neuron involvement reported to the California Department of Public Health with symptom onset between June 2012 and July 2015. Patients meeting diagnostic criteria for other acute flaccid paralysis etiologies were excluded. Cerebrospinal fluid, serum samples, nasopharyngeal swab specimens, and stool specimens were submitted to the state laboratory for infectious agent testing.Case incidence and infectious agent association.Fifty-nine cases were identified. Median age was 9 years (interquartile range [IQR], 4-14 years; 50 of the cases were younger than 21 years). Symptoms that preceded or were concurrent included respiratory or gastrointestinal illness (n=54), fever (n=47), and limb myalgia (n=41). Fifty-six patients had T2 hyperintensity of spinal gray matter on magnetic resonance imaging and 43 patients had cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis. During the course of the initial hospitalization, 42 patients received intravenous steroids; 43, intravenous immunoglobulin; and 13, plasma exchange; or a combination of these treatments. Among 45 patients with follow-up data, 38 had persistent weakness at a median follow-up of 9 months (IQR, 3-12 months). Two patients, both immunocompromised adults, died within 60 days of symptom onset. Enteroviruses were the most frequently detected pathogen in either nasopharynx swab specimens, stool specimens, serum samples (15 of 45 patients tested). No pathogens were isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid. The incidence of reported cases was significantly higher during a national enterovirus D68 outbreak occurring from August 2014 through January 2015 (0.16 cases per 100,000 person-years) compared with other monitoring periods (0.028 cases per 100,000 person-years; P<.001).In this series of patients identified in California from June 2012 through July 2015, clinical manifestations indicated a rare but distinct syndrome of acute flaccid paralysis with evidence of spinal motor neuron involvement. The etiology remains undetermined, most patients were children and young adults, and motor weakness was prolonged.

Multiple sclerosis (Houndmills, Basingstoke, England) Van Haren, K., Tomooka, B. H., Kidd, B. A., Banwell, B., Bar-Or, A., Chitnis, T., Tenembaum, S. N., Pohl, D., Rostasy, K., Dale, R. C., O'Connor, K. C., Hafler, D. A., Steinman, L., Robinson, W. H. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) and relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) share overlapping clinical, radiologic and laboratory features at onset. Because autoantibodies may contribute to the pathogenesis of both diseases, we sought to identify autoantibody biomarkers that are capable of distinguishing them. METHODS: We used custom antigen arrays to profile anti-myelin-peptide autoantibodies in sera derived from individuals with pediatric ADEM (n = 15), pediatric multiple sclerosis (Ped MS; n = 11) and adult MS (n = 15). Using isotype-specific secondary antibodies, we profiled both IgG and IgM reactivities. We used Statistical Analysis of Microarrays software to confirm the differences in autoantibody reactivity profiles between ADEM and MS samples. We used Prediction Analysis of Microarrays software to generate and validate prediction algorithms, based on the autoantibody reactivity profiles. RESULTS: ADEM was characterized by IgG autoantibodies targeting epitopes derived from myelin basic protein, proteolipid protein, myelin-associated oligodendrocyte basic glycoprotein, and alpha-B-crystallin. In contrast, MS was characterized by IgM autoantibodies targeting myelin basic protein, proteolipid protein, myelin-associated oligodendrocyte basic glycoprotein and oligodendrocyte-specific protein. We generated and validated prediction algorithms that distinguish ADEM serum (sensitivity 62-86%; specificity 56-79%) from MS serum (sensitivity 40-87%; specificity 62-86%) on the basis of combined IgG and IgM anti-myelin autoantibody reactivity to a small number of myelin peptides. CONCLUSIONS: Combined profiles of serum IgG and IgM autoantibodies identified myelin antigens that may be useful for distinguishing MS from ADEM. Further studies are required to establish clinical utility. Further biological assays are required to delineate the pathogenic potential of these antibodies. Identification of Naturally Occurring Fatty Acids of the Myelin Sheath That Resolve Neuroinflammation Ho, P. P., Kanter, J. L., Johnson, A. M., Srinagesh, H. K., Chang, E., Purdy, T. M., Van Haren, K., Wikoff, W. R., Kind, T., Khademi, M., Matloff, L. Y., Narayana, S., Hur, E. M., Lindstrom, T. M., He, Z., Fiehn, O., Olsson, T., Han, X., Han, M. H., Steinman, L., Robinson, W. H. Lipids constitute 70% of the myelin sheath, and autoantibodies against lipids may contribute to the demyelination that characterizes multiple sclerosis (MS). We used lipid antigen microarrays and lipid mass spectrometry to identify bona fide lipid targets of the autoimmune response in MS brain, and an animal model of MS to explore the role of the identified lipids in autoimmune demyelination. We found that autoantibodies in MS target a phosphate group in phosphatidylserine and oxidized phosphatidylcholine derivatives. Administration of these lipids ameliorated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis by suppressing activation and inducing apoptosis of autoreactive T cells, effects mediated by the lipids' saturated fatty acid side chains. Thus, phospholipids represent a natural anti-inflammatory class of compounds that have potential as therapeutics for MS. Acute flaccid myelitis: cause, diagnosis, and management. Murphy, O.

Acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) is a disabling, polio-like illness mainly affecting children. Outbreaks of AFM have occurred across multiple global regions since 2012, and the disease appears to be caused by non-polio enterovirus infection, posing a major public health challenge. The clinical presentation of flaccid and often profound muscle weakness (which can invoke respiratory failure and other critical complications) can mimic several other acute neurological illnesses. There is no single sensitive and specific test for AFM, and the diagnosis relies on identification of several important clinical, neuroimaging, and cerebrospinal fluid characteristics. Following the acute phase of AFM, patients typically have substantial residual disability and unique long-term rehabilitation needs. In this Review we describe the epidemiology, clinical features, course, and outcomes of AFM to help to guide diagnosis, management, and rehabilitation. Future research directions include further studies evaluating host and pathogen factors, including investigations into genetic, viral, and immunological features of affected patients, host-virus interactions, and investigations of targeted therapeutic approaches to improve the long-term outcomes in this population.

Cellucci, T., Van Mater, H., Graus, F., Muscal, E., Gallentine, W., Klein-Gitelman, M. S., Benseler, S. M., Frankovich, J., Gorman, M. P., Van Haren, K., Dalmau, J., Dale, R. C. OBJECTIVE: Autoimmune encephalitis (AE) is an important and treatable cause of acute encephalitis. Diagnosis of AE in a developing child is challenging because of overlap in clinical presentations with other diseases and complexity of normal behavior changes. Existing diagnostic criteria for adult AE require modification to be applied to children, who differ from adults in their clinical presentations, paraclinical findings, autoantibody profiles, treatment response, and long-term outcomes.METHODS: A subcommittee of the Autoimmune Encephalitis International Working Group collaborated through conference calls and email correspondence to consider the pediatric-specific approach to AE. The subcommittee reviewed the literature of relevant AE studies and sought additional input from other expert clinicians and researchers.RESULTS: Existing consensus criteria for adult AE were refined for use in children. Provisional pediatric AE classification criteria and an algorithm to facilitate early diagnosis are proposed. There is also discussion about how to distinguish pediatric AE from conditions within the differential diagnosis.CONCLUSIONS: Diagnosing AE is based on the combination of a clinical history consistent with pediatric AE and supportive diagnostic testing, which includes but is not dependent on antibody testing. The proposed criteria and algorithm require validation in prospective pediatric cohorts. Subacute Neuropsychiatric Syndrome in Girls With SHANK3 Mutations Responds to Immunomodulation. Bey, A. L., Gorman, M. P., Gallentine, W., Kohlenberg, T. M., Frankovich, J., Jiang, Y. H., Van Haren, K. Phenotypic and biological characterization of rare monogenic disorders represents 1 of the most important avenues toward understanding the mechanisms of human disease. Among patients with SH3 and multiple ankyrin repeat domains 3 (SHANK3) mutations, a subset will manifest neurologic regression, psychosis, and mood disorders. However, which patients will be affected, when, and why are important unresolved questions. Authors of recent studies suggest neuronal SHANK3 expression is modulated by both inflammatory and hormonal stimuli. In this case series, we describe 4 independent clinical observations of an immunotherapy responsive phenotype of peripubertal-onset neuropsychiatric regression in 4 girls with pathogenic SHANK3 mutations. Each child exhibited a history of stable, mild-to-moderate lifelong developmental disability until 12 to 14 years of age, at which time each manifested a similar, subacute-onset neurobehavioral syndrome. Symptoms included mutism, hallucinations, insomnia, inconsolable crying, obsessive-compulsive behaviors, loss of self-care, and urinary retention and/or incontinence. Symptoms were relatively refractory to antipsychotic medication but improved after immunomodulatory treatment. All 4 patients exhibited chronic relapsing courses during a period of treatment and follow-up ranging from 3 to 6 years. Two of the 4 girls recovered their premorbid level of functioning. We briefly review the scientific literature to offer a conceptual and molecular framework for understanding these clinical observations. Future clinical and translational investigations in this realm may offer insights into mechanisms and therapies bridging immune function and human behavior. MRI Surveillance of Boys with X-linked Adrenoleukodystrophy Identified by Newborn Screening: Meta-analysis and Consensus Guidelines. Mallack, E. J., Turk, B. R., Yan, H., Price, C., Mlis, M. D., Moser, A. B., Becker, C., Hollandsworth, K., Adang, L., Vanderver, A., Van Haren, K., Ruzhnikov, M., Kurtzberg, J., Maegawa, G., Orchard, P. J., Lund, T. C., Raymond, G. V., Regelmann, M., Orsini, J. J., Seeger, E., Kemp, S., Eichler, F., Fatemi, A. Among boys with X-Linked adrenoleukodystrophy, a subset will develop childhood cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy (CCALD). CCALD is typically lethal without hematopoietic stem cell transplant before or soon after symptom onset. We sought to establish evidence-based guidelines detailing the neuroimaging surveillance of boys with neurologically asymptomatic adrenoleukodystrophy.To establish the most frequent age and diagnostic neuroimaging modality for CCALD, we completed a meta-analysis of relevant studies published between January 1, 1970 and September 10, 2019. We used the consensus development conference method to incorporate the resulting data into guidelines to inform the timing and techniques for neuroimaging surveillance. Final guideline agreement was defined as >80% consensus.One hundred twenty-three studies met inclusion criteria yielding 1,285 patients. The overall mean age of CCALD diagnosis is 7.91years old. The median age of CCALD diagnosis calculated from individual patient data is 7.0years old (IQR: 6.0 - 9.5, n=349). Ninety percent of patients were diagnosed between 3 and 12. Conventional MRI was most frequently reported, comprised most often of T2-weighted and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI. The expert panel achieved 95.7% consensus on the following surveillance parameters: (1) Obtain an MRI between 12 and 18 months old. (2) Obtain a second MRI 1 year after baseline. (3) Between 3 and 12years old, obtain a contrast-enhanced MRI every 6 months. (4) After 12years, obtain an annual MRI.Boys with adrenoleukodystrophy identified early in life should be monitored with serial brain MRIs during the period of highest risk for conversion to CCALD.

S., Engelen, M., Van Haren, K. X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is the most common genetic peroxisomal disorder with an estimated prevalence of 1:15,000. Approximately two-thirds of males with ALD manifest the inflammatory demyelinating cerebral phenotype (cALD) at some disease stage, in which focal, inflammatory lesions progress over months to years. Hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation can permanently halt cALD progression, but it is only effective if initiated early. Although most cALD lesions progress relentlessly, a subset may spontaneously arrest; subsequent reactivation of these arrested lesions has not been previously detailed.We describe a novel arresting-relapsing variant of cALD.Salient clinical and radiographic studies were reviewed and summarized for cALD patients with episodic deteriorations.We report a series of five unrelated men with spontaneously arrested cALD lesions that subsequently manifested signs of clinical and radiologic lesion progression during longitudinal follow-up. In three of five patients, functional status was too poor to attempt transplant by the time the recurrence was identified. One patient experienced reactivation followed by another period of spontaneous arrest.These cases emphasize the need for continued clinical and radiologic vigilance for adult men with ALD to screen for evidence of new or reactivated cALD lesions to facilitate prompt treatment evaluation. Genetic and phenotypic spectrum associated with IFIH1 gain-of-function. Rice, G. I., Park, S., Gavazzi, F., Adang, L. A., Ayuk, L.

P., Rodriguez, D., Saletti, V., Sharpe, C., Tonduti, D., Vadlamani, G., Van Haren, K., Tomas Vila, M., Vogt, J., Wassmer, E., Wiedemann, A., Wilson, C. J., Zerem, A., Zweier, C., Zuberi, S. M., Orcesi, S., Vanderver, A. L., Hur, S., Crow, Y. J. IFIH1 gain-of-function has been reported as a cause of a type I interferonopathy encompassing a spectrum of autoinflammatory phenotypes including Aicardi-Goutires syndrome and Singleton Merten syndrome. Ascertaining patients through a European and North American collaboration, we set out to describe the molecular, clinical and interferon status of a cohort of individuals with pathogenic heterozygous mutations in IFIH1. We identified 74 individuals from 51 families segregating a total of 27 likely pathogenic mutations in IFIH1. Ten adult individuals, 13.5% of all mutation carriers, were clinically asymptomatic (with seven of these aged over 50 years). All mutations were associated with enhanced type I interferon signaling, including six variants (22%) which were predicted as benign according to multiple in silico pathogenicity programs. The identified mutations cluster close to the ATP binding region of the protein. These data confirm variable expression and non-penetrance as important characteristics of the IFIH1 genotype, a consistent association with enhanced type I interferon signaling, and a common mutational mechanism involving increased RNA binding affinity or decreased efficiency of ATP hydrolysis and filament disassembly rate.

Vanderver, A., Bernard, G., Helman, G., Sherbini, O., Boeck, R., Cohn, J., Collins, A., Demarest, S., Dobbins, K., Emrick, L., Fraser, J., Masser-Frye, D., Hayward, J., Karmarkar, S., Keller, S., Mirrop, S., Mitchell, W., Pathak, S., Sherr, E., van Haren, K., Waters, E., Wilson, J. L., Zhorne, L., Schiffmann, R., van der Knaap, M. S., Pizzino, A., Dubbs, H., Shults, J., Simons, C., Taft, R. J. Genome sequencing (GS) is promising for unsolved leukodystrophies, but its efficacy has not been prospectively studied.A prospective time-delayed cross-over design trial of GS to assess the efficacy of GS as a first-line diagnostic tool for genetic white matter disorders took place between 12/01/2015 - 09/27/2017. Patients were randomized to receive GS immediately with concurrent standard of care (SoC) testing, or to receive SoC testing for four months followed by GS.34 individuals were assessed at interim review. The genetic origin of two patient's leukoencephalopathy was resolved before randomization. Nine patients stratified to the immediate intervention group and 23 patients to the delayed-GS arm. The efficacy of GS was significant relative to SoC in the Immediate (5 of 9 [56%] vs. 0 of 9 [0%]; Wild-Seber p <0.005) and Delayed (control) arms (14 of 23 [61%] vs 5 of 23 [22%]; Wild-Seber p <0.005). The time to diagnosis was significantly shorter in the immediate-GS group (log rank test, p=0.04). The overall diagnostic efficacy of combined GS and SoC approaches was 26 of 34 (76.5% [95% CI=58.8% to 89.3%]) in less than 4 months, greater than historical norms of less than 50% over 5years. Owing to loss of clinical equipoise, the trial design was altered to a single-arm observational study.In this study, first-line GS provided earlier and greater diagnostic efficacy in white matter disorders. We provide an evidence-based diagnostic testing algorithm to enable appropriate clinical GS utilization in this population. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. Acute Flaccid Myelitis of Unknown Etiology in California, 2012-2015. Van Haren, K., Ayscue, P., Waubant, E., Clayton, A., Sheriff, H., Yagi, S., Glenn-Finer, R., Padilla, T., Strober, J.

View details for Incidence, Risk Factors and Outcomes Among Children With Acute Flaccid Myelitis: A Population-based Cohort Study in a California Health Network Between 2011 and 2016. Kane, M. S., Sonne, C., Zhu, S., Malhotra, A., Van Haren, K., Messacar, K., Glaser, C. A. BACKGROUND: Acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) is defined as an acute onset of limb weakness with longitudinal spinal gray matter lesions. Reporting bias and misdiagnosis confound epidemiologic studies of AFM. We mitigated these confounders by using a large data set to assess AFM incidence, risk factors and outcomes in a fixed population.METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted within Kaiser Permanente Northern California population among children 1-18 years. Cases met radiographic and clinical criteria for AFM and were confirmed by two clinicians. Clinical and demographic data were assessed.RESULTS: A total of 28 patients met study criteria for AFM between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2016, an overall rate of 1.46 per 100,000 person-years. Incidence increased from 0.30 to 1.43 cases/per 100,000 person-years between 2011 and 2016, respectively. Median age was 9 years. Risk factors included male sex, Asian ancestry and history of asthma, atopic dermatitis or head injury. Risk factors associated with poliomyelitis were absent. Prodromal illness was common; enterovirus was the most common pathogen detected (n = 5). Among the 27 patients with 12-month follow-up, most demonstrated some improvement, 11 (41.0%) had full recovery, but several had significant deficits with one death reported after the study period.CONCLUSIONS: We employed a closed-population study to generate AFM incidence, risk and outcome data. Our findings support previous reports of male sex and atopy as risk factors. Interval increase in incidence, predisposing Asian ancestry and history of head injury were unique findings to this study. Overall prognosis was better than prior reports, but recovery was incomplete in several patients.

Here we report clinical and imaging outcomes following allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in two patients with ALSP at the University of California, San Francisco between January 2016 and December 2017. Patient 1 proceeded to transplantation at age 53 with a haplo-identical sibling donor. Patient 2, whose sister and mother had died of the disease, proceeded to transplantation at age 49 with a 12/12 human leukocyte antigen-matched unrelated donor. Both patients received reduced intensity conditioning regimens. At 28 and 26 months post-HSCT, respectively, both patients were alive, without evidence of graft-versus-host disease, with major infection at 1 year in one and new-onset seizures in the other. In both cases, neurological worsening continued post-HSCT; however, the progression in cognitive deficits, overall functional status and gait impairment gradually stabilized. There was continued progression of parkinsonism in both patients. On brain MRI, within 1 year there was stabilization of T2/FLAIR abnormalities, and after 2 years there was complete resolution of abnormal multifocal reduced diffusion. In summary, after >2 years of follow-up, allogeneic HSCT in ALSP led to interval resolution of diffusion MRI abnormalities, stabilization of T2/FLAIR MRI abnormalities, and partial clinical stabilization, supportive of treatment response. Allogeneic HSCT may be beneficial in ALSP by providing a supply of bone marrow-derived brain-engrafting myeloid cells with donor wild-type CSF1R to repopulate the microglial niche. Pneumonia Prevention Strategies for Children With Neurologic Impairment. Lin, J. L., Van Haren, K., Rigdon, J., Saynina, O., Song, H., Buu, M. C., Thakur, Y., Srinivas, N., Asch, S. M., Sanders, L. M. Children with neurologic impairment (NI) face high risk of recurrent severe pneumonia, with prevention strategies of unknown effectiveness. We evaluated the comparative effectiveness of secondary prevention strategies for severe pneumonia in children with NI.We included children enrolled in California Children's Services between July 1, 2009, and June 30, 2014, with NI and 1 pneumonia hospitalization. We examined associations between subsequent pneumonia hospitalization and expert-recommended prevention strategies: dental care, oral secretion management, gastric acid suppression, gastrostomy tube placement, chest physiotherapy, outpatient antibiotics before index hospitalization, and clinic visit before or after index hospitalization. We used a 1:2 propensity score matched model to adjust for covariates, including sociodemographics, medical complexity, and severity of index hospitalization.Among 3632 children with NI and index pneumonia hospitalization, 1362 (37.5%) had subsequent pneumonia hospitalization. Only dental care was associated with decreased risk of subsequent pneumonia hospitalization (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 0.64; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.49-0.85). Exposures associated with increased risk included gastrostomy tube placement (aOR: 2.15; 95% CI: 1.63-2.85), chest physiotherapy (aOR: 2.03; 95% CI: 1.29-3.20), outpatient antibiotics before hospitalization (aOR: 1.42; 95% CI: 1.06-1.92), clinic visit before (aOR: 1.30; 95% CI: 1.11-1.52), and after index hospitalization (aOR: 1.72; 95% CI: 1.35-2.20).Dental care was associated with decreased recurrence of severe pneumonia. Several strategies, including gastrostomy tube placement, were associated with increased recurrence, possibly due to unresolved confounding by indication. Our results support a clinical trial of dental care to prevent severe pneumonia in children with NI. Clinical Subpopulations in a Sample of North American Children Diagnosed With Acute Flaccid Myelitis, 2012-2016. Elrick, M. J., Gordon-Lipkin, E., Crawford, T. O., Van Haren, K., Messacar, K., Thornton, N., Dee, E., Voskertchian, A., Nance, J. R., Munoz, L. S., Gorman, M. P., Benson, L. A., Thomas, D. L., Pardo, C. A., Milstone, A. M., Duggal, P. Importance: Acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) is an emerging poliolike illness of children whose clinical spectrum and associated pathogens are only partially described. The case definition is intentionally encompassing for epidemiologic surveillance to capture all potential AFM cases. Defining a restrictive, homogenous subpopulation may aid our understanding of this emerging disease.Objective: To evaluate the extent to which the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) case definition of AFM incorporates possible alternative diagnoses and to assess the plausibility of a case definition that enriches the biological homogeneity of AFM for inclusion in research studies.Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective case analysis of children younger than 18 years diagnosed as having AFM between 2012 and 2016 using the CDC case definition. Group 1 included patients recruited from the United States and Canada based on the CDC case definition of AFM. Group 2 included patients referred to the Johns Hopkins Transverse Myelitis Center for evaluation of suspected AFM. Patients' records and imaging data were critically reviewed by 3 neurologists to identify those cases with definable alternative diagnoses, and the remaining patients were categorized as having restrictively defined AFM (rAFM). Clinical characteristics were compared between patients with rAFM (cases) and those with alternative diagnoses, and a case description distinguishing these AFM groups was identified. Interrater reliability of this description was confirmed for a subset of cases by a fourth neurologist. Data were analyzed between May 2017 and November 2018.Main Outcomes and Measures: Proportion of patients with possible alternative diagnosis.Results: Of the 45 patients who met the CDC AFM case definition and were included, the mean age was 6.1 years; 27 were boys (60%); and 37 were white (82%), 3 were Asian (7%), 1 was Hispanic (2%), and 4 were mixed race/ethnicity (9%). Of the included patients, 34 were classified as having rAFM, and 11 had alternate diagnoses (including transverse myelitis, other demyelinating syndromes, spinal cord stroke, Guillain-Barre syndrome, Chiari I myelopathy, and meningitis). Factors differing between groups were primarily asymmetry of weakness, lower motor neuron signs, preceding viral syndrome, symptoms evolving over hours to days, absence of sensory deficits, and magnetic resonance imaging findings. A case description was able to reliably define the rAFM group.Conclusions and Relevance: We present an approach for defining a homogeneous research population that may more accurately reflect the pathogenesis of the prototypical poliomyelitis-like subgroup of AFM. The definition of rAFM forms a blueprint for inclusion criteria in future research efforts, but more work is required for refinement and external validation. Safety, tolerability, and efficacy of fluoxetine as an antiviral for acute flaccid myelitis. Messacar, K., Sillau, S., Hopkins, S. E., Otten, C., Wilson-Murphy, M., Wong, B., Santoro, J. D., Treister, A., Bains, H. K., Torres, A., Zabrocki, L., Glanternik, J. R., Hurst, A. L., Martin, J. A., Schreiner, T., Makhani, N., DeBiasi, R. L., Kruer, M. C., Tremoulet, A. H., Van Haren, K., Desai, J., Benson, L. A., Gorman, M. P., Abzug, M. J., Tyler, K. L., Dominguez, S. R. OBJECTIVE: To determine the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of fluoxetine for proven or presumptive enterovirus (EV) D68-associated acute flaccid myelitis (AFM).METHODS: A multicenter cohort study of US patients with AFM in 2015-2016 compared serious adverse events (SAEs), adverse effects, and outcomes between fluoxetine-treated patients and untreated controls. Fluoxetine was administered at the discretion of treating providers with data gathered retrospectively. The primary outcome was change in summative limb strength score (SLSS; sum of Medical Research Council strength in all 4 limbs, ranging from 20 [normal strength] to 0 [complete quadriparesis]) between initial examination and latest follow-up, with increased SLSS reflecting improvement and decreased SLSS reflecting worsened strength.RESULTS: Fifty-six patients with AFM from 12 centers met study criteria. Among 30 patients exposed to fluoxetine, no SAEs were reported and adverse effect rates were similar to unexposed patients (47% vs 65%, p = 0.16). The 28 patients treated with >1 dose of fluoxetine were more likely to have EV-D68 identified (57.1% vs 14.3%, p < 0.001). Their SLSS was similar at initial examination (mean SLSS 12.9 vs 14.3, p = 0.31) but lower at nadir (mean SLSS 9.25 vs 12.82, p = 0.02) and latest follow-up (mean SLSS 12.5 vs 16.4, p = 0.005) compared with the 28 patients receiving 1 (n = 2) or no (n = 26) doses. In propensity-adjusted analysis, SLSS from initial examination to latest follow-up decreased by 0.2 (95% confidence interval [CI] -1.8 to +1.4) in fluoxetine-treated patients and increased by 2.5 (95% CI +0.7 to +4.4) in untreated patients (p = 0.015).CONCLUSION: Fluoxetine was well-tolerated. Fluoxetine was preferentially given to patients with AFM with EV-D68 identified and more severe paralysis at nadir, who ultimately had poorer long-term outcomes.CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class IV evidence that for patients with EV-D68-associated AFM, fluoxetine is well-tolerated and not associated with improved neurologic outcomes. MRI Brain Abnormalities in Acute Flaccid Myelitis: Characteristics and Differentiation from Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis Hopkins, S., Gordon-Lipkin, E., Van Haren, K., Santoro, J., Munoz-Arcos, L., Matesanz, S., Pardo-Villamizar, C., Banwell, B. View details for Pediatric Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis: a systematic review of literature and case series Santoro, J., Lazzareschi, D. V., Campen, C., Van Haren, K. P. To characterize the phenotype of pediatric Bickerstaff's brainstem encephalitis (BBE) and evaluate prognostic features in the clinical course, diagnostic studies, and treatment exposures.We systematically reviewed PubMed, Web of Science, and SCOPUS databases as well as medical records at theLucile Packard Children's Hospital to identify cases of pediatric BBE. Inclusion required all of the following criteria: age20years, presence of somnolence or alterations in mental status at the time of presentation or developed within 7 days of presentation, ataxia, and ophthalmoplegia.We reviewed 682 manuscripts, identifying a total of 47 pediatric BBE cases. We also describe five previously unreported cases. The phenotype of these pediatric patients was similar to previously published literature. Sixty-eight percent of patients demonstrated positive anti-GQ1b antibody titers, yet the presence of these antibodies was not associated with longer times to recovery. Patients with neuroimaging abnormalities featured a longer median time to recovery, but this was not statistically significant (p=0.124). Overall, patients treated with any form of immunotherapy (intravenous immunoglobulin, steroids, or plasmapheresis) demonstrated shorter median time to resolution of symptoms compared to supportive therapy, although this trend was not statistically significant (p=0.277). Post-hoc t tests revealed a trend towards use of immunotherapy against supportive care alone (p=0.174).Our study identified clinical, radiologic, and treatment features that may hold prognostic value for children with BBE. The role of immunotherapy remains under investigation but may prove of utility with further, randomized controlled studies in this rare disease.

View details for Postmortem Whole Exome Sequencing Identifies Novel EIF2B3 Mutation With Prenatal Phenotype in 2 Siblings Song, H., Haeri, S., Vogel, H., van der Knaap, M., Van Haren, K. We describe 2 male siblings with a severe, prenatal phenotype of vanishing white matter disease and the impact of whole exome sequencing on their diagnosis and clinical care.The 2 children underwent detailed clinical characterization, through clinical and laboratory testing, as well as prenatal and postnatal imaging. Biobanked blood from the 2 siblings was submitted for whole exome sequencing at Baylor Laboratories.Both male children had abnormal prenatal neuroimaging and suffered precipitous, fatal neurologic decline. Neuropathologic findings included subependymal pseudocysts, microcalcifications, and profound lack of brain myelin and sparing of peripheral nerve myelin. A novel homozygous mutation in the EIF2B3 gene (c.97A>G [p.Lys33Glu]) was found in both children; both parents were heterozygous carriers. The family subsequently conceived a healthy child via in vitro fertilization with preimplantation mutation screening.These histories expand the prenatal phenotype of eIF2b-related disorders and poignantly illustrate the impact that unbiased genomic sequencing can have on the diagnosis and medical decision making for families affected by childhood neurodegenerative disorders. Revised consensus statement on the preventive and symptomatic care of patients with leukodystrophies Adang, L.

L., Bernard, G., van Haren, K., Vanderver, A., Global Leukodtystrophy Initiative Leukodystrophies are a broad class of genetic disorders that result in disruption or destruction of central myelination. Although the mechanisms underlying these disorders are heterogeneous, there are many common symptoms that affect patients irrespective of the genetic diagnosis. The comfort and quality of life of these children is a primary goal that can complement efforts directed at curative therapies. Contained within this report is a systems-based approach to management of complications that result from leukodystrophies. We discuss the initial evaluation, identification of common medical issues, and management options to establish a comprehensive, standardized care approach. We will also address clinical topics relevant to select leukodystrophies, such as gallbladder pathology and adrenal insufficiency. The recommendations within this review rely on existing studies and consensus opinions and underscore the need for future research on evidence-based outcomes to better treat the manifestations of this unique set of genetic disorders. Decision Making in Adrenoleukodystrophy: When Is a Good Outcome Really a Good Outcome? Arresting and Relapsing Cerebral Adrenoleukodystrophy, A Treatable Mimic of Multiple Sclerosis Carlson, A.

View details for Neonatal detection of Aicardi Goutires Syndrome by increased C26:0 lysophosphatidylcholine and interferon signature on newborn screening blood spots. Armangue, T., Orsini, J. J., Takanohashi, A., Gavazzi, F., Conant, A., Ulrick, N., Morrissey, M. A., Nahhas, N., Helman, G., Gordish-Dressman, H., Orcesi, S., Tonduti, D., Stutterd, C., van Haren, K., Toro, C., Iglesias, A. D., van der Knaap, M. S., Goldbach Mansky, R., Moser, A. B., Jones, R. O., Vanderver, A. Aicardi Goutires Syndrome (AGS) is a heritable interferonopathy associated with systemic autoinflammation causing interferon (IFN) elevation, central nervous system calcifications, leukodystrophy and severe neurologic sequelae. An infant with TREX1 mutations was recently found to have abnormal C26:0 lysophosphatidylcholine (C26:0 Lyso-PC) in a newborn screening platform for X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, prompting analysis of this analyte in retrospectively collected samples from individuals affected by AGS.In this study, we explored C26:0 Lyso-PC levels and IFN signatures in newborn blood spots and post-natal blood samples in 19 children with a molecular and clinical diagnosis of AGS and in the blood spots of 22 healthy newborns. We used Nanostring nCounter for IFN-induced gene analysis and a high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC MS/MS) newborn screening platform for C26:0 Lyso-PC analysis.Newborn screening cards from patients across six AGS associated genes were collected, with a median disease presentation of 2months. Thirteen out of 19 (68%) children with AGS had elevations of first tier C26:0 Lyso-PC (>0.4M), that would have resulted in a second screen being performed in a two tier screening system for X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD). The median (95%CI) of first tier C26:0 Lyso-PC values in AGS individuals (0.43M [0.37-0.48]) was higher than that seen in controls (0.21M [0.21-0.21]), but lower than X-ALD individuals (0.72M [0.59-0.84])(p<0.001). Fourteen of 19 children had elevated expression of IFN signaling on blood cards relative to controls (Sensitivity 73.7%, 95%CI 51-88%, Specificity 95%, 95% CI 78-99%) including an individual with delayed disease presentation (36months of age). All five AGS patients with negative IFN signature at birth had RNASEH2B mutations. Consistency of agreement between IFN signature in neonatal and post-natal samples was high (0.85).This suggests that inflammatory markers in AGS can be identified in the newborn period, before symptom onset. Additionally, since C26:0 Lyso-PC screening is currently used in X-ALD newborn screening panels, clinicians should be alert to the fact that AGS infants may present as false positives during X-ALD screening. Acute flaccid myelitis: A clinical review of US cases 2012-2015. Messacar, K., Schreiner, T. L., Van Haren, K., Yang, M., Glaser, C. A., Tyler, K. L., Dominguez, S. R. This review highlights clinical features of the increasing cases of acute flaccid paralysis associated with anterior myelitis noted in the United States from 2012 to 2015. Acute flaccid myelitis refers to acute flaccid limb weakness with spinal cord gray matter lesions on imaging or evidence of spinal cord motor neuron injury on electrodiagnostic testing. Although some individuals demonstrated improvement in motor weakness and functional deficits, most have residual weakness a year or more after onset. Epidemiological evidence and biological plausibility support an association between enterovirus D68 and the recent increase in acute flaccid myelitis cases in the United States. Ann Neurol 2016. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis: Updates on an inflammatory CNS syndrome. Pohl, D., Alper, G., Van Haren, K., Kornberg, A. J., Lucchinetti, C. F., Tenembaum, S., Belman, A. L. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is an immune-mediated demyelinating CNS disorder with predilection to early childhood. ADEM is generally considered a monophasic disease. However, recurrent ADEM has been described and defined as multiphasic disseminated encephalomyelitis. ADEM often occurs postinfectiously, although a causal relationship has never been established. ADEM and multiple sclerosis are currently viewed as distinct entities, generally distinguishable even at disease onset. However, pathologic studies have demonstrated transitional cases of yet unclear significance. ADEM is clinically defined by acute polyfocal neurologic deficits including encephalopathy. MRI typically demonstrates reversible, ill-defined white matter lesions of the brain and often also the spinal cord, along with frequent involvement of thalami and basal ganglia. CSF analysis may reveal a mild pleocytosis and elevated protein, but is generally negative for intrathecal oligoclonal immunoglobulin G synthesis. In the absence of a specific diagnostic test, ADEM is considered a diagnosis of exclusion, and ADEM mimics, especially those requiring a different treatment approach, have to be carefully ruled out. The role of biomarkers, including autoantibodies like anti-myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein, in the pathogenesis and diagnosis of ADEM is currently under debate. Based on the presumed autoimmune etiology of ADEM, the current treatment approach consists of early immunotherapy. Outcome of ADEM in pediatric patients is generally favorable, but cognitive deficits have been reported even in the absence of other neurologic sequelae. This review summarizes the current knowledge on epidemiology, pathology, clinical presentation, neuroimaging features, CSF findings, differential diagnosis, therapy, and outcome, with a focus on recent advances and controversies. Magnetic Resonance Imaging Spectrum of Succinate Dehydrogenase-Related Infantile Leukoencephalopathy Helman, G., Caldovic, L., Whitehead, M. T., Simons, C., Brockmann, K., Edvardson, S., Bai, R., Moroni, I., Taylor, J. M., Van Haren, K., Taft, R. J., Vanderver, A., van der Knaap, M. S. Succinate dehydrogenase-deficient leukoencephalopathy is a complex II-related mitochondrial disorder for which the clinical phenotype, neuroimaging pattern, and genetic findings have not been comprehensively reviewed.Nineteen individuals with succinate dehydrogenase deficiency-related leukoencephalopathy were reviewed for neuroradiological, clinical, and genetic findings as part of institutional review board-approved studies at Children's National Health System (Washington, DC) and VU University Medical Center (Amsterdam, the Netherlands).All individuals had signal abnormalities in the central corticospinal tracts and spinal cord where imaging was available. Other typical findings were involvement of the cerebral hemispheric white matter with sparing of the U fibers, the corpus callosum with sparing of the outer blades, the basis pontis, middle cerebellar peduncles, and cerebellar white matter, and elevated succinate on magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). The thalamus was involved in most studies, with a predilection for the anterior nucleus, pulvinar, and geniculate bodies. Clinically, infantile onset neurological regression with partial recovery and subsequent stabilization was typical. All individuals had mutations in SDHA, SDHB, or SDHAF1, or proven biochemical defect.Succinate dehydrogenase deficiency is a rare leukoencephalopathy, for which improved recognition by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in combination with advanced sequencing technologies allows noninvasive diagnostic confirmation. The MRI pattern is characterized by cerebral hemispheric white matter abnormalities with sparing of the U fibers, corpus callosum involvement with sparing of the outer blades, and involvement of corticospinal tracts, thalami, and spinal cord. In individuals with infantile regression and this pattern of MRI abnormalities, the differential diagnosis should include succinate dehydrogenase deficiency, in particular if MRS shows elevated succinate. Ann Neurol 2016 ANN NEUROL 2016;79:379-386. Emerging Treatments for Pediatric Leukodystrophies Helman, G., Van Haren, K., Escolar, M. L., Vanderver, A. The leukodystrophies are a heterogeneous group of inherited disorders with broad clinical manifestations and variable pathologic mechanisms. Improved diagnostic methods have allowed identification of the underlying cause of these diseases, facilitating identification of their pathologic mechanisms. Clinicians are now able to prioritize treatment strategies and advance research in therapies for specific disorders. Although only a few of these disorders have well-established treatments or therapies, a number are on the verge of clinical trials. As investigators are able to shift care from symptomatic management of disorders to targeted therapeutics, the unmet therapeutic needs could be reduced for these patients. A novel outbreak enterovirus D68 strain associated with acute flaccid myelitis cases in the USA (2012-14): a retrospective cohort study Greninger, A. L., Naccache, S. N., Messacar, K., Clayton, A., Yu, G., Somasekar, S., Federman, S., Stryke, D., Anderson, C., Yagi, S., Messenger, S., Wadford, D., Xia, D., Watt, J. P., Van Haren, K., Dominguez, S. R., Glaser, C., Aldrovandi, G., Chiu, C. Y. Enterovirus D68 was implicated in a widespread outbreak of severe respiratory illness across the USA in 2014 and has also been reported sporadically in patients with acute flaccid myelitis. We aimed to investigate the association between enterovirus D68 infection and acute flaccid myelitis during the 2014 enterovirus D68 respiratory outbreak in the USA.Patients with acute flaccid myelitis who presented to two hospitals in Colorado and California, USA, between Nov 24, 2013, and Oct 11, 2014, were included in the study. Additional cases identified from Jan 1, 2012, to Oct 4, 2014, via statewide surveillance were provided by the California Department of Public Health. We investigated the cause of these cases by metagenomic next-generation sequencing, viral genome recovery, and enterovirus D68 phylogenetic analysis. We compared patients with acute flaccid myelitis who were positive for enterovirus D68 with those with acute flaccid myelitis but negative for enterovirus D68 using the two-tailed Fisher's exact test, two-sample unpaired t test, and Mann-Whitney U test.48 patients were included: 25 with acute flaccid myelitis, two with enterovirus-associated encephalitis, five with enterovirus-D68-associated upper respiratory illness, and 16 with aseptic meningitis or encephalitis who tested positive for enterovirus. Enterovirus D68 was detected in respiratory secretions from seven (64%) of 11 patients comprising two temporally and geographically linked acute flaccid myelitis clusters at the height of the 2014 outbreak, and from 12 (48%) of 25 patients with acute flaccid myelitis overall. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that all enterovirus D68 sequences associated with acute flaccid myelitis grouped into a clade B1 strain that emerged in 2010. Of six coding polymorphisms in the clade B1 enterovirus D68 polyprotein, five were present in neuropathogenic poliovirus or enterovirus D70, or both. One child with acute flaccid myelitis and a sibling with only upper respiratory illness were both infected by identical enterovirus D68 strains. Enterovirus D68 viraemia was identified in a child experiencing acute neurological progression of his paralytic illness. Deep metagenomic sequencing of cerebrospinal fluid from 14 patients with acute flaccid myelitis did not reveal evidence of an alternative infectious cause to enterovirus D68.These findings strengthen the putative association between enterovirus D68 and acute flaccid myelitis and the contention that acute flaccid myelitis is a rare yet severe clinical manifestation of enterovirus D68 infection in susceptible hosts.National Institutes of Health, University of California, Abbott Laboratories, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

A., Takanohashi, A., Petryniak, M., Rowitch, D., Messing, A., Wrabetz, L., Schiffmann, R., Eichler, F., Escolar, M. L., Vanderver, A. Leukodystrophies are a heterogeneous, often progressive group of disorders manifesting a wide range of symptoms and complications. Most of these disorders have historically had no etiologic or disease specific therapeutic approaches. Recently, a greater understanding of the pathologic mechanisms associated with leukodystrophies has allowed clinicians and researchers to prioritize treatment strategies and advance research in therapies for specific disorders, some of which are on the verge of pilot or Phase I/II clinical trials. This shifts the care of leukodystrophy patients from the management of the complex array of symptoms and sequelae alone to targeted therapeutics. The unmet needs of leukodystrophy patients still remain an overwhelming burden. While the overwhelming consensus is that these disorders collectively are symptomatically treatable, leukodystrophy patients are in need of advanced therapies and if possible, a cure.

L., Pizzino, A., Helman, G., Suhr, D., Waggoner, J., Hobson, D., Vanderver, A., Patterson, M. C. Leukodystrophies are inherited disorders whose primary pathophysiology consists of abnormal deposition or progressive disruption of brain myelin. Leukodystrophy patients manifest many of the same symptoms and medical complications despite the wide spectrum of genetic origins. Although no definitive cures exist, all of these conditions are treatable. This report provides the first expert consensus on the recognition and treatment of medical and psychosocial complications associated with leukodystrophies. We include a discussion of serious and potentially preventable medical complications and propose several preventive care strategies. We also outline the need for future research to prioritize clinical needs and subsequently develop, validate, and optimize specific care strategies.

De Novo Mutations in the Motor Domain of KIF1A Cause Cognitive Impairment, Spastic Paraparesis, Axonal Neuropathy, and Cerebellar Atrophy Lee, J., Srour, M., Kim, D., Hamdan, F. F., Lim, S., Brunel-Guitton, C., Decarie, J., Rossignol, E., Mitchell, G. A., Schreiber, A., Moran, R., Van Haren, K., Richardson, R., Nicolai, J., Oberndorff, K. M., Wagner, J. D., Boycott, K.

KIF1A is a neuron-specific motor protein that plays important roles in cargo transport along neurites. Recessive mutations in KIF1A were previously described in families with spastic paraparesis or sensory and autonomic neuropathy type-2. Here, we report 11 heterozygous de novo missense mutations (p.S58L, p.T99M, p.G102D, p.V144F, p.R167C, p.A202P, p.S215R, p.R216P, p.L249Q, p.E253K, and p.R316W) in KIF1A in 14 individuals, including two monozygotic twins. Two mutations (p.T99M and p.E253K) were recurrent, each being found in unrelated cases. All these de novo mutations are located in the motor domain (MD) of KIF1A. Structural modeling revealed that they alter conserved residues that are critical for the structure and function of the MD. Transfection studies suggested that at least five of these mutations affect the transport of the MD along axons. Individuals with de novo mutations in KIF1A display a phenotype characterized by cognitive impairment and variable presence of cerebellar atrophy, spastic paraparesis, optic nerve atrophy, peripheral neuropathy, and epilepsy. Our findings thus indicate that de novo missense mutations in the MD of KIF1A cause a phenotype that overlaps with, while being more severe, than that associated with recessive mutations in the same gene.

A., Feikin, D., Glaser, C. In August 2012, the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) was contacted by a San Francisco Bay area clinician who requested poliovirus testing for an unvaccinated man aged 29 years with acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) associated with anterior myelitis (i.e., evidence of inflammation of the spinal cord involving the grey matter including anterior horn cell bodies) and no history of international travel during the month before symptom onset. Within 2 weeks, CDPH had received reports of two additional cases of AFP with anterior myelitis of unknown etiology. Testing at CDPH's Viral and Rickettsial Disease Laboratory for stool, nasopharyngeal swab, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) did not detect the presence of an enterovirus (EV), the genus of the family Picornaviridae that includes poliovirus. Additional laboratory testing for infectious diseases conducted at the CDPH Viral and Rickettsial Disease Laboratory did not identify a causative agent to explain the observed clinical syndrome reported among the patients. To identify other cases of AFP with anterior myelitis and elucidate possible common etiologies, CDPH posted alerts in official communications for California local health departments during December 2012, July 2013, and February 2014. Reports of cases of neurologic illness received by CDPH were investigated throughout this period, and clinicians were encouraged to submit clinical samples for testing. A total of 23 cases of AFP with anterior myelitis of unknown etiology were identified. Epidemiologic and laboratory investigation did not identify poliovirus infection as a possible cause for the observed cases. No common etiology was identified to explain the reported cases, although EV-D68 was identified in upper respiratory tract specimens of two patients. EV infection, including poliovirus infection, should be considered in the differential diagnosis in cases of AFP with anterior myelitis and testing performed per CDC guidelines.

J., Lopez, J., Van Haren, K., Wilkes, J., Sheng, X., Nelson, C., Korgenski, E. K., Srivastava, R., Bonkowsky, J. L. Inherited leukodystrophies are progressive, debilitating neurological disorders with few treatment options and high mortality rates. Our objective was to determine national variation in the costs for leukodystrophy patients and to evaluate differences in their care.We developed an algorithm to identify inherited leukodystrophy patients in deidentified data sets using a recursive tree model based on International Classification of Disease, 9th Edition, Clinical Modification, diagnosis and procedure charge codes. Validation of the algorithm was performed independently at two institutions, and with data from the Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS) of 43 US children's hospitals, for a 7-year period between 2004 and2010.A recursive algorithm was developed and validated, based on six International Classification of Disease, 9th Edition, Clinical Modification, codes and one procedure code that had a sensitivity up to 90% (range 61-90%) and a specificity up to 99% (range 53-99%) for identifying inherited leukodystrophy patients. Inherited leukodystrophy patients comprise 0.4% of admissions to children's hospitals and 0.7% of costs. During 7 years, these patients required $411 million of hospital care, or $131,000/patient. Hospital costs for leukodystrophy patients varied at different institutions, ranging from two to 15 times more than the average pediatric patient. There was a statistically significant correlation between higher volume and increased cost efficiency. Increased mortality rates had an inverse relationship with increased patient volume that was not statistically significant.We developed and validated a code-based algorithm for identifying leukodystrophy patients in deidentified national datasets. Leukodystrophy patients account for $59 million of costs yearly at children's hospitals. Our data highlight potential to reduce unwarranted variability and improve patient care.

Aspirin can reduce stroke-like events and seizure episodes and prevent further brain injuries in these patients. Although a few cases of intracranial hemorrhage in patients with Sturge-Weber syndrome have been reported, prior reports have not discussed this complication with regard to particular therapies. The authors present a toddler with Sturge-Weber syndrome who developed a subdural hematoma in the setting of a mechanical fall with minor head trauma. They discuss the possible role of aspirin in contributing to, or perhaps protecting against, intracranial hemorrhage in patients with Sturge-Weber syndrome. Further data are needed to establish the utility of aspirin in Sturge-Weber syndrome.

Both the disease course and its response to treatment may be highly dependent on the immune system. In this review, we compare three common leukodystrophies, each with a different immune response: (1) X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, which demonstrates a severe, lymphocytic inflammatory response; (2) metachromatic leukodystrophy, which yields a histiocytic response; and (3) vanishing white-matter disease, in which no inflammation is typically seen. We highlight the biochemical, pathologic, and clinical differences, while focusing on the immune response in each disease. We also review the response of leukodystrophies to immunomodulatory therapies and interventions such as hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation. Future studies may delineate specific inflammatory markers as possible candidates for therapeutic intervention.

P., van Kollenburg, B., Bertrand, G., Van Haren, K., Scheper, G. C., Powers, J. M., van der Knaap, M. S. Leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter (VWM) is an autosomal-recessive disorder in which febrile infections may provoke major neurologic deterioration. Characteristic pathologic findings include cystic white matter degeneration, foamy oligodendrocytes, dysmorphic astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, oligodendrocytosis, and apoptotic losses of oligodendrocytes. VWM is caused by mutations in eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 2B (eIF2B). eIF2B plays an important role in the regulation of protein synthesis. Mutant eIF2B may impair the ability of cells to regulate protein synthesis in response to stress and perhaps even under normal conditions. An overload of misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum activates the unfolded protein response (UPR), a compensatory mechanism that inhibits synthesis of new proteins and induces both prosurvival and proapoptotic signals. We have studied the activation of the UPR in VWM through the immunohistochemical expression of its upstream components PERK and phosphorylated eIF2alpha (eIF2alphaP) and combined immunohistochemical and Western blot analysis of the downstream effector proteins activating transcription factor-4 (ATF4) and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) in 4 VWM brains and 3 age-matched controls. We demonstrate activation of the UPR in glia of patients with VWM. Our findings may point to a possible explanation for the dysmorphic glia, the increased numbers of oligodendrocytes, and the apoptotic loss of oligodendrocytes in VWM.

P., PETERSON, D. R., van der Knaap, M. S., Powers, J. M. Vanishing white matter disease (VWM) is a progressive cavitating disease of central white matter due to a deficiency of the translation initiation factor eIF2B. Oligodendrocytes appear to be numerically increased in some white matter areas, while decreased in others. We compared oligodendrocytes of cerebral, cerebellar, and pontine white matter from 5 VWM patients with those of age-matched controls by light microscopy and immunohistochemistry using antibodies to activated caspase-3, bak, bax, bcl-2, survivin, and Ki-67, as well as by the TUNEL technique. Oligodendrocytes were identified morphologically and quantified using an ocular grid. We observed statistically significant increases in their densities at all sites; Ki-67-labeled oligodendrocytes were identified in 2 of 5 patients. Apoptotic oligodendrocytes were documented in 3 of 5 patients, while bcl-2 and survivin labeling was observed in 2 of 5 and 2 of 2 patients, respectively. There was a trend toward an increase in apoptotic labeling of oligodendrocytes that was strongest in the cerebrum, the major locus of VWM, in the youngest and most severely affected patients. These data conclusively demonstrate increased oligodendrocytic densities in VWM; the increase is not an artifact of white matter contraction. Our data also document that oligodendrocytes undergo apoptosis, perhaps in conjunction with major neurologic crises, and that a subset of oligodendrocytes are able to persist and proliferate. Conflicting proliferative, cell-death, and survival signals impact the oligodendrocytes of VWM. View details for",85,Relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis,-12.467188835144043,175

Monozygotic twins and triplets discordant for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis display differential methylation and gene expression Monozygotic twins and triplets discordant for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis display differential methylation and gene expression   ,   ,   ,   ,   ,   ,   ,   ,   ,   &     , Article number:  () Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterised by the loss of upper and lower motor neurons. ALS exhibits high phenotypic variability including age and site of onset, and disease duration. To uncover epigenetic and transcriptomic factors that may modify an ALS phenotype, we used a cohort of Australian monozygotic twins (n = 3 pairs) and triplets (n = 1 set) that are discordant for ALS and represent sporadic ALS and the two most common types of familial ALS, linked to and . Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450K BeadChip, EpiTYPER and RNA-Seq analyses in these ALS-discordant twins/triplets and control twins (n = 2 pairs), implicated genes with consistent longitudinal differential DNA methylation and/or gene expression. Two identified genes, and , showed significant differential methylation in an extended cohort of >1000 ALS cases and controls. Combined longitudinal methylation-transcription analysis within a single twin set implicated , , , and , which have been previously associated with ALS. Longitudinal transcriptome data showed an 8-fold enrichment of immune function genes and under-representation of transcription and protein modification genes in ALS. Examination of these changes in a large Australian sporadic ALS cohort suggest a broader role in ALS. Furthermore, we observe that increased methylation age is a signature of ALS in older patients. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterised by the rapidly progressive loss of the upper and lower motor neurons. Disease onset commonly occurs in middle to late age and typically results in death within three to five years. Existing treatments are of limited effect, and despite intensive effort, the pathogenic mechanisms underlying disease are still poorly understood. A recognised family history (familial ALS, FALS) is seen in approximately 10% of cases while the remainder are considered sporadic (SALS). The familial and sporadic forms of the disease are clinically and pathologically indistinguishable. To date, the only proven cause of ALS are gene mutations leading to motor neuron death. Pathogenic repeat expansions in the gene and missense mutations in the gene are the most frequent known causes of ALS worldwide, yet no cause has been identified for the majority of patients (>80%). Even in those individuals with a proven causal gene mutation, inter- and intra-familial phenotypic heterogeneity is commonly observed. Age of disease onset may vary by more than 60 years and disease duration may be measured in months or in decades. Affected individuals, particularly those with a repeat expansion, may present with ALS or frontotemporal dementia (FTD), or a mixed phenotype. Causal mutations may show incomplete penetrance and indeed monozygotic twins are more commonly discordant for ALS than concordant. Taken together, this phenotypic variability suggests a significant contribution from modifying factors in disease manifestation. Epigenetic and transcriptional profiling have implicated differential DNA methylation and/or gene expression in ALS. has been shown to have increased methylation and decreased transcription in ALS/FTD patients with the pathogenic repeat expansion. Other major ALS genes, however, including , and , are generally unmethylated and show no differences between patients and controls. Nevertheless, changes in expression of some ALS genes is apparent in sporadic disease. Whole methylome and transcriptome studies in spinal cord and blood tissue have found global changes and implicated various genes, pathways and several overlapping themes including changes that affect immune response and cellular transport. Disease discordant monozygotic (MZ) twins hold great potential for studies that seek to identify epigenetic and transcriptomic factors that modify the phenotype of complex human diseases. Identical twin studies can account for confounding factors such as genetic variation and the early development environment. Such studies have informed understanding of phenotypic variation in Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, and depression, among others. Previous DNA methylation studies of known causal ALS genes in ALS-discordant MZ twins found no aberrant methylation between twins, while twin-based methylome-wide studies suggested a different epigenetic age in affected twins and identified potentially altered GABA signalling and immune response. Nevertheless, further studies are required because the differentially methylated sites implicated in initial screens have often failed to be validated in targeted studies using bisulphite pyrosequencing. Similarly, candidate molecular pathways have shown limited overlap between twin sets and changes in methylation are yet to be linked to changes in transcription. It remains unclear which of the observed differences in either DNA methylation or gene expression reflect ALS discordance between co-twins. It is also unclear whether these differences in DNA methylation correlate with differential gene expression on a transcriptome-wide scale. In this study, we undertook comprehensive methylome- and transcriptome-wide analysis of a longitudinal ALS-discordant cohort comprising MZ triplets and twins, representing the three most common types of ALS: -linked ALS, -linked ALS and sporadic ALS. We analysed methylome- and transcriptome-wide data, independently and in combination, in an attempt to identify disease-relevant methylation changes and their downstream impact. Co-twin analyses indicated a significant interaction effect between age and disease status on DNA methylation age, with older twins showing a consistent difference between ALS-affected and unaffected co-twins in a longitudinal series. Furthermore, we identified several genes likely to contribute to ALS through integration of longitudinal twin genome-wide DNA methylation and transcription data, further assessed in a large sporadic ALS case-control cohort. Clinical and sample information for the three discordant MZ twin sets, one discordant MZ triplet set and two control twin sets are included in Table . Pedigrees and extended pedigrees are shown in Fig. . All individuals with ALS have been screened for causal mutations in known ALS genes. The FALS twin set has a pathogenic hexanucleotide repeat expansion in . The FALS triplet set harbours a p.I114T mutation. Targeted analysis of methylation in mutation-known MZ sets To assess whether differential methylation of the or CpG islands were associated with the disease discordance we observe in the twin set and triplets, we investigated the status of CpG methylation of the and CpG islands. To perform a high-density, targeted analysis, we used EpiTYPER, with additional support from a number of Infinium HumanMethylation450K CpG sites present in the same region. methylation in the MZ triplet set shows a consistent methylation pattern We used EpiTYPER to quantify methylation of the upstream CpG island encompassing the promoter region and exon 1 in the discordant MZ triplets carrying the p.I114T mutation and a pair of control twins from another p.I114T family that were negative for the mutation. Additionally, five CpG sites present in the Infinium HumanMethylation450K data set were located within the CpG island (Fig. ). Neither the 23 CpG units within the CpG island, nor the five 450K CpG sites, showed any consistent methylation differences between ALS affected and ALS unaffected MZ triplets, nor control twins (Fig. ). No differences were observed in methylation in the MZ twin set The quantitative methylation status of two CpG islands associated with was determined using EpiTYPER. The amplicons covered the entirety of both CpG islands, the promoter region and adjacent intronic/intergenic regions. The intronic pathogenic (GGGGCC) repeat expansion (indicated with a black diamond in Fig. ) is flanked by the two CpG islands. In the disease discordant FALS twin set harbouring a expansion, methylation across the GpG island (CGI) measured by the EpiTYPER assay are highly concordant and generally unmethylated (Fig. ). Similarly, in the four 450K probes associated with , none of the CpG sites show a clear difference in methylation between the co-twins (Fig. ). Whole methylome analysis of disease discordant MZ twins/triplets Co-twin/triplet differences in DNA methylation age (DNAm) reflects an age-dependant effect Horvath’s DNA methylation age algorithm used methylation levels of 353 CpG sites to predict the epigenetic age from each twin/triplet sample in Table . DNA methylation age has a high correlation with chronological age across multiple tissue types, thus enabling calculation of the biological age of an individual. We tested the association of methylation age with disease status and chronological age in a mixed model while controlling for sex. The effect of disease status on methylation age was found to be highly dependent upon chronological age (p = 1.3E-5, Fig. ). Briefly, with increasing age, asymptomatic co-twins were estimated to have a younger epigenetic age than their ALS-affected twin. This result was most evident in the approximately 20-year difference in methylation age between twins in the oldest disease discordant twin set of this cohort (Fig. ). Global methylation and cell type proportions do not show any effect of disease status Global methylation was calculated as the mean methylation across all Infinium HumanMethylation450K CpG sites passing data processing (n = 386183). No significant effect of disease on global methylation was found when controlling for sex and age at sample collection (p = 0.08, Fig. ). To better reflect influence on transcription, CpG sites were classified according to CpG density: high density CpG islands, intermediate density in islands, island shores, and low CpG density. Mean methylation within each of these four levels of CpG density does not show any effect of disease status (HC, p = 0.93; IC, p = 0.99; ICshore, p = 0.82; LC, p = 0.093, Supplementary Fig. ). Full blood count data were unavailable from twin/triplet sets at time of sample collection. Therefore, blood cell proportions for each twin/triplet sample were estimated from methylation data using Houseman .’s algorithm and the six cell types were assessed for association with disease status. Disease status did not have a significant effect on any of the cell types when controlling for age at sample collection and sex (all p > 0.2, Fig. ). Differentially methylated probes were identified across discordant MZ twins/triplets The established DNA methylation twin-study method of statistical significance and the magnitude of pairwise methylation differences were combined to detect differentially methylated probes in discordant MZ twin studies. 59 probes were identified as differentially methylated across twin/triplet sets (full list in Supplementary Table , 9 top-ranked probes shown in Fig. ). All 59 probes were used for hierarchical clustering and principal components analysis (PCA) of the longitudinal MZ cohort to investigate the presence of a disease signature. Both hierarchical clustering and PCA did not indicate that samples cluster by disease status, but rather approximately by twin set and individual, where longitudinal samples were available (Fig. ). The 59 probes were subsequently investigated in our large case-control 450K methylation extended data set (n = 646 SALS cases and 533 unrelated controls). After FDR correction, 2 of the 59 probes showed significantly differential methylation between cases and controls when controlling for age and sex (, cg00278366, p = 2.5E-5; , cg15444185, p = 0.049, Fig. ; full results for all 59 CpGs in Supplementary Table ). As observed in the MZ cohort, hierarchical clustering and PCA of this probe list in the case-control cohort does not indicate any power to discriminate between ALS and control samples (Fig. ), nor sex or age group. Differentially methylated probes (DMPs) identified within discordant MZ twin/triplet sets implicates new genes and existing ALS genes Given the clinical heterogeneity in our twin/triplet cohort, within-twin-set differential methylation was also investigated. Using a threshold of a difference in -methylation ≥0.25 between co-twins or the affected triplet and the mean of the unaffected triplets, we identified 0 DMPs in female SALS twins, 6 in C9orf72 twins, 58 in SOD1 triplets, 2689 in male SALS, and 29 in control twins (Supplementary Fig. ). Up to 11 probes were annotated per gene in the male SALS twin list of DMPs, for a total of 1829 genes identified. The 506 genes to which multiple male SALS twin probes annotate are given in Supplementary Table , which includes two genes previously associated with ALS, (Dipeptidyl Peptidase Like 6) and (Receptor Activity Modifying Protein 3) (Fig. ). No other discordant twin/triplet set had multiple probes annotated to the same gene. Across all discordant twin/triplet sets, 2 probes (Fig. ) and 13 genes (, , , , , , , _, , , , , , Fig. ) were identified in multiple twin/triplet sets. None of these probes or genes were also identified in the control twin set. Each of the male SALS twins’ DMPs, twins’ DMPs and triplets’ DMPs showed minimal overlap with the control twins DMPs (5, 1, and 1 DMPs, respectively, Fig. , Supplementary Table ). Similarly, minimal overlapping genes-annotated-to-DMPs were identified between the control and discordant twins/triplets, with 9, 1, and 1 genes respectively (Fig. , Supplementary Table ). Transcriptome-wide analysis of disease discordant MZ siblings Differentially expressed genes within male SALS twins implicates immune function and cell signalling functional pathways in sporadic ALS Using limma voom to detect genes differentially expressed between male SALS twins while controlling for repeated sampling, we identified 4179 genes as significant following FDR correction (p < 0.05). Of these, 750 genes also had a fold change of 1.5 or greater (Fig. , top genes shown in Fig. , full list in Supplementary Table ). Notably, and , both known ALS genes, were identified as significantly downregulated in the ALS twin compared to their unaffected co-twin (: logFC = 0.70, t = 3.99, FDR = 0.027; : logFC = 0.70, t = 6.42, FDR = 0.008, Fig. ). Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of these 750 genes identified 74 terms significantly enriched in this list. Over-representation of genes was seen in 25 terms associated with immune function and cell signalling, while there was an under-representation of genes associated with 45 terms, largely related to transcription and protein modification (Fig. , Supplementary Table ). Validation of twin differentially expressed genes in a case-control cohort Within the validation RNAseq data set of SALS and controls, 379 of the 750 genes identified in the male SALS twins were present. When analysed with limma while controlling for sex, 213 of the 379 genes were differentially expressed between cases and controls, yet none also showed a minimum fold change of 1.5 (top 8 of 213 genes shown in Fig. , 213 genes in Supplementary Table ). was not present in the case-control data set, while was not validated (log FC = 0.13, t = 1.99, FDR = 0.075). Hierarchical clustering and PCA of the 379 genes did not identify clusters representing disease status (Fig. ). Integration of genome-wide methylation and transcriptome data sets identifies 12 genes both differentially methylated and differentially expressed To increase the likelihood of detecting biologically meaningful disease-related alterations, RNA-Seq and Infinium HumanMethylation450K data sets were combined for the male SALS twins. Of 506 genes having at least one differentially methylated CpG probe annotated to them in the male SALS twins, 123 are also identified in the entire post-processing RNA-Seq data set of 13718 genes. Conversely, of the 750 genes present in our top DEG list, 642 also have at least one CpG probe mapped to the same gene in the full post-processing 450K set of 24073 genes. When comparing the gene lists of the 123 differentially methylated genes and the 642 differentially expressed genes from the same twin set, 12 genes (, , , , , , , , , , , ) were present in both gene lists (Fig. ). Using a longitudinal cohort of MZ twins and triplets that are discordant for ALS, we have conducted both a targeted and genome-wide DNA methylation study in conjunction with a sample-matched transcriptomic study. Our cohort is representative of the clinical heterogeneity (age of disease onset, disease duration) frequently observed in ALS cohorts. We have shown that DNA methylation age is the most consistently altered epigenetic signature in ALS. In addition, we observed a higher frequency of unique peripheral blood methylation changes within twin/triplet sets compared to shared methylation changes across twin/triplet sets. However, combined analysis of peripheral blood methylation and transcription detected ALS-relevant changes. These data suggest that the epigenetic and transcriptomic landscape of ALS may be highly complex with numerous small perturbations and various pathways, only some of which are common, contributing to disease. Epigenetic age was significantly associated with disease in an age-dependent manner, such that affected twins/triplets have an older DNA methylation age than their unaffected co-twins/-triplets while no such effect was observed in young discordant twins. A clear and consistent difference was apparent between the oldest twins in the study, and to a lesser extent, within both middle-aged twin/triplet sets. This pattern of increased methylation age in ALS affected twins is consistent with previous studies of , and SALS disease-discordant twins. Increased DNA methylation age has been linked to increased mortality and age has been shown to be a major risk and prognostic factor for ALS. Our results also reflect a contribution of ageing to disease risk. Methylation age has also been previously linked to age of onset in ALS patients with a repeat expansion, while we observed a similar phenomenon in our sporadic ALS twin sets, with a much greater between-co-twin difference in DNA methylation age in our late onset twin set compared to our early onset twin set. Further investigation in extended ALS cohorts, specifically mutation-known FALS and SALS would be worthwhile to confirm the contribution of increased DNA methylation age to ALS. When assessing genome-wide DNA methylation using a magnitude and statistical ranking method, we identified 59 probes differentially methylated in all ALS twins/triplets compared to their unaffected co-twin/-triplets. These 59 probes were selected from high CpG density regions of the genome, therefore considered biologically relevant as they are more likely to affect gene expression. Annotation of the probes to the closest gene transcription site and subsequent gene ontology analysis implicated developmental processes. However, clustering of these 59 DMPs were unable to discriminate between affected and healthy twins, or sporadic cases and controls. Yet, two of these probes were confirmed as significantly differentially methylated in the case-control analysis. ’s homolog gene is involved in neurogenesis and highly expressed in the brain, while responds to DNA damage by moving to the nucleus and contributes to control of the cell cycle. There is a growing body of evidence that DNA damage response is a significant factor in ALS. We conducted within-twin/triplet-set comparisons to show the triplet set, twin set and the male SALS twin set each have a moderate number of probes with large differences in methylation (6, 58, and 2689 probes respectively with |Δ| ≥ 0.25). In contrast, the female SALS twin set showed highly consistent methylation across all >386,000 probes (max |Δ| = 0.11). Following annotation of these probes to genes, limited overlap of differentially methylated genes was observed between disease discordant twin sets, consistent with other genome-wide methylation studies in ALS-discordant SALS twin sets. This may be reflective of the heterogenous nature of sporadic ALS, or the different methodologies and strategies used to determine differential methylation. A meta-analysis incorporating these studies would be worthwhile to give a broader picture of the methylation signature of sporadic ALS. It is noteworthy that the four twin sets used in this study represent two distinct genetic forms of disease ( and ), along with two cases at extreme age-of-disease-onset ends of the clinical spectrum of sporadic ALS, suggesting again that there may be various epigenetic pathways impacting the phenotype. Some proportion of the observed differences unique to a twin set may result from epigenetic drift, especially as the greatest number of unique differentially methylated probes was identified in the oldest twin set and the least in the youngest twin set. It is therefore likely that disease, as well as age, is contributing to the differential methylation observed. The metabolism and nutritional status of an individual with ALS, compared to their unaffected co-twin, may also influence methylation status, and therefore potentially contribute to the differential methylation observed. However, detailed dietary data is not available for the individuals included in this study and therefore could not be assessed. Nevertheless, we identified multiple differentially methylated probes annotated to two genes previously associated with ALS, and in our oldest twin set, the male SALS twins. was the first gene to be associated with sporadic ALS. It has roles regulating dendritic excitability, with membrane hyperexcitability observed in ALS. It has also been associated with multiple sclerosis and spinal muscular atrophy, and as such is worthy of further investigation in broader ALS. Analysis of transcriptome-wide gene expression in a subset of our disease discordant MZ cohort, the male SALS twins, found 750 differentially expressed genes. 379 of these genes were assessed in our validation sporadic case-control cohort, and 213 were confirmed to be significantly differentially expressed in sporadic ALS. Gene Ontology analysis implicated primarily upregulation of the immune system, which has been previously identified as dysregulated in ALS. Interestingly, and were downregulated in the ALS-affected twin. has been identified as a causal ALS and FTD gene in several international cohorts. While transient overexpression has been shown to have deleterious effects in zebrafish models, this is the first report of altered mRNA expression in ALS. has been previously linked to in its implication in ALS. Little is known about the effects of altered expression of in ALS, but its overexpression in the G93A- ALS mouse model has been linked to accelerated neurological deficits and worsened mitochondrial pathology. It is interesting that we observed lower expression in the ALS twin than their unaffected co-twin, given that overexpression has been linked to disease in both genes. It was an unfortunate limitation of this study that neither gene featured in our post-processing HumanMethylation450K dataset, and that so few of the genes identified had data available in our case-control data set. As such, it would be worthwhile to further investigate disease-dependent expression of the remaining 371 genes. Comparison of transcriptional and DNA methylation changes in ALS-discordant twin/triplet set(s) indicated that despite many genes being present in only one data set, there was overlap between the two datasets. Of the 750 differentially expressed genes identified in the male SALS twins, 642 had methylation data available, while of the 506 genes to which multiple of the 1366 differentially methylated probes annotated, only 123 were also represented in our gene expression data. When we compared these 642 expression-derived genes and 123 methylation-derived genes, we identified twelve genes: , , , , , , , , , , , . Notably, the ALS genes identified from DMPs in the male SALS twin set, and , were not present in the post-processing male SALS twins RNA-Seq data set. and were identified across all twin sets to have a single probe differentially methylated, which was confirmed in our sporadic case-control cohort, however, neither gene was present in our RNA-Seq data set. While and were differentially expressed in the male SALS twins, neither gene was present in the methylation dataset. While none of the twelve genes have previously been directly linked to ALS, some indirect links exist. , as part of the collagen gene family, is related to , which has been linked to neurodegeneration through impaired autophagy and induction of apoptosis. Additionally, collagen has also been identified as a significant gene ontology term in analysis of DNA methylation in sporadic ALS. , granzyme M, is 1 of 4 gene products from the granzyme family. Granzymes A and B are elevated in ALS serum, with granzyme B correlated to ALS severity. Granzyme B has been further implicated in inducing apoptosis in human ALS motor neurons. , neutral Sphingomyelinase II, is associated with apoptosis and cell cycle regulation, which have been previously linked to ALS. has been suggested as a possible gene contributing to an ALS-linked region on chromosome 17. is involved in the kynurenine pathway, which has been implicated in ALS. These twelve genes, identified when combining DNA methylation and gene expression data, may thus contribute to disease, and warrant further investigation. Assessment of global methylation and blood cell composition showed no difference between ALS and healthy co-twins. Although a lack of global changes in methylation is consistent with five other sets of ALS-discordant twins, not all studies agree. It is also interesting that blood cell composition, as determined from whole blood methylation, was not found to vary between affected and unaffected twins, given that upregulation of the immune system and changes in white blood cell populations have previously been demonstrated in ALS. This lack of effect in white blood cell estimates may be partly attributable to shared genetic background, although a prior study reported differing methylation-derived cell proportion estimates in one ALS-discordant twin pair. High-density quantitative targeted analysis of the and gene-associated CpG islands and gene promotors did not identify any differences in methylation status between ALS-discordant MZ twins/triplets carrying mutations in these genes. The general consistency observed in methylation between carriers of mutations suggests DNA methylation of the promoter itself is not likely to be a major mechanism contributing to differences in penetrance in -linked ALS, in line with previous reports. Methylation of was low in a twin set carrying the repeat expansion. Methylation of the promoter and/or the repeat expansion has been reported in the brain and blood of repeat expansion carriers, in some cases with similar low levels of methylation as that observed here. Interestingly, neither of the two prior twin studies, one ALS concordant and one discordant, detected methylation of , suggesting that methylation is just one part of the epigenetic story in ALS. In conclusion, our disease-discordant twin study, utilising longitudinal samples throughout disease progression, demonstrated significant association of DNA methylation age with disease in an age dependent manner. We have also identified an important set of DMPs and DEGs, and associated functional pathways, that may be involved in either ALS pathogenesis or protection from disease. These genes and pathways offer potential targets for future therapeutic treatment for ALS patients. The cohort of 1806 total participants used in this study is summarised below. This study was approved by the human research ethics committees of Macquarie University (5201600387) and Sydney South West Area Health Service. Samples from ALS patients, family members, and unrelated controls were obtained from the Macquarie University Neurodegenerative Diseases Biobank, Molecular Medicine Laboratory at Concord Hospital, and the Australian MND DNA bank. Written informed consent was obtained from all study subjects and all methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations. Most participants were of European descent and patients were clinically diagnosed with definite or probable ALS based on El Escorial criteria. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood using standard protocols. RNA was extracted from peripheral blood with the QIAsymphony PAXgene blood RNA kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Three ALS discordant monozygotic twin pairs, one ALS discordant MZ triplet set and two control MZ twin pairs were included in this study (Fig.  and Table ). Monozygosity for each twin/triplet set was confirmed using STR fragment analysis and/or SNP microarrays. Longitudinal samples were available from two twin sets (male and female sporadic ALS (SALS) twin sets in Fig. ). The four discordant twin/triplet sets had previously undergone mutation analysis for known ALS genes and whole genome analysis for novel and/or rare de novo variants. Additional samples were used in this study for data processing (Illumina HumanMethylation 450K, EpiTYPER methylation assays, and RNA-Seq) and for examination of significant findings (Illumina HumanMethylation 450K assay and RNA-Seq). Demographic characteristics between cases and controls in extended cohorts were assessed with t-tests for age and tests for sex. For quality control and processing of the EpiTYPER data, 279 samples with EpiTYPER data (158 familial ALS/FTD samples, 56 asymptomatic samples (individuals harbouring a causal gene mutation but currently unaffected), and 65 control samples), and 261 samples with EpiTYPER data (123 familial ALS, 65 asymptomatic, and 73 control samples) were used. For the Infinium HumanMethylation 450K BeadChip, 1658 samples were used in data processing and normalisation. This comprised 889 individuals with sporadic or familial ALS, 92 asymptomatic and 668 controls. The familial ALS and asymptomatic cases largely overlap with the EpiTYPER cohort. The extended cohort subset comprised 650 sporadic ALS individuals and 539 unrelated controls. One hundred and ninety samples were used for data processing and normalisation of the RNA-Seq data, comprising 114 individuals with ALS (99 sporadic ALS, 15 familial ALS) and 76 unrelated controls. The validation subset comprised of 96 sporadic cases and 69 controls. The majority of the 96 validation sporadic ALS cases were also present in the HumanMethylation 450K BeadChip SALS/control cohort. All quality control and data processing steps were carried out in R v 3.4.4. Custom EpiTYPER assays (Sequenom, San Diego, USA) were used to quantify CpG methylation of 56 and 39 CpG units respectively of the two gene-associated CpG islands for and the gene-associated CpG island upstream of . EpiTYPER uses base-specific cleavage of bisulphite-converted DNA and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MADL-TOF MS) to quantify DNA methylation. Primers for overlapping amplicons were designed with Sequenom’s EpiDesigner software to target the CpG island regions, and therefore the promoter regions, as shown in Supplementary Fig. . Primer and assay details are available in Supplementary Table . Samples were assayed in one or two batches, and either in duplicate or as singletons (Supplementary Table ). Sample processing was performed by Agena Bioscience (Brisbane, Queensland, Australia). As each gene assay was run across several plates of samples, the highly methylated DNA control was used to calculate the between-plate coefficient of variation, determined to be 4.9% and 2.3% for and plates, respectively. CpG methylation was quantified as the percentage of methylated cytosines for each CpG unit, where CpG units consist of one or more CpG sites. For units with multiple CpG sites, methylation percentages were normalised by averaging across the number of sites. EpiTYPER data processing was adapted from a previously established method. Twin samples were processed together with the full familial cohorts to leverage the increased sample size. In brief, CpG units that failed to meet assay reliability standards were discarded and samples in duplicate were averaged for the remaining CpG units. Given the relatively small number of CpG units remaining after removal of those determined to be unreliable and the relatively high failure rate of samples and units, a two-step sample/unit filtering process was used. First, failed samples, with ≥90% of CpG unit readings missing, were removed, followed by CpG units which were missing data for ≥90% of samples. Second, samples with a low detection success (missing data for ≥15% of units) were removed, and the same threshold applied to remove CpG units with low detection success (units missing data for ≥15% of samples). Finally, any remaining missing values were imputed with the mean for that unit. Following data processing and filtering, 28 of 56 and 23 of 39 CpG units (for and , respectively) remained for analysis. Infinium Human Methylation 450K v1.2 BeadChip array Genome-wide methylation was investigated using the Infinium HumanMethylation 450K v1.2 BeadChip (Illumina, San Diego, USA). This microarray provides qualitative methylation values for approximately 480,000 CpG sites distributed throughout the genome. Bisulphite-converted DNA was hybridised to the Infinium HumanMethylation 450K BeadChip. Fluorescence imaging of the BeadChip using an Illumina HiScan SQ scanner successfully generated raw Intensity Data files (.idat) for all samples. Data processing of the .idat files was adapted from the method presented by. Twin samples were processed together with the full cohort to leverage larger sample sizes. All default settings were used except where otherwise specified. In brief, samples with less than 99% of CpGs detected were removed. shinyMethyl (v. 1.12.0) was used to visually identify possible outliers, with confirmation of sex queries using RnBeads (v. 1.0.0.). Samples with any possibility of incorrect identification were removed. Data were normalised with the dasen function from wateRmelon (v. 1.20.3). Probes that had failed to be detected (threshold p > 0.05) with the minfi (v. 1.22.1) function detectionP were removed (n = 10270 probes). Normalised data were submitted to Horvath’s online DNAm age calculator. Samples that did not strongly correlate (r < 0.85) with the DNAm age results gold standard were removed. Leveraging technical replicate/duplicate samples (n = 30), both 1) in the form of multiple blood collections at the same time and resulting independent DNA extractions (technical replicates) and 2) multiple aliquots of single DNA extractions (duplicates), a custom filtering step was included to identify and remove highly variable probes. Any probe identified to have multiple pairs of technical replicate or duplicate samples with differences greater than three standard deviations from the probe’s mean difference was discarded (n = 38697). Of the remaining probes, any known to cross hybridise, be located on sex chromosomes, or bind to SNPs, were removed (n = 50362). Following raw data processing, quantitative CpG methylation values for 1215 samples (including 34 twin samples from Table  and 1179 case/control extended cohort samples outlined in Supplementary Table ) and 386183 probes remained for analysis and examination. Comparison of the case-control extended cohort (Supplementary Table ) showed that sex ( = 33.8, p < 0.01) and age (t = 4.20, p < 0.01) were significantly different between ALS cases and controls. All statistical analyses were carried out in R v. 3.4.4. Gene-specific targeted methylation analysis of and in the FALS twin/triplet sets Methylation of or , as quantified by both EpiTYPER and 450K assays, was visualised in the relevant monozygotic disease discordant twin/triplets. Four and five 450K CpGs were available in the post processing data set in the targeted region of (cg05990720, cg11613875, cg14363787, cg23074747) and (cg16086310, cg17253939, cg18126791, cg19948014, cg26893544), respectively. Since only one twin set and one triplet set are available in our cohort for each respective variant, results are descriptive only. Observed differences in DNA methylation age, blood cell composition and global methylation within a twin/triplet set DNA methylation age was determined from 450K methylation data using the method of Horvath. Blood cell proportions in whole blood derived methylation was estimated from 450K methylation data with the minfi implementation of Houseman .’s algorithm. Global methylation levels were determined as the mean methylation estimate across all post-processing 450K CpG sites per sample. CpG sites were also divided into one of four categories based on HIL CpG classes (high-density CpG island (HC), intermediate-density CpG island (IC) and non-island (LC); ICshore, intermediate-density CpG island shore that borders HCs) and the mean methylation for each was calculated. Methylome-wide analysis in MZ sets to identify differentially methylated probes The list of differentially methylated probes (DMP) across all MZ sets was identified using an established ranked magnitude-significance method. In brief, statistical significance per CpG site was determined using a paired t-test on methylation M-values, using the per-patient mean of longitudinal samples and unaffected triplets. The magnitude of the difference in methylation was calculated as the mean difference in -methylation between co-twins. Both methods were used to rank all CpGs, and a final ranked list was determined from the mean of these two ranking methods. Top DMPs were the subset of all CpG probes that met the following two criteria, 1) they were in high CpG density regions of the genome and 2) the ranked list of high-density probes was truncated immediately prior to the first probe to show a difference in the direction of change across the four discordant MZ sets. The ability of these probes to discriminate between ALS and healthy individuals was assessed by hierarchical clustering and principal components analysis of all twin/triplet sets. Within-twin/triplet set DMPs were also identified. A CpG probe was considered to be differentially methylated within a twin/triplet set where there was an absolute difference in -methylation ≥0.25 between the affected twin and their unaffected co-twin/triplet. Examination of identified twin DMPs in a sporadic ALS cohort Twin/triplet DMPs were examined in the larger sporadic case-control cohort. Differences between cases and controls for each of the identified probes were analysed, along with the ability of the DMP list to cluster cases and controls separately. Raw sequencing reads in fastq format were generated for male SALS twins (based on longitudinal sample availability) and the sporadic case-control validation cohort as outlined in Supplementary Table . The quality of raw sequencing reads was evaluated using fastQC (v 0.11.7) for both datasets. Trimming and alignment was performed as outlined in Table  using either Trimmomatic (v. 0.36) or Cutadapt (version 1.8.1) and HISAT2 (v2.0.5). All subsequent data processing and analysis was completed in R (v. 3.4.4), using BioConductor packages edgeR (v. 3.18.1) and limma (v. 3.32.10). A standard edgeR TMM normalisation and filtering pipeline was used in data processing, with only those genes where expression was greater than 0.3 counts per million in a minimum of 3 samples (male SALS twins) or 2 counts per million in a minimum of 75 samples (case-control cohort) retained for analysis, which is equivalent to approximately 12–15 raw counts in the smallest library size for each dataset. For the male SALS twins RNA-Seq data, of the 27685 human genes present in the per-gene read counts generated by HTSeq, 13718 genes remained following raw data processing using edgeR. Whereas in the case-control cohort, of the 23368 human genes present in the per-gene read counts generated by HTSeq, 7354 genes remained following raw data processing using edgeR. MDS (multi-dimensional scaling) indicated the presence of three outliers in the case-control cohort, 1 control and 2 SALS samples. All three were removed and final clinical details for the cohort can be found in Supplementary Table . Comparison of the RNA-Seq case-control validation cohort (Supplementary Table ) showed that there were no significant differences in age (t = 1.74, p = 0.08) between the ALS cases and controls, but a difference was observed in sex between cases and controls ( = 6.5, p = 0.01). To identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using the paired longitudinal RNA-Seq samples from the ALS-discordant male SALS twins (Table ), read count data was analysed using limma, including model terms for longitudinal sample collection and disease status. Voom transformation was applied prior to modelling. Multiple testing correction using the BH-FDR method was applied to the full list of post-processing genes. Genes identified in twin analyses were investigated for an effect of disease in the full case-control cohort with limma, including sex as a covariate. Data were voom transformed, given the highly variable library sizes. Multiple testing corrections using the BH-FDR method was applied only on the subset of genes identified as differentially expressed in twins. Hierarchical clustering and principal components analysis of the expression of these DEGs in the case-control cohort was assessed. To identify genes most likely to be altered in disease, results from independent analysis of genome-wide methylation and expression data sets were integrated. Longitudinal RNA-Seq data is only available for one male SALS twin set, therefore we first identified the overlap between top DEGs and the genes annotated to the most differentially methylated probes within that twin set. We extended this analysis by overlapping the same list of DEGs with the genes annotated to the top differentially methylated probes across all combined twin sets. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis for biological processes was applied to the genes identified as differentially expressed in male SALS twins. The gene list was analysed with PANTHER overrepresentation tests (GO Ontology database release 2018-08-09). Enrichment was tested relative to all genes detected in the appropriate post-processing data set. Fisher’s exact test with FDR correction was used. All analyses were carried out in R (v. 3.4.4). Linear mixed effects models were used to analyse DNAm age, blood cell type proportions and global mean M-methylation. Modelling was carried out using the lmer function in the package lme4 (v. 1.1.14) for DNAm age and mean methylation, while a mixed effects beta regression for cell type proportions was applied with the glmmTMB function from the glmmTMB package (v. 0.2.2.0). Blood cell type proportions were increased by 0.001 to all estimates to avoid taking the log of zero. All mixed models assessed the effect of disease status while controlling for age at sample collection and sex. When analysing DNAm age, the interaction of disease and age at collection was also tested. Random effects were introduced for repeated sampling within co-twins, and a random intercept per twin/triplet set. When modelling cell types, due to convergence issues, the random slope for repeated sampling was dropped, leaving random intercepts for each co-twin and twin set. Likelihood ratio tests were used to determine significance of model terms. Linear models were used for case-control examination of probes identified in the MZ cohort, with the same fixed effect terms of age at sample collection and sex as described for mixed models. Hierarchical clustering utilised the package cluster (v. 2.0.6), with Manhattan distance and ward clustering methods for 450K data, and Spearman correlation distance and average linkage clustering for log-transformed RNA-Seq count data. Where appropriate, technical replicates are shown as means with error bars indicating standard deviation (unless otherwise stated).

Teleneurology and mobile technologies: the future of neurological care , –() Neurological disorders are the leading cause of global disability; however, much of the world lacks access to proper neurological care. Teleneurology, the use of technology to provide remote neurological care and education, has immense potential to increase access to care for people around the world. Telestroke has realized this potential, and teleneurology applications for chronic conditions are beginning to emerge. Mobile technologies, especially smartphones and wearable sensors, can provide objective, frequent assessments of neurological conditions, but applications of these technologies are in their infancy. In low-income settings, teleneurology can increase local capabilities through education, diagnostic assistance and consultation. In high-income settings, neurological care will expand and migrate from hospitals and clinics to homes and mobile devices, incorporate systems of asynchronous communications and integrate clinicians with diverse skill sets. Neurological disorders are the leading cause of global disability. However, for most people around the world, current neurological care is poor. In low-income countries, most individuals lack access to proper neurological care, and in high-income countries, distance and disability limit access. With the global proliferation of smartphones, teleneurology — the use of technology to provide neurological care and education remotely — has the potential to improve and increase access to care for billions of people. Telestroke has already fulfilled this promise, but teleneurology applications for chronic conditions are still in their infancy. Similarly, few studies have explored the capabilities of mobile technologies such as smartphones and wearable sensors, which can guide care by providing objective, frequent, real-world assessments of patients. In low-income settings, teleneurology can increase the capacity of local care systems through professional development, diagnostic support and consultative services. In high-income settings, teleneurology is likely to promote the expansion and migration of neurological care away from institutions, incorporate systems of asynchronous communication (such as e-mail), integrate clinicians with diverse skill sets and reach new populations. Inertia, outdated policies and social barriers — especially the digital divide — will slow this progress at considerable cost. However, a future increasingly will be possible in which neurological care can be accessed by anyone, anywhere. Here, we examine the emerging evidence regarding the benefits of teleneurology for chronic conditions, its role and risks in low-income countries and the promise of mobile technologies to measure disease status and deliver care. We conclude by discussing the future trends, barriers and timing for the adoption of teleneurology. All prices are NET prices. VAT will be added later in the checkout.

Medical Editor: When to Seek Medical Care, Questions to Ask the Doctor, and Diagnosis More Headache Types and Associated Diseases and Conditions Migraine Headache in Children and Self-Care at Home Migraine Headache in Children More Medical Treatment Migraine Headache in Children Follow-up and Prognosis Doctor's Notes on Migraine Headache in Children Symptoms Migraine triggers in children can include cheese, nuts, and sugar. are the most common acute and recurrent pattern experienced by children. These often incapacitating experiences are noteworthy for their sudden onset and accompanying symptoms of , , , and relief by . Doctors focus on ruling out other serious diseases or conditions when they first examine migraineurs (people who have migraines). Treatment consists of finding and avoiding trigger factors in the environment, giving immediate pain relief, and taking preventive drugs. Migraineurs may present with an array of various signs and symptoms. During a episode, patients often endure the sudden onset of a severe located around the eyes, in the forehead region, or in the temples. Some children experience vision changes or other sensory changes (""auras"") during or proceeding a . A sick feeling in the stomach or vomiting is common. Many children avoid bright lights, loud noises, or strong odors since these may amplify the pain of their headache. While various medications may be employed to treat a , the severe head pain is often completely relieved by deep . An inherited tendency is believed to make some people more likely to have a after some minor trigger, although no single theory explains how the produces all the symptoms of a typical migraine headache. Emotional or physical , the onset of an illness, and/or certain foods or liquids may trigger a migraine headache. One rare migraine presentation (familial hemiplegic migraine) has been shown to have specific gene mutations that predispose to the patient's symptoms. Although migraine have long been considered a (relatively harmless) condition, their symptoms may wreak havoc on a person's quality of life and ability to take part in normal life activities. Migraine pain is so intense that migraineurs often cannot think or function very well during or immediately following episodes. The symptoms of migraines interrupt normal activities in a majority of children who suffer from them. In one study of 970,000 self-reported migraineurs aged 6 to 18 years, 329,000 school days were lost per month. The sense of vulnerability of the sudden and unanticipated onset of migraine symptoms may cause emotional changes such as or sadness. Appropriate diagnosis and treatment of migraines can greatly improve quality of life for a person who suffers from migraine . Studies suggest that migraine headaches occur in 5% to 10% of school-aged children in the United States This frequency gradually increases through adolescence and peaks at about 44 years of age. Many people experience spontaneous remission, meaning that the headaches go away on their own for no clear reason. The age of onset of migraine headaches is earlier in boys than in girls. From infancy to 7 years of age, boys are affected equally or slightly more than girls. The prevalence of migraines increases during the adolescent and young adult years. After menarche (the time when the first occurs), a female predominance occurs. This continues to increase until middle age. The frequency of migraines declines in both sexes by 50 years of age. Most migraineurs begin to experience attacks before 20 years of age. Approximately 20% have their first attack before their fifth birthday. Preschool children experiencing a migraine attack usually look ill and have , vomiting, and a strong need to sleep. They may show pain by irritability, crying, rocking, or seeking a dark room in which to sleep. They usually fall asleep within an hour of the time the attack begins. The most common accompanying signs and symptoms include: Older children tend to present with headache on one side of their skull. The headache location and intensity often change during or between attacks. Research has shown that many ""sinus headaches"" are really of migrainous origin. As children grow older, headache intensity and duration increases, and migraines begin to happen at more regular intervals. Older children also describe a pulsating or throbbing characteristic to their headaches. Headaches often shift to the one-sided temple location that most adult migraineurs report. Childhood migraines often stop for a few years after . A headache may be a symptom of a benign (relatively harmless) condition, or it may be a life-threatening symptom. The patient's medical history and physical examination results are often enough to identify or rule out serious underlying problems or conditions. Testing (laboratory or imaging) is employed to support a suspected diagnosis. No specific laboratory or radiological test establishes the diagnosis of migraine headache. Doctors make the diagnosis through medical history, physical examination with emphasis on the neurological components, and clinical judgment. When considering a diagnosis of migraine headache, the doctor will ask about a child's medical history, previous tests, , and current and previous medications. Children will be asked to describe how the headache feels (for example, throbbing, pounding, squeezing, pressing, pulsating, aching, burning, stabbing, dull). They will also be asked about the headache's location, timing, severity, causal events (for example, , falling down), duration, and whether any relatives have migraine headaches. Other common historical evidence to support the diagnosis of migraine headache includes sensitivity to light and sound, tenderness in the (usually where the pain is most severe) and a strong desire to lie down and sleep. Conditions that cause severe headaches in children include both primary and secondary disorders. 16 Surprising Headache Triggers and Tips for Pain Relief The exact cause(s) of migraine headaches is unknown. Some migraines are thought to be due a temporary deficiency of the brain chemical . Many of the drugs effective in treating migraines target this chemical. Some migraineurs know that their headaches are triggered by something they eat, drink, or a particular activity. Chinese food (commonly containing MSG -- sodium glutamate), Migraines most likely have several trigger factors and multiple internal causes. Although many migraine disorders do not develop until middle age, early recognition of migraine risk factors may help a child adopt a healthy lifestyle. Primary headaches are conditions in which the headache is the medical condition and no underlying internal cause is present. Treatment is aimed at the specific headache disorder. Primary types include: The doctor must find out which type of headache a child has, because the best treatments are different for each category. Headaches that come back again and again are usually the result of primary disorders. Secondary headaches are a result of some underlying condition. When that condition is treated, the associated headache usually gets better or goes away. Secondary headaches can be caused by many conditions, from harmless to life-threatening. The following are examples of such conditions: (inflammation of the membranes of the brain or ) (inflammation of the mucous membrane of any sinus) Subarachnoid ( in the brain membranes) A physician evaluating a patient with headache must consider that a patient with a primary headache disorder may also have a secondary headache disorder. Both migraine headaches with aura (see below) and migraines without aura have a premonitory phase (a phase that precedes and forewarns), which may start up to 24 hours before the headache phase. During this prodrome phase many symptoms may develop. These include: food craving or (lack of appetite, distaste for food), These prodrome symptoms are often more evident in migraine without aura than in migraine with aura. Children with frequent migraine headaches or migraine variants often have a vague feeling that something is different in their world. They often learn to recognize these early signs but have trouble explaining or describing them to parents or health care practitioners. An aura is a focused symptom that happens right before a migraine headache or when one begins. An aura may occur without headache, or it may be more severe than the following migraine headache. Some children with migraine headaches experience auras; however, under- reporting may exist due to the inability of young patients to verbally explain their sensations. The aura usually occurs less than 30 minutes before the migraine headache and lasts for 5 to 20 minutes. Motor auras (those affecting a person's coordination) tend to last longer than other forms. Visual disturbances are the most common form of aura. Numbness and tingling of one side of the face and tingling of fingers on the same side are the second most common type of aura. Disorder of speech is a rare aura presentation. Complete recovery of aura symptoms should be expected. Children are often unable to recognize or describe their auras. Picture cards that show typical visual auras may help the doctor get an accurate history. Visual auras are often reported as moving or changing shapes and are the most common form in children. Micropsia (perception of objects as smaller than they are) Macropsia (perception of objects as larger than they are) Alice in Wonderland syndrome [the illusion of dreams, feelings of levitation (floating or rising), and altered sense of the passage of time] Aphasia (impaired or absent understanding or production of or communication by speech, writing, or signs) Ataxia (an inability to coordinate muscle activity during voluntary movement) (a sensation of spinning or twirling, implying a definite feeling of rotation) Paresthesia (an abnormal feeling of burning, pricking, tickling, tingling, etc) Hemiparesis (weakness affecting one side of the body) Aura symptoms can vary widely within and between attacks for the same individual. The actual headache phase of a migraine attack is usually shorter in children than in adults. Children's headaches can last 30 minutes to 48 hours but usually last less than 4 hours. Some children report short headaches lasting 10 to 20 minutes. The headache phase is often associated with the following: After the headache phase, the migraineur (person who has migraines) may feel elated and energized or, more typically, exhausted and lethargic (weary, tired) in the stage known as the postdrome. This stage of migraine may last from hours to days. This type of migraine, also known as , is characterized by a visual or other type of aura followed by a unilateral (one-sided), throbbing headache, which may later spread to both sides. It lasts from half an hour to 48 hours. Migraine with aura occurs in 15% to 40% of children who experience migraine headaches. The typical aura is manifested by various abnormalities of the visual, auditory, and/or sensory systems. These symptoms are progressive in intensity, usually last for about 1 hour, and resolve completely. Common migraines lack an aura. Migraine without aura in children is traditionally described as a recurring (happening over and over), bilateral (two-sided) headache disorder with a throbbing and/or pulsating pain quality, moderate-to-severe intensity, and severe stomach symptoms. Common accompanying symptoms in children are irritability and paleness with dark circles under the eyes. In younger children, the pain is more often on both sides and around the eyes and temples. Migraine without aura occurs in a majority of migrainous children. Persons with chronic migraine have headache attacks at least 15 days of every month for at least 2 months. Chronic migraine may affect up to 4% of teenage girls and 2% of teenage boys. This is a severe form of migraine headache in which the attack is continuous over 72 hours. People who have such an attack usually have a history of migraine. In those who vomit, rehydration (restoring adequate fluid levels) is often the necessary first step in treatment. These are classified as migraines because they often have the same triggers. They are brief, recurrent, episodic disorders that are made worse by physical activity and relieved by deep sleep or typical anti-migraine medications. Complicated and variant migraines cause some of the same symptoms as typical migraines, including pain, stomach problems, autonomic symptoms (for example, abnormal sweating, changes in pupil size), neurologic symptoms (for example, tingling, numbness, weakness), and changes in mood or emotion. These benign (relatively harmless) disorders are frightening because they often seem to be life-threatening emergency situations. Migraine equivalents are under-recognized and under-reported expressions of childhood migraine. They are often forerunners of the typical migraine, and complicated and variant migraines occasionally alternate with typical migraines. Listed below are examples of some of these variant migraine patterns. FHM is an uncommon form of migraine with aura. Persons with FHM have long-lasting hemiplegia (paralysis of one side of the body) along with numbness, aphasia, and confusion. The hemiplegia may come before (as part of the aura), accompany, or follow the headache, and symptoms may last for hours or as long as a week. FHM is very rare and may run in families (usually another first- or second-degree relative is affected in these cases). The headache is usually opposite from the paralyzed side. Some cases of FHM are associated with cerebellar ataxia [a loss of muscle coordination caused by disorders of the cerebellum (a part of the brain)]. People with other types of severe FHM may experience , fever, and meningismus [pain caused by irritation of the membrane layers (meninges) surrounding the brain and spinal cord]. Another type of FHM involves progressive ataxia, nystagmus (uncontrollable, rapid horizontal or vertical movement of the eyeballs), , and dysarthria (a speech disturbance due to emotional , to , or to paralysis, incoordination, or spasticity of the muscles used for speaking). A chromosomal marker has been demonstrated to be shared with patients who experience FHM. The significance of this observation is not fully understood. Basilar migraine (basilar artery migraine or Bickerstaff syndrome): Basilar migraine is a subtype of migraine with aura that is mostly observed in adolescent and young adult females. The headache pain is located in the back of the head. The headache must have at least two of the aural symptoms and signs listed below: Bilateral paresthesias (abnormal feeling of burning, pricking, tickling, tingling, etc., on both sides of the body) [noises (ringing, whistling, hissing, roaring, etc.) in the ear] Unilateral (one-sided) or bilateral (two-sided) vision loss A history of typical migraine exists in a majority of families studied. Many people experience basilar migraine attacks intermingled with typical migraine attacks. Some children with migraine will suffer from basilar migraine. The most common age of onset is 7 years of age. This form of migraine is associated with paralysis of the extraocular muscles (muscles which control eyeball movement) and is rare. People with this type of migraine experience severe one-sided headaches. Ophthalmoplegia (paralysis of one or more of the eye muscles) may precede, accompany, or follow the headache. This is an extremely rare migraine type during which there is a unilateral (one-sided) sudden loss of vision preceded by a sensation of bright lights. A migraine headache generally follows within 1 hour of the visual impairment and is commonly on the same side as the affected eye. Full vision recovery is expected, and it is rare to have any permanent loss or impairment of vision. This condition is probably not a true migrainous disorder. It is the most frequent cause of vertigo in childhood and is characterized by brief episodes of vertigo, disequilibrium (poor balance), and nausea. Episodes tend to be brief, have a sudden onset, and may occur in clusters for several hours and then spontaneously stop. Children with this problem are usually aged 2 to 6 years. Nystagmus may occur during but not between attacks. loss, , or loss of consciousness does not occur. Symptoms usually last only a few minutes. Parents observe that an attack is characterized by a sudden onset of fear, refusal to walk, or need to hold onto supporting structures for stability. They may have a sudden loss of alertness (""space out""). No headache occurs in benign paroxysmal vertigo. Children with benign paroxysmal vertigo often develop a more common form of true migraine as they mature. This type of migraine is characterized by short-lived episodes of amnesia (memory loss), confusion, agitation, lethargy, and dysphasia (speech difficulties) brought about by minor head . The child may have aphasia, and the confusional state may either precede or follow the headache. Some children also experience recurrent episodes of temporary amnesia and confusion. Recovery almost always occurs within 6 hours. One report points out that brain CT studies of those whose migraine is associated with head trauma are normal. The child may not have a history of headache but usually develops typical migraine attacks at some point in the future. Migraine-associated cyclic vomiting syndrome (periodic syndrome): This syndrome is characterized by recurrent periods of intense vomiting separated by symptom-free intervals. Many people with cyclic vomiting have regular or cyclic patterns of illness. Symptoms usually come on quickly at night or in the early morning and last 6 to 48 hours. Associated symptoms include abdominal pain, nausea, retching, anorexia, paleness, lethargy, photophobia, phonophobia, and headache. Headache often does not appear until the child is older. Migraine-associated cyclic vomiting syndrome usually begins when the person is a toddler and disappears in adolescence or early adulthood. (It rarely begins in adulthood.) This syndrome affects more females than males. Infections, psychological or physical stress, and dietary triggers are often clearly associated. Examples of triggers include cheese, chocolate, monosodium glutamate (MSG), emotional stress, excitement, or infections. Usually, a family history of migraines in the parents or siblings is present. Children with this condition often need intravenous fluids. The child may have recurrent bouts of generalized with nausea and vomiting. No headache is present. After several hours, the child can sleep and later awakens feeling better. Abdominal migraine may alternate with typical migraine and usually leads to typical migraine as the child matures. Probably not a true migrainous condition, paroxysmal torticollis is manifested as a sustained contraction or shortening of the neck muscles. This rare disorder is characterized by repeated episodes of head tilting and is associated with nausea, vomiting, and headache. Attacks usually occur in infants and may last from hours to days. A migraine is a result of neurological (nerve) dysfunction. More Headache Types and Associated Diseases and Conditions Acephalic migraine of childhood (migraine sine hemicrania): This condition is characterized by a (usually visual) without headache. Females are more likely than males to have this type of migraine. The syndrome is characterized by headache that is preceded by visual hallucinations or delusions, distortions of body image and abnormalities in the experience of time. Such experiences may wax and wane over several days to months, and children generally recover without residual problems. It is most commonly seen in the young school-aged child. Menstrual migraine occurs in close approximation to the onset of and will commonly last for 2 to 3 days. The cause of such migraine headaches has been postulated to be associated with the reduction of estrogen and levels that are associated with menses. No aura is appreciated with menstrual migraines. Women who suffer from menstrual migraines may also experience more traditional migraines (either with or without aura) at other times of their . Psychiatric diseases Many migraineurs report anxiety (excessive worrying) or sadness. Whether the headache or the mood or anxiety symptoms appear first is unclear. and migraine headaches often occur in the same person and may be related. About 70% of individuals with partial complex have migraines, but most people with migraines do not have . Migraineurs are more prone to than people without migraine. Intermittent vertigo is found in many of people with classic migraine and in some of those with common migraine. A higher degree of cardiovascular reactivity to postural changes (blood circulation responses to standing or sitting) has been shown in those with cyclic vomiting and migraine. Diarrhea is common in migraineurs and is sometimes severe enough to cause excessive fluid loss and . Migraines are associated with sleep disturbances, and (somnambulism) is found in some of migraineurs. An aversion (dislike) of striped patterns is found in many tested migraineurs. One study found that eating ice cream caused headache in 93% of migraineurs and was typically located at the usual site of migraine pain. When to Seek Medical Care, Questions to Ask the Doctor, and Diagnosis Parents should take children with severe headaches to see a doctor. The doctor will ensure that no life-threatening underlying condition is responsible. He or she will also provide a diagnosis, reassurance that no serious underlying illness is present, and a plan for effective pain treatment. Writing down specific questions before a medical appointment is a good idea. Parents should feel free to take notes and/or make an audio recording of the visit. The purpose of the first appointment is to find out what kind of headache the child has. If a diagnosis of migraine headache is confirmed, the doctor should spend time explaining exactly what that means for the child and for the parents or caregivers. Education is often the most important part of the visit. A review of potential trigger factors, how to treat the headache pain at the time of the attacks, and whether a preventive drug is needed are important issues that should be addressed. Doctors evaluate children who have headaches by performing a thorough general physical examination and a detailed neurologic examination (an examination of the brain and nerve functioning). All findings should be distinctly normal. Doctors perform or order appropriate additional evaluations and tests if the child has abnormal vital signs, nuchal rigidity (stiff neck), cranial nerve (nerves in the head) abnormalities, macrocephaly (an abnormally large head), bruits (abnormal body sounds), papilledema (swelling of the structures and tissues of the ), cutaneous lesions (skin changes), cognitive (thinking) changes, or asymmetric signs (for example, weakness on one side of the body). The doctor will order laboratory studies (lab tests) to rule out other causes for those people with headache that might have a non-migrainous reason for their headaches. Typically, imaging studies are unnecessary in children with a long-term (more than 6 months) history of headaches, normal neurologic examination results, and no seizures. An abnormal imaging result is very rare in a person meeting these criteria. The doctor will consider imaging studies in everyone with a history of seizures, recent , significant change in the character of the headache, focused brain/spinal cord/nerve deficits, or papilledema (swelling of the structures and tissues of the retina). A () will probably be performed if the doctor suspects (inflammation of the membranes of the brain and/or spinal cord), encephalitis (inflammation of the brain), subarachnoid hemorrhage (bleeding in the brain membranes), or certain other conditions. Migraine Headache in Children and Self-Care at Home There are a variety of treatments for migraine headaches in children including self-care measures and medications. Sleep is the best treatment for a migraine. Sleep restores normal brain function, relieves pain, and resolves many associated migraine symptoms. Doctor-prescribed or recommended pain-relieving drugs should be given to the child migraineur. Medical treatment of migraine headaches in children is based on the following: (1) education of children and parents or caregivers about , (2) creation of a plan of immediate treatment for the attacks, and (3) consideration of preventive medicines or measures for children with frequent migraines. The doctor should explain the disease to the child and the parents or caregivers. The treatment of children with mild, infrequent migraine attacks consists mainly of rest, trigger avoidance, and stress reduction. The doctor should also assure parents that the headache is not caused by a or other life-threatening condition. A regular bedtime, strict meal schedules, and not overloading the child with too many activities are important. Helping the child recognize migraine triggers is helpful but often difficult. Ridding migraine triggers reduces the frequency of headaches in some children but does not completely stop occurrences. A headache diary can be used to record triggers and features of attacks. Triggering factors that occur up to 12 hours prior to an attack should be noted. Other important factors to include are as follows: Bedtime, wake time, and quality of sleep prior to the attack Unfortunately, even the most diligent person cannot always identify specific migraine triggers. At the time of attack, parents or caregivers should have the child lie down in a cool, dark, quiet room to help him or her fall asleep. In spite of the development of many effective anti-migraine medications, sleep is the most powerful and best treatment. During a migrainous attack, a child can often be found resting in the fetal position with the affected side of the head down. Some children find that ice or pressure on the affected artery can reduce pain for a short time. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are effective if taken at a high but appropriate dose during the aura or early headache phase. Common over-the-counter (OTC) NSAIDs include (, Children's Advil/, etc.) and (, , , Naprelan). ( and others) may also be used for pain control. should not be used in children or adolescents. Digestion temporarily slows or stops during migraine attacks, delaying absorption of oral medications. Occasionally, carbonated may improve absorption. Other treatment methods, such as self-relaxation, biofeedback, and self-hypnosis, may be reasonable alternatives to drug therapies in childhood migraine, particularly in adolescents. Response rates in children tend to be higher than in adults and show continued effectiveness over time. The primary goals of preventive therapy are to prevent migraine attacks and to reduce the frequency and severity of attacks. Most preventive migraine medications have potential side effects, so only children with at least one to two attacks per week should take them. Parents and caregivers should have realistic expectations. While medications lessen the impact of migraines, they do not resolve the underlying causes and they will not completely eliminate all migraines. Half of all patients experience a 50% reduction in migraines (at most). Migraine Headache in Children More Medical Treatment An estimated 20% to 50% of migraineurs (people who have migraines) are sensitive to foods. These dietary triggers are thought to cause a change that provokes a migraine attack. Helping children learn to recognize and avoid these triggers is helpful but often difficult. The following are some common dietary triggers: Individuals with low levels of a substance called phenol sulfotransferase P are believed to be sensitive to dietary monoamines (a type of molecule) such as tyramine and phenylethylamine. Cultured dairy products (for example, aged cheese, sour cream, buttermilk), chocolate, and citrus fruits are believed to cause vasodilation (widening of the blood vessels) in certain people. Some migraines may be triggered by artificial sweeteners. Alcoholic beverages (especially red wine) and excess of or withdrawal from caffeinated such as coffee, tea, cocoa, or colas may trigger a migraine headache. Migraineurs should limit caffeinated sources to no more than two cups per day to prevent -withdrawal headaches. Caffeine can be found in chocolate-containing foods and candies; therefore, children with migraines should avoid them. These vasodilating agents are found in preserved meats. Examples of foods containing these chemicals include lunch meats, processed meats, smoked fish, sausage, pork and beans with bacon, sausage, salami, pastrami, liverwurst, hotdogs, ham, corned beef, corn , beef jerky, bratwurst, and bacon. MSG is a flavor enhancer and vasodilator found in many processed foods. Food labels should be checked carefully. MSG sources include Accent seasoning, bacon bits, baking mixtures, basted turkey, bouillon cubes, chips (potato, corn), croutons, dry-roasted peanuts, breaded foods, frozen dinners, gelatins, certain Asian foods and soy sauce, pot pies, relishes, salad dressing, soups, and yeast extract. Citrus fruits, avocados, bananas, raisins, and plums: These foods may be triggers. Although few individuals are sensitive to fruit, children with migraines should still eat a well-rounded, natural that includes fruits and vegetables and avoid processed foods. A headache diary may be helpful (a pattern often emerges after 6 to 8 weeks). Care must be taken to avoid creating an unnaturally limited diet that harms a child's growth and development. Both OTC and can trigger or worsen migraine headaches. (), estrogen (), histamine, (), (), (), (), and reserpine (Serpasil) are examples of medications that can increase migraine frequency. Excessive use of OTC and analgesics can cause occasional migraine attacks to convert to analgesic-abuse headaches or drug-induced headaches that do not respond to treatment. Children with migraines should avoid frequent or long-term use of NSAIDs, acetaminophen, triptans, or ergotamines. Migraineurs who have been treated for a long time with amphetamines (Biphetamine), phenothiazine (a type of antihistamine), or () should avoid sudden withdrawal from these medications because migraine headaches may result. In children who have an inborn tendency for migraine headaches, attacks can occur as a result of psychological (emotional), physiological (internal body processes), or environmental triggers. Physical exertion and travel or motion can be triggers. These include stress, anxiety, worry, , and sadness. Migraine headaches are not an imagined or psychological illness. Stress makes an underlying tendency for migraine more difficult to manage. The frequency of migraines can be reduced but not eliminated by maintaining a healthy lifestyle. These include fever or illness and not getting adequate food, rest, or sleep. Children with migraines should stick to a routine with regular meal times and adequate sleep. These include fluorescent light, bright light, flickering light, , barometric pressure changes, high altitude, strong odors, computer screens, or rapid temperature changes. Some migraineurs report that complex visual patterns like stripes, checks, or zigzag lines trigger their migraines. Activity can trigger childhood migraine. Some migraineurs report that they are more likely to get a headache after participating in sports or being extremely active. Minor head trauma (for example, being hit in the head with a ball, falling on one's head) may also result in a migraine attack. This may cause migraine, particularly in young children. If headaches cannot be reasonably controlled within 6 months, the child should see a pediatric neurologist (a physician specializing in the treatment of brain/nerve disorders). Children who suddenly develop new neurologic problems such as weakness, thinking difficulties, or seizures, should also see a pediatric neurologist. The drug treatments of migraine headache and associated symptoms can be divided into Analgesic and abortive therapies are for the treatment of occasional severe headache attacks and related symptoms. Analgesic and abortive medications should not be used frequently (that is, more than two times per week) because they may cause rebound headaches when children stop taking them. In general, the earlier in an attack the pain is treated, the less severe the pain becomes. The longer the wait before starting therapy, the more difficult the pain is to control. Established migraines are notoriously difficult to treat successfully. Digestion temporarily slows or stops during migraine attacks, delaying absorption of oral medications. In addition to drug therapy approaches, other approaches to reducing the severity of many childhood migraines include avoiding sensory stimulation (for example, bright lights, intense odors), applying ice packs, and resting in a quiet, dark room. Preventive medications are taken on a daily basis over a long period of time to reduce the frequency or severity of headaches and associated symptoms. None of the preventive medications are 100% effective in preventing all attacks. A good response to preventive medications is a 50% reduction in the frequency or severity of attacks. Children should not be given these drugs unless they have frequent (more than two per week), prolonged, and disabling migraine attacks that do not respond to other treatments. Often, several weeks are necessary before improvement is observed. Some child migraineurs must be kept on long-term preventive therapy, while others tolerate drug ""holidays,"" particularly during summer, when migraines are less frequent for many children. Occasionally, these drugs lose their effectiveness after initially helping the child. Using the same drug later is often not very effective. Different drugs work better for different people; therefore, several may have to be tried before finding the best drug for a particular child. Preventive drugs should be withdrawn slowly to avoid relapse and withdrawal symptoms. The following drugs are used to treat quickly stop migraine headaches in mid attack. They have little preventive value. The first group is the ""triptans,"" which specifically target serotonin. They are all chemically very similar, and their action is similar. The following drugs are also specific and affect serotonin levels, but they affect other brain chemicals as well. Occasionally, one of these drugs works when a triptan does not. ( Injection, Nasal Spray) acetaminophen-isometheptene-dichloralphenazone (Midrin) The following daily drugs have preventive value and are helpful to those who have more than two migraine headaches per week: Medications used to treat : Beta-blockers [propranolol (Inderal), calcium channel blockers [ (Covera)] : (Elavil), () Antiseizure medications: (), (), () Children with status migrainosus (a severe form of migraine headache in which the attack is continuous over 72 hours) can be treated in an emergency department or a doctor's office with intravenous or intramuscular medications. Migraine Headache in Children Follow-up and Prognosis Doctors sometimes cannot be absolutely certain that a child has migraines, or they may suspect that he or she has a headache condition caused by an underlying neurologic disease. Such children should have appropriate follow-up care, so that they can be observed over time. In children with an inborn tendency for migraine, minor head trauma may worsen the headaches, typically for a period of days to months. If this occurs, parents should make a follow-up appointment. A follow-up appointment is also needed if the headaches worsen, if they do not respond to medications, or if drug side effects are intolerable. Several medication trials are often necessary before adequate headache control is achieved. In one of the few long-term studies of migraine patients, a Scandinavian researcher named Bille observed 73 Swedish children with migraine. He followed these children for 40 years. On average, they started to have migraines at age 6 years. During puberty or young adulthood, 62% of the children were migraine-free for at least 2 years. About 33% started to have regular attacks again after an average of 6 migraine-free years, and a surprising 60% of the original 73 children still had migraines after 30 years. In 30 years, 22% of the children never had a migraine-free year.

75456798-73a6-4bd3-8127-085ec11ff158,"Published: April 03, 2010. Updated: November 06, 2017 Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in Western countries. Alzheimer’s disease occurs almost exclusively above the age of 60 and increases with age, affecting approximately 5% of all persons over the age of 70. The course of AD is progressive. In the early stages of the disease, the memory loss may go unrecognized or may be ascribed to benign forgetfulness. Slowly the cognitive problems begin to interfere with daily activities, such as keeping track of finances, following instructions on the job, driving, shopping, and housekeeping. Some patients are unaware of these difficulties (agnosognosia), and others have considerable insight, resulting in frustration and anxiety. These major differences in insight have no clear explanation. The most important risk factors for AD are old age and a positive family history. The frequency of AD increases with each decade of adult life to reach 20 to 40% of the population over the age of 85. A positive family history of dementia suggests a genetic cause of AD. AD is characterized in the brain by abnormal clumps () and tangled bundles of fibers () composed of misplaced proteins. Three genes have been discovered that cause early onset (familial) AD. Other genetic mutations that cause excessive accumulation of amyloid protein are associated with age-related (sporadic). Although the pathophysiology of AD is not well understood, histopathologic examination of affected brain tissue clearly indicates a selective loss of cholinergic neurons. This is the rationale behind the use of anticholineesterases in the treatment of AD. A progressive dementia that presents without sensorimotor affection in patients >70 years old. President Ronald Reagan is a famous example. Neat appearance, social amenities preserved until late Disoriented due to loss of spatial or event memory loss Little insight (although some patients have insight) A Mini-mental status examination (MMSE) score < 24 (out of a total score of 30) is suggestive of dementia. If the mini-mental status examination scores normal in patients presenting with intellectual deficits a formal neuropsychological evaluation conducted by a neuropsychologist should be performed. MRI of the brain is mainly done to exclude other causes (tumor, subdural hematoma, normal pressure hydrocephalus). Early in the disease course the MRI is normal, while later the imaging findings are not specific with generalized cortical and subcortical atrophy slightly greater than the general population. The atrophy may be more prominent in the parietal and temporal lobes of the brain. The most characteristic focal finding in AD is reduced hippocampal volume or medial temporal lobe atrophy. Parietal hypometabolism shown on PET or parietal hypoperfusion shown on SPECT or PET support the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease The management of Alzheimer’s disease is difficult and frustrating, because there is no specific treatment and no way to slow the progression of the disease. The primary focus is on long-term amelioration of associated behavioral and neurologic problems. For some people (approximately 10 to 20%) in the early or middle stages of AD, medication with anticholineesterases such as tacrine (Cognex) may alleviate some cognitive symptoms. Other anticholineesterases include donepezil (Aricept), rivastigmine (Exelon), and galantamine (Reminyl) may keep some symptoms from becoming worse for a limited time. A fifth drug, memantine (Namenda), was recently approved for use in the United States. Memantine blocks a is a glutamate receptor known as N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (also known as the NMDA receptor or NMDAR). Combining memantine with other anticholineesterase AD drugs may be more effective than any single therapy. One controlled clinical trial found that patients receiving donepezil plus memantine had better cognition and other functions than patients receiving donepezil alone. Also, other medications may help control behavioral symptoms such as sleeplessness, agitation, wandering, anxiety, and depression. Haloperidol is useful in relieving agitation later in the course of the disease. AD is a progressive disease, but its course can vary from 5 to 20 years. The most common cause of death in AD patients is infection. Reader comments on this article are listed below. . Remember my personal information Notify me of follow-up comments?

These conditions can be hereditary. Treatment can depend on the type of periodic fever syndrome, but often includes life-long use of medication. Periodic fever syndromes refer to diseases that cause periodic (episodic) fever that do not have an infectious (virus, bacteria) cause. In general, children with these syndromes are well between episodes. Many of these syndromes are hereditary (passed down from parents) and result from a mutation (defect or mistake) in a gene (this is the code that determines the structure of our proteins). The syndromes are defined by several factors, including: The parts of the body affected in addition to the fever The ethnicity (the area of the world where the child or parents come from) of the child and parents Many of these syndromes have a specific treatment, often based on understanding the problem caused by the genetic defect. Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is the most common periodic fever syndrome. Patients suffer from recurrent episodes of fever, accompanied by abdominal, chest and joint pain, and swelling. The disease generally affects people of Mediterranean and Middle Eastern descent, typically Sephardic Jews, Turks, Arabs and Armenians. Since the discovery of the gene defect, it is being diagnosed more frequently, even among populations where it was thought to be very rare, such as Italians, Greeks and Ashkenazi Jews. FMF episodes start before the age of 20 years in approximately 90 percent of the patients. In more than half of them the disease appears before the age of 10 years. FMF is a genetic disease. The responsible gene is called the MEFV gene, named after the Mediterranean Sea, and it affects a protein called , which plays a role in the natural control of inflammation. When this gene has a defect, the regulation of inflammation cannot be done properly and patients experience episodes of fever and other symptoms. Infection, trauma, menses (periods) or psychological stress may trigger episodes. FMF is inherited as an autosomal recessive disease (which means that while the child may have the disease, neither parent needs to show symptoms of the disease). In this case, the child receives two mutated genes, one from the mother and the other from the father. The parents are then called carriers. Often somebody in the extended family has the disease. If one child has the disease and the parents are carriers, there is a 25 percent chance another child will get FMF. If one of the children has FMF and also one of the parents has FMF, there is a 50 percent chance of another child getting FMF. Not all children will have all symptoms and symptoms may change over time. Episodes resolve without treatment and usually last between one and four days. Most children are totally normal between episodes, but some children have such frequent episodes they do not fully recover or do not grow properly. Some of the attacks may be so painful that the patient or family seeks medical help in the emergency department. For example, severe abdominal attacks may mimic acute and therefore some patients may undergo abdominal surgery, such as an appendectomy. The chest pain may be so severe that it may be difficult to breathe deeply. Usually, only one joint is affected at a time, most commonly an ankle or a knee. The joint may be so swollen and painful that the child cannot walk. In about a third of these patients there is a red rash over the involved joint. In some children, the sole finding of the disease may be episodes of joint pain and swelling, which is misdiagnosed as acute , or . Usually, the joint swelling resolves over five to 14 days. In about 5 to 10 percent of cases the joint involvement may become chronic. Some children report muscle pain in the legs. Rarely, children have recurrent pericarditis (inflammation of the outer layer of the heart), myositis (muscle inflammation), meningitis (inflammation of the membrane surrounding the brain and spinal cord) and orchitis (testicular inflammation). Frequent attacks can affect the child's and family’s life, including school attendance. The most severe complication of FMF if untreated is the development of . Amyloid is a protein that deposits in certain organs in children with chronic inflammatory diseases that are not well controlled. The most common organ involved is the kidney, but amyloid can deposit in the gut, skin and heart. Eventually, amyloid causes a loss of function, especially of the kidneys. Children who are properly treated (see below under medications) are safe from the risk of developing this life-threatening complication. Yes, but often the disease is milder and less obvious (thus harder to diagnose) than in children. The risk of amyloidosis is lower in adult onset disease. Despite the knowledge that FMF is a genetic disease, a genetic mutation is not found in all children with FMF. Therefore the diagnosis of FMF is still based on clinical signs. FMF is suspected in children with episodic fever with an ethnic origin typical for FMF and/or with a family history of FMF or unexplained kidney failure. Often children initially have episodes of fever without the other symptoms so it takes careful observation until a diagnosis is made. Families should write a diary documenting the episodes and describing what happens. Because not all children have typical episodes, it may take a long time to suspect FMF and to make the diagnosis. Examining the child during an episode and obtaining laboratory tests showing signs of inflammation are helpful (like tests for a or a ). Generally, these tests become positive during an episode and return to normal, or near normal, after the episode ends. A sample of is also tested for the presence of protein. Patients with amyloidosis will have high levels of protein in urine tests. This warns the physician to do more tests to see if the protein in the urine is from amyloidosis. In children suspected of having FMF, a genetic test to look for the gene mutation will be obtained. If these tests are positive (homozygote which means that the gene defect is found in both gene copies, one from each parent), the diagnosis of FMF is definite. However, it is possible to have FMF with a defect in only one gene copy (called heterozygoteor even without any gene defect, since the genetic test looks at only part of the entire FMF gene. In the United States more than 30 percent of the patients with FMF do not have mutations in both gene copies. In that case the response to the specific FMF treatment, , will determine the diagnosis. It is highly probable that children have FMF if they do not have episodes or have a lot fewer episodes when they are being treated with colchicine. Usually a trial of six months of treatment is given to the patient. FMF cannot be cured, but it can be well controlled with life-long use of colchicine. In this way, episodes can usually be prevented (in 60 percent of patients completely prevented, in 33 percent partially prevented, and in about 5 percent colchicine is not effective) and amyloidosis can be prevented in 100 percent of patients. If the patient stops taking the drug, episodes (often after missing only one dose) and the risk of amyloidosis may return. Compliance (taking the medicine as recommended) is very important. If colchicine is taken regularly the child can live a normal life with a normal life expectancy. The patient or the parents should not change the medication dose without discussing this first with the doctor. Some children initially need psychological support for a disease that means taking medications for their entire life. Colchicine prevents episodes from starting but does not treat an episode that has already started. Therefore, the dose of colchicine should not be increased during an already active episode. Colchicine is a safe drug with minor side effects that usually respond to dose reduction or other methods of treatment. The most frequent side effect is . Some children cannot tolerate the given dose because of frequent watery stools. In these cases, the dose should be reduced until it is tolerated and then slowly increased back to the appropriate dose. Other methods include reducing the intake of milk or dairy products and sometimes it is necessary to give a medicine to treat diarrhea (like Imodium®). Other side effects are nausea, vomiting and abdominal cramps. In rare cases, it may cause muscle weakness. The blood count (white and red blood cells and platelets) may decrease occasionally, but recovers with dose reduction. Children taking colchicine grow normally. A decrease in the sperm count later in life is very rare. Female patients do not have to stop taking colchicine during pregnancy or breastfeeding, but (obtaining a sample from the fluid surrounding the fetus) is recommended. Children treated with colchicine should have blood count and urine tests at least twice a year. If treated properly with life-long colchicine, children with FMF live a normal life. If there is a delay in diagnosis, or lack of compliance with treatment, the risk of developing amyloidosis increases. Children who develop amyloidosis may eventually need or a kidney transplant. There are no restrictions on the child’s everyday life. Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Associated Periodic Syndrome (TRAPS) What is tumor necrosis factor receptor associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS)? Tumor necrosis factor receptor associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS) is a genetic disease with an autosomal dominant (one gene defect is enough to result in having the disease) inheritance. That means that either one of the parents is ill with a variant of the disease or that the gene defect was newly formed in the child with the disease (de novo mutation). Apart from episodes of fever, other symptoms can include: Migratory (moves from one place to another) painful red skin rashes The gene defect was only recently discovered. The former name of this syndrome was familial Hibernian fever. TRAPS is a rare disease, but since the gene defect was discovered more patients with different clinical features have been identified. Thus, the actual frequency is still unknown. It affects males and females equally and the onset seems to be during late childhood, or adulthood. The first cases were reported in patients from Irish-Scottish ancestry; however the disease has also been identified in almost all ethnic groups. TRAPS is not a contagious condition. It is a genetic disease. TRAPS is caused by a gene defect in a protein called tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR), which leads to an increase of the patient’s normal inflammatory response. The protein that causes inflammation, called tumor necrosis factor (TNF), overacts, since the receptor (TNFR) that usually binds to TNF is not present to control its activity. Infection, trauma or psychological stress may trigger episodes. However, not every person that has a gene defect will have the clinical signs of TRAPS. The main symptoms are recurrent episodes of fever typically lasting two or three weeks, associated with chills and intense muscle pain involving the trunk and the upper limbs. The typical rash is red and painful, representing underlying inflammation of the skin and muscle. The rash moves from one place to another on the body, usually from the arms and legs to the trunk. Most patients feel cramping muscle pain at the onset of attacks that gradually increases in strength and also moves from one part of the body to another. Abdominal pain with nausea and vomiting are common. Inflammation of the membrane covering the front of the eye (conjunctiva), and/or swelling around the eye is common. Other less common features include chest pain, due to inflammation of the pleura (the membrane surrounding the lungs), or the pericardium (the membrane surrounding the heart). Like FMF (see above) amyloidosis is the most severe late complication of TRAPS and often results in large amounts of proteins in the urine and kidney failure. The disease symptoms vary from person to person, as well as the length of episodes and the time between episodes. The reasons for these differences are based in part on differences in the specific gene defect. Blood tests will show signs of inflammation during an episode. The diagnosis is confirmed only by genetic tests showing a genetic defect in the TNFR gene. The physician will probably test for other types of periodic fever syndromes. There is still no proven definitive treatment to prevent or cure the disease. Non-specific anti-inflammatory agents, including steroid use, help to relieve symptoms, but long-term steroid use leads to serious side effects. Giving a medicine that is similar to the TNF receptor called (a medicine used to treat juvenile idiopathic arthritis) has been shown to be an effective treatment in some patients when given at the beginning of an attack or even as preventive medicine. Patients with TRAPS will have episodes of symptoms throughout their life. What is the long-term outcome and course of TRAPS? It is hard to predict the outcome in any one patient since amyloidosis appears in only a minority of patients. This risk is dependent in part on the genetic defect and on other unclear environmental factors. Hyperimmunoglobulin D syndrome (HIDS), also called Mevalonate Kinase Associated Periodic Fever Syndrome HIDS, also called Mevalonate Kinase Associated Periodic Fever Syndrome, is a autosomal recessive (which means that while the child is sick neither parent needs to show symptoms of the disease) genetic syndrome that results in episodic high fever with skin rash, (glands that are part of the immune system) in the neck, abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhea. The disease starts early in infancy. The name of this disease comes from the fact that most patients have very high amounts of immunoglobulin (proteins that are part of the immune system) of type D The most severe form of this disease starts at birth and is called mevalonic aciduria. These patients also have neurologic (nervous system) disease and suffer from poor growth. The form of this condition that is described below is the mild form because that is the only type that starts with episodes of fever. HIDS is a very rare disease. The disease is mostly found in Western Europe, especially in the Netherlands and in France, but has been described in all ethnic groups. Boys and girls are equally affected. Symptoms usually start in early childhood, most commonly in the first year of life. HIDS is a genetic disease. The gene defect is in a protein called mevalonic kinase (MVK). MVK is a protein that facilitates a chemical reaction in the body (enzyme) involved in the process of making cholesterol. In HIDS the MVK enzyme is active in only 1 to 10 percent of the normal enzyme activity. It still is unknown why the gene defect causes fever. Episodes can be triggered by infection, stress, and vaccination or without any obvious trigger. HIDS is inherited in an autosomal recessive way (which means that while the child is sick neither parent needs to show symptoms of the disease). In that case, the child receives two mutated genes, one from the mother and the other from the father. The parents are then called carriers. Often somebody in the extended family has the disease. If one child has the disease and the parents are carriers there is a 25 percent chance another child will get HIDS. Fever episodes are the major symptom, lasting three to seven days and recurring every two to 12 weeks. The attacks begin suddenly, often with shaking chills. Additional common symptoms can include: The disease symptoms and severity can differ from patient to patient. Most patients experience symptoms like: One of the most striking features of this condition is swelling of the lymph nodes in the neck and other parts of the body . It usually takes a physician expert in this disease to diagnose HIDS. The disease is suspected in patients with the symptoms listed above. Blood tests showing signs of inflammation during an episode are usually seen. Most (but not all, especially very young patients) have elevated levels of immunoglobulin D. During episodes, a urine test for organic acid (these are acids in the body that have the carbon atom in them) will show high levels of mevalonic acid. The diagnosis will be confirmed by a genetic test finding the genetic defect in the MVK protein or by showing low levels of MVK activity in blood cells. HIDS cannot be cured. An effective treatment to prevent attacks is not available. Research is being done to search for effective treatments. During an episode, (like ibuprofen, naproxen) or steroids may be partially helpful. HIDS is a lifelong disorder but episodes usually get milder and less frequent over time, often resolving later in life. Some patients develop . Except for amyloidosis in very rare cases, HIDS does not lead to severe organ damage. Neonatal Onset Multisystem Inflammatory Disease (NOMID), in Europe called Chronic Inflammatory Neurological Cutaneous Articular (CINCA) syndrome and related diseases What is neonatal onset multisystem inflammatory disease (NOMID)? Neonatal onset multisystem inflammatory disease (NOMID) is a rare genetic disease causing episodes of fever. In Europe this condition is called chronic inflammatory neurological cutaneous articular (CINCA) syndrome and related diseases. The symptoms of this condition start at birth, or are observed within the first weeks of life. The first symptoms are usually a skin rash and fever. Infants also have neurologic symptoms, such as chronic (inflammation of the membranes surrounding the brain), hearing and vision loss. About 50 percent of the children later develop severe joint involvement and have significant growth abnormalities. Two other less severe diseases that are caused by defects on the same gene of NOMID are called Muckle-Wells syndrome (MWS) and familial cold auto inflammatory – also called familial cold urticarial syndrome (FCAS). These diseases start later in life. The entire group of these diseases are now called the cryopyrin- associated auto inflammatory diseases. NOMID is a very rare condition. MWS and FCAS are probably seen more frequently but are still rare. NOMID is a genetic disease. The disease is inherited as an autosomal dominant disease. That means that either one of the parents is ill with a variant of the disease or that the gene defect was newly formed in the sick child (de novo mutation. A genetic defect is found in only 50 percent of patients. The gene defect is in a protein called cryopyrin, which has the important task of controlling inflammation in the body. NOMID occurs equally in males and females. It has been observed in multiple ethnic groups. There is no seasonal influence. Some of the infants with NOMID are born prematurely. The babies often have signs of infection (fever, rash) at birth but no infection is found. The rash resembles urticaria (hives), but is not itchy. The rash increases in intensity with fever. Patients have neurologic problems from chronic meningitis (inflammation of the membranes surrounding the brain). This can result in vision difficulties, hearing loss and other neurologic problems. The eyes often appear as bulging and children often have episodes of vomiting. The skull is slightly increased in size. In some children, there is delayed closure of the anterior fontanel (the soft part in the skull of infants where the skull bones attach to each other). Children may later complain of headaches. Later, usually after 1 year of age, patients develop joint pain and swelling. In severe cases, an overgrowth of cartilage and of the bone epiphysis (the ends of the bone), especially at the knee, may occur. This bone overgrowth can result in joint deformity. These bone changes are seen in X-rays. There is a delay in growth and the children with NOMID are often very short. In older children, the hands appear short and wide and there may be clubbing(widening) of the finger and toe tips. Not all children have all of these symptoms. NOMID is suspected by the clinical features. The diagnosis is confirmed by the genetic test. However, 50 percent of the children do not have a genetic mutation. Until recently there was no effective treatment for NOMID. Patients were treated with medications to reduce symptoms like nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, steroids or . Recent research has shown that medications that target specific molecules involved in the inflammatory process increased in NOMID due to the genetic defect may be very effective for treating NOMID. Initial studies have shown that most NOMID patients respond dramatically to treatment with . However, this treatment must continue indefinitely as there is no known cure to NOMID. Physical therapy, splints and other aids are necessary to treat joint deformities if they occur. Splints and walking aids might also be necessary. Surgery is occasionally needed to correct these deformities. are needed for children with deafness. The outcome of NOMID was poor in the past, with severe growth disturbances. Many patients developed severe joint deformities and neurologic damage, mainly to the ears and eyes. There were also cases of death from brain damage. New treatment may have changed this poor outcome. Future studies are planned to answer this question. Muckle-Wells syndrome and Familial Cold auto inflammatory syndrome What are Muckle-Wells syndrome and familial cold auto inflammatory syndrome? These syndromes are related to gene defects on the same cryopyrin protein gene causing NOMID. As in NOMID, no gene defect is found in about 50 percent of the patients. These syndromes occur later in life than NOMID and are milder. In familial cold auto inflammatory syndrome, cold, and perhaps other environmental triggers, causes a hive-like rash (urticaria) to occur. In Muckle-Wells syndrome patients also develop episodic fever and deafness. In both syndromes untreated patients often develop amyloidosis. Amyloid is a protein that deposits in certain organs in children with chronic inflammatory diseases that are not well controlled. The most common organ involved is the kidney, but amyloid can deposit in the gut, skin and heart. Eventually amyloid causes a loss of function, especially of the kidneys. As in NOMID, recent studies have shown that the use of Kineret® for these syndromes is very effective. Periodic fever, Aphthous-stomatitis, Pharyngitis, Adenitis (PFAPA) Syndrome What is Periodic fever, Aphthous-stomatitis, Pharyngitis, Adenitis (PFAPA) syndrome? This syndrome includes recurrent episodes of fever with aphthous-stomatitis (mouth sores), pharyngitis (sore throat with redness and sometimes a throat that has a white covering – exudate- like that’s seen in a throat with streptococcal infection). PFAPA affects children in early childhood, usually starting at age 2 to 4 years. Episodes usually decrease in frequency and resolve after the age of 10 years. This disease was recognized for the first time in 1987 and was called Marshall’s. The frequency of PFAPA is not known, but the disease appears to be more common than generally appreciated. The answer to this question is not yet known. No gene defect has been found in PFAPA, although in some cases more than one family member has the disease. No infectious cause has been found in PFAPA, thus it is not a contagious disease. It is clear that the inflammatory process is activated during episodes but it is not clear why it is triggered. Enlarged cervical lymph nodes (glands in the neck, an important part of the immune system) The episodes of fever start abruptly and last for three to seven days. During episodes, the child looks very ill and complains about at least one of the three symptoms mentioned above. The episodes of fever recur every few weeks and often families know the exact day when an attack will start. On the day the fever starts the child will feel a little ill before the attack and the family knows an attack is about to start. Not all children have all symptoms, especially mouth sores. Some children have other symptoms, like: There are no laboratory tests, or imaging procedures, specific for diagnosing PFAPA. The disease will be diagnosed based on the results of a physical examination and other symptoms. Inflammatory blood tests like the white blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and the C-reactive protein are increased during attacks. Before the diagnosis is confirmed, it is important to exclude all other diseases that may present with similar symptoms (especially a streptococcal throat). The dramatic response to treatment (see below) also helps diagnose PFAPA. There is no specific treatment to cure PFAPA. The aim of treatment is to control symptoms during the episodes of fever, to shorten the duration of episodes, and in some children to prevent attacks from occurring. In most children, the disease will resolve by itself without treatment, usually after the age of 10 years. The fever does not usually respond well to Tylenol® or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. A single dose of steroids (usually ), given when symptoms first appear, has been shown to shorten an episode and sometimes even end the episode. However, the interval between episodes may also be shortened with this treatment, and the next episode may occur earlier than expected. In some patients using (a medicine that is used to treat stomach ulcers) may prevents attacks from occurring. In patients with very frequent attacks, a (removing the tonsils by surgery) may be considered. The disease may last for several years. Over time, the intervals between the episodes will increase and usually after the age of 10 years resolve by itself. Children with PFAPA continue to grow and develop normally.

7edcf158-d939-445a-9bb2-ae13597edca5,"Targeting Iron Dyshomeostasis for Treatment of Neurodegenerative Disorders   , , –() While iron has an important role in the normal functioning of the brain owing to its involvement in several physiological processes, dyshomeostasis has been found in many neurodegenerative disorders, as evidenced by both histopathological and imaging studies. Although the exact causes have remained elusive, the fact that altered iron levels have been found in disparate diseases suggests that iron may contribute to their development and/or progression. As such, the processes involved in iron dyshomeostasis may represent novel therapeutic targets. There are, however, many questions about the exact interplay between neurodegeneration and altered iron homeostasis. Some insight can be gained by considering the parallels with respect to what occurs in healthy aging, which is also characterized by increased iron throughout many regions in the brain along with progressive neurodegeneration. Nevertheless, the exact mechanisms of iron-mediated damage are likely disease specific to a certain degree, given that iron plays a crucial role in many disparate biological processes, which are not always affected in the same way across different neurodegenerative disorders. Moreover, it is not even entirely clear yet whether iron actually has a causative role in all of the diseases where altered iron levels have been noted. For example, there is strong evidence of iron dyshomeostasis leading to neurodegeneration in Parkinson’s disease, but there is still some question as to whether changes in iron levels are merely an epiphenomenon in multiple sclerosis. Recent advances in neuroimaging now offer the possibility to detect and monitor iron levels in vivo, which allows for an improved understanding of both the temporal and spatial dynamics of iron changes and associated neurodegeneration compared to post-mortem studies. In this regard, iron-based imaging will likely play an important role in the development of therapeutic approaches aimed at addressing altered iron dynamics in neurodegenerative diseases. Currently, the bulk of such therapies have focused on chelating excess iron. Although there is some evidence that these treatment options may yield some benefit, they are not without their own limitations. They are generally effective at reducing brain iron levels, as assessed by imaging, but clinical benefits are more modest. New drugs that specifically target iron-related pathological processes may offer the possibility to prevent, or at the least, slow down irreversible neurodegeneration, which represents an unmet therapeutic target.

91693732-5802-4202-865a-11aaca7d945a,"— — Nerves send and receive messages from every part of your body and process them in your brain. They allow you to: Many nerves are coated in myelin. Myelin is an insulating material. When it’s worn away or damaged, nerves can deteriorate, causing problems in the brain and throughout the body. Damage to myelin around nerves is called demyelination. Nerves are made up of neurons. Neurons are composed of: The axon sends messages from one neuron to the next. Axons also connect neurons to other cells, such as muscle cells. Some axons are extremely short, while others are 3 feet long. Axons are covered in myelin. Myelin protects the axons and helps carry axon messages as quickly as possible. Myelin is made of membrane layers that cover an axon. This is similar to the idea of an electrical wire with coating to protect the metal underneath. Myelin allows a nerve signal to travel faster. In unmyelinated neurons, a signal can travel along the nerves at about 1 meter per second. In a myelinated neuron, the signal can travel 100 meters per second. Certain medical conditions can damage myelin. Demyelination slows down messages sent along axons and causes the axon to deteriorate. Depending upon the location of the damage, axon loss can cause problems with: Inflammation is the most common cause of myelin damage. Other causes include: Demyelination prevents nerves from being able to conduct messages to and from the brain. The effects of demyelination can occur rapidly. In (GBS), myelin may only be under attack for a few hours before symptoms appear. Not everyone is affected by demyelinating conditions in the same way. However, some demyelinating symptoms are very common. Early symptoms — which are among the first signs of demyelination — include: Symptoms associated with the effect of demyelination on nerves Nerves are a key part of your body functions, so a wide range of symptoms can occur when nerves are affected by demyelination, including: Symptoms can come and go in chronic conditions, like (MS), and progress over years. There are different types of demyelination. These include inflammatory demyelination and viral demyelination. Inflammatory demyelination happens when the body’s immune system attacks myelin. Types of demyelination like MS, , and are caused by inflammation in the brain and spinal cord. GBS involves inflammatory demyelination of peripheral nerves in other parts of the body. Viral demyelination occurs with (PML). PML is caused by the JC virus. Myelin damage can also occur with: Hypoxic-ischemic demyelination occurs due to vascular disease or a lack of oxygen in the brain. MS is the most common demyelinating condition. According to the , it affects 2.3 million people worldwide. In MS, demyelination occurs in the white matter of the brain and in the spinal cord. Lesions or “plaques” then form where myelin is under attack by the immune system. Many of these plaques, or scar tissue, occur throughout the brain over the course of years. There’s no cure for demyelinating conditions, but new myelin growth can occur in areas of damage. However, it’s often thinner and not as effective. Researchers are looking into ways to increase the body’s ability to grow new myelin. Most treatments for demyelinating conditions reduce the immune response. Treatment involves using drugs like interferon beta-1a or glatiramer acetate. People with low vitamin D levels more easily develop MS or other demyelinating conditions. High levels of vitamin D may reduce inflammatory immune responses. Demyelinating conditions, especially MS and optic neuritis, or inflammation of the optic nerve, are detectable with MRI scans. MRIs can show demyelination plaques in the brain and nerves, especially those caused by MS. Your healthcare provider may be able to locate plaques or lesions affecting your nervous system. Treatment can then be directed specifically at the source of demyelination in your body. The central nervous system (CNS) is able to produce its own cholesterol. Current show that if you take statins to reduce the cholesterol in your body, they’re not likely to affect your CNS cholesterol. Many have also found that statin treatment may protect against Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in people who haven’t already experienced cognitive impairment and are still relatively young. have found that statins may slow the rate of cognitive decline and delay the onset of AD. Research continues, and we don’t have a definite answer yet. Some studies show that statins don’t affect the CNS or remyelination, and still others say they do. Currently, most of the evidence doesn’t show statin therapy to be harmful to remyelination within the CNS. Still, the effects of statins on cognitive function remain controversial at this time. Activating the immune system with a vaccine can trigger an autoimmune reaction. This tends to occur only in a few individuals with hypersensitive immune systems. Some children and adults experience “acute demyelinating syndromes” after exposure to certain vaccines, such as those for influenza or HPV. But there have only been , and it’s not certain that vaccines were the cause of the demyelination. Demyelinating conditions can seem painful and unmanageable at first. However, it’s still possible to live well with MS and other common conditions. There’s promising new research about the causes of demyelination and how to treat the biological sources of myelin deterioration. Treatments are also being improved for the management of pain caused by demyelination. Demyelinating conditions may not be curable. However, you can talk to your healthcare about medications and other treatments that may help you learn more about your condition. The more you know, the more you can do to address the symptoms, such as making lifestyle changes, to help you effectively manage the pain. — — Everything You Should Know About Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP) Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM): What You Should Know Multiple Sclerosis (MS): Possible Ways to Improve Remyelination Multiple sclerosis is a chronic illness of the central nervous system.

His family noted some memory loss of unclear duration. On examination, he was oriented to self and place but not to month or year. He immediately registered 3 items, but recalled only 1 item at 5 minutes with clues provided. Visual acuity waspoor. On motor examination, he had 4/5 lower extremity strength. His gait was broad based, spastic, and ataxic. Romberg sign was positive. He had loss of vibratory sense in the legs, absentposition sense in toes, and hyperesthesia to pinprick in distal extremities. Muscle stretch reflexes were normal. Babinskisigns were present. The patient's hematocrit was 29%, with a mean corpuscular volume of µm3.

He presents with a global confusion, ataxic gait, horizontal nystagmus, and conjugate gaze palsies. He looks emaciated and is known to consume alcohol when he has the money. His BP is 100/60, normal respirations, somewhat agitated and unable to follow commands. 1. Your working diagnosis based on this classic presentation is?Central pontine myelinolysis Wernicke's encephalopathyAcute B12 deficiencyCerebellar InfarctionDementia Pugilistica 2. Your initial treatment would be?Rapid infusion 500 cc of Ringers Lactate Start IV with Dextrose 5%WaterAdminister B12 statAdminister thiamine statAdminister Naloxone stat Wernicke's encephalopathyAdminister thiamine statThiamine deficiency occurs mainly with malnutrition as seen in some disorders (such as malignancies, anorexia nervosa, hyperemesis gravidarum, starvation, and AIDS) and especially in chronic alcoholics. There is generally evidence of symmetrical periventricular (III ventricle, aqueduct of Sylvius, and IV ventricle) lesions in the brainstem and medial thalamus. The anterior cerebellar vermis is frequently involved. Diagnosis is facilitated by MRI, which is more sensitive than CT in detecting the acute periventricular and diencephalic lesions. Central pontine myelinosis is a result of rapid fluid correction (rate and volume). Symptoms of B12 deficiency develops more gradually and affects the spinal cord first (Subacute Combined degeneration of the spinal cord). Symptoms of cerebellar infarction usually demonstrate ipsilateral cerebellar signs. This 2-year-old male child was seen in your office because he over the past 2 weeks is having periods of becoming anorectic, less playful and less alert. Intermittent vomiting, vague abdominal pain and clumsiness, and ataxia is noted. Mother wants to know if he is mentally retarded. They live in an urban slum area where deteriorated housing prevails. Your examination reveals an irritable child and you observe a seizure in your office. Your office CBC demonstrates basophilic stippling. There is no lateralizing neurologic deficits but you note blurring of the disc margins on ophthalmologic exam.You send the patient to the hospital for observation and further tests, because you are concerned that he may have:EncephalitisBrain tumorLead poisoning Infantile seizuresSubarachnoid hemorrhage Lead poisoning The symptoms of lead poisoning ""plumbism"" are non specific the diagnosis depends on an appreciation of the causative factors, a high index of suspicion, and the results of certain laboratory tests. The presence of lead lines at the metaphyses of long bones and basophilic stippling of red cells are too inconsistent to be relied on, but basophilic stippling of bone marrow normoblasts is uniformly increased. Impairment of heme synthesis, which is exquisitely sensitive to the toxic effects of lead, result in the increased excretion of urinary coproporphyrin (UCP) and of delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA). These urinary indices and the lead concentration in serum bear an imperfect relationship to the clinical manifestations. ( The test for UCP, which is readily performed in the clinic and emergency department, a few milliliters of urine are acidified with acetic acid and shaken with an equal volume of ether; if UCP is present, the ether layer will reveal a reddish fluorescence under a Wood's lamp. This test is strongly positive when the whole blood concentration of lead exceeds 80 mg/dl. Treatment is with EDTA (calcium disodium edetate) which chelates lead. In children who die of acute lead encephalopathy, the brain is massively swollen, with herniation of the temporal lobes and cerebellum. This 40-year-old mother of 2 was admitted to the hospital due to mentation change. She has been in good health and recently started oral contraceptives due to menorrhagia (heavy menstrual flow). Recently she began complaining of bouts of abdominal pain but her regular doctor could not find anything wrong and started Valium 2 days ago because she seemed nervous and anxious. Thenext day she began acting weird according to the family. You findthe patient to be restless, agitated, and occasionally seems delirious. No localizing neurologic deficits were noted and during the examination she had a major motor seizure. You place her Iintensive care and start her on dilantin after which she advances in to status epilepticus. Several drugs are given to stop the seizures only to make things worse. You suspect:lead poisoningArsenic poisoningAcute intermittent porphyruriaDrug overdoseWernicke's encephalopathy Acute intermittent porphyruriaThis case represents one that snuck up on me during my residency. It seemed that the more drugs we gave her the worse she became. We checked the urinary porphyrins as well as a serum delta - aminolevulinic acid and found both to be elevated. We stopped all the drugs, uses dextrose IV, Hematin and the patient recovered completely over the next 2 days. In hind sight the birth control pills and the valium precipitated an acute attack of Acute Intermittent Porphyria (AIP). Interesting to note that the porphyrias (three in number) were never recognized until sulfur was introduced into the practice of medicine. Numerous common drugs (over 50 that can induce cytochrome P-450) can precipitate this condition. Once recognized then recurrent attacks can be prevented by educating the patient that even starvation can cause AIP. The normal treatment is Hematin (which suppresses the production of delta-ALA) and she was advised to avoid going without meals (avoid prolonged carbohydrate deprivation. If an acute attack occurs she's to go to the ER and receive Hematin. This is an inherited condition so educate the family and test if symptoms arise. A 23-year-old man presents with a 7-year history of arm and vocal tremor. The tremor became more noticeable with action and posture, it never occurred at rest. His gait changed as well with mild unsteadiness, and he experiences a slight tremor of his head when walking. Your examination reveals a dysarthric scanning and slightly slow speech accompanied with a vocal tremor. A mild hypotonia without cog-wheeling or bradykinesia on motor exam. Rapid alternating movements were mildly uncoordinated, with dysdiadochokinesis and dysmetria was seen. Sensory and DTR exam was normal. Routine laboratory findings include low plateletcount 100,000 (N-165-415). Total bilirubin 2.7mg/dl (N 0.30-1.30)and direct bilirubin 0.8 mg/dl (N 0.04-0.38) were mildly elevated.The remainder of the routine chemistry and hematology studies were normal. An abdominal ultrasound revealed mildhepatomegaly and marked splenomegaly.What is your tentative diagnosis?Essential tremorCerebellar disease due to B12NeoplasmWilson's diseaseFriedreich's ataxia Wilson's diseaseThe patient did have an essential tremor, however, to diagnose essential tremor you must have tremor only. Here the patient had cerebellar dysfunction. His liver function tests suggest he has liver disease. The diagnosis of Wilson's disease (Hepatolenticular encephalopathy) is usually made at bedside by careful examination of his eyes. By illuminating his irises from the side and varying the angle of the light on the eye, it was possible to see Kayser-Fleischer rings in the outer cornea of both eyes, even though his irises were brown. They extended around the full circumference of the iris, thicker superiorly and inferiorly, and were later documented by slit-lamp examination by an experienced neuro-ophthalmogist. Serum and urine ceruloplasmin will confirm the diagnosis and treatment is with Penicillamine (chelates copper). A 50-year-old farmer is seen in the ER He was drowsy, demonstrated mental confusion, and complained of severe abdominal pain and a headache. He had a tonic clonic seizure in the ambulance en-route. His wife states he's been in good health but does complain of numbness in his feet for the past 2 weeks, when coming in from the field. His annual exam 3 months ago was normal. For the past 2 weeks he has been spraying his 1400 acre field with pesticides. Your exam reveals no localizing neurologic deficits other than a mild diffuse encephalopathy and abdominal tenderness to palpation. You cannot assess his probable peripheral neuropathy until he's lucid and canrespond appropriately. You suspect:Lead poisoning Mercury poisoningArsenic poisoningHerpes encephalitisSubarachnoid hemorrhage Arsenic poisoningThe most common cause of Arsenic poisoning is the suicidal or accidental ingestion of herbicides, insecticides, or rodenticides containing copper acetoarsenite (Paris Green). In rural areas, arsenic-containing insecticide sprays are a common source of poisoning. Arsenic is used also in the manufacture of paints, enamels, and metals; as disinfectant for skins and furs; and also in galvanizing, soldering, etching, and lead plating. Arsenic is still used in the treatment of psoriasis and other skin disorders and in some herbal remedies. Diagnosis depends on the demonstration of increased levels of arsenic in the hair and urine. Arsenic is deposited in the hair within 2 weeks of exposure and may remain fixed there for long periods. Concentrations of more than 0.1 mg arsenic per 100 mg hair are indicative of poisoning. Arsenic also remains within bones for long periods and is slowly excreted in the urine and feces. Excretion of more than 0.1 mg arsenic per liter of urine is considered abnormal; levels greater than 1 mg/L may occur soon after acute exposure. Treatment is with dimercaprol (BAL). A 30-year-old artist is seen in your office with numbness in his feet. He is a sculptor who is a health food fanatic and taking several herbal preparations. Heworks with pottery and uses numerous glazes in the process. He also describes a vague abdominal colic. He denies fever. Your exam indicates he hasdiminished Achilles DTR's decreased response to pinprick to the level of his ankles. You also note rigidity of the abdominal muscles. Laboratoryexamination only reveals an anemia and no leukocytosis.Your tentative diagnosis is:Acute intermittent porphyria Lead poisoningArsenic poisoningPolyneuropathyWilson's disease Lead poisoningLead poisoning in adults is much less common than in children. The hazards to adults are the result of inhaling the dust of inorganic lead salts and the fumes from the burning of objects containing lead or involvement in processes that require the re-smelting of lead. Painting, printing, pottery glazing, welding, and storage battery manufacturing are the industries in which these hazards are likeliest to occur. Encephalopathy found in children is rare in adults. Diagnosis and treatment is the same as that of children. This 80-year-old edentulous female presents with a sensory ataxia, paresthesias, impaired memory, fecalincontinence, and evidence of neuropathy and spinal cord dysfunction. She has noted that at night she hasto keep a light on to prevent falling when going to the bathroom. She is being treated for a hiatal hernia andchronic gastritis for the past 10 years. She has been unable to eat food that she has to chew because she cannot afford dentures. Her exam revealed a mild dementia, decreased proprioception and vibration in the lower extremities, absent ankle reflexes andpositive bilateral Babinski's and a positive Romberg test.Given this history, you suspect:Alzheimer's diseaseAmyotrophic lateral sclerosisSubacute combined degeneration of the spinal cordTransverse myelitisFriedreich's ataxia Subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cordThis patient is at risk for B12 deficiency. This disorder usually presents with neuropathy first with diminished reflexes if the disease is not treated then spinal cord symptoms appear (Babinski's). This is one of only a few disorders that may present with both upper motor and lower motor symptoms (ALS, Syphilis, Friedreich's ataxia, vitamin E deficiency, cervical spondylitic myelopathy). Sensory ataxia due to the peripheral neuropathy prevents her proprioceptive feed back and she is unable to navigate in the dark without visual cues (hence the positive Romberg test). This is very common in patients with pernicious anemia (however the neurologic symptoms may predate by months, the macrocytic anemia found with the serum test or before the Shillings test becomes positive for pernicious anemia). Diagnosis is made by using chemiluminescence assay of for cobalamin (normal range 230 - 931 pg/mL). Treatment is with intramuscular cobalamin (B12) 1000 ug, or sublingual 2000 ug usually monthly. I have treated patients with severe depletion (0 - 230 pg/mL) with weekly injections for 1 month then biweekly for 1 month then monthly then rechecking the serum after they have been on the once/monthly treatment for 2-3 months, in order, to see if they maintain a mid to high range cobalamin level. The neuropathy may take months to 1 year to improve and the spinal cord may never improve. This is why your index of suspicion should be greatest when potential malnutrition occurs in the presence of neuropathy, diagnose it before the spinal cord becomes involved. A 41-year-old factory worker presents in your office with complaining of paresthesias in his feet and handsand headache. He also describes lassitude, confusion, incoordination, and intention tremor, which are confirmed on the neurologic exam. He works forGeneral Electric making incandescent lights. He has noted the symptoms to progress over the past several months (after 2 months of starting to work there).Otherwise he has been in good health.You suspect:Arsenic poisoningLead poisoningManganese poisoningOrganophosphate poisoningMercury poisoning Mercury poisoningMercury poisoning arises in two forms, one due to inorganic compounds and the other, more dangerous , to organic mercury (seen in laboratory chemists). This patient presents with the more chronic form due to inorganic compounds, which occurs in persons exposed to large amounts of the metal used in the manufacture of thermometers, mirrors, incandescent lights, X-ray machines, and vacuum pumps. If exposure is more than a minimal degree over a long period, gastrointestinal disturbances are prone to occur (anorexia, weight loss), as well as stomatitis and gingivitis with loosening of the teeth. Diagnosis is with 24 hour urine sample (appears to be more sensitive than serum in chronic poisoning). Normal is less than 20 mcg/L; symptoms develop at or > 200 mcg/L; remove from occupational exposure if > 300 mcg/L. Toxicity in chronic exposure can be see at levels of 50 to 100 mcg/L. Normally employes at hazardous occupations are required to have a baseline urine test when they start work and the test is repeated every 3 to 6 months depending on the risk. Treatment is with DMSA (2, 3 - dimercaptosuccinic acid) administered orally and appears to chelate mercury selectively. A 24 year-old-female is found in here garage with the car running. You see her in the ER initially unresponsive after administering oxygen she becomes lethargic then confused, complaining of headache, nausea, dyspnea. Assuming she survives and your diagnosis was correct. What is the possible neurologic sequelae that may develop 1 - 3 weeks later, you need to inform the patient about?Huntington's choreaParkinsonismAlzheimer's diseaseFronto-temporal -dementiaMigraine headaches Parkinsonismand that 75% will recover within one year. evidence of trauma during drunkennessRBC count revealing an increased mean corpuscular volume (MCV) with round macrocytosisLiver disease Alcohol withdrawalBlackoutsWernicke's and Korsakoff syndromesMarchiafava-Bignami diseaseCentral Pontine myelinolysisCerebellar degenerationPeripheral neuropathy with decreased sensation to pain Tremulousness - within 8- 12 hours Auditory hallucinations - 24 hoursWithdrawal seizures - within 48 hours The classic triad of the syndrome is confusion, ophthalmoplegia, and ataxia, though these are only seen in combination in 10% of cases What eye sx do you see in wernicke encephalopathy? What part of brain does wernicke encephalopathy always involve? Confabulation, that is, invented memories which are then taken as true due to gaps in memory Symmetrical Demyelination Of the Corpus Callosum is seen in what disease? neurological disease caused by severe damage of the myelin sheath of nerve cells in the pons, predominately of iatrogenic etiology. It is characterized by acute paralysis, dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), and dysarthria (difficulty speaking), and other neurological symptoms = what disease? Alcoholic cerebellar degeneration in what part of the brain? weight loss because this usually signifies a nutritional deficiency that can lead to the development of the disease sensory and motor loss, painful paresthesias (all sensory modalities may be involved).system issues seem to develop in a symmetrical pattern. In most cases the legs are affected first, followed by the arms. hands usually when the symptoms reach above the ankle level.The polyneuropathy that develops spans a large range of severity. Some cases are seemingly asymptomatic and may only be recognized upon careful examination. The most severe cases may result in profound physical disability. initial symptoms includecentral nervous system depression,headache, dizziness, nausea, lack of coordination, confusion, with sufficiently large doses, unconsciousness and death. The initial symptoms of methanol exposure are usually less severe than the symptoms resulting from the ingestion of a similar quantity of ethanol. Sx of methanol intoxication after initial sx have passed (2nd set sx)? second set of symptoms arises, 10 to as many as 30 hours after the initial exposure to methanolincluding blurring or complete loss of vision and acidosis. These symptoms result from the accumulation of toxic levels of formate in the blood, and may progress to death by respiratory failure. Carbon monoxide poisoning CT, MRI, and gross brain appearance CT: symmetrical bilateral low attenuation areas in the globus pallidus (arrows). No other abnormalities are visible. MRI (obtained one week later) demonstrate abnormal T2 hyperintensity bilaterally in the globus pallidus (black arrows), cerebellar hemispheres, and frontoparietal white matter.

WithdrawalDilated pupilsTachycardiaHypertensionMuscle achesProfuse sweating Treatment: Oral benzodiazepine (diazepam) sedation Biochemically, arsenic prevents use of thiamine resulting in a clinical picture resembling thiamine deficiency.Poisoning with arsenic can raise lactate levels and lead to lactic acidosis. Low potassium levels in the blood increase the risk of experiencing a life-threatening heart rhythm problem from arsenic trioxide. Arsenic in cells clearly stimulates the production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). When the H2O2 reacts with certain metals such as iron or manganese it produces a highly reactive hydroxyl radical. Inorganic Arsenic trioxide found in ground water particularly affects voltage-gated potassium channels, disrupting cellular electrolytic function resulting in neurological disturbances, cardiovascular episodes such as prolonged qt interval, neutropenia, high blood pressure, central nervous system dysfunction, anemia, Leukemia, and death. Arsenic trioxide is a ubiquitous molecule present in American drinking water.Symptoms of arsenic poisoning begin with headaches, confusion and drowsiness. As the poisoning develops, convulsions and changes in fingernail pigmentation may occur. When the poisoning becomes acute, symptoms may include diarrhea, vomiting, blood in the urine, cramping muscles, hair loss, stomach pain, and more seizures. The organs of the body that are usually affected by arsenic poisoning are the lungs, skin, kidneys, and liver. The final result of arsenic poisoning is coma or death. thiamine def, arsenic poisoning (mimics thiamine def.) When do you see subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord?

A 28-year-old woman presents with a sudden onset of diplopia. On examination when attempting to look to the right, she is unable to adduct the left eye past the midline; associated with nystagmus in the abducting (right) eye. When she attempts to look to the left she is unable to adduct the right eye past the midline; associated with nystagmus in the abducting (left) eye. All past medical history is normal except 5 years ago she had a 4-week episode of blindness in her left eye, which resolved without any residual. The rest of the examination was normal.

A 30-year-old woman is seen with new-onset bilateral asynchronous trigeminal neuralgia. It began without warning 5 days ago and over-the-counter medications is not relieving the pain. She has no other complaint and her history and examination confirms trigeminal neuralgia. You clinically suspectMultiple sclerosisTolosa-Hunt syndromeMigraineAnterior communicating artery aneurysmCentral pontine myelinosis A 22-year-old woman has been experiencing discomfort and blurring of vision in her left eye for several days. She has never had similar symptoms and has otherwise been healthy. She has 20/20 vision in her right eye, measured with a near vision card while her left eye is covered. With the right eye covered, she is unable to read newsprint and her acuity is 20/300. Her pupils are equal, but she has a left afferent pupillary defect. The left and right optic disc appear normal. She complains of discomfort in the left eye during testing of visual pursuit. The remainder of her examination is normal.What is the proper term describing her condition?Optic AtrophyPapilledemaOptic neuritisGiant cell ""temporal"" arteritisComplicated migraine A 21-year-old right-handed woman experienced a sensation of numbness and tingling over her abdomen and in her legs. The next day her legs began to feel stiff and tight, and she experienced incomplete voiding and difficulty in initiating her urinary stream. As the day progressed, the numbness and tingling became more pronounced in her mid-abdomen and elbow, and she noted difficulty in walking. She went to bed early that evening, and when she awoke the next morning she was unable to stand. What is the temporal profile, the most likely site of involvement and most likely diagnosis in this case?Acute - Spinal - VascularSubacute - Spinal - InflammatoryChronic - Spinal - NeoplasmSubacute - Peripheral - InflammatoryAcute - Peripheral - metabolic A 25-year-old female presents with clumsiness of the right arm. Her history is positive for optic neuritis at age 16 which resolved in 6 weeks. On examination you find the right upper extremity to exhibit hyper-reflexa and distal weakness. You diagnose optic atrophy in her right eye. Which of the following (according to the McDonald Criteria for MS) will you need in order to make a clinical diagnosis of MS.Nothing additionallyMRI with gadoliniumMRI in 3 monthsMRI without gadoliniumCompare current MRI with previous MRI if available Nothing additionallyYou are able to clinically make the diagnosis with the history and physical findings. Sure you will need the MRI and CSF for confirmation, after you have clinically made the diagnosis. The most common presenting finding or symptom of multiple sclerosis is:Internuclear ophthalmoplegiaTransverse myelitisCerebellar ataxiaOptic neuritisUrinary retention Optic neuritisOptic neuritis is the initial symptom in approximately 40% of persons who are eventually diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. This rapidly developing ophthalmologic disorder is associated with partial or total loss of vision, pain on motion of the involved eye, scotoma affecting macular vision, and a variety other visual field defects. Ophthalmoscopically visible optic papillitis occurs in about half these patients. Which of the following is the most common clinical form of multiple sclerosis?Relapsing-remittingPrimary progressiveSecondary progressiveProgressive relapsingAcute fulminant form (Marburg's variant) Which of the following is the most common adverse effect at the onset of therapy with Interferon B-1A for the treatment of multiple Sclerosis?HeadachesFlu-like symptomsSeizuresVomitingMyositis A 38-year-old man who has progressive difficulty concentrating on his job comes to medical attention because of irregular, jerky movements of his extremities. A sister and an uncle died in mental institutions. A younger brother currently has similar symptoms. His mother became demented in her middle age. The most likely diagnosis isParkinson's dementia complexHuntington's diseaseWilson's diseaseFronto-temporal dementiaDementia with Lewy bodies A 64-year-old male presents with frequent falls. He has Parkinson symptoms (resting tremor, bradykinesia, cogwheel rigidity). You notice the patient has reduced voluntary eye (upward) movements and keeps his neck rather rigid and extended. More importantly the patient is falling with out warning and has trouble keeping his balance. When placed on L-dopa (Sinemet) he had only a slight improvement. A 72-year-old retired engineer became acutely confused and disoriented. Symptoms resolved as mysteriously as they started. Over the next 3 years, he gradually became depressed and socially withdrawn and had progressive short-term memory impairment and repetitiveness. During this time, he would occasionally have visual hallucinations associated with periodic confusional states. His gait deteriorated, and he developed postural instability with retropulsion and stooping. There was no response to a trial of carbidopa/levodopa (Sinemet). Examination was notable for symmetric parkinsonian features, masked facial expression, and postural tremor in his hands. Mental status examination revealed profound impairment in delayed recall, with no benefit from cues or practice trials. Brain MRI demonstrated atrophy; EEG showed diffuse slowing. Trials of various SSRI agents, H2 blockers for reflux and neuroleptics caused delirium. The patient continued this downward, fluctuating course until his death in a nursing home 7 years later. The most likely diagnosis isParkinson's dementia complexHuntington's diseaseWilson's diseaseFronto-temporal dementiaDementia with Lewy body Dementia with Lewy-bodyDementia with Lewy bodies overlaps clinically with Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, but is more associated with the latter.[1] In DLB, loss of cholinergic (acetylcholine-producing) neurons is thought to account for degeneration of cognitive function (similar to Alzheimer's), and loss of dopaminergic (dopamine-producing) neurons for degeneration of motor control (similar to Parkinson's) - in some ways, therefore, it resembles both diseases. The overlap of neuropathologies and presenting symptoms (cognitive, emotional, and motor) can make an accurate differential diagnosis difficult. In fact, it is often confused in its early stages with Alzheimer's disease and/or vascular dementia (multi-infarct dementia), although, where Alzheimer's disease usually begins quite gradually, DLB often has a rapid or acute onset, with especially rapid decline in the first few months. DLB tends to progress more quickly than Alzheimer's disease.[2] Despite the difficulty, a prompt diagnosis of DLB is important because of the risks of sensitivity to neuroleptic drugs and because appropriate treatment of symptoms can improve life for both the person with DLB and their caregivers.[2]DLB is distinguished from the dementia that sometimes occurs in Parkinson's disease by the time frame in which dementia symptoms appear relative to Parkinson symptoms.[3] Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD) would be the diagnosis when dementia onset is more than a year after the onset of Parkinson's. DLB is diagnosed when cognitive symptoms begin at the same time or within a year of Parkinson symptoms. A 60-year-old woman with a history of hypertension has been brought to the family doctor because her husband ""thought she needed to be checked."" The patient reported that nothing was wrong with her and that her husband had always been overly protective. Her husband reminded her that she had had trouble driving recently, getting lost on several familiar streets, and that at a recent reunion; she had been unable to recall friends. She was unable to handle normal household budget, leaving bills unpaid. Recently she is not taking usual care in dressing. The patient responded that he ""was making mountains out of anthills."" The patient also thought that the house had been recently burglarized and that people were watching the house. Except for a long history for gout and an ulcer many years ago, the patient has no history of medical problems. The patient takes no medication. Physical examination and Neurological examination were normal except that the patient was making frequent paraphasic errors. She could not recall any of 3 simple objects. She is aware of the clinic name but not the town and says it is ""fallish"" in 1982.The most likely diagnosis is Alzheimer' diseasePicks diseaseEarly Huntington's diseaseVascular dementiaMetabolic encephalopathy A 55-year-old man, premorbidly described by his family as ""thoughtful, accomplished, and intelligent,"" began neglecting his home and work responsibilities over a 2-year period. He became increasingly inflexible and uncaring. At work he missed several deadlines, and clients complained that he ""forgot"" about them. Consequently, he stopped working. He became more impulsive, driving late at night without reason. He obsessively checked his furnace numerous times each day and night, unconcerned about this safety risk. His wife became increasingly tearful and anxious, whereas he seemed unaware of her turmoil and his change in personality. The patient's personal hygiene declined; he stopped shaving and dressed sloppily. At social functions, he interrupted conversations, touched people inappropriately, and spoke in a tasteless and loud fashion, often embarrassing his wife. Despite these changes, he continued to garden and perform other favored activities, albeit with less attention to detail. Examination results revealed a malodorous and unshaven man with disheveled clothes. He spoke out of turn and was repetitive, stating, 'I have to go."" At times he attempted to leave the examination room but returned with gentle coaxing. His affect was otherwise flat. He gave concrete, terse responses to questions, mostly affirmative, negative, or stating, ""I don't know."" Naming was impaired. He followed some simple commands, but more complex sequences were incomplete or disorganized. His memory was relatively intact, although retrieval of relatives' names was impaired. He listed only 5 animals in 1 minute, a significant impairment given his postgraduate education level. Other than motor impersistence and mild rooting reflex bilaterally, the results of the neurologic examination were relatively unremarkable. Over the next 2 years, the patient became increasing withdrawn, spoke less, and required prompting for virtually every activity.The most likely diagnosis isParkinson's dementia complexHuntington's diseaseWilson's diseaseFronto-temporal dementiaLewy-body dementia A 70-year-old man presented with a 3-year history of progressive memory loss, which mainly affected his short term memory. He needed his daughter to remind him of his appointments and some day-to-day activities. He had problems with driving alone as he became confused with the routes, though he had used them for a long time. He could not manage his bills as usual. The physical examination was unremarkable. The Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) was 20 out of 30. What is the cause of his memory loss/disease?Alzheimer' diseasePicks diseaseEarly Huntington's diseaseVascular dementiaMetabolic encephalopathy Alzheimer's diseaseAlzheimer's is the most common cause of dementia among older adults. The major pathogenesis is the production and accumulation of beta-amyloid peptide, bringing about the formation of neurofibrillary tangles, oxidation and lipid peroxidation, glutamatergic excitotoxicity, inflammation, and activation of the cascade of apoptotic cell death. Furthermore, the other hypothesis regarding the pathophysiology of AD stresses tau-protein abnormalities, heavy metals, vascular factors, and viral infections.[4] The natural course of AD averages 10 years. The cardinal features are insidious onset, progressive course, and early memory loss; at least one other cognitive impairment such as language dysfunction, apraxia, agnosia, visuospatial disorder, as well as executive dysfunction, must be seen. These impairments should constitute a decline from the previous level of cognitive functioning, interfering with daily activities.Memory decline is the hallmark of cognitive change in AD. It is characterized as a storage deficit, meaning that material cannot be recalled with cue. In the early stage, memory impairment for recent events is common whereas long-term memory remains intact. As the disease progresses, individuals with AD are increasingly unable to recall more distant memories. Typically, the motor signs are absent early in the course. Likewise, sensory abnormalities, seizures, and gait difficulties are uncommon until the late phase of disease. Behavioural changes, including depression, anxiety, apathy, aggression, agitation, wandering, vocalization, disinhibition, and abnormal eating, are common thereafter and cause caregiver stress as well as greater need for additional health care services. A 65-year-old man with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease developed sudden left hemiparesis and dysarthria 6 months ago. Three months later, his wife noticed that he could not name the only two grandchildren he had and could not remember to take his medications. He could neither operate a remote control nor cook meals as usual. On examination, there was only slight pronator drift on his left arm and hyperreflexia of the left extremities. Alzheimer' diseasePicks diseaseVascular dementiaDementia with Lewy-Body Huntington's disease Vascular Dementia.There are several clinical syndromes of vascular dementia (VaD), categorized into multi-infarct dementia, single strategic infarct (single brain infarct damaging functionally critical areas of the brain such as angular gyrus, thalamus, basal forebrain, posterior cerebral artery, and anterior cerebral artery territories), lacunar state, Binswanger's disease,genetic forms (e.g., cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy [CADASIL]), and hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy.A number of mechanisms causing these clinical syndromes are hemorrhage, ischemia/thrombosis, vasospasm, low perfusion, hematologic and rheological problems.Since cases do not share common etiology and mechanism, patients may have different clinical presentations. For example, the onset may be abrupt or insidious. The progression may be stepwise, fluctuating, or marked by continuous worsening. Frequently, individuals with VaD present with gradual and progressive cognitive decline without any stroke events. However, typical cases of VaD are usually seen with atherosclerotic co-morbidities (diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary heart disease, and peripheral artery disease). The onset of cognitive decline is either subtle or abrupt, and there is psychomotor slowing, executive dysfunction, focal cognitive deficits and motor signs. The temporal association between the cerebrovascular event and the onset of dementia should be within 3 months. Nevertheless, as VaD is variable, sometimes the temporal association cannot be demonstrated easily due to an unclear onset of vascular event. A 72-year-old man with a 6-month history of cognitive impairment and visual hallucination presented to an emergency room after repeated falls a few days ago. His wife felt that he had been slow in thinking, speaking, and performing his routine activities for a few months. On examination, he had bilateral rigidity, parkinsonian gait, and masked face. No history of medication could be elicited. The most likely diagnosis isParkinson's disease with dementia Huntington's diseaseWilson's diseaseFronto-temporal dementiaDementia with Lewy-body Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB)DLB is claimed to be the second most common type of degenerative dementia among older adults, accounting for 10-15% of cases at autopsy. The criteria for diagnosis of DLB are highly specific but not sensitive. Core clinical features are fluctuating cognitive impairment (50-75%), visual hallucinations, and parkinsonism (seen in 25-50% of patients at diagnosis). Its supportive features are repeated falls, syncope, transient loss of consciousness, neuroleptic sensitivity, systematized delusion, hallucination of other modalities, REM sleep behavior disorder, and depression. Physicians frequently encounter patients with dementia and parkinsonism, and a number of differential diagnoses should be raised such as multi-infarct dementia, normal pressure hydrocephalus, and Parkinson-plus syndrome. A 50-year-old woman presented with behavioral change over the course of two years. She had less concentration to accomplish her assigned tasks and was less responsible to her job. She had begun eating more and had gained 20 pounds in 5 months. She told lies and dirty jokes, stole office stationary, and picked up objects within reach and sight. She had poor personal hygiene and refused to take a bath. Apart from grasp, and palmomental reflexes, the physical examination did not reveal any other abnormality. Her MMSE was 29/30, but her performance on the clock drawing test was poor. Alzheimer's diseaseHuntington's diseaseWilson's diseaseFronto-temporal dementiaDementia with Lewy bodies Answer: D, Frontotemporal dementiaThe clinical features of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are described with the emphasis on prominent personality and behavioral changes with less prominent memory loss early in the course. Frequently, FTD is misdiagnosed as personality disorders or late-onset psychiatric disorders. Common behaviors and conduct disturbances are loss of personal awareness, loss of social comportment, disinhibition, impulsivity, distractibility, hyperorality (e.g., excessive eating), social withdrawal, stereotyped or preservative behavior, and speech output change (e.g., reduction of speech, stereotype of speech, and echolalia). The physical examination usually reveals early prominent primitive or frontal reflexes. 50% of patients have a family history of dementia in a first-degree relative. There are three principal varieties of FTD: frontal variant FTD (Pick's disease), semantic dementia, and progressive nonfluent aphasia. Physicians usuallymisdiagnose FTD if semantic dementia and progressive nonfluent aphasia are present because these two subtypes do not have prominen behavioral or personality disturbance like the frontal variant FTD (Pick's disease). A 61-year-old right-handed man presents with involuntary twitches of his left hand. He first noticed between 6 months and 1 year ago that when he is at rest, his left hand shakes. He can stop the shaking by looking at his hand and concentrating. The shaking does not impair his activities in any way. He has no trouble holding a glass of water. There is no tremor in his right hand, and his lower extremities are not affected. He has had no trouble walking, and there have been no falls. There have been no behavioral or language changes. On examination, a tremor of the left hand is evident when the man is distracted. His handwriting is mildly tremulous. He has bilateral cogwheel rigidity with contralateral activation, which is worse on the left. His rapid alternating movements are bradykinetic on the left. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this case?A. EpilepsyB. Guillain-Barré syndromeC. Multiple sclerosisD. Parkinson's diseaseE. Stroke Parkinson's Disease: (The tremor is of a Parkinsonian type. The patient also has the classic findings of Parkinson's disease: asymmetric tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia. Epilepsy is characterized by repeated unprovoked seizures. Hand shaking can be the result of a focal motor seizure, but the presentation overall makes epilepsy an unlikely diagnosis. Guillain-Barré syndrome is a peripheral demyelinating disease that usually presents as an ascending motor deficit. Multiple sclerosis is a central nervous system (CNS) demyelinating disease. It presents with individual episodes of CNS deficits, which usually recover to some extent. Stroke is characterized by the acute onset of a neurological deficit due to nerve infarction.

Neurofilament light chain levels correlate with clinical measures in CLN3 disease   , () CLN3 disease is a neurodegenerative disorder with onset in childhood. It affects multiple functions at different developmental stages. Incomplete understanding of the pathophysiology hampers identification of cell and tissue biochemical compounds reflective of the disease process. As treatment approaches are being explored, more sensitive, objective, quantifiable, and clinically relevant biomarkers are needed. We collected prospective biosamples from 21 phenotyped individuals with CLN3. We measured neurofilament light chain (NEFL) levels, a marker of neuronal damage, in cross-sectional CSF and serum samples from individuals with CLN3 and in pediatric non-CLN3 controls using two different assays. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum NEFL levels are significantly higher in CLN3 (CSF: 2096 ± 1202; serum: 29.0 ± 18.0 pg/mL) versus similarly aged non-CLN3 (CSF: 345 ± 610; serum: 6.7 ± 3.2 pg/mL) samples. NEFL levels correlate with Unified Batten Disease Rating Scale and adaptive behavior composite scores, and magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy markers. NEFL levels from CSF and serum are strongly correlated ( = 0.83;  < 0.0001). CSF and serum NEFL levels increase in multiple neurologic conditions. Here, we show that CSF and serum NEFL levels also increase in CLN3 (versus non-CLN3) and correlate with other disease-relevant measures. These findings suggest NEFL as a relevant and feasible biomarker for applications in CLN3 clinical trials and management. All prices are NET prices. VAT will be added later in the checkout.

Neuroimmune disorders of the central nervous system in children in the molecular era on behalf of the attendees of the International Neuroimmune Meeting , –() An to this article was published on 15 November 2018 Immune-mediated disorders of the CNS in children are a complex group of demyelinating, inflammatory, parainfectious and postinfectious disorders with heterogeneous pathobiological mechanisms and clinical manifestations, often associated with fundamental derangement in immune regulation. In this Review, we aim to provide an update on our knowledge of neuroimmune disorders and highlight areas of research that are priorities for improving clinical management. We outline the clinical features of neuroimmune disorders, the current approaches to their treatment and new approaches in development. We then consider the pathological features, including biomarkers, pathological mechanisms and genetics, and discuss the value of immune assays in clinical investigation and basic research. On the basis of current knowledge and techniques, we propose four research priorities: rigorous and consistent collection of core clinical data, cooperative investigation of treatments, development of biological assays and genetic studies. These priorities should help us to achieve the shared goal of precision medicine for neuroimmune disorders. However, multicentre research and the creation of clinical consortia for these rare disorders will be necessary, and we hope that this Review serves as a call to action that is timely given current exciting advances in neuroimmune therapeutics. Neuroimmune disorders are more prevalent than previously appreciated. Advances in assay development, genetic research, neuroimaging and clinical phenotyping have led to better characterization of the different neuroimmune disorders. Immune signatures have not been identified for all neuroimmune disorders; diagnosis in patients with these disorders relies on the clinical features of acquired neuroinflammation. Prompt diagnosis and immunomodulatory therapy have improved clinical outcomes from neuroimmune disorders, but formal consensus-based treatment protocols or protocols based on evidence from clinical trials are yet to be established. Collaborative research into the pathobiological mechanisms of neuroimmune disorders will further refine relevant treatment strategies, including targeting of key biological pathways.

a94b4c87-219b-4adc-8cfb-3d93985e3c28,"Ketogenic Diets for Adult Neurological Disorders , –() The current review highlights the evidence supporting the use of ketogenic diet therapies in the management of a growing number of neurological disorders in adults. An overview of the scientific literature supporting posited mechanisms of therapeutic efficacy is presented including effects on neurotransmission, oxidative stress, and neuro-inflammation. The clinical evidence supporting ketogenic diet use in the management of adult epilepsy, malignant glioma, Alzheimer’s disease, migraine headache, motor neuron disease, and other neurologic disorders is highlighted and reviewed. Lastly, common adverse effects of ketogenic therapy in adults, including gastrointestinal symptoms, weight loss, and transient dyslipidemia are discussed. The ketogenic diet (KD) is a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet that induces ketone body production in the liver through fat metabolism. The goal is to mimic a fasting or starvation state without depriving the body of necessary calories to sustain growth and development [, ]. The classic ketogenic diet is composed of a macronutrient ratio of 4:1 (4 grams (g) of fat to every 1 g of protein plus carbohydrates combined), thus shifting the predominant caloric source from carbohydrate to fat. Fatty acids metabolized by the liver produce the ketone bodies acetoacetate (which spontaneously converts to acetone) and β-hydroxybutyrate (Fig. ) which enter the bloodstream and are utilized by organs including the brain where they are further metabolized in mitochondria to generate energy. With ketogenic diet use, organs utilize ketone bodies as the major fuel source for the central nervous system to replace glucose. To increase flexibility and palatability, less strict KD variants have been developed (Fig. ), including lower ratio ketogenic diets, the modified Atkins diet (MAD), and combining these diets with medium-chain triglyceride oil (MCT). Ketogenic diets with lower ratios of 3:1, 2:1, or 1:1 (referred to in some studies as modified ketogenic diets) are chosen based on age, individual tolerability, goal level of ketosis, and protein requirements []. The MAD, introduced into practice in 2003, typically employs a 10 to 20-g/day net carbohydrate limit (most often 20 g in adults) which is roughly equivalent to a ratio of 1 to 2:1 of fat to protein plus carbohydrates [, ]. The MCT variant ketogenic diet incorporates medium-chain triglycerides, like capric and caproic acid (Fig. ), provided in coconut and/or palm kernel oil as a diet supplement and allows for greater carbohydrate and protein intake than even a lower ratio KD [], which can improve compliance. In addition, there is growing interest in the therapeutic use of ketogenic dietary supplements like ketone esters as a potential substitute for ketogenic diets. Although numerous studies have examined the use of ketogenic therapies for epilepsy and weight loss [, ], these diets and supplements have more recently been adopted as potential treatments of other potentially diet-sensitive neurological disorders. The current review explores the proposed mechanisms by which ketogenic therapies are thought to achieve therapeutic benefit in a variety of neurologic diseases and to describe the accumulating, predominantly clinical, evidence supporting ketogenic diet use in specific adult neurological disorders including epilepsy, malignant glioma, Alzheimer’s disease, migraine headache, and motor neuron disease. An increasing number of experimental studies demonstrate pleiotropic actions of ketone bodies and ketogenic diets []. Ketones can induce changes in neurotransmitter concentrations and release, as well as neural membrane polarity which may inhibit increased neuronal excitability. For example, studies demonstrate that ketones can open adenosine tri-phosphate (ATP)-sensitive potassium channels and slow spontaneous neuronal firing in cultured mouse hippocampal neurons [, ]. Medium-chain fatty acids (Fig. ), such as decanoic acid, may selectively inhibit AMPA receptors, as demonstrated in and models of seizure activity [,,]. Furthermore, ketone bodies acetoacetate and β-hydroxybutyrate increase the accumulation of the inhibitory neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in presynaptic vesicles in rodent models []. Rodents in a state of metabolic ketosis have been shown to exhibit lower levels of glutamate in neurons but stable amounts of GABA, which creates a shift towards inhibition []. Glutamate recycling via glutamine becomes more efficient when ketone bodies are available which can improve GABA resynthesis for inhibitory neurotransmission []. In human studies, patients treated with a ketogenic diet showed increased GABA levels in the cerebrospinal fluid and in brain tissue using magnetic resonance spectroscopy [, ]. Some studies have also suggested direct inhibition of vesicular glutamate loading by ketone bodies [] resulting in reduced glutamatergic synaptic transmission and potential interference with glutamate-mediated toxicity implicated in neuronal injury. Ketogenic therapies may also provide additional neuroprotective benefit by improving mitochondrial function. Metabolic ketosis can increase mitochondrial energy reserves while decreasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production []. Animals treated with KD exhibit stimulation of mitochondrial biogenesis, increased cerebral ATP concentrations, and lower ROS production [, ]. Another potential mechanism of action of the ketogenic diet is through modulation of intracellular signaling pathways including mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). Rodents maintained on a KD showed reduced insulin levels and reduced phosphorylation of Akt and S6, providing evidence for increased AMP-activated protein kinase signaling and decreased mTOR activation [, ]. Similarly, rodents consuming a KD exhibit time-dependent changes in mitochondrial hydrogen peroxide production and elevations in lipid peroxidation product 4-hydrocy-2-nonenal (4-HNE) levels, both of which result in enhanced activation of Nrf2—the primary transcription factor responsible for initiating the response to oxidative stress [, ]. Administration of ketone bodies can inhibit opening of the membrane permeability transition (mPT) pore, which regulates the homeostatic status of mitochondria, by raising the threshold of calcium-induced mPT []. The reduction in oxidative stress resulting from exposure to ketone bodies may also occur via genomic effects. models demonstrate that the direct application of ketones inhibits histone deactylases (HDACs) resulting in increased transcriptional activity of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) γ and upregulation of antioxidant genes [, ]. There is emerging evidence that ketone bodies exhibit systemic and neuroprotective anti-inflammatory effects []. In rodent models of neurodegenerative and neuro-inflammatory disorders, KD treatment reduces expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, microglial activation, and pain and inflammation after thermal nociception [,,]. One potential explanation for this observation is that fatty acids activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α which then inhibits the pro-inflammatory transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signal transduction pathway to downregulate expression of two key genes involved in the inflammatory response—COX2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase []. Recent studies also show that β-hydroxybutyrate may directly bind to hydroxy-carboxylic acid receptor 2 (HCA2) and/or inhibit the innate immune sensor NOD-like receptor 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome which controls the activation of caspase-1 and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18 [, , ]. Disease-Specific Effects: Evidence from Models Several preclinical studies have explored KDs and/or exogenous supplementation of ketone salts in the treatment of specific neurologic disorders including gliomas, Alzheimer’s disease, and seizure disorders. In rodent glioma models, KDs decrease serum glucose, serum insulin-like growth factor and tumor weight when administered as a stand-alone therapy. When administered in combination with glycolytic inhibitor 2-deoxy--glucose (2-DG), radiation therapy, or temozolomide, the diet also reduced peritumoral edema and tumor microvasculature and increased median survival time [,,,,,]. Thus, KDs favor a metabolic shift in malignant cells towards an anti-angiogenic, anti-invasive, pro-apoptotic, and anti-inflammatory state that contributes to suppressed tumor growth []. Potential mechanisms include enhanced cytotoxic T cell anti-tumor immunity [], attenuated insulin-activated Akt/mTOR and Ras/MAPK signaling pathways [, ], and reduced inflammation as previously described. Other proposed mechanisms include the induction of genes involved in oxidative stress protection, angiogenesis, and vascular remodeling [, , ]. studies also suggest that KDs block or improve histological and biochemical changes seen in Alzheimer’s disease pathology. Rodents treated with the ketogenic diet, exogenous β-hydroxybutyrate, and MCT display reduced brain amyloid-β levels, protection from amyloid-β toxicity, and improved mitochondrial function [,,]. Similarly, in a symptomatic mouse model of AD and in aged rats, exogenous ketone and ketogenic diet administration improved learning and memory [, ]. These observations provide insight into potential mechanisms by which AD risk and pathology may be impacted by ketogenic therapies. There has been controversy over whether the anti-seizure effect of the KD is due to ketosis as blood ketone (i.e., β-hydroxybutyrate) concentrations inconsistently correlate with seizure control amongst clinical studies [,,,,], although findings may relate to diet heterogeneity and methodological differences between studies. Rodent studies suggest that modulation of gut microbiota, by feeding or fecal transplant, may confer the anti-seizure effect of KDs. The mechanism involves microbial interactions that reduce bacterial gamma-glutamylation activity, decrease peripheral gamma-glutamylated-amino acids, and elevate bulk hippocampal GABA/glutamate ratios []. Whether similar changes in microbiome profile occur in adults with drug-resistant epilepsy and other neurologic disorders in response to KD therapy and whether particular taxonomic changes in gut microbiota correlate with treatment response remains unknown. In summary, preclinical studies support the use of KDs and/or ketone bodies to thwart or ameliorate the histologic, biochemical, and electrophysiologic changes that lead to neurologic dysfunction and disease and lay the foundation for clinical studies investigating management of these disorders in adults. Ketogenic Diets in the Management of Adult Neurological Disorders Although first recognized as an effective treatment for epilepsy nearly one century ago, the introduction of anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) supplanted interest in diet therapy until the 1990s when studies re-emerged demonstrating its efficacy in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy and particular pediatric epilepsy syndromes [,,]. Initial clinical studies and additional evidence since the turn of the century support ketogenic diet use in adult epilepsy management, with modern research reporting efficacy defined by the proportion of patients achieving ≥ 50% seizure reduction (defined as responders). A 2015 meta-analysis reviewed 12 studies using the classic KD, the MAD, and the classic KD in combination with MCT in adults with drug-resistant epilepsy. They found a combined efficacy rate of 52% for the classic KD and 34% for the MAD []. A similar 3-month responder rate of 39% was observed in an observational study of 101 adult patients naïve to diet therapy who subsequently began MAD []. Overall, intention-to-treat (ITT) data from adult observational studies demonstrate responder rates of 22 to 70% for the classic KD and 12 to 67% for the MAD [, , ], with some suggestion of increased efficacy in adults with generalized rather than focal epilepsy [, ]. Such disparate effects are supported by two recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating MAD efficacy in adults with drug-resistant epilepsy. An RCT in Iran compared the proportion of patients with focal or generalized epilepsy achieving ≥ 50% seizure reduction between 34 patients randomized to 2 months of MAD (of whom 22 completed the study) compared to 32 patients randomized to standard medical management and found 35.5% (12/34) efficacy in the MAD group (ITT analysis) at 2 months compared to 0% in the control group, a difference that was statistically significant []. In contrast, an RCT from Norway compared the change in seizure frequency in patients with drug-resistant focal or multifocal epilepsy between 37 patients randomized to 12 weeks of MAD (of whom 28 received the intervention and 24 completed the study) and 38 adults randomized to their habitual diet (of whom 34 received the intervention and 32 completed the study) []. They found a significant moderate benefit (25-50% seizure reduction) in the diet group compared to controls, but no significant difference in ≥ 50% seizure reduction between groups (no difference in the proportion of responders to diet standard medical management). Thus, additional RCTs of larger sample size are warranted to investigate MAD efficacy in different subpopulations of adult epilepsy patients. Ketogenic diets also show promise for the management of status epilepticus in adults [,,,,]. For example, of 10 adults with super-refractory status epilepticus (SRSE; status epilepticus that continues or recurs 24 h or more after the initiation of treatment with anesthetic agents to induce burst or seizure suppression) of median duration 21.5 days treated with a 4:1 or 3:1 KD, successful resolution of status epilepticus over a median of 3 days (range 1-31 days) was observed in 100% of patients who achieved ketosis (9 out of 10) [, ]. Similarly, of 15 adult patients with SRSE treated with a 4:1 ratio KD (14 of whom completed therapy) for a median of 10 days, 11 (79% of patients who completed KD therapy, 73% of all patients enrolled) achieved resolution of SRSE in a median of 5 days (range 0-10 days) []. As status epilepticus carries a high risk of morbidity and mortality [], KDs offer a needed adjunctive strategy for management with the advantages of potentially synergizing with concurrent treatments and reducing the need for prolonged use of anesthetic drugs. Malignant gliomas, the most frequently diagnosed primary brain tumors, are highly heterogeneous tumors with characteristically poor response to treatment. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive type of glioma in adults and carries an extremely poor prognosis with a median overall survival between 12 and 15 months from the time of diagnosis. The 5-year survival rate is less than 5% [, ]. Currently, GBM treatment includes maximal safe tumor resection, followed by radiotherapy and concurrent temozolomide treatment []. Other treatment strategies include managing peritumoral edema with glucocorticoids and using bevacicumab for anti-angiogenic effect. However, overall survival remains poor despite these interventions []. As tumors exhibit high rates of aerobic glycolysis followed by predominant fermentation of pyruvate to lactate despite sufficient oxygen availability [, ], malignant glioma cells critically depend on glucose as the main energy source to survive and sustain their aggressive proliferative properties []. Hyperglycemia, moreover, is a negative predictor of overall survival in GBM patients [,,,]. These findings have led researchers to investigate strategies to target glycemic modulation using ketogenic diets, caloric restriction, carbohydrate restriction, intermittent fasting, and combined diet protocols broadly classified as ketogenic metabolic therapies with mixed results. In 2010, a case report was published of an adult woman with newly diagnosed GBM who was successfully treated with a calorie-restricted ketogenic diet combined with chemotherapy and radiation after partial tumor resection. There was no evidence of residual tumor using fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after 2 months of treatment. However, tumor recurrence was detected 10 weeks after stopping diet therapy []. In 2015, a study was published describing 6 adults with newly diagnosed GBM who were treated with a KD and demonstrated reduced mean serum glucose compared to patients on a regular diet. However, 5 out of 6 showed evidence of disease by 12 months []. Similarly, 2 adults with recurrent GBM treated with a 3:1 calorie-restricted KD noted evidence of tumor progression by 12 weeks in another case series []. In the largest pilot trial to date, 20 adult patients with recurrent GBM were treated with a low (≤ 60 g/day) carbohydrate diet. Three participants discontinued the diet because of poor tolerability, 3 had stable disease after 6 weeks that lasted for 11 to 13 weeks and 1 had a minor response. Overall, patients with stable ketosis showed a trend towards an increase in survival without tumor progression []. The most durable response was observed in an adult with newly diagnosed GBM who experienced significant tumor regression 24 months following subtotal resection, calorie-restricted ketogenic diet, hyperbaric oxygen, and other targeted metabolic therapies combined []. These preliminary studies demonstrate feasibility and short-term safety of ketogenic diet therapies in the treatment of GBM. However, given the heterogeneity in study design (differences in diet protocols, combined therapies, endpoints, and outcomes measured) as well as absence of control groups, no conclusive statements can be made regarding overall efficacy compared to standard therapies. Consequently, randomized controlled trials assessing ketogenic diet efficacy on overall survival or progression-free survival in adults with GBM are needed. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of progressive dementia, affecting approximately 10% of individuals age 65 years and older. Histological hallmarks include hippocampal neuronal death, extracellular amyloid-β peptide deposition, and intracellular tau protein neurofibrillary tangles. Defects in mitochondrial and respiratory chain function may alter amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing, resulting in pathogenic amyloid-β fragment production []. Progressive cognitive degeneration in patients with AD has been linked to reduced uptake and metabolism of glucose []. Studies demonstrate that asymptomatic individuals with genetic risk factors for AD or a positive family history show reduced glucose uptake in prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate, entorhinal cortex, and hippocampal tissue compared to normal-risk individuals using FDG-PET. Furthermore, reduction in glucose uptake in these regions correlates with glucose transporter GLUT1 downregulation in the brain of individuals with AD [, ]. High-glycemic diets are associated with greater cerebral amyloid burden [] and increased insulin resistance can contribute to the development of sporadic AD [, ]. Therefore, clinical investigators hypothesize that reducing dietary intake of high-glycemic foods may prevent cerebral amyloid accumulation and reduce AD risk. In an early RCT published in 2004, the investigators randomized 20 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD to receive a single oral dose of either a medium-chain triglyceride supplement or placebo on different days. Serum ketone levels increased following MCT ingestion, but only patients without the apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele showed enhanced short-term cognitive performance on a screening tool of attention, memory, language, and praxis, whereas patients with the allele did not []. These findings were replicated in a study of 19 elderly patients without dementia who received an MCT supplement and exhibited similar improvements in working memory, visual attention, and task switching []. A third RCT comparing response to a very restricted (5-10%) or liberal (50%) carbohydrate intake diet over 6 weeks in adults with MCI showed an improvement in verbal memory performance. This improvement correlated with serum ketone concentrations in the carbohydrate restricted group []. A 2015 case report demonstrated that a patient with AD using ketone monoester (R)-3-hydroxybutyl (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate (Fig. ) supplementation over 20 months without altering their diet displayed improved cognitive and daily activity performance as well as diurnal elevations in circulating serum β-hydroxybutyrate levels []. In a single-arm pilot study of 15 patients with mild-moderate AD, 9 out of 10 compliant patients that completed 3 months of treatment with a ≥ 1:1 ratio KD combined with MCT demonstrated improved Alzheimer’s disease Assessment Scale—cognitive subscale scores []. Interestingly, two subsequent randomized studies of MCT or a ketogenic product compared to placebo for 3 to 6 months as well as an observational study administering a ketogenic meal over 3 months reported that the cognitive benefit of ketogenic therapies was greatest in patients who did not have the APOE ε4 allele [, ]. In the observational study, cognitive improvement was limited to APOE ε4 negative patients with mild AD only []. A recent study of patients with mild-moderate AD treated with 1 month of MCT supplements demonstrated an increase in brain C-acetoacetate PET uptake, suggesting ketones from MCT can compensate for the brain glucose deficit observed in AD []. In sum, the preliminary clinical evidence suggests that ketogenic therapies including ketogenic diets and/or supplements designed to induce metabolic ketosis may improve cognitive outcomes in patients with AD. However, APOE ε4 genotype and the degree of disease progression may impact response to metabolic ketosis. Migraine headache is a primary disorder of brain excitatory-inhibitory imbalance leading to the periodic activation and sensitization of the trigemino-vascular pain pathway. Experimental evidence suggests that the ketogenic diet may act at different stages of migraine pathophysiology to restore brain metabolism and excitability and counteract inflammatory and oxidative mechanisms []. For example, a MCT KD administered to rodents reduced the propagation of cortical spreading depression, the neurophysiological event underpinning migraine aura []. Although a clinical case series of KD use in migraine dates back to 1928 with improvement observed in 39% of cases [], more recent studies including 2 case reports and 2 prospective studies demonstrate KD effectiveness for migraine prophylaxis in adults with benefit ranging from reduction in attack frequency and intensity to migraine cessation [,,,]. Notably, all but 8 of the 117 patients in these collective studies were overweight and treated with a hypocaloric (≤ 800 kcal) ketogenic diet. However, in the larger prospective study comparing 96 patients treated with either a hypocaloric ketogenic diet (≤ 30 g/day carbohydrates) or a nonketogenic standard weight-loss diet during the 1st month of a 6-month dietary treatment, overweight migraineurs treated with the KD showed a significant reduction in attack frequency and analgesic use during the 1st month of the study followed by a modest worsening of migraine control when patients were gradually transitioned to a standard diet over the remaining 5 months of the study. As weight loss was observed in both the KD treatment arm and the control arm and the change in weight persisted for the full 6 month of the study, the early headache benefit achieved with the ketogenic diet appears to be independent of weight-loss []. The smaller prospective study included 8 normal weight patients with migraine treated with a normocaloric KD (≤ 15 g/day carbohydrates) who appeared to experience the same reduction in migraine frequency and duration after 1 month of treatment exhibited by their 10 overweight peers treated with a hypocaloric KD, but small sample size did not allow for subgroup analyses []. A recent single arm clinical trial evaluating the effect of 12 weeks of MAD (10 g/day carbohydrate limit the 1st month and 20 to 30 g/day carbohydrate limit thereafter) in 18 patients with chronic cluster headache demonstrated either full resolution of headache or at least 50% reduction in attack frequency in 83% (15/18) [], suggesting the potential benefit of KDs for prophylaxis of other headache phenotypes that share similar mechanisms with migraine headache. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the degeneration of motor neurons in the spinal cord and brain which leads to progressive motor weakness and ultimately death 2 to 5 years from symptom onset due to respiratory failure []. Posited mechanisms of motor neuron degeneration include glutamate excitotoxicity, abnormal protein aggregation, impaired axonal transport, inflammation, oxidative stress, and abnormalities in energy metabolism []. Altered glucose uptake has been observed in the brain and spinal cord of ALS patients as well as disturbances in energy metabolism [,,,]. Approaches targeting the metabolic impairments found in ALS through the use of alternative fuels include the Deanna Protocol (a collection of arginine α-ketoglutarate, medium-chain triglycerides, vitamins, and antioxidants), specific medium-chain triglycerides (trioctanoin and triheptanoin) (Fig. ), and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase inhibitors [, ]. Although these have yet to be studied clinically for ALS, preclinical work in rodent ALS models suggests that these approaches improve mitochondrial metabolism, reduce motor neuron toxicity, improve or delay motor symptoms/disease progression, and in some cases extend survival [,,,,]. Controlled clinical trials investigating these approaches are warranted. Recent studies have begun to explore the use of ketogenic therapies in other adult neurological and psychiatric disorders including Parkinson’s disease, traumatic and ischemic brain and spinal cord injury, mood disorders, and multiple sclerosis. Preclinical work has demonstrated regeneration in motor or cognitive performance with ketogenic therapies in rodent models of neurologic disease. In one study, KD administration improved forelimb motor function in rodents after spinal cord injury with maintenance of the functional benefits when returning to a standard diet after 12 weeks []. KD administration for 7 days following traumatic brain injury in adolescent rats improved recovery of memory function with several studies suggesting a possible age-dependent effect and an underlying mechanism of reduced alterations in cell metabolism and cell death [,,]. KD and ketone body administration have also been shown to protect dopaminergic neurons from degeneration and improve motor function in rodent models of Parkinson’s disease via mechanisms that include improved mitochondrial function and ATP production [,,,]. A pilot study of the use of a KD for 4 weeks in patients with Parkinson’s disease showed a global enhancement in the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale, which included motor function, in the 5 patients who completed the study []. Ketogenic diets have also been shown to significantly dampen motor disability and memory dysfunction by preventing inflammation and enhancing neuroprotection in a murine model of multiple sclerosis (MS) []. A single randomized pilot trial has been reported assessing the safety and feasibility of 6 months of ketogenic diet (< 50 g of carbohydrates/day) therapy compared to standard diet therapy in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis []. The authors concluded that the KD is safe, feasible with 90% compliance, and potentially effective as the KD cohort displayed clinically meaningful improvements in health-related quality of life (HRQOL) summary scale scores as well as a mild reduction in expanded disability scale status []. Recent clinical evidence suggests that the impaired colonic microbiome function observed in patients with multiple sclerosis is normalized by 6 months of ketogenic diet therapy; however, as no specific microbiome pattern was apparent and shifts in bacterial populations were multidirectional, the precise role for microbiome changes in MS pathology remains unclear []. Further clinical studies including imaging outcomes, blinded clinical trials, and immune assays are warranted to better define KD efficacy in these conditions. Interestingly, several studies in adults receiving diet therapy for epilepsy have reported benefits of KD treatment beyond seizure control. These include improvements in arousal, mood, alertness, energy, and concentration [,,]. Furthermore, quality of life scores tend to increase rather than decrease with diet therapy []. Thus, the potential benefits of KDs may extend further than the primary neurologic disorder and also impact comorbid psychiatric and other medical conditions. Ketogenic Diet Adverse Effects and Contraindications in Adults As ketogenic diets are being utilized with increasing frequency for adult neurologic disorders, recognition and management of potential adverse effects and contraindications must be considered. The adverse effects most often reported by adults on ketogenic diets for the treatment of epilepsy are weight loss, gastrointestinal effects, and a transient increase in lipids. In clinical studies of KD use in other neurological disorders in adults, similar side effects have been reported although a true estimate of prevalence in these populations is difficult due to the small number of participants, often with lack of control groups for comparison, short duration of follow up, reliance on self-report of adverse effects in some studies, and heterogeneity in KD therapy applied [, ]. Gastrointestinal side effects can include constipation, diarrhea (typically with MCT supplementation), nausea, vomiting, and rarely pancreatitis (KD therapies are therefore contraindicated in acute pancreatitis). The side effects can improve with continued diet use and with minor adjustments, rarely necessitating pharmaceutical intervention or diet discontinuation. Strategies utilized by dietitians and nutritionists include recommending multiple small meals throughout the day; increasing fiber, sodium, and fluid intake; and daily exercise. When used, gradual introduction of MCT may reduce gastrointestinal side effects. Given that many adults with neurologic disorders are overweight or obese, weight loss may be a welcomed effect, and for those who are normal or underweight and wish to maintain or gain weight, regulation and monitoring of caloric intake is recommended. Anorexia is a contraindication to using KD therapies. Fasting serum total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol have been shown to increase in adults with epilepsy after initiation of a ketogenic diet and then normalize with continued treatment (after approximately 1 year) or after cessation of treatment [, , ]. Although the influence of ketogenic diets on cholesterol levels and other markers of cardiovascular disease in adults with neurologic disorders is limited, some reports note improvements in weight, body mass index (BMI) and triglyceride level but a shift in predominant LDL particle size in adults with epilepsy on long-term (at least 12 months) MAD compared to controls [], whereas other reports note no difference in blood lipid parameters, BMI, blood pressure, or carotid artery thickness after 10 years of KD use []. More extensive evidence of ketogenic diet impact on cardiovascular health in adults has been garnered from studies of weight loss comparing low-carbohydrate to low-fat diets. For example, meta-analysis and systemic reviews of randomized controlled trials exploring the effect of a ketogenic or low-carbohydrate diet on cardiovascular risk in overweight or obese participants have generally noted positive effects on cardiovascular health measures with noted reductions in weight, BMI, blood pressure, and triglycerides, no significant change in LDL, and in some instances increased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol [,,]. However, it is worth noting that the macronutrient composition of these low-carbohydrate diets ranged from the traditional Atkins diet (which typically involves a ≤ 20 g/day carbohydrate restriction at induction) to diets permissive of carbohydrate intake of 50 g/day or 30 to 40% of caloric intake. Thus, the effect of more restrictive ketogenic diets on cardiovascular health measures should be further explored in adults of normal weight and with neurological disorders []. Elevated fasting lipids prior to KD therapy are not an absolute contraindication to treatment although they should be closely monitored. Vitamin and mineral deficiencies can also occur when restricting carbohydrates and supplementing with a recommended daily allowance of a multivitamin and minerals can prevent these. This is of particular importance in postmenopausal women and adults that are not ambulatory as prolonged ketonemia can cause osteopenia and osteoporosis through mechanisms that are poorly understood and require further investigation [, , ]. Lastly, as with any therapy, potential interactions with other treatments are important to consider. Basic management principles (e.g., minimizing carbohydrates and sugar additives in medications, parental and intravenous fluids) are necessary in order to avoid inadvertently bringing the patient out of ketosis. Still, clinical data supporting significant pharmacodynamic or pharmacokinetic interactions between KDs and pharmacological drugs is limited. A recent RCT in adults showed that serum concentrations of AEDs decreased by 16% in the diet group compared to controls ( < 0.0001), including one participant in whom serum concentration of zonisamide decreased 41% and carbamazepine decreased 21%. This patient had an increase in seizures following MAD initiation by greater than 200% []. From the pediatric epilepsy literature, serum levels of the most commonly used AEDs, with the exception of valproic acid, do not appear to be significantly altered with concomitant KD use [,,]. Valproic acid use in rare cases has also interfered with the development of ketosis and contributed to the worsening of secondary carnitine deficiency (which can occur with either KD or valproic acid use), so close monitoring of ketosis and carnitine level is advised and carnitine supplementation is recommended if a deficiency is observed [, ]. As the ketogenic diet can also lead to an asymptomatic metabolic acidosis, particularly early after initiation, caution has been advised for concomitant use of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (acetazolamide, topiramate, and zonisamide) which may worsen acidosis. There is a theoretical higher risk of kidney stones when KDs are combined with carbonic anhydrate inhibitors, as both have been independently associated with nephrolithiasis [, ], and increased risk in combination-therapy populations has been demonstrated for zonisamide in some studies of pediatric patients [], whereas not others []. Although dose adjustments for the majority of AEDs are not typically merited, if clinical concern for a medication side effect arises, plasma AED levels should be monitored and adjustments in KD ratio considered []. A similar strategy is warranted for any medication used in combination with KD therapy. Although the neurological conditions described in this review have distinct underlying pathologies, many are caused by a disruption in energy metabolism and exhibit evidence of increased oxidative stress and neuro-inflammation. Diet manipulation could alter the course and outcomes of these and other neurologic disorders that share common pathways. Extensive preclinical work supports the use of metabolic ketosis induced by ketogenic diets and/or exogenous ketone ingestion to prevent or slow progression of physiologic, histological, and biochemical changes leading to neurodegeneration. The scientific evidence presented here from clinical studies of adults with a wide variety of neurological disorders supports KD therapy (as highlighted in Table ), with the strongest evidence supporting use in epilepsy, Alzheimer’s disease, migraine headache, and glioma, although further clinical investigation using randomized, blinded KD trials in large populations, and in patient subpopulations where feasible, is warranted.

9f6568ae-1f6d-42a9-aafc-43c12c0c10bd,"Recent Advances in Cannabinoid Physiology and Pathology Recent Advances in Cannabinoid Physiology and Pathology Part of the book series (AEMB, volume 1162) The Cannabis plant has been used for many of years as a medicinal agent in the relief of pain and seizures. It contains approximately 540 natural compounds including more than 100 that have been identified as phytocannabinoids due to their shared chemical structure. The predominant psychotropic component is Δ-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ-THC), while the major non-psychoactive ingredient is cannabidiol (CBD). These compounds have been shown to be partial agonists or antagonists at the prototypical cannabinoid receptors, CB1 and CB2. The therapeutic actions of Δ-THC and CBD include an ability to act as analgesics, anti-emetics, anti-inflammatory agents, anti-seizure compounds and as protective agents in neurodegeneration. However, there is a lack of well-controlled, double blind, randomized clinical trials to provide clarity on the efficacy of either Δ-THC or CBD as therapeutics. Moreover, the safety concerns regarding the unwanted side effects of Δ-THC as a psychoactive agent preclude its widespread use in the clinic. The legalization of cannabis for medicinal purposes and for recreational use in some regions will allow for much needed research on the pharmacokinetics and pharmocology of medical cannabis. This brief review focuses on the use of cannabis as a medicinal agent in the treatment of pain, epilepsy and neurodegenerative diseases. Despite the paucity of information, attention is paid to the mechanisms by which medical cannabis may act to relieve pain and seizures. transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily A, member 1 transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily V, member 1 transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily V, member 2 This is a preview of subscription content, to check access.

Depression und Lebensqualität bei Patienten mit amyotropher Lateralsklerose Depression und Lebensqualität bei Patienten mit amyotropher Lateralsklerose Depression and Quality of Life in Patients With Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Dtsch Arztebl 2008; 105(23): ; DOI: 10.3238/arztebl.2008.0397 ; ; ; ; Die Diskussion, lebensbeendende Maßnahmen für schwer beeinträchtigte Patienten zu erleichtern, wird lauter. In zwei Studien untersuchten die Autoren Affektlage und Lebensqualität von Patienten mit amyotropher Lateralsklerose (ALS). In zwei verschiedenen Studien mit unterschiedlichen Fragestellungen wurde die Depressionsrate und Lebensqualität von ALS-Patienten zum einen longitudinal und zum anderen im Vergleich zu gesunden Personen untersucht. Zwischen physischen Einschränkungen aufgrund von ALS und Depression oder Lebensqualität ergab sich kein Zusammenhang. Je geringer die Schulbildung war, desto höher war die durchschnittliche Schwere der Depression. Die Lebensqualität der ALS-Patienten unterschied sich nicht wesentlich von gesunden Kontrollpersonen; Depressionen waren vergleichsweise selten. Nur wenige ALS-Patienten entscheiden sich für lebensverlängernde Maßnahmen wie invasive Beatmung, häufig aufgrund einer erwarteten schlechten Lebensqualität. Unsere Daten zeigen, dass eine befriedigende Lebensqualität ohne depressive Symptomatik in jedem Stadium der ALS möglich ist. Dtsch Arztebl 2008; 105(23): 397–403 DOI: 10.3238/arztebl.2008.0397 Depression, Ateminsuffizienz, amyotrophe Lateralsklerose, Sterbehilfe, Lebensqualität In Gesprächen mit Patienten, Angehörigen, Ärzten und Pflegepersonal zeichnet sich häufig ab, dass sie nicht wissen, wie die emotionale Situation von Patienten mit schweren motorischen Einschränkungen im Allgemeinen und Patienten mit amyotropher Lateralsklerose (ALS) tatsächlich ist. Ganzini und Block () vermuten einen psychologischen Abwehrmechanismus. Einer gesunden Person scheint es schwer zu fallen, sich vorzustellen, wie das Empfinden und Erleben eines schwer beeinträchtigten Patienten verläuft. Es wird meist eine niedrige Lebensqualität angenommen (). Trotz fehlender Gewissheit werden Entscheidungen über lebensbeendende Maßnahmen oft von Ärzten und Angehörigen getroffen oder zumindest stark beeinflusst (, ). Es gibt Hinweise, dass in den Niederlanden heute jeder fünfte ALS-Patient durch Euthanasie oder assistierten Suizid verstirbt () und auch in Deutschland werden die Stimmen für eine Lockerung der Gesetzeslage für aktive Sterbehilfe, auch für ALS-Patienten im terminalen Stadium, zur Verkürzung der sogenannten Leidenszeit lauter (). Diese Tatsache legt die Dringlichkeit der Untersuchung von Lebensqualität und Affektstörungen von ALS-Patienten nahe. Gegenstand der vorliegenden Untersuchung war daher die Frage, ob ALS-Patienten depressiv verstimmt sind und eine Einschränkung ihrer Lebensqualität im Verlauf ihrer Erkrankung erfahren. Die Ergebnisse werden in Relation zu gesunden Kontrollpersonen und anderen Patientengruppen ohne schwere motorische Einschränkungen diskutiert. Die Studie soll helfen zu verstehen, was ein Leben mit schweren motorischen Einschränkungen bedeuten kann. In einem ersten Untersuchungsabschnitt (I) wurden ALS-Patienten in allen Krankheitsstadien zur Affektlage (depressive Symptomatik) und subjektiv empfundener Lebensqualität (sLQ) im Verlauf der Erkrankung zum Zeitpunkt T1 und T2 (T2 90 ± 10 Tage nach T1; T1 n = 39 und T2 n = 30) untersucht. Eine mögliche depressive Symptomatik wurde mit dem ALS-Depressions-Inventar (ADI-12) (, ) als metrisches Maß der selbstberichteten Affektlage ermittelt. Es waren Werte im Bereich 12 = keine Anzeichen von depressiver Symptomatik bis 48 = höchster Depressionswert möglich. Bei einem Wert von > 28 bestand eine klinisch relevante depressive Symptomatik (DS). Die sLQ wurde mit dem Schedule for the Evaluation of Individual Quality of Life Direct Weight, SEIQoL-DW, erfasst. Es müssen fünf Bereiche genannt werden, die die Lebensqualität bestimmen (Nennung 0 = nein, 1 = ja), und dann die Zufriedenheit mit diesen Bereichen in Prozent angegeben werden. Aus diesen Angaben wird der Seiqol-Index-Score in Prozent (SIS) ermittelt (, ) (eZusatzinfortmation). Außerdem wurden erhoben: Funktionelle Einschränkungen („ALS functional rating scale“, ALS-FRS [e3], möglicher Bereich 0 = locked-in Zustand bis 40 = keine funktionelle Einschränkung). Im folgenden Text entspricht leichte bis mittelschwere körperliche Einschränkung einer ALS-FRS > 15, schwere körperliche Einschränkung entspricht einer ALS-FRS < 15. Außerdem wurde die Zeit seit Diagnose und Schulbildung erhoben (). In einem zweiten Untersuchungsabschnitt (II) wurde eine weitere Gruppe von ALS-Patienten in Bezug auf sLQ (SEIQoL-DW [e2]) mit gesunden Kontrollen verglichen. Des Weiteren wurden die funktionelle Einschränkung der Patienten (ALS-FRS) und die Zeit seit Diagnosestellung erfasst. Zur Prüfung der linearen Korrelation von depressiver Symptomatik (ADI-12, metrisch) und den metrischen Skalen der funktionellen Einschränkungen (ALS-FRS), der Diagnosedauer, der Schulbildung und der Lebensqualität (SIS) wurde die Pearson-Korrelation ermittelt. Der Signifikanztest auf Gruppenunterschiede von beobachteten Merkmalen (Nennung der Lebensqualitätsbereiche) zwischen zwei unabhängigen Variablen, die dichotom betrachtet wurden (Gruppen: klinisch relevante DS mit ADI-12 > 28 versus keiner DS mit ADI-12 < 28; leicht bis mittelschwer mit ALS-FRS > 15 versus schwer körperlich eingeschränkt mit ALS-FRS < 15), erfolgte anhand eines Chi2-Tests. Der Unterschied zweier unabhängiger Variablen bezüglich einer abhängigen Variablen wurde mittels Students t-Test auf Signifikanz geprüft. Entsprechend wurden Gruppenunterschiede in den Angaben zur Lebensqualität (SIS) mit Zwischensubjektfaktor Beatmungsgruppe (beatmet versus nicht beatmet) geprüft. Den Unterschied mehrerer unabhängiger Variablen bezüglich einer abhängigen Variablen prüften die Autoren mittels einer univariaten Varianzanalyse auf Signifikanz. Entsprechend wurden Gruppenunterschiede in den Angaben zur Lebensqualität (SIS, Nennung und Zufriedenheit der sLQ) mit Zwischensubjektfaktor (ALS-Patienten versus gesunde Kontrollen) ermittelt. Die statistische Analyse erfolgte mit SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) für Windows Version 14.0. Das Signifikanzniveau wurde zweiseitig geprüft und mit p = 0,05 angenommen. Die Effektstärke wurde mit Eta2 angegeben. Die Datenanalyse erfolgte sowohl hypothesengeleitet (Unabhängigkeit Depression/sLQ und körperliche Einschränkung) als auch explorativ. Studie I: Affektlage und Lebensqualität von ALS-Patienten im Verlauf der Erkrankung Selbstberichtete Affektlage – Insgesamt zeigten 28 % der ALS-Patienten (T1 11/39) eine klinisch relevante depressive Symptomatik (ADI-12 > 28) (Tabelle 1). Interaktion der selbstberichteten Affektlage – ALS-Patienten zum Zeitpunkt T1 zeigten keinen korrelativen Zusammenhang von depressiver Symptomatik (ADI-12) und dem Ausmaß körperlicher Beeinträchtigung (ALS-FRS; r = -0,017, p = 0,920) () oder Diagnosedauer (Monate; r = 0,18, p = 0,267). Bei ALS-Patienten (T1) waren depressive Symptomatik (ADI-12) und kürzere Schulbildung signifikant korreliert (r = -0,41, p = 0,005). Subjektiv empfundene Lebensqualität (sLQ), SIS – ALS-Patienten berichteten zu beiden Zeitpunkten über eine Lebensqualität, die im Bereich anderer chronisch erkrankter Patienten ohne schwere motorische Einschränkungen lag (SIS; aufgrund fehlender Originaldaten aus der Literatur ist hier kein quantitativer Vergleich möglich (, ) (Tabelle 1). Nennungen sLQ –ALS-Patienten mit DS (T1 11/39 ADI-12 > 28) nannten signifikant häufiger Gesundheit (Nennung 9/11; Chi2 = 6,72, p = 0,010, Eta2 = 0,42) und Mobilität (Nennung 6/11; Chi2 = 4,07, p = 0,044, Eta2 = 0,32) als Bereiche, die die Lebensqualität bestimmen, im Vergleich zu ALS-Patienten ohne DS (T1 28/39 ADI-12 = 28; Nennung Gesundheit 10/28; Mobilität 6/28). ALS-Patienten ohne DS nannten signifikant häufiger persönliches Wohlbefinden (Nennung 8/28; Chi2 = 3,95, p = 0,047, Eta2 = 0,32) (), was kein ALS-Patient mit DS nannte. Stark körperlich eingeschränkte ALS-Patienten (T1 16/39 ALS-FRS < 15) nannten signifikant häufiger Kommunikation (Nennung 7/16; Chi2 = 5,93, p = 0,029, Eta2 = 0,39) und medizinische Betreuung (Nennung 10/16; Chi2 = 9,36, p = 0,002, Eta2 = 0,49) als Bereiche, die die Lebensqualität bestimmen, im Vergleich zu leicht bis mittelschwer eingeschränkten Patienten (T1 23/39 ALS-FRS > 15; Nennung 0/23 Kommunikation, 0/23 medizinische Betreuung). Interaktion der subjektiven Lebensqualität (sLQ) – ALS-Patienten (T1) zeigten einen signifikanten negativen korrelativen Zusammenhang der sLQ (SIS) und der ADI-12-Depressionswerte (ADI-12; r = -0,36, p = 0,027). Je geringer der Depressionsscore, desto höher ist die Lebensqualität. Bei ALS-Patienten zeigte sich im Verlauf der Erkrankung (T2) ein signifikanter korrelativer Zusammenhang der subjektiv empfundenen Lebensqualität (SIS) und dem Ausmaß körperlicher Beeinträchtigung (ALS-FRS; r = -0,43, p = 0,021). Das Vorzeichen der Korrelation war jedoch negativ, das heißt je stärker die körperliche Beeinträchtigung war, desto höher waren die Lebensqualitätswerte. Beatmete Patienten (T1; invasiv und nicht invasiv 17/39; SIS) wiesen keine signifikant unterschiedliche sLQ im Vergleich zu nicht beatmeten Patienten (22/39; SIS, t = -0,75, p = 0,461) auf. Im Verlauf der Erkrankung (T2) zeigten beatmete Patienten (13/30; SIS) eine signifikant höhere Lebensqualität als nicht beatmete ALS-Patienten (17/30; SIS, t = 2,20, p = 0,035). Studie II: Vergleich der Lebensqualität von ALS-Patienten mit der von gesunden Kontrollpersonen Subjektiv empfundene Lebensqualität (sLQ) – Im zweiten Untersuchungsabschnitt (II) mit einer weiteren Gruppe von ALS-Patienten mit leichten bis mittelschweren körperlichen Einschränkungen und gesunden Kontrollpersonen ergab sich im statistischen Vergleich der Lebensqualität kein signifikanter Unterschied zwischen den beiden Gruppen (SIS, Testgröße der Varianz F = 0,11, p = 0,745, Eta2 < 0,01) (). Nennungen bei der subjektiven Lebensqualität – ALS-Patienten (II) nannten Freunde und Soziales signifikant häufiger als Bereich, der die Lebensqualität bestimmt als gesunde Kontrollen (Nennung; F = 4,03, p = 0,050, Eta2 = 0,07) (), wohingegen Beruf und Finanzen signifikant seltener genannt wurde (Nennung; F = 8,29, p = 0,006, Eta2 = 0,12). ALS-Patienten waren signifikant zufriedener mit dem Bereich Familie im Vergleich zu Gesunden (Zufriedenheit; F = 16,78, p < 0,001, Eta2 = 0,26), für die Gesundheit ergab sich eine signifikant erniedrigte Zufriedenheit für ALS-Patienten im Vergleich zu Gesunden (Zufriedenheit; F = 8,79, p = 0,005, Eta2 = 0,18). ALS und Affektlage Verschiedene Studien zeigen eine große Varianz der Prävalenz depressiver Symptomatik bei Patienten mit ALS von 0 % () bis 44 % (, ). In der vorliegenden Studie zeigten 28 % der ALS-Patienten eine klinisch relevante depressive Symptomatik; dies ist im Einklang mit der Mehrzahl der anderen Studien (im Mittel 24 bis 28 %) (–). Die wenigen Studien, die Depression anhand des strukturierten klinischen Interviews nach DSM-IV () diagnostizieren, berichten übereinstimmend über Prävalenzen von 9 bis 11 % (–) (dies entspricht 11 % für dieselben ALS-Patienten wie zu T1 der vorliegenden Studie [7]). Damit liegt die Depressionsprävalenz nach DSM-IV bei der ALS leicht über der Häufigkeit in der gesunden Bevölkerung (4 bis 5 %) (), jedoch unter der von Patienten mit Multipler Sklerose (17 bis 46 %) (, ). Die Diskrepanz der Depressionsprävalenz in ALS-Studien ist unter anderem darauf zurückzuführen, dass das klinische Interview nach DSM-IV als Fremdbeurteilungsverfahren sowohl die momentane Affektlage als auch depressive Episoden vor Diagnosestellung erfasst. Im Gegensatz dazu misst der ADI-12 als Screeningtest in der vorliegenden Studie die selbstberichtete momentane Affektlage und ergibt daher bei geringerer Spezifität meist deutlich höhere Depressionsraten. In unserer Untersuchung wurde bei ALS-Patienten kein Zusammenhang von depressiver Symptomatik und dem Ausmaß körperlicher Beeinträchtigung oder Diagnosedauer gefunden. Dies konnte auch in anderen Studien gezeigt werden (, , –). Im Gegensatz dazu konnte für Karzinompatienten ein Zusammenhang von depressiver Symptomatik und körperlicher Beeinträchtigung nachgewiesen werden (). Es wurde ein signifikanter Zusammenhang zwischen Schulbildung der ALS-Patienten und der Schwere depressiver Symptomatik gefunden; je höher der Schulabschluss desto geringer der Depressionswert. Dieser Zusammenhang könnte darauf hindeuten, dass Menschen mit höherer Schulbildung mehr Möglichkeiten zur Verfügung stehen funktionale Bewältigungsstrategien zu entwickeln. Der ausbleibende Anstieg der Depressionsrate bei steigender funktioneller Einschränkung und Diagnosedauer kann das häufig vorgebrachte Argument nicht bestätigen, die emotionale Belastung und damit die depressive Verstimmung nähme durch die fortschreitende körperliche Erkrankung in jedem Fall zu. Tatsächlich gibt es depressive Episoden in jedem Krankheitsstadium der ALS, die durch pharmakologische und psychotherapeutische Maßnahmen beeinflussbar sind (). Einen fatalistischen Zusammenhang zwischen der Diagnose ALS und Depression zu postulieren, entbehrt einer empirischen Grundlage (). ALS und Lebensqualität In mehreren Untersuchungen berichteten ALS-Patienten über eine zum Teil erstaunlich hohe subjektiv empfundene Lebensqualität trotz ihrer starken physischen Einschränkungen (, ). Auch in der aktuellen Studie lag die mittlere subjektive Lebensqualität der ALS-Patienten bei 66 bis 72 % und damit in einem Bereich vergleichbar mit gesunden Kontrollpersonen. Bei ALS-Patienten wurden meist wenige bis keine Zusammenhänge zwischen subjektiver Lebensqualität und körperlicher Beeinträchtigung sowie dem Zeitraum seit Diagnosestellung gefunden (, , , , , ). In der vorliegenden Studie wurde sogar die subjektive Lebensqualität im Verlauf der Erkrankung höher, je größer das Ausmaß an körperlicher Beeinträchtigung war. Beatmete Patienten wiesen eine höhere sLQ auf als nicht beatmete ALS-Patienten. Dies kann man mit den symptomatischen Effekten der Beatmung wie zum Beispiel der Reduktion der Tagesmüdigkeit erklären. Die Daten der Autoren legen nahe, dass eine subjektiv als hoch empfundene Lebensqualität auch im fortgeschrittenen Stadium der ALS möglich ist. Die subjektive Lebensqualität der ALS-Patienten in den Untersuchungen der Autoren lag in einem vergleichbaren Bereich wie bei chronisch erkrankten Patienten ohne schwere motorische Einschränkungen in verschiedenen anderen Untersuchungen (sLQ etwa 70 %) (, , ). Im Gegensatz dazu erreichen Karzinompatienten in einem fortgeschrittenen Krankheitsstadium sLQ-Werte (< 60 %) (, ), die im direkten Vergleich zu ALS-Patienten signifikant niedriger sind () und mit steigender körperlicher Einschränkung sinken (, ). Diese Daten lassen darauf schließen, dass ALS-Patienten trotz der besonderen Schwere der Erkrankung im Vergleich zu anderen Patienten (bei keiner der anderen berichteten Erkrankungen treten regelhaft vergleichbare Lähmungen auf) () bemerkenswerterweise eine subjektiv empfundene vergleichbare bis signifikant höhere Lebensqualität zeigen. Über die Ursachen dieser besonderen Stellung der ALS-Patienten relativ zu anderen Patienten kann bisher lediglich spekuliert werden. Depression war bei ALS-Patienten dieser Studie mit einer negativen subjektiven Lebensqualität assoziiert, was den engen Zusammenhang von Affektlage und Lebensqualität bestätigt (). Depressive ALS-Patienten scheinen sich mehr über externale, für sie nicht mehr erreichbare Lebensbereiche wie Gesundheit und Mobilität, zu definieren. Hingegen sind für nicht depressive ALS-Patienten internale Lebensbereiche, wie persönliches Wohlbefinden, das auch im Verlauf der Krankheit erhalten bleiben kann, wichtiger. Entsprechend der vorliegenden Studiendaten bestätigten auch Neudert und Kollegen, dass ALS-Patienten ihre Prioritäten in Bezug auf die Lebensqualität auf soziale Aspekte verschieben (). In der Studie der Autoren nannten ALS-Patienten Freunde und Soziales signifikant häufiger als Bereich, der die Lebensqualität bestimmt als Gesunde, wohingegen Beruf und Finanzen signifikant seltener genannt wurden. Sie waren außerdem signifikant zufriedener mit der Familie. Im Verlauf der ALS gewannen spezifische Bereiche an Bedeutung für die subjektive Lebensqualität, je stärker die körperliche Beeinträchtigung wurde. Kommunikation und medizinische Betreuung wurden signifikant häufiger von stark eingeschränkten ALS-Patienten genannt, im Vergleich zu leicht bis mittelschwer eingeschränkten Patienten, die diese Bereiche gar nicht nannten. Die Daten geben Hinweise auf erfolgreiche Anpassungsstrategien der ALS-Patienten in Bezug auf Bedürfnisse und Prioritäten entsprechend der Lebensumstände des Krankheitsstadiums. Mögliche Nachteile der Stichproben der vorgestellten Studie könnten die fehlende Repräsentativität und die Stichprobengrößen in den zwei unterschiedlichen Untersuchungsabschnitten I und II sein. Die durchgeführte Befragung von schwerst körperlich eingeschränkten Patienten erlaubt kaum größere Studienpopulationen. Patienten ohne Kontakt zu den beteiligten ALS-Klinikambulanzen werden von solchen Studien ebenso wenig erfasst, wie diejenigen, die sich nicht für solche Studien interessieren. Trotz dieser möglichen Einschränkungen bleibt das Ergebnis bemerkenswert, dass weder die Höhe der sLQ noch die Depressivität bedeutend mit der körperlichen Einschränkung zusammenhingen. Die hier vorgestellten Studien sowie Daten aus der Literatur haben Konsequenzen für den Umgang mit ALS-Patienten auch im Bezug auf Diskussionen zur Sterbehilfe. Die in dem vorliegenden Artikel beschriebenen Ergebnisse bezüglich subjektiver Lebensqualität und depressiver Symptomatik bei ALS-Patienten in frühen wie in späten Stadien widersprechen dem weit verbreiteten Urteil des besonderen Leidens von schwer körperlich beeinträchtigten Patienten. Der Entscheidung gegen lebensverlängernde Maßnahmen liegen die Angst vor Autonomie- und Kontrollverlust zugrunde sowie die Sorge, dass fehlende Mobilität und erschwerte Kommunikation zu sozialer Isolation führen könnten (). Außerdem wird angenommen, dass die Lebensqualität bei schwerst gelähmten Patienten, insbesondere wenn sie auf lebenserhaltende Maßnahmen angewiesen sind, niedrig sei (). Die Tatsache, dass beatmete ALS-Patienten eine signifikant höhere sLQ als nicht beatmete Patienten angaben, widerspricht dieser Annahme. Viele therapeutische Maßnahmen, wie invasive Beatmung und Kommunikationsgeräte, die dem Patienten ein größeres Maß an Autonomie verschaffen und die durch das Gefühl der Kontrolle über das eigene Schicksal () zu einer besseren Lebensqualität führen, sind vorhanden (, ). Informationen werden vermutlich oft nicht ausreichend kommuniziert und vorhandene Möglichkeiten eventuell nicht voll genutzt (). Depressionen werden meist nicht behandelt (, ), sondern als normale Begleiterscheinung einer todbringenden Krankheit hingenommen. Wenn die Ergebnisse der vorliegenden Studie, sowie alle therapeutischen Optionen inklusive der Möglichkeit der Beendigung von invasiver Beatmung und künstlicher Ernährung eingehend mit Patienten und Angehörigen besprochen würden, entschieden sich möglicherweise mehr Patienten für therapeutische Maßnahmen (, , ). Es ist anzunehmen, dass ein Großteil der Bitten um beschleunigtes Versterben bei exzellenter Palliativversorgung wegfallen würde (, ). Die Autoren hoffen, dass die vorliegenden empirischen Daten zur emotionalen Situation von schwer beeinträchtigten Patienten eine differenziertere Diskussion zu einem durch den Arzt assistierten Suizid (physician assisted suicide, PAS) ermöglichen und weitere Untersuchungen mit dem Ziel, die Sichtweise des Patienten hervorzuheben, erleichtern. Interessenkonflikt Die Autoren erklären, dass kein Interessenkonflikt im Sinne der Richtlinien des International Committee of Medical Journal Editors besteht. Erklärung Die an den Studien teilnehmenden Probanden gaben ihr schriftliches Einverständnis zur Studienteilnahme. Die Untersuchungen wurden von den Ethikkommissionen der Universität Ulm und der Universität Tübingen genehmigt.

Albert Ludolph Neurologische Klinik der Universität Ulm im Rehabilitationskrankenhaus Ulm (RKU) Oberer Eselsberg 45 89081 Ulm E-Mail: albert.ludolph@rku.de Summary Depression and Quality of Life in Patients With Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Introduction: There is increasing debate on the issue of whether to facilitate the end-of-life decisions of severely disabled paients with diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Our two studies were intended to explore the emotional state and quality of life of patients with ALS. Methods: Two studies were performed to investigate depression and the quality of life in ALS patients: one was a longitudinal study, the other a comparison of ALS patients to normal control subjects. Results: These studies found no correlation between physical disability in ALS and either depression or the quality of life. The rate of depression was found to be inversely related to educational status. A satisfactory quality of life without depressive manifestations seems to be possible in any stage of ALS. In ALS patients the quality of life was comparable with healthy controls. Discussion: The rationale for not providing life-sustaining treatment to severely disabled patients is that a poor quality of life is expected after such treatment. Our studies have shown, however, that ALS patients can experience a satisfactory quality of life even if they are severely physically impaired, including in the terminal phase.

The average survival time after being diagnosed with ALS is three to five years. This protocol describes possible causes of ALS, diagnosis and conventional treatment, emerging medical therapies and nutritional interventions. Conventional medicine, which has fared poorly in the treatment of ALS, attempts to lessen symptoms by slowing disease progression. By adding scientifically studied natural interventions to conventional therapies, one may be able to target pathogenic mechanisms of ALS from multiple angles in hopes of slowing disease progression and improving quality of life. What is Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis? Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease) is a degenerative neuromuscular disease. ALS destroys motor neurons, the nerves that control movement, resulting in loss of motor function and eventual paralysis. Respiratory failure due to nerve damage that affects the muscles that control breathing is the most common cause of death in ALS patients. There are two main forms of ALS: sporadic and familial. While familial ALS is typically caused by hereditary genetic mutations, the cause of sporadic ALS (comprising 90% of all cases) is not completely understood. It is generally believed that sporadic ALS is caused by multiple factors that converge to damage motor neurons, including oxidative stress and glutamate toxicity, among others. Natural interventions such as vitamin B12 and ginseng, in addition to conventional therapies, may help slow disease progression and improve quality of life by targeting multiple pathogenic mechanisms of ALS. What are the Causes and Risk Factors for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis? Genetic mutations Oxidative stress Glutamate (an important neurotransmitter) accumulation and toxicity While causal relationships have not been established, exposure to heavy metals, pesticides, and other environmental toxins has been linked with ALS development. What are the Signs and Symptoms of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis? Note: Early symptoms vary depending on which muscles are affected first. Common symptoms can include: Tingling in fingers or toes Cramping in arms or legs Difficulty with tongue and facial movements, including chewing and swallowing What are the Conventional Medical Treatments for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis? Riluzole—blunts the effects of glutamate accumulation and can extend survival by a few months Edaravone—a free radical scavenger that can reduce oxidative stress Other treatments may help relieve symptoms and improve quality of life: Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation Medications to relieve painful muscle cramps Medications to reduce excessive salivation Physical, occupational, and speech therapy Mobility aids What are Emerging Therapies for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis? Stem cell therapy Multiple proteins and mutations have been linked to ALS pathogenesis. Gene replacement therapy and pharmaceutical interventions are being explored as potential treatments. Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) modulates neuronal growth and function, and injections may help slow disease progression, but results have been mixed. Many other treatments are being explored. More updated information can be found online at the ALS Association website. What Nutritional Interventions May Be Beneficial for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis? Vitamin B12. Vitamin B12 deficiency has been associated with nerve damage in animal models. High intramuscular doses in ALS patients have been shown to slow muscle wasting. Zinc. Mutations in the superoxide dismutase enzyme (which stabilizes superoxide radicals and is implicated in the pathology of certain kinds of ALS) can decrease its affinity for zinc and cause it to become toxic to motor neurons. Altering brain zinc levels is being explored in many nervous system diseases. Ginseng. Ginseng significantly delayed the onset of symptoms in an animal model of ALS. Ginseng may also protect motor neurons from apoptosis and membrane damage. Ginkgo biloba. Ginkgo biloba has antioxidant properties that have shown in experimental models to protect against glutamate-induced excitotoxicity and neuronal death due to oxidative stress. Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10). Patients with ALS have a higher percentage of oxidized CoQ10. Administering CoQ10 in an animal model of ALS extended lifespan. Acetyl-L-carnitine. Acetyl-L-carnitine has been found to reduce neuromuscular degeneration and increase lifespan in animal models of ALS. Acetyl-L-carnitine also appears to enhance the growth and repair of neurons. Lipoic acid. Lipoic acid is an antioxidant shown to protect cells against glutamate-induced excitotoxicity. In one study, administering lipoic acid improved survival in a mouse model of ALS. Whey protein. Protein supplementation may help improve the nutritional and functional status of ALS patients. Preliminary data suggest whey protein may protect motor neurons from oxidative damage. Creatine. In several animal studies, creatine has been shown to provide protection against neurodegenerative diseases. Additionally, a small study found that creatine supplementation improved muscle strength in ALS patients. Other natural interventions that may be helpful for ALS patients are glutathione and N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC), green tea, pycnogenol, and resveratrol. 2 Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (Lou Gehrig’s Disease) Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a degenerative neuromuscular disease, also called Lou Gehrig’s disease after the famous baseball player who died from this condition. ALS affects the nervous system and destroys motor neurons (nerve cells that help control movement) while sparing the abilities to see, hear, feel, touch and taste. ALS is characterized by progressive dysfunction resulting in symptoms such as tripping, clumsiness, difficulty talking, slurred speech, muscle cramps, twitching and ultimately, paralysis. The most common cause of death among ALS patients is respiratory failure, which occurs when nerve damage eventually affects the muscles that control breathing. The average survival time after being diagnosed with ALS is three to five years (ALSA 2012). There are two main forms of ALS: sporadic and familial. The sporadic form comprises 90 percent of all ALS cases. However, many scientists study the familial forms in order to try to understand the mechanisms of the disease. While familial ALS is typically caused by mutations in different genes (including a gene known as SOD1), researchers still do not completely understand the pathogenesis of sporadic ALS. Scientists are pursuing a number of theories including oxidative stress, glutamate toxicity, and mitochondrial dysfunction (Rowland 1994; Cleveland 1999; Rothstein 2009). Other possible risk factors include viral infections (Woodall 2004) and environmental toxins (Mitchell 2000). The current consensus is that many factors may converge to cause the motor neuron damage typified by ALS (Rothstein 2009). Conventional medicine, which has fared poorly in the treatment of ALS, attempts to lessen symptoms by slowing disease progression. There are only two disease-modifying drugs currently approved in the United States for ALS patients: riluzole and edaravone (Miller 2007; FDA 2017). By adding scientifically studied natural interventions to conventional therapies, one may be able to target pathogenic mechanisms of ALS from multiple angles in hopes of slowing disease progression and improving quality of life. 3 Possible Causes of ALS Superoxide Dismutase Because SOD1 gene mutations can cause familial ALS, many researchers have studied this protein to determine how it plays a role in the death of motor neurons. SOD1 is a gene that codes for superoxide dismutase (SOD), an enzyme which helps convert superoxide radicals into less harmful molecules. Superoxide molecules are a form of free radical or reactive oxygen species, a class of molecules that can damage the DNA, proteins, and membranes of cells causing them to die (Rothstein 2009). If SOD is either functioning poorly or is present in inadequate quantities, rampant oxidative stress driven by unabated superoxide molecules can damage tissue and contribute to disease. Approximately 20% of familial cases and 2% of all ALS cases are linked to SOD1 gene mutations (Sung 2002; Andersen 2006; Chiò 2008). This suggests that the accumulation of superoxide molecules and other free radicals could contribute to ALS. In addition to increasing superoxide levels, SOD1 mutations can damage neurons in other ways. For example, mutant SOD1 produces abnormal SOD molecules which are theorized to serve as the seed for large clusters of misfolded proteins that are toxic to neurons (Karch 2009; Lindberg 2002). Oxidative stress Studies have found elevated levels of oxidative stress within the central nervous system as well as peripherally in ALS (Miana-Mena 2011; Hensley 2006; Ilieva 2007; Kanekura 2009). This suggests that motor neuron death in ALS is related to increased levels of reactive oxygen species. These conditions contribute to the neuronal death and muscle wasting common in ALS. Oxidative stress can be relieved by increasing the concentration of antioxidants such as beta-carotene (Dawson 2000), vitamins C (Mandl 2009) and E (Colombo 2010), as well as the mineral selenium (Sanmartin 2011). Many other supplements, such as coenzyme Q10, also have antioxidant properties. Glutamate Toxicity Glutamate is an important neurotransmitter. Under normal conditions, its concentrations are tightly regulated. However, it appears the system regulating glutamate concentration in patients with ALS may be disturbed (Rothstein 1995b), resulting in an accumulation of glutamate in the space (synapse) between cells (Cameron 2002). This excess glutamate may excite nerve cells beyond their capacity resulting in nerve cell death. Patients with ALS have elevated levels of glutamate in their cerebrospinal fluid, support this hypothesis (Rothstein 1990, Shaw 1995). Mutant glutamate transport proteins are also associated with sporadic forms of ALS, further supporting the idea that elevated levels of glutamate-mediated excitation can kill motor neurons in ALS patients (Lin 1998; Rothstein 1995; Dunlop 2003). Some of the most powerful evidence supporting the critical role that glutamate plays in the pathology of ALS is the effectiveness of the medication riluzole, which inhibits glutamate’s effects on the nervous system. It modulates the release of glutamate, thereby improving survival for ALS patients. Its effect however is modest, suggesting that excess glutamate is not the sole cause of the disease. Mitochondrial Dysfunction The mitochondria provide energy for all cells, including neurons. Unfortunately, mitochondria also produce reactive oxygen species as a byproduct of energy generation. Mitochondrial dysfunction can result in the production of excessive amounts of superoxide, causing extensive cell damage and death. Accumulation of superoxide is prevented by SOD and other enzymes (Brand 2011). There are a number of ways in which the mitochondria in motor neurons may become impaired in ALS (Shi 2010). In animal models of ALS, dysfunction of mitochondria in motor neurons occurs before any other observable pathologic changes, suggesting this is an early event in the progression of the disease (Kong 1998). Mutant forms of SOD appear to lead to mitochondrial dysfunction (Liu 2004). Studies of both human and animal neurons have found extensive mitochondrial dysfunction associated with ALS (Cassarino 1999; Beal 2005; Martin 2011; Cozzolino 2011; Kawamata 2011; Faes 2011). In addition, some patients with ALS appear to have impaired mitochondrial function in their muscle fibers (Crugnola 2010). Animal models of ALS show abnormal transport of mitochondria in their motor neurons which could further contribute to the progression of the disease (De Vos 2007). Additionally, because proper mitochondrial function is so essential, other yet unidentified processes could be altered when mitochondrial health is impaired (Fosslien 2001). Along these lines, an emerging theory linking excitotoxicity and mitochondrial dysfunction suggests that an accumulation of lactate, a metabolic byproduct which is toxic (especially to nerve cells) at high concentrations may play a role in ALS progression (Vadakkadath Meethal 2012). This theory (a.k.a. the lactate dyscrasia theory) proposes that mitochondrial dysfunction partly contributes to an accumulation of lactate in the junction of motor neurons and muscle cells (the neuromuscular junction (NMJ)) leading to death of both the nerve and muscle cells, thereby requiring the remaining muscle cells to work harder-than-normal to generate the force necessary for motor control. However, since lactate is a metabolic byproduct and greater metabolic demand increases lactate production, the remaining muscle cells produce even more lactate than usual due to their increased workload, hastening the accumulation of lactate and exacerbating neuronal destruction and muscular atrophy. This theory also proposes that malfunction of an as yet undiscovered lactate shuttle within the NMJ may be a pathological feature of ALS, suggesting that supporting mitochondrial function may optimize lactate metabolism and combat the toxicity caused by accumulation of excess lactate. If this theory is correct, then combining drugs that inhibit lactate accumulation such as nizofenone (Matsumoto 1994) with nutrients that support mitochondrial function (like coenzyme Q10 and pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) might be an effective therapy for ALS. Heavy metals and environmental agents. The role of heavy metals in ALS is highly controversial. Since clusters of ALS patients have been found in certain geographical areas, researchers have searched for an underlying environmental theme such as heavy metal poisoning. For example, researchers have found that elevated levels of lead are associated with a higher risk of ALS (Fang 2010). Another toxin which has been identified as a potential mediator for ALS is mercury, though the link between mercury and ALS risk is not as clear (Callaghan 2011, Mano 1990). These toxins can lead to subtle cellular changes such as interfering with the methylation of DNA (Rooney 2011). Other studies however have failed to show a link between ALS and any of the common heavy metals (Gresham 1986). Beta-N-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA), a neurotoxin made by certain bacteria may play an important role in the development of ALS. BMAA may be implicated in the high incidence of ALS in Guam, where these bacteria are commonly found in the seeds of the Cycas circinalis plant (Banack 2010). Exposure to pesticides may also increase the risk of developing ALS (Johnson 2009). Exposure to pesticides in the grass on the playing field is one theory put forth to explain the unusually high incidence of ALS in Italian soccer players (Chio 2009). While there is good reason to think that neurotoxic agents like these may be somehow linked to degenerative brain and nerve conditions like ALS, researchers have been unable to meet the demanding scientific standard needed to establish a causal relationship (Caban-Holt 2005, Johnson 2009). 4 Diagnosis and Conventional Treatment of ALS Like many neuromuscular diseases, it can be difficult to make an early diagnosis of ALS. Depending on which muscle group is affected first, its symptoms vary from person to person and can include: tingling in the fingers or toes cramping in the arms or legs trouble with tongue and facial movements, including chewing and swallowing. As the disease progresses, it spreads through the affected limb until eventually all muscle groups become involved. This spread into all muscle groups is the defining characteristic of ALS. In fact, the term amyotrophy refers to the atrophy (wasting) of muscle tissue, while lateral sclerosis refers to the hardening of the spinal column from the buildup of scar tissue (Rowland 2001). The diagnosis of ALS is primarily a clinical one and requires the appearance of both upper (increased tone and reflexes) and lower (fasciculations and muscle atrophy) motor neuron involvement in many segments of the body. Electromyography, nerve conduction studies, and transcranial magnetic stimulation can all be used to support the diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Riluzole, an FDA approved drug for the treatment of ALS, blunts the effects of glutamate by decreasing its release and blocking the ability of glutamate to bind to its receptors, thereby decreasing the excitotoxicity that leads to cell death. Albeit small, its two to three month increase in survival time (Miller 2007) indicates that controlling glutamate levels in the brain could be an essential component in fighting ALS and provides valuable information toward ultimately finding a more effective treatment for the disease (Carlesi 2011). Edaravone (Radicava) was approved by the FDA in 2017 to treat ALS patients (FDA 2017). Edaravone has free radical-scavenging abilities and may reduce oxidative stress, an important aspect of ALS pathogenesis. Edaravone was shown in two controlled clinical trials to slow functional deterioration in a certain subset of ALS patients. The first was a randomized trial of 206 subjects treated with intravenous infusions of either edaravone or placebo for 24 weeks (Abe 2014). While there was no significant difference in overall ALS functional rating scores (ALSFRS-R) between the groups after treatment, post-hoc analysis revealed that subjects in earlier stages of the disease showed a greater treatment effect (Edaravone [MCI-186] ALS 16 Study Group 2017). In order to demonstrate the efficacy in this subgroup, a second trial including 137 subjects in early stages of ALS was conducted. The edaravone group experienced a 33% slower decline in function than the placebo group (Writing Group 2017). Edaravone is generally recommended in addition to riluzole as an adjuvant therapy. Concerns have been raised regarding the safety and efficacy of edaravone treatment (Turnbull 2018). The majority of patients in the second study experienced treatment-related adverse events, likely due to the nature of drug delivery (ie, intravenous infusion). Edaravone has also only been shown to be effective in a small subset of patients with ALS. The remainder of conventional medical treatment for ALS patients focuses on relieving symptoms and improving quality of life. For example, non-invasive positive pressure ventilation is often used to help patients with ALS breathe, especially at night (Mustfa 2006; Lo Coco 2006). Physicians frequently recommend prescription medications to relieve painful muscle cramps (e.g. carbamazepine and phenytoin) (Andersen 2005), excessive salivation (e.g. atropine, amitriptyline, hyoscamine, and injections of botulinum toxin into the salivary glands) (Giess 2000; Lipp 2003; Stone 2009), and other symptoms. ALS patients are often advised to engage in moderate exercise and seek physical therapy to maintain muscle strength and function. As the disease progresses, splints, braces, and wheelchairs are used to help with mobility. Also, higher toilet seats, headrests and specialized utensils may help improve the quality of life for ALS patients (Borasio 2001). Occupational and speech therapy help patients as their motor control gradually deteriorates. 5 Emerging Medical Therapies Stem Cells Stem cells, immature cells that can differentiate into specialized adult cells, may represent the next generation of ALS therapy. However, due to federal restrictions on stem cell therapy as well as the difficulty of designing studies, very few trials have been conducted to date on the treatment of ALS with stem cells. Those that have been conducted, however, are encouraging and early trials show great promise. Researchers have found the following: Bone marrow derived “stem-cell transplantation in the motor cortex delays ALS progression and improves quality of life” (Martinez 2009). Direct injection of bone marrow derived stem cells into the frontal motor cortex (a brain region) of human ALS patients is generally safe and well tolerated (Martinez 2012). Researchers have also experimented with the use of stem cells that express beneficial growth factors as a way of comprehensively treating ALS (Suzuki 2008; Lunn 2009). This therapy offers the potential to alter the course of ALS in afflicted patients. TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) and FUS (fused in sarcoma) Research has identified the cellular protein TDP-43 as an important factor in the cause of ALS, especially the sporadic forms (Mackenzie 2007). TDP-43 binds DNA and RNA in cells, including motor neurons. Aggregates of TDP-43 are found in the motor neurons of patients with ALS, suggesting that they may contribute to ALS pathogenesis. Identification of TDP-43’s involvement in ALS rapidly fueled a breakthrough discovery of an additional causative mutation in the gene encoding another RNA/DNA binding protein called FUS (fused in sarcoma) (Kwiatkowski 2009; Vance 2009). Because both of these proteins have been implicated in ALS, they may represent a novel pathway by which the motor neurons are damaged. This has also opened up the potential for gene therapy, allowing researchers to try to replace defective genes with functional ones, thus slowing or reversing the loss of motor neurons associated with ALS (Lagier-Tourenne 2009; Hester 2009). Researchers are also searching for ways to inhibit TDP-43 aggregation using chemicals such as methylene blue and latrepirdine (Yamashita 2009). IGF-1 and Growth Hormone Insulin-like Growth Factor-1 (IGF-1) is a potent modulator of neuronal growth and function. This neurotrophic factor has the ability to protect neurons both in the central and peripheral nervous system. Researchers have examined the possibility in cell and animal models that IGF-1 could be an effective therapeutic treatment for ALS (Sakowski 2009). Human studies, however, have produced mixed results. Whereas one study found some slowing of the progression of ALS in patients treated with IGF-1 injections (Nagano 2005), others found that subcutaneous (under the skin) injections are not effective in ALS patients (Sorenson 2008). However, the lack of effect with subcutaneous injections could be due to an inability to access the central nervous system. Intraspinal cord delivery has shown promise in animal models (Franz 2009). The use of retroviruses as a potential delivery method for administering IGF-1 to ALS patients has also shown promise (Lepore 2007). Similarly, growth hormone (GH) may be related to ALS as one trial found that ALS patients had impaired GH secretion compared to healthy controls (Morselli 2006). However, the potential therapeutic value of GH replacement therapy needs further investigation as a recent clinical trial found no improvement in ALS patients receiving GH compared to placebo (Sacca 2012). Other Treatments Arimoclomol is an investigational drug that improves the expression of “heat shock proteins”, thereby helping prevent the accumulation of misfolded proteins. Comprehensive in vivo and in vitro studies demonstrated its effect in the prevention of neuronal loss and promotion of motor neuron survival, even after the onset of symptoms. Clinical trials have reported good safety and tolerability (Phukan 2010). Ceftriaxone, a commonly used antibiotic, may also be able to treat ALS by improving reuptake of glutamate. When used in an animal model of ALS, ceftriaxone delayed loss of neurons and muscle strength, thus increasing survival (Rothstein 2005). Dexpramipexole is under development by Knopp Neurosciences and Biogen Idec as a potential neuroprotective therapy for ALS (Cheah 2010). While it has been shown to be safe and well tolerated (Bozik 2011), more research needs to be done to determine its efficacy. Another new medication which is currently being studied in clinical trials is TRO19622 (clinicaltrials.gov 2010). TRO19622 is a cholesterol-like molecule and displays remarkable neuroprotective properties both in vitro and in vivo. TRO19622 is expected to preserve existing neuronal function by delaying or even stopping further progression of the disease. TRO19622 has been granted orphan drug designation status for the treatment of ALS in the USA. This status allows the opportunity to seek ‘fast track’ review by the FDA (Trophos.com 2012). 6 Nutritional Interventions Adequate nutrition is crucial for ALS patients. As the disease progresses, patients gradually lose the ability to chew or swallow with ease. At the same time, the abdominal and pelvic muscles weaken, oftentimes resulting in depression. Patients often lose the ability and desire to eat, making malnutrition a common problem. The recognition that aggressive nutritional intervention is paramount among ALS patients has spurred ardent research efforts aimed at elucidating the potential therapeutic value of dietary supplementation (Cameron 2002). Vitamins and Minerals Vitamin B12 (methylcobalamin). Whereas ultra-high (25mg daily for 4 weeks) intramuscular doses of methylcobalamin (a form of vitamin B12) have been shown to slow muscle wasting (Izumi 2007), low levels of vitamin B12 have been associated with nerve damage in many different animal models. One of the main problems associated with low levels of vitamin B12 is elevated levels of methylmalonic acid (MMA) which is toxic to neurons (Ganji 2012). Low levels of vitamin B12 are also associated with poorly functioning peripheral nerves which can be exacerbated by ALS (Leishear 2011). Vitamin B12 can also prevent damage to the opthalmic nerves by reducing MMA and homocysteine levels, both being associated with oxidative damage (Pott 2012). Low levels of vitamin B12 have also been associated with neuronal degeneration in other models (Moore 2012). Zinc. Mutations to the copper/zinc superoxide dismutase gene are responsible for 2-3% of ALS cases. These mutations result in the SOD enzyme having a reduced affinity for zinc (Ermilova 2005). In fact, the loss of zinc from SOD1 results in the remaining copper in SOD1 becoming extremely toxic to motor neurons (Trumbull 2009). Altering zinc levels within the brain is being studied as a method for treating many different nervous system diseases, including ALS (Grabrucker 2011). However, a study conducted at the Linus Pauling Institute found that large doses of zinc inhibit copper absorption, which can lead to anemia. In the study, researchers added a small dose of copper to animal ALS models receiving zinc and found that the copper prevented early death associated with high doses of zinc (Ermilova 2005). In summary, adding a small amount of copper to the subject’s diets prevented this lethal anemia, suggesting that moderate amounts of zinc supplementation combined with small amounts of copper might help prevent neuron death in ALS. Herbal Supplements Ginseng. In an animal model of ALS, ginseng was shown to significantly delay the onset of ALS symptoms (Jiang 2000). An extract from the ginseng plant called ginsenoside has also been found to increase the expression of SOD1 (Kim 1996). Ginseng and its extracts may also be able to protect motor neurons from apoptosis and membrane damage, further helping to slow the progression of ALS (Radad 2011). Ginkgo biloba. Ginkgo biloba has antioxidant properties (Ernst 2002). Additionally, it has been shown to promote healthy mitochondrial function (Fosslien 2001). During an in vitro study, it was found to protect against glutamate-induced excitotoxicity (Kobayashi 2000). Ginkgo biloba also reduced weight loss in a mouse model of ALS (Ferrante 2001). Ginkgo biloba extract has been shown to protect neurons from death due to oxidative stress (Shi 2009). Additional Support Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) acts as an antioxidant and is essential for proper mitochondrial function (Mancuso 2010). Human studies have found that ALS patients have a higher percentage of oxidized CoQ10 (ubiquinone), a condition the researchers blamed on oxidative stress caused by the disease (Sohmiya 2005). Supplementation with ubiquinol, the reduced (non-oxidized) form of CoQ10 may ameliorate this problem, though no studies have tested this hypothesis. Several animal studies, including the following have supported the benefit of CoQ10 treatment in ALS: In an animal model of familial ALS, administration of coenzyme Q10 significantly extended life span and oral administration significantly increased CoQ10 concentrations in the brains and mitochondria of the test animals (Matthews 1998). As a result of these promising studies in mice, researchers have been testing the benefits of CoQ10 on humans with ALS. One phase II study did not find any substantial benefit of CoQ10 supplementation in patients with ALS (Kauffman 2009). However, more research still needs to be done as CoQ10 plays an important role in mitochondrial function and controlling oxidative stress - two key components of ALS. In addition, it has been noted that high doses of CoQ10 are generally safe (Ferrante 2005). Acetyl-L-carnitine has been shown to improve mitochondrial function (Carta 1993; Virmani 2002; Jin 2008). Acetyl-L-carnitine appears to increase the growth and repair of neurons (Wilson 2010; Kokkalis 2009) while protecting neurons from high levels of glutamate when combined with lipoic acid (Babu 2009). Acetyl-L-carnitine also protects neuron cell cultures from excitotoxicity, one of the putative mechanisms of disease in ALS (Bigini 2002). Acetyl-L-carnitine has also been found to reduce neuromuscular degeneration and increase life span in animal models of ALS (Kira 2006). In one animal study, the effects of acetyl-L-carnitine were increased when administered in conjunction with lipoic acid (Hagen 2002). Lipoic acid. Lipoic acid has been shown to have antioxidant properties as well as increase intracellular levels of glutathione (Suh 2004a; Yamada 2011). It also chelates metals both in the test tube and in animal models (Suh 2004b and 2005). As a result, lipoic acid supplementation might protect neurons from some of the changes that lead to ALS (Liu 2008). Furthermore, lipoic acid has been shown to protect cells against glutamate-induced excitotoxicity (Muller 1995). In one study, administration of lipoic acid improved survival in a mouse model of ALS (Andreassen 2001b). Protein and Amino acids. Adequate protein intake is essential for patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Protein supplementation may help improve the nutritional status of ALS patients, thereby slowing the progression of the disease. A 2010 study found that patients with ALS taking whey protein supplements had improved nutritional and functional parameters as compared to the control group (Carvalho-Silva 2010). Some preliminary data suggests that whey protein may also directly protect motor neurons from oxidative stress, thus delaying the progression of ALS (Ross 2011). A Portuguese study suggested that dietary supplementation with amino acids may have some beneficial effects on the course of the disease (Palma 2005). Creatine. In cells, creatine aids in the formation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the primary source of cellular energy. In multiple animal studies, creatine has been shown to provide protection against neurodegenerative diseases. For example, it has been suggested that creatine helps to stabilize cellular membranes (Persky 2001). Creatine may also lessen the burden of the excitotoxin glutamate in the brain, thus improving survival time in animals with ALS (Andreassen 2001a). In human ALS patients, there is evidence to suggest that creatine may improve mitochondrial function (Vielhaber 2001). In addition, a small preliminary study found that creatine supplementation improves muscle strength in ALS patients (Mazzini 2001). More recent research has confirmed that creatine can protect neurons from toxic processes such as those that drive the progression of ALS. Creatine, due to its antioxidant and anti-excitotoxic properties, has been found to have a significant therapeutic effect in mouse models of ALS (Klopstock 2011; Beal 2011). However, human studies have yielded mixed results (Pastula 2010) which may be due to insufficient sample size (Klopstock 2011). Creatine can cross the blood-brain barrier and gain access to the brain, a treatment which lowered levels of glutamate in the cerebrospinal fluid which may help to protect the brain (Atassi 2010). Glutathione and N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC). Glutathione is an antioxidant which is naturally synthesized by the body. Increasing glutathione levels could help prevent free radical damage to cells (Exner 2000). The glutathione precursor N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) boosts blood levels of glutathione (Carmeli 2012). Patients with ALS tend to have higher levels of oxidized glutathione (glutathione that has already been used to protect the body from free radicals) (Baillet 2010). Increased levels of glutathione can also protect neurons from degeneration in models of ALS (Vargas 2008). Interestingly, cell culture models have shown that ALS is associated with reduced glutathione levels due to mitochondrial dysfunction, and that reduced glutathione levels can result in elevated levels of glutamate (D’Alessandro 2011). Along with being a glutathione precursor, NAC has antioxidant activity of its own. In animal models of ALS, NAC administration has been shown to decrease motor neuron loss, improve muscle mass, and increase survival time and motor performance (Andreassen 2000; Henderson 1996). In addition, NAC supplementation can help thin mucous secretions in the oral cavity which may make swallowing easier (Kuhnlein 2008). Green tea. Green tea contains high concentrations of catechins, flavonoids with strong antioxidant properties (Hu 2002). Green tea extract has been demonstrated to have anti-inflammatory properties as well (Hong 2000). One of these catechins known as epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is of particular interest in the context of ALS. EGCG and other catechins may be able to protect neurons from a variety of diseases (Mandel 2008). EGCG has been found to protect cultures of motor neurons from death due to excessive levels of glutamate (Yu 2010). Motor neurons can also be protected from mitochondrial dysfunction with the addition of EGCG in culture (Schroeder 2009). EGCG can also bind to and inactivate iron, which may help protect motor neurons from the effects of ALS (Benkler 2010). Epidemiological data further supports the following role of tea in its potential protection of neurons: green tea consumption reduces the risk of neurodegenerative diseases (Mandel 2011) and people who drink tea may have a lower risk of developing ALS (Morozova 2008). Pycnogenol® is an extract of marine pine bark that includes procyanidins and phenolic acids (Packer 1999). It has been shown to have antioxidant properties (Packer 1999) as well as protective effects against glutamate excitotoxicity (Kobayashi 2000). Pycnogenol® is a common complementary therapy option among ALS patients (Cameron 2002). In addition, pycnogenol® increased the levels of SOD produced in an animal study (Kolacek 2010). Resveratrol is a powerful antioxidant found in red grape skins and Japanese knotweed (Polygonum cuspidatum). Resveratrol has been found to suppress the influx of excitatory ions into some cell types which is associated with reduced glutamate-induced cell toxicity (Wu 2003). Another way resveratrol may target neurodegenerative diseases is by reducing oxidative stress, both on its own and by increasing the expression of SIRT1 (Sun 2010), a stress-response gene associated with longevity and protection against a number of cellular assaults. Although it is not known what role this gene plays in ALS, increasing SIRT1 expression via resveratrol administration helps protect motor neurons from ALS in cell culture (Kim 2007; Wang 2011). In addition, resveratrol can increase the activity of SOD in cells and protect them from apoptosis and oxidative stress (Yoon 2011). Adding the cerebrospinal fluid from ALS patients to rat motor neuron cell cultures causes the cultured cells to die. One of the intriguing aspects of resveratrol is that it can protect the motor neuron cell cultures from death which is something that riluzole, the only FDA approved drug for ALS, cannot do (Yanez 2011).

The average survival time after being diagnosed with ALS is three to five years. This protocol describes possible causes of ALS, diagnosis and conventional treatment, emerging medical therapies and nutritional interventions. Conventional medicine, which has fared poorly in the treatment of ALS, attempts to lessen symptoms by slowing disease progression. By adding scientifically studied natural interventions to conventional therapies, one may be able to target pathogenic mechanisms of ALS from multiple angles in hopes of slowing disease progression and improving quality of life. What is Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis? Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease) is a degenerative neuromuscular disease. ALS destroys motor neurons, the nerves that control movement, resulting in loss of motor function and eventual paralysis. Respiratory failure due to nerve damage that affects the muscles that control breathing is the most common cause of death in ALS patients. There are two main forms of ALS: sporadic and familial. While familial ALS is typically caused by hereditary genetic mutations, the cause of sporadic ALS (comprising 90% of all cases) is not completely understood. It is generally believed that sporadic ALS is caused by multiple factors that converge to damage motor neurons, including oxidative stress and glutamate toxicity, among others. Natural interventions such as vitamin B12 and ginseng, in addition to conventional therapies, may help slow disease progression and improve quality of life by targeting multiple pathogenic mechanisms of ALS. What are the Causes and Risk Factors for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis? Genetic mutations Oxidative stress Glutamate (an important neurotransmitter) accumulation and toxicity While causal relationships have not been established, exposure to heavy metals, pesticides, and other environmental toxins has been linked with ALS development. What are the Signs and Symptoms of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis? Note: Early symptoms vary depending on which muscles are affected first. Common symptoms can include: Tingling in fingers or toes Cramping in arms or legs Difficulty with tongue and facial movements, including chewing and swallowing What are the Conventional Medical Treatments for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis? Riluzole—blunts the effects of glutamate accumulation and can extend survival by a few months Edaravone—a free radical scavenger that can reduce oxidative stress Other treatments may help relieve symptoms and improve quality of life: Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation Medications to relieve painful muscle cramps Medications to reduce excessive salivation Physical, occupational, and speech therapy Mobility aids What are Emerging Therapies for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis? Stem cell therapy Multiple proteins and mutations have been linked to ALS pathogenesis. Gene replacement therapy and pharmaceutical interventions are being explored as potential treatments. Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) modulates neuronal growth and function, and injections may help slow disease progression, but results have been mixed. Many other treatments are being explored. More updated information can be found online at the ALS Association website. What Nutritional Interventions May Be Beneficial for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis? Vitamin B12. Vitamin B12 deficiency has been associated with nerve damage in animal models. High intramuscular doses in ALS patients have been shown to slow muscle wasting. Zinc. Mutations in the superoxide dismutase enzyme (which stabilizes superoxide radicals and is implicated in the pathology of certain kinds of ALS) can decrease its affinity for zinc and cause it to become toxic to motor neurons. Altering brain zinc levels is being explored in many nervous system diseases. Ginseng. Ginseng significantly delayed the onset of symptoms in an animal model of ALS. Ginseng may also protect motor neurons from apoptosis and membrane damage. Ginkgo biloba. Ginkgo biloba has antioxidant properties that have shown in experimental models to protect against glutamate-induced excitotoxicity and neuronal death due to oxidative stress. Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10). Patients with ALS have a higher percentage of oxidized CoQ10. Administering CoQ10 in an animal model of ALS extended lifespan. Acetyl-L-carnitine. Acetyl-L-carnitine has been found to reduce neuromuscular degeneration and increase lifespan in animal models of ALS. Acetyl-L-carnitine also appears to enhance the growth and repair of neurons. Lipoic acid. Lipoic acid is an antioxidant shown to protect cells against glutamate-induced excitotoxicity. In one study, administering lipoic acid improved survival in a mouse model of ALS. Whey protein. Protein supplementation may help improve the nutritional and functional status of ALS patients. Preliminary data suggest whey protein may protect motor neurons from oxidative damage. Creatine. In several animal studies, creatine has been shown to provide protection against neurodegenerative diseases. Additionally, a small study found that creatine supplementation improved muscle strength in ALS patients. Other natural interventions that may be helpful for ALS patients are glutathione and N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC), green tea, pycnogenol, and resveratrol. 2 Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (Lou Gehrig’s Disease) Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a degenerative neuromuscular disease, also called Lou Gehrig’s disease after the famous baseball player who died from this condition. ALS affects the nervous system and destroys motor neurons (nerve cells that help control movement) while sparing the abilities to see, hear, feel, touch and taste. ALS is characterized by progressive dysfunction resulting in symptoms such as tripping, clumsiness, difficulty talking, slurred speech, muscle cramps, twitching and ultimately, paralysis. The most common cause of death among ALS patients is respiratory failure, which occurs when nerve damage eventually affects the muscles that control breathing. The average survival time after being diagnosed with ALS is three to five years (ALSA 2012). There are two main forms of ALS: sporadic and familial. The sporadic form comprises 90 percent of all ALS cases. However, many scientists study the familial forms in order to try to understand the mechanisms of the disease. While familial ALS is typically caused by mutations in different genes (including a gene known as SOD1), researchers still do not completely understand the pathogenesis of sporadic ALS. Scientists are pursuing a number of theories including oxidative stress, glutamate toxicity, and mitochondrial dysfunction (Rowland 1994; Cleveland 1999; Rothstein 2009). Other possible risk factors include viral infections (Woodall 2004) and environmental toxins (Mitchell 2000). The current consensus is that many factors may converge to cause the motor neuron damage typified by ALS (Rothstein 2009). Conventional medicine, which has fared poorly in the treatment of ALS, attempts to lessen symptoms by slowing disease progression. There are only two disease-modifying drugs currently approved in the United States for ALS patients: riluzole and edaravone (Miller 2007; FDA 2017). By adding scientifically studied natural interventions to conventional therapies, one may be able to target pathogenic mechanisms of ALS from multiple angles in hopes of slowing disease progression and improving quality of life. 3 Possible Causes of ALS Superoxide Dismutase Because SOD1 gene mutations can cause familial ALS, many researchers have studied this protein to determine how it plays a role in the death of motor neurons. SOD1 is a gene that codes for superoxide dismutase (SOD), an enzyme which helps convert superoxide radicals into less harmful molecules. Superoxide molecules are a form of free radical or reactive oxygen species, a class of molecules that can damage the DNA, proteins, and membranes of cells causing them to die (Rothstein 2009). If SOD is either functioning poorly or is present in inadequate quantities, rampant oxidative stress driven by unabated superoxide molecules can damage tissue and contribute to disease. Approximately 20% of familial cases and 2% of all ALS cases are linked to SOD1 gene mutations (Sung 2002; Andersen 2006; Chiò 2008). This suggests that the accumulation of superoxide molecules and other free radicals could contribute to ALS. In addition to increasing superoxide levels, SOD1 mutations can damage neurons in other ways. For example, mutant SOD1 produces abnormal SOD molecules which are theorized to serve as the seed for large clusters of misfolded proteins that are toxic to neurons (Karch 2009; Lindberg 2002). Oxidative stress Studies have found elevated levels of oxidative stress within the central nervous system as well as peripherally in ALS (Miana-Mena 2011; Hensley 2006; Ilieva 2007; Kanekura 2009). This suggests that motor neuron death in ALS is related to increased levels of reactive oxygen species. These conditions contribute to the neuronal death and muscle wasting common in ALS. Oxidative stress can be relieved by increasing the concentration of antioxidants such as beta-carotene (Dawson 2000), vitamins C (Mandl 2009) and E (Colombo 2010), as well as the mineral selenium (Sanmartin 2011). Many other supplements, such as coenzyme Q10, also have antioxidant properties. Glutamate Toxicity Glutamate is an important neurotransmitter. Under normal conditions, its concentrations are tightly regulated. However, it appears the system regulating glutamate concentration in patients with ALS may be disturbed (Rothstein 1995b), resulting in an accumulation of glutamate in the space (synapse) between cells (Cameron 2002). This excess glutamate may excite nerve cells beyond their capacity resulting in nerve cell death. Patients with ALS have elevated levels of glutamate in their cerebrospinal fluid, support this hypothesis (Rothstein 1990, Shaw 1995). Mutant glutamate transport proteins are also associated with sporadic forms of ALS, further supporting the idea that elevated levels of glutamate-mediated excitation can kill motor neurons in ALS patients (Lin 1998; Rothstein 1995; Dunlop 2003). Some of the most powerful evidence supporting the critical role that glutamate plays in the pathology of ALS is the effectiveness of the medication riluzole, which inhibits glutamate’s effects on the nervous system. It modulates the release of glutamate, thereby improving survival for ALS patients. Its effect however is modest, suggesting that excess glutamate is not the sole cause of the disease. Mitochondrial Dysfunction The mitochondria provide energy for all cells, including neurons. Unfortunately, mitochondria also produce reactive oxygen species as a byproduct of energy generation. Mitochondrial dysfunction can result in the production of excessive amounts of superoxide, causing extensive cell damage and death. Accumulation of superoxide is prevented by SOD and other enzymes (Brand 2011). There are a number of ways in which the mitochondria in motor neurons may become impaired in ALS (Shi 2010). In animal models of ALS, dysfunction of mitochondria in motor neurons occurs before any other observable pathologic changes, suggesting this is an early event in the progression of the disease (Kong 1998). Mutant forms of SOD appear to lead to mitochondrial dysfunction (Liu 2004). Studies of both human and animal neurons have found extensive mitochondrial dysfunction associated with ALS (Cassarino 1999; Beal 2005; Martin 2011; Cozzolino 2011; Kawamata 2011; Faes 2011). In addition, some patients with ALS appear to have impaired mitochondrial function in their muscle fibers (Crugnola 2010). Animal models of ALS show abnormal transport of mitochondria in their motor neurons which could further contribute to the progression of the disease (De Vos 2007). Additionally, because proper mitochondrial function is so essential, other yet unidentified processes could be altered when mitochondrial health is impaired (Fosslien 2001). Along these lines, an emerging theory linking excitotoxicity and mitochondrial dysfunction suggests that an accumulation of lactate, a metabolic byproduct which is toxic (especially to nerve cells) at high concentrations may play a role in ALS progression (Vadakkadath Meethal 2012). This theory (a.k.a. the lactate dyscrasia theory) proposes that mitochondrial dysfunction partly contributes to an accumulation of lactate in the junction of motor neurons and muscle cells (the neuromuscular junction (NMJ)) leading to death of both the nerve and muscle cells, thereby requiring the remaining muscle cells to work harder-than-normal to generate the force necessary for motor control. However, since lactate is a metabolic byproduct and greater metabolic demand increases lactate production, the remaining muscle cells produce even more lactate than usual due to their increased workload, hastening the accumulation of lactate and exacerbating neuronal destruction and muscular atrophy. This theory also proposes that malfunction of an as yet undiscovered lactate shuttle within the NMJ may be a pathological feature of ALS, suggesting that supporting mitochondrial function may optimize lactate metabolism and combat the toxicity caused by accumulation of excess lactate. If this theory is correct, then combining drugs that inhibit lactate accumulation such as nizofenone (Matsumoto 1994) with nutrients that support mitochondrial function (like coenzyme Q10 and pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) might be an effective therapy for ALS. Heavy metals and environmental agents. The role of heavy metals in ALS is highly controversial. Since clusters of ALS patients have been found in certain geographical areas, researchers have searched for an underlying environmental theme such as heavy metal poisoning. For example, researchers have found that elevated levels of lead are associated with a higher risk of ALS (Fang 2010). Another toxin which has been identified as a potential mediator for ALS is mercury, though the link between mercury and ALS risk is not as clear (Callaghan 2011, Mano 1990). These toxins can lead to subtle cellular changes such as interfering with the methylation of DNA (Rooney 2011). Other studies however have failed to show a link between ALS and any of the common heavy metals (Gresham 1986). Beta-N-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA), a neurotoxin made by certain bacteria may play an important role in the development of ALS. BMAA may be implicated in the high incidence of ALS in Guam, where these bacteria are commonly found in the seeds of the Cycas circinalis plant (Banack 2010). Exposure to pesticides may also increase the risk of developing ALS (Johnson 2009). Exposure to pesticides in the grass on the playing field is one theory put forth to explain the unusually high incidence of ALS in Italian soccer players (Chio 2009). While there is good reason to think that neurotoxic agents like these may be somehow linked to degenerative brain and nerve conditions like ALS, researchers have been unable to meet the demanding scientific standard needed to establish a causal relationship (Caban-Holt 2005, Johnson 2009). 4 Diagnosis and Conventional Treatment of ALS Like many neuromuscular diseases, it can be difficult to make an early diagnosis of ALS. Depending on which muscle group is affected first, its symptoms vary from person to person and can include: tingling in the fingers or toes cramping in the arms or legs trouble with tongue and facial movements, including chewing and swallowing. As the disease progresses, it spreads through the affected limb until eventually all muscle groups become involved. This spread into all muscle groups is the defining characteristic of ALS. In fact, the term amyotrophy refers to the atrophy (wasting) of muscle tissue, while lateral sclerosis refers to the hardening of the spinal column from the buildup of scar tissue (Rowland 2001). The diagnosis of ALS is primarily a clinical one and requires the appearance of both upper (increased tone and reflexes) and lower (fasciculations and muscle atrophy) motor neuron involvement in many segments of the body. Electromyography, nerve conduction studies, and transcranial magnetic stimulation can all be used to support the diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Riluzole, an FDA approved drug for the treatment of ALS, blunts the effects of glutamate by decreasing its release and blocking the ability of glutamate to bind to its receptors, thereby decreasing the excitotoxicity that leads to cell death. Albeit small, its two to three month increase in survival time (Miller 2007) indicates that controlling glutamate levels in the brain could be an essential component in fighting ALS and provides valuable information toward ultimately finding a more effective treatment for the disease (Carlesi 2011). Edaravone (Radicava) was approved by the FDA in 2017 to treat ALS patients (FDA 2017). Edaravone has free radical-scavenging abilities and may reduce oxidative stress, an important aspect of ALS pathogenesis. Edaravone was shown in two controlled clinical trials to slow functional deterioration in a certain subset of ALS patients. The first was a randomized trial of 206 subjects treated with intravenous infusions of either edaravone or placebo for 24 weeks (Abe 2014). While there was no significant difference in overall ALS functional rating scores (ALSFRS-R) between the groups after treatment, post-hoc analysis revealed that subjects in earlier stages of the disease showed a greater treatment effect (Edaravone [MCI-186] ALS 16 Study Group 2017). In order to demonstrate the efficacy in this subgroup, a second trial including 137 subjects in early stages of ALS was conducted. The edaravone group experienced a 33% slower decline in function than the placebo group (Writing Group 2017). Edaravone is generally recommended in addition to riluzole as an adjuvant therapy. Concerns have been raised regarding the safety and efficacy of edaravone treatment (Turnbull 2018). The majority of patients in the second study experienced treatment-related adverse events, likely due to the nature of drug delivery (ie, intravenous infusion). Edaravone has also only been shown to be effective in a small subset of patients with ALS. The remainder of conventional medical treatment for ALS patients focuses on relieving symptoms and improving quality of life. For example, non-invasive positive pressure ventilation is often used to help patients with ALS breathe, especially at night (Mustfa 2006; Lo Coco 2006). Physicians frequently recommend prescription medications to relieve painful muscle cramps (e.g. carbamazepine and phenytoin) (Andersen 2005), excessive salivation (e.g. atropine, amitriptyline, hyoscamine, and injections of botulinum toxin into the salivary glands) (Giess 2000; Lipp 2003; Stone 2009), and other symptoms. ALS patients are often advised to engage in moderate exercise and seek physical therapy to maintain muscle strength and function. As the disease progresses, splints, braces, and wheelchairs are used to help with mobility. Also, higher toilet seats, headrests and specialized utensils may help improve the quality of life for ALS patients (Borasio 2001). Occupational and speech therapy help patients as their motor control gradually deteriorates. 5 Emerging Medical Therapies Stem Cells Stem cells, immature cells that can differentiate into specialized adult cells, may represent the next generation of ALS therapy. However, due to federal restrictions on stem cell therapy as well as the difficulty of designing studies, very few trials have been conducted to date on the treatment of ALS with stem cells. Those that have been conducted, however, are encouraging and early trials show great promise. Researchers have found the following: Bone marrow derived “stem-cell transplantation in the motor cortex delays ALS progression and improves quality of life” (Martinez 2009). Direct injection of bone marrow derived stem cells into the frontal motor cortex (a brain region) of human ALS patients is generally safe and well tolerated (Martinez 2012). Researchers have also experimented with the use of stem cells that express beneficial growth factors as a way of comprehensively treating ALS (Suzuki 2008; Lunn 2009). This therapy offers the potential to alter the course of ALS in afflicted patients. TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) and FUS (fused in sarcoma) Research has identified the cellular protein TDP-43 as an important factor in the cause of ALS, especially the sporadic forms (Mackenzie 2007). TDP-43 binds DNA and RNA in cells, including motor neurons. Aggregates of TDP-43 are found in the motor neurons of patients with ALS, suggesting that they may contribute to ALS pathogenesis. Identification of TDP-43’s involvement in ALS rapidly fueled a breakthrough discovery of an additional causative mutation in the gene encoding another RNA/DNA binding protein called FUS (fused in sarcoma) (Kwiatkowski 2009; Vance 2009). Because both of these proteins have been implicated in ALS, they may represent a novel pathway by which the motor neurons are damaged. This has also opened up the potential for gene therapy, allowing researchers to try to replace defective genes with functional ones, thus slowing or reversing the loss of motor neurons associated with ALS (Lagier-Tourenne 2009; Hester 2009). Researchers are also searching for ways to inhibit TDP-43 aggregation using chemicals such as methylene blue and latrepirdine (Yamashita 2009). IGF-1 and Growth Hormone Insulin-like Growth Factor-1 (IGF-1) is a potent modulator of neuronal growth and function. This neurotrophic factor has the ability to protect neurons both in the central and peripheral nervous system. Researchers have examined the possibility in cell and animal models that IGF-1 could be an effective therapeutic treatment for ALS (Sakowski 2009). Human studies, however, have produced mixed results. Whereas one study found some slowing of the progression of ALS in patients treated with IGF-1 injections (Nagano 2005), others found that subcutaneous (under the skin) injections are not effective in ALS patients (Sorenson 2008). However, the lack of effect with subcutaneous injections could be due to an inability to access the central nervous system. Intraspinal cord delivery has shown promise in animal models (Franz 2009). The use of retroviruses as a potential delivery method for administering IGF-1 to ALS patients has also shown promise (Lepore 2007). Similarly, growth hormone (GH) may be related to ALS as one trial found that ALS patients had impaired GH secretion compared to healthy controls (Morselli 2006). However, the potential therapeutic value of GH replacement therapy needs further investigation as a recent clinical trial found no improvement in ALS patients receiving GH compared to placebo (Sacca 2012). Other Treatments Arimoclomol is an investigational drug that improves the expression of “heat shock proteins”, thereby helping prevent the accumulation of misfolded proteins. Comprehensive in vivo and in vitro studies demonstrated its effect in the prevention of neuronal loss and promotion of motor neuron survival, even after the onset of symptoms. Clinical trials have reported good safety and tolerability (Phukan 2010). Ceftriaxone, a commonly used antibiotic, may also be able to treat ALS by improving reuptake of glutamate. When used in an animal model of ALS, ceftriaxone delayed loss of neurons and muscle strength, thus increasing survival (Rothstein 2005). Dexpramipexole is under development by Knopp Neurosciences and Biogen Idec as a potential neuroprotective therapy for ALS (Cheah 2010). While it has been shown to be safe and well tolerated (Bozik 2011), more research needs to be done to determine its efficacy. Another new medication which is currently being studied in clinical trials is TRO19622 (clinicaltrials.gov 2010). TRO19622 is a cholesterol-like molecule and displays remarkable neuroprotective properties both in vitro and in vivo. TRO19622 is expected to preserve existing neuronal function by delaying or even stopping further progression of the disease. TRO19622 has been granted orphan drug designation status for the treatment of ALS in the USA. This status allows the opportunity to seek ‘fast track’ review by the FDA (Trophos.com 2012). 6 Nutritional Interventions Adequate nutrition is crucial for ALS patients. As the disease progresses, patients gradually lose the ability to chew or swallow with ease. At the same time, the abdominal and pelvic muscles weaken, oftentimes resulting in depression. Patients often lose the ability and desire to eat, making malnutrition a common problem. The recognition that aggressive nutritional intervention is paramount among ALS patients has spurred ardent research efforts aimed at elucidating the potential therapeutic value of dietary supplementation (Cameron 2002). Vitamins and Minerals Vitamin B12 (methylcobalamin). Whereas ultra-high (25mg daily for 4 weeks) intramuscular doses of methylcobalamin (a form of vitamin B12) have been shown to slow muscle wasting (Izumi 2007), low levels of vitamin B12 have been associated with nerve damage in many different animal models. One of the main problems associated with low levels of vitamin B12 is elevated levels of methylmalonic acid (MMA) which is toxic to neurons (Ganji 2012). Low levels of vitamin B12 are also associated with poorly functioning peripheral nerves which can be exacerbated by ALS (Leishear 2011). Vitamin B12 can also prevent damage to the opthalmic nerves by reducing MMA and homocysteine levels, both being associated with oxidative damage (Pott 2012). Low levels of vitamin B12 have also been associated with neuronal degeneration in other models (Moore 2012). Zinc. Mutations to the copper/zinc superoxide dismutase gene are responsible for 2-3% of ALS cases. These mutations result in the SOD enzyme having a reduced affinity for zinc (Ermilova 2005). In fact, the loss of zinc from SOD1 results in the remaining copper in SOD1 becoming extremely toxic to motor neurons (Trumbull 2009). Altering zinc levels within the brain is being studied as a method for treating many different nervous system diseases, including ALS (Grabrucker 2011). However, a study conducted at the Linus Pauling Institute found that large doses of zinc inhibit copper absorption, which can lead to anemia. In the study, researchers added a small dose of copper to animal ALS models receiving zinc and found that the copper prevented early death associated with high doses of zinc (Ermilova 2005). In summary, adding a small amount of copper to the subject’s diets prevented this lethal anemia, suggesting that moderate amounts of zinc supplementation combined with small amounts of copper might help prevent neuron death in ALS. Herbal Supplements Ginseng. In an animal model of ALS, ginseng was shown to significantly delay the onset of ALS symptoms (Jiang 2000). An extract from the ginseng plant called ginsenoside has also been found to increase the expression of SOD1 (Kim 1996). Ginseng and its extracts may also be able to protect motor neurons from apoptosis and membrane damage, further helping to slow the progression of ALS (Radad 2011). Ginkgo biloba. Ginkgo biloba has antioxidant properties (Ernst 2002). Additionally, it has been shown to promote healthy mitochondrial function (Fosslien 2001). During an in vitro study, it was found to protect against glutamate-induced excitotoxicity (Kobayashi 2000). Ginkgo biloba also reduced weight loss in a mouse model of ALS (Ferrante 2001). Ginkgo biloba extract has been shown to protect neurons from death due to oxidative stress (Shi 2009). Additional Support Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) acts as an antioxidant and is essential for proper mitochondrial function (Mancuso 2010). Human studies have found that ALS patients have a higher percentage of oxidized CoQ10 (ubiquinone), a condition the researchers blamed on oxidative stress caused by the disease (Sohmiya 2005). Supplementation with ubiquinol, the reduced (non-oxidized) form of CoQ10 may ameliorate this problem, though no studies have tested this hypothesis. Several animal studies, including the following have supported the benefit of CoQ10 treatment in ALS: In an animal model of familial ALS, administration of coenzyme Q10 significantly extended life span and oral administration significantly increased CoQ10 concentrations in the brains and mitochondria of the test animals (Matthews 1998). As a result of these promising studies in mice, researchers have been testing the benefits of CoQ10 on humans with ALS. One phase II study did not find any substantial benefit of CoQ10 supplementation in patients with ALS (Kauffman 2009). However, more research still needs to be done as CoQ10 plays an important role in mitochondrial function and controlling oxidative stress - two key components of ALS. In addition, it has been noted that high doses of CoQ10 are generally safe (Ferrante 2005). Acetyl-L-carnitine has been shown to improve mitochondrial function (Carta 1993; Virmani 2002; Jin 2008). Acetyl-L-carnitine appears to increase the growth and repair of neurons (Wilson 2010; Kokkalis 2009) while protecting neurons from high levels of glutamate when combined with lipoic acid (Babu 2009). Acetyl-L-carnitine also protects neuron cell cultures from excitotoxicity, one of the putative mechanisms of disease in ALS (Bigini 2002). Acetyl-L-carnitine has also been found to reduce neuromuscular degeneration and increase life span in animal models of ALS (Kira 2006). In one animal study, the effects of acetyl-L-carnitine were increased when administered in conjunction with lipoic acid (Hagen 2002). Lipoic acid. Lipoic acid has been shown to have antioxidant properties as well as increase intracellular levels of glutathione (Suh 2004a; Yamada 2011). It also chelates metals both in the test tube and in animal models (Suh 2004b and 2005). As a result, lipoic acid supplementation might protect neurons from some of the changes that lead to ALS (Liu 2008). Furthermore, lipoic acid has been shown to protect cells against glutamate-induced excitotoxicity (Muller 1995). In one study, administration of lipoic acid improved survival in a mouse model of ALS (Andreassen 2001b). Protein and Amino acids. Adequate protein intake is essential for patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Protein supplementation may help improve the nutritional status of ALS patients, thereby slowing the progression of the disease. A 2010 study found that patients with ALS taking whey protein supplements had improved nutritional and functional parameters as compared to the control group (Carvalho-Silva 2010). Some preliminary data suggests that whey protein may also directly protect motor neurons from oxidative stress, thus delaying the progression of ALS (Ross 2011). A Portuguese study suggested that dietary supplementation with amino acids may have some beneficial effects on the course of the disease (Palma 2005). Creatine. In cells, creatine aids in the formation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the primary source of cellular energy. In multiple animal studies, creatine has been shown to provide protection against neurodegenerative diseases. For example, it has been suggested that creatine helps to stabilize cellular membranes (Persky 2001). Creatine may also lessen the burden of the excitotoxin glutamate in the brain, thus improving survival time in animals with ALS (Andreassen 2001a). In human ALS patients, there is evidence to suggest that creatine may improve mitochondrial function (Vielhaber 2001). In addition, a small preliminary study found that creatine supplementation improves muscle strength in ALS patients (Mazzini 2001). More recent research has confirmed that creatine can protect neurons from toxic processes such as those that drive the progression of ALS. Creatine, due to its antioxidant and anti-excitotoxic properties, has been found to have a significant therapeutic effect in mouse models of ALS (Klopstock 2011; Beal 2011). However, human studies have yielded mixed results (Pastula 2010) which may be due to insufficient sample size (Klopstock 2011). Creatine can cross the blood-brain barrier and gain access to the brain, a treatment which lowered levels of glutamate in the cerebrospinal fluid which may help to protect the brain (Atassi 2010). Glutathione and N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC). Glutathione is an antioxidant which is naturally synthesized by the body. Increasing glutathione levels could help prevent free radical damage to cells (Exner 2000). The glutathione precursor N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) boosts blood levels of glutathione (Carmeli 2012). Patients with ALS tend to have higher levels of oxidized glutathione (glutathione that has already been used to protect the body from free radicals) (Baillet 2010). Increased levels of glutathione can also protect neurons from degeneration in models of ALS (Vargas 2008). Interestingly, cell culture models have shown that ALS is associated with reduced glutathione levels due to mitochondrial dysfunction, and that reduced glutathione levels can result in elevated levels of glutamate (D’Alessandro 2011). Along with being a glutathione precursor, NAC has antioxidant activity of its own. In animal models of ALS, NAC administration has been shown to decrease motor neuron loss, improve muscle mass, and increase survival time and motor performance (Andreassen 2000; Henderson 1996). In addition, NAC supplementation can help thin mucous secretions in the oral cavity which may make swallowing easier (Kuhnlein 2008). Green tea. Green tea contains high concentrations of catechins, flavonoids with strong antioxidant properties (Hu 2002). Green tea extract has been demonstrated to have anti-inflammatory properties as well (Hong 2000). One of these catechins known as epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is of particular interest in the context of ALS. EGCG and other catechins may be able to protect neurons from a variety of diseases (Mandel 2008). EGCG has been found to protect cultures of motor neurons from death due to excessive levels of glutamate (Yu 2010). Motor neurons can also be protected from mitochondrial dysfunction with the addition of EGCG in culture (Schroeder 2009). EGCG can also bind to and inactivate iron, which may help protect motor neurons from the effects of ALS (Benkler 2010). Epidemiological data further supports the following role of tea in its potential protection of neurons: green tea consumption reduces the risk of neurodegenerative diseases (Mandel 2011) and people who drink tea may have a lower risk of developing ALS (Morozova 2008). Pycnogenol® is an extract of marine pine bark that includes procyanidins and phenolic acids (Packer 1999). It has been shown to have antioxidant properties (Packer 1999) as well as protective effects against glutamate excitotoxicity (Kobayashi 2000). Pycnogenol® is a common complementary therapy option among ALS patients (Cameron 2002). In addition, pycnogenol® increased the levels of SOD produced in an animal study (Kolacek 2010). Resveratrol is a powerful antioxidant found in red grape skins and Japanese knotweed (Polygonum cuspidatum). Resveratrol has been found to suppress the influx of excitatory ions into some cell types which is associated with reduced glutamate-induced cell toxicity (Wu 2003). Another way resveratrol may target neurodegenerative diseases is by reducing oxidative stress, both on its own and by increasing the expression of SIRT1 (Sun 2010), a stress-response gene associated with longevity and protection against a number of cellular assaults. Although it is not known what role this gene plays in ALS, increasing SIRT1 expression via resveratrol administration helps protect motor neurons from ALS in cell culture (Kim 2007; Wang 2011). In addition, resveratrol can increase the activity of SOD in cells and protect them from apoptosis and oxidative stress (Yoon 2011). Adding the cerebrospinal fluid from ALS patients to rat motor neuron cell cultures causes the cultured cells to die. One of the intriguing aspects of resveratrol is that it can protect the motor neuron cell cultures from death which is something that riluzole, the only FDA approved drug for ALS, cannot do (Yanez 2011).

It can cause symptoms that come and go, including numbness or tingling, muscle weakness, vision problems and trouble walking or talking. In this protocol, learn about the causes of MS and what treatments are available. Discover how an imbalanced immune system contributes to the inflammation that drives the disease. Vitamin D supplementation has been shown to modulate the immune response in MS and help improve symptoms, in some clinical trials. What is Multiple Sclerosis? Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune and inflammatory disease characterized by destruction of the myelin sheath—the coating that insulates and protects neurons. This demyelination causes disruptions in neural communication and potentially neuronal death, leading to disability. MS may follow several disease courses, the most common of which is relapsing remitting. Relapsing remitting MS is characterized by clearly defined acute attacks followed by periods of remission. Natural interventions such as vitamin D and essential fatty acids may help relieve inflammation and improve symptoms of MS. What are the Risk Factors for Multiple Sclerosis? Genetic predisposition Viral infection (eg, Epstein-Barr virus) Vitamin D deficiency Hormonal imbalance Exposure to organic solvents Food sensitivities Smoking What are the Signs and Symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis? Note: Symptoms of MS vary widely, depending on the location of affected nerve fibers. Symptoms may include: Fatigue Numbness or tingling in limbs Impaired vision Muscle weakness, clumsiness Loss of balance, dizziness, potential nausea and vomiting Bladder dysfunction Changes in memory, reasoning, and spatial perception What are Conventional Medical Treatments for Multiple Sclerosis? Note: There is currently no cure for MS. Treatments include therapies to calm acute attacks, slow or modify the disease course, and alleviate symptoms. Several experimental therapies are currently being evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. Therapies for acute attacks: Corticosteroids Plasmapheresis (plasma exchange to remove inflammatory factors and antibodies) Disease-modifying therapies: Beta interferons to reduce inflammation and slow disease progression Glatiramer acetate, an immunomodulator Immunosuppressant drugs (eg, mitoxantrone) Monoclonal antibodies (eg, natalizumab) Dalfampridine, a potassium channel blocker, to increase the ability of nerve cells to conduct impulses Symptom management may include: muscle relaxants medications to reduce fatigue antidepressants What are Additional Therapies for Multiple Sclerosis? Physical therapy Occupational therapy Speech therapy Cognitive rehabilitation Vocational rehabilitation Swank low-fat diet Hormone therapy What Natural Interventions May Be Beneficial for Multiple Sclerosis? Vitamin D. As vitamin D deficiency is a risk factor for MS, supplementation may be helpful. Several clinical studies have demonstrated that MS patients taking vitamin D had fewer relapses and less inflammation. Essential fatty acids. Omega-3 (ie, DHA and EPA) and certain omega-6 (ie, GLA) fatty acids have been shown to reduce inflammation and improve some symptoms of MS. Antioxidants. Oxidative stress may play a role in the pathogenesis of MS, and MS patients tend to have low levels of the endogenous antioxidant glutathione peroxidase. Supplementing with selenium, vitamin E, vitamin C, and/or N-acetylcysteine may boost glutathione peroxidase levels for potential benefits. Lipoic acid. Lipoic acid has been shown to inhibit the activity of ICAM-1, a protein believed to be involved in the pathogenesis of MS. Supplementation with lipoic acid reduced ICAM-1 levels and T-cell migration into the central nervous system in patients with MS. Vitamin B12. Patients with MS may be deficient in vitamin B12. Supplementation has been shown in several studies to improve symptoms and the clinical course of the disease in patients with MS. Biotin. Biotin (vitamin B7) has demonstrated positive effects in patients with MS. Studies showed high doses of biotin improved measures of MS-related disabilities in some patients. Other natural interventions that may benefit patients with MS include coenzyme Q10, ginkgo biloba, green tea, and curcumin. 2 Introduction Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a disease of autoimmunity and inflammation characterized by destruction of the myelin sheath that insulates and protects neurons. When a patient experiences an ""attack,"" or episode of increased disease activity, the resultant impairment of neuronal communication can manifest as a broad spectrum of symptoms, affecting sensory processing, locomotion, and cognition. Scientific research suggests both genetic and environmental factors contribute to the development of the disease. Current medical treatments for MS include potent immunosuppressive drugs, which reduce immune function, and anti-inflammatory medications as well as invasive procedures such as plasma exchange, which attempts to reduce inflammatory mediators in a patient's blood. Largely ignored and discounted by mainstream medicine, nutrients offer immune-modifying benefits that can help complement pharmacological and clinical interventions and improve quality of life for MS patients. Furthermore, mounting evidence suggests vitamin D may be a missing link in virtually all autoimmune diseases, including MS. This single vitamin has the ability to modulate the immune system in ways that even pharmaceutical drugs cannot. A multitude of epidemiological studies have revealed that individuals with low levels of vitamin D in their blood are at considerably increased risk for developing MS; in fact, up to 90% of MS patients are deficient in vitamin D.1 3 Understanding Multiple Sclerosis Within the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) a vast network of neurons are constantly communicating amongst themselves, and with the peripheral nervous system (outside of the brain and spinal cord), to control every aspect of human function, from sight and hearing, to cognition and mobility. The efficiency and accuracy of communication between individual neurons form the basis for our ability to do things as diverse as complete simple daily tasks and comprehend complex philosophical or mathematical ideas. Neuronal communication is similar to the transmission of an electrical current through a series of wires. Droves of neurons work together to deliver messages to every corner of the body by transmitting signals along their long, cylindrical mid-sections called axons and passing it on to the next neuron. This is repeated until the message reaches its destination. Like electrical wires, neuronal axons require insulation to ensure that they are able to transmit a signal accurately, and at high speeds. Specialized cells called oligodendrocytes provide this insulation to neurons by wrapping the axons in an insulating material called myelin. Without this myelin sheath, neuronal communication becomes nearly impossible, and neurons become susceptible to damage. Multiple sclerosis is a disease which ultimately leads to the inability of neurons to communicate amongst themselves. Because multiple sclerosis is not selective for specific neurons, and can progress through the brain and spinal cord randomly, each patient's symptoms may vary considerably. During the initial stages of the disease, symptoms often emerge for a finite time before regressing for an extended period. 4 Pathology of Disease Progression Demyelination MS is an immuno-inflammatory disease in which immune cells enter the central nervous system (CNS) and destroy the myelin sheath. Immune cells, which become activated through complex mechanisms migrate into the CNS, and attack the myelin sheath. The resultant demyelination is thought to be carried out by T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, and macrophages, three primary classes of immune cells, which are routinely found in MS lesions.2 Loss of myelin followed by subsequent lack of neural communication and neuronal death is accepted as the primary cause of disability in MS patients.3 Axonal transection, or the severing of axons, occurs under conditions of both acute and chronic demyelination.4-6 Remyelination Remyelination is the process by which demyelinated axons are naturally re-wrapped with myelin, restoring nerve conduction and functionality.7 This phenomenon is the result of oligodendrocytes repairing the damage to the myelin sheath that occurs during an episode of increased disease activity. However, as the disease progresses over years (usually decades) the oligodendrocytes begin to lose their ability to repair the damage, and symptoms become progressively worse and episodes more frequent due to remyelination failure. In addition to developing therapies that slow MS disease progression, many laboratories are developing novel therapeutics that aim to promote remyelination and reverse existing CNS damage. Inflammation In addition to immune-mediated loss of myelin, another characteristic feature of MS is inflammation caused by a class of white blood cells called T cells.8,9 Some of the damage in the CNS is directly carried out by two subpopulations of T lymphocytes called T helper 1 and T helper 17 which produce pro-inflammatory factors.10 Recent studies have identified that chemical mediators, interleukin-23 (IL-23) and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), contribute to the autoimmune characteristics of these T cells. Data suggest absence of these pro-inflammatory signals was sufficient to prevent inflammation in the brain.11 This suggests that therapeutic strategies directed at blocking the production of inflammatory mediators could be effective for treating MS. Vitamin D and Multiple Sclerosis: A Panacea? Mainstream medicine has failed to recognize the pivotal role of vitamin D in regulating the overactive immune system in MS patients. Greater than 30 years have passed since vitamin D was originally hypothesized to be an important environmental determinant of the prevalence of MS.12,13 During the three decades following the initial linking of vitamin D and MS, evidence has continued to mount. It is now known that MS occurs more frequently in individuals with lower blood levels of vitamin D. A study published in the prestigious Journal of the American Medical Association found that, compared to those with the highest vitamin D blood levels, those with the lowest blood levels were 62% more likely to develop MS. MS attacks occur less frequently during seasons corresponding with the highest exposure to sunlight; since vitamin D synthesis depends upon exposure of the skin to sunlight, the summer months also bring the highest blood levels of vitamin D.14 A recent study has quantified the impact of vitamin D blood levels on risk for MS relapse—for each 4 ng/ml increase in 25-hydroxy vitamin D in the blood, the risk for MS relapse is reduced by 12%. The investigators who conducted this study concluded that ""Clinically, raising 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels by [20 ng/ml] could halve the hazard of a relapse.""15 Vitamin D mediates these disease-modifying effects through complex and powerful interactions with the immune system. Hostile immune cells, which attack the myelin sheath, are calmed upon exposure to vitamin D. In fact, when aggressive immune cells taken directly from MS patients are exposed to the active form of vitamin D, the cells divide and reproduce much more slowly, indicating that vitamin D has the ability to impede the aberrant autoimmunity that is a driving force in MS. However, vitamin D does more than just arrest damaging immune cells; it also supercharges protective immune cells. T-reg cells are specialized components of the immune system that help keep immunity balanced. If too few T-reg cells are present, the immune system becomes overactive, as in autoimmune diseases like MS. Vitamin D increases the number of protective T-reg cells, restoring equilibrium to an overactive immune system.16 In a randomized controlled trial, supplementation with doses of vitamin D ranging from 10,000 IU to 40,000 IU daily over the course of 52 weeks resulted in a reduction in relapses and a reduction in the number of aggressive immune cells in patients with MS.17 Despite robust findings across a range of studies on the link between vitamin D and MS, mainstream medicine and the federal government have only just recently begun to realize the need to initiate federally funded trials. Results of a large scale, randomized, controlled clinical trial to assess the effects of vitamin D in MS are currently pending.1 Life Extension customers should not be surprised if vitamin D emerges as a frontline treatment for MS in the coming years. However, instead of waiting for mainstream physicians to begin recommending vitamin D to MS patients, Life Extension suggests all individuals monitor their blood levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D and maintain a blood level of 50–80 ng/mL. This is because low vitamin D levels are also an emerging risk factor for numerous other diseases, such as type 1 diabetes, heart disease, and rheumatoid arthritis.18-22 The amount of supplementation required to achieve this blood level varies from person to person, but it appears many individuals require supplementation of 5,000‒8,000 IU vitamin D daily to reach these levels. More information about the role of vitamin D in health is available in the compelling Life Extension Magazine article entitled ""Startling Findings About Vitamin D Levels in Life Extension Members."" 5 Risk Factors for MS Genetics and Family History Studies have established a definitive role for genetics as contributing factor for developing MS. The most compelling data reveal that while unrelated adopted siblings have a 0‒2% disease risk, identical twins demonstrate a 25% disease risk.23 Several studies have identified susceptibility genes related to many aspects of immune function.24-28 While these genetic links are helpful in understanding MS population clusters, findings such as the 25% disease risk among identical twins and the geographic distribution of MS suggest that up to 75% of MS must be attributable to non-genetic or environmental factors. Infection Infection is one of the more widely suspected non-genetic risk factors for MS. Data suggest that, in genetically predisposed individuals, exposure to an infectious agent may lead to MS.29 One common theory, molecular mimicry, proposes that presentation of foreign antigens that are molecularly similar to self-antigens leads to an autoimmune response.30,31 In other words, viruses involved in the development of autoimmune diseases could possibly display very similar proteins to the proteins found on nerves making these nerves also a target for antibodies. Investigators have probed the involvement of several viruses including: herpes simplex virus (HSV), rubella, measles, mumps, and Epstein Barr virus (EBV).32 Currently, the strongest evidence for the involvement of an infectious agent implicates EBV. Virtually all patients who have MS are infected with the EBV.32 Further, levels of antibodies to EBV are strongly correlated with the risk of developing the disease.33 Low Vitamin D Levels Considering the regulatory role that vitamin D plays in immune system reactivity, it is not surprising that population-based studies have consistently found lower levels of vitamin D in the blood of patients with MS compared to healthy control subjects. Data from the Nurses' Health Study (more than 92,000 women followed from 1980 to 2000) and the Nurses' Health Study II (more than 95,000 women followed from 1991 to 2001), support the notion of a protective effect for vitamin D against the risk of developing MS. The incidence of MS was 33% lower in women that consumed the most vitamin D as compared to those that consumed the least. In addition, those that consumed at least 400 IU daily of vitamin D from supplements had an astounding 41% lower incidence of MS.18 In a recent study, researchers at the University of California, San Francisco discovered low 25-hydroxyvitamin D blood levels in African Americans with MS as compared to controls.34 The senior author, who is also the associate director of UCSF Multiple Sclerosis Center concluded, ""It seems relatively clear low vitamin D levels are a risk factor for developing multiple sclerosis."" Hormones Studies have shown that MS is more common in women than men, and that the disease course is affected by the fluctuation of steroid hormones during the female menstrual cycle.35 It is also widely reported that MS patients who become pregnant experience a significant decrease in relapses, enabling women who have MS to bear children safely.36 Animal models of multiple sclerosis have shown that the pregnancy hormone, estriol, can ameliorate disease and can cause an immune shift.36,37 Other studies note that pregnant women who have MS tend to experience a rebound of their disease within three months post-delivery.38 These findings suggest hormones can regulate the course of MS, and this theory is further supported by research demonstrating that steroid hormones (eg, estrogens, testosterone, progesterone, and, dehydroepiandrosterone [DHEA]) can modulate the immune system.39-41 The specific relationship of hormones to the disease process of MS is complex, with ratios between the individual hormones also playing a role. For example, during a human study that examined the presence of MS lesions by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), patients with high estradiol and low progesterone levels had more lesions that those who had low levels of both hormones. Further, patients with a high estrogen to progesterone ratio had a significantly greater number of ""active,"" inflamed lesions than patients who had a low ratio.42 These studies suggest that maintaining youthful hormone balance may ease the symptoms of MS. A study from Italy provided further evidence that abnormal hormone levels may play a role in the development of MS. The investigators measured hormone levels in 35 women and 25 men with MS, and in 36 people without the disease. Women with low testosterone levels were found to have more brain tissue damage, as determined using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The women with MS had lower levels of testosterone throughout their monthly cycle compared to women who did not have the condition. Testosterone levels did not vary between men with MS and unaffected men. However, men with MS who had the highest levels of the female hormone estradiol were found to have the greatest degree of brain tissue damage.43 More information about optimizing and balancing hormone levels can be found in Life Extension's ""Male Hormone Restoration"" and ""Female Hormone Restoration"" protocols. Organic Solvents In the mid-1990s, researchers in Sweden evaluated 13 studies investigating the connection between solvent exposure and autoimmune disease. Organic solvents include chemicals such as toluene, paint thinner, and acetone, the latter of which is commonly found in nail polish remover. Ten of those studies indicated a significant relationship between organic solvent exposure and MS. All of the analyses suggested exposure to solvents increases a person's relative risk of developing MS.44 In another study scientists analyzed the occupational health records of more than 57,000 workers in Norway, covering a 16-year period. They concluded that workers, such as painters, who are routinely exposed to organic solvents, had twice the risk of developing MS than those who were not occupationally exposed. These results were compatible with the hypothesis that organic solvents are a possible risk factor for MS.45 Individuals interested in protecting themselves from organic solvents and other environmental toxins should read Life Extension's ""Metabolic Detoxification"" protocol. Food Sensitivities Sensitivities to certain foods may also play a role in the development or exacerbation of MS. Antibodies to gluten, which is a protein found in wheat, is more common in patients with MS.46,47 MS is also most prevalent in areas where consumption of wheat gluten and milk are also high.48 This relationship led scientists to explore a possible link between antibodies produced to bovine milk proteins and the ability of those antibodies to cross-react to the protective sheathes around nerves triggering an MS episode. Indeed, this immunologic cross-reactivity has been demonstrated in the laboratory in rodents that have MS.49,50 Further investigations have revealed that in MS patients, higher levels of these antibodies are produced within the central nervous system.51 Additional studies are still needed to understand how this cross-reactivity plays into the development and progression of MS. To help rule out food sensitivities, Life Extension suggests blood testing such as the Food Safe Allergy test and the Celiac Disease Antibody Screen. Call 800-226-2370 for more information on how to obtain this type of testing. Additional information about food allergies is available in the Life Extension Magazine article entitled ""What's Really Making You Sick?"" Smoking A recently published literature review, evaluating more than 3,000 MS cases and 450,000 controls, supports the emerging consensus that smoking increases the risk of developing MS by approximately 50%.52 It is unlikely that smoking alone accounts for the worldwide variation in MS prevalence, and thus, the interplay between genetic markers and smoking has also been investigated. One such study reported that smokers that have two known genetic markers for MS had two times the risk for developing MS than their non-smoking counterparts.53 Another study has also verified that smokers diagnosed with MS but in remission have 3.5 times the risk of reactivating and progression of their disease than their non-smoking counterparts.54,55 6 Symptoms and Diagnosis MS can affect people of all ages; however, the average age of disease onset is between 20 and 40 years.48 Fatigue, numbness in the limbs, impaired vision, muscle weakness, loss of balance, and bladder dysfunction are frequent symptoms. Symptoms of multiple sclerosis vary widely, depending on the location of affected nerve fibers.48 Symptoms affecting mobility tend to appear early in the course of MS and they may include weakness, clumsiness, leg dragging, stiffness, and a tendency to drop objects. Common sensory symptoms include numbness, sensations of heaviness, tingling, and electrical sensations. Visual symptoms are also common, affecting more than one-third of all people who have MS. The classic visual disturbances, such as blurred or foggy vision and eyeball pain, usually appear early in the course of the disease. MS can also interfere with the nerves that supply the vestibular apparatus in the inner ear, which is where balance is perceived. This can result in dizziness, nausea, and vomiting. In the later stages of the disease, involvement of the genitourinary tract may result in loss of bladder, sexual, and bowel function.56 Over 40% of MS patients suffer from changes in memory, reasoning, spatial perception, and verbal fluency.57 Symptoms of MS are often triggered or worsened by an increase in body temperature. MS is a tremendously variable and unpredictable disease. Different patients will experience different symptoms, rates of disease progression, and responses to treatment. Four Disease Courses Have Been Identified in MS Progressive relapsing (PR) MS, which is the least common disease course, shows progression of disability from onset but with clear acute relapses, with or without full recovery. Approximately 5% of people with MS appear to have PRMS at diagnosis. Secondary progressive (SP) MS begins with an initial relapsing-remitting disease course, followed by progression of disability. Typically, secondary-progressive disease is characterized by: less recovery following attacks, persistently worsening functioning during and between attacks, and accompanied by progressive disability. Many patients with RRMS do develop SPMS ultimately. Primary progressive (PP) MS is characterized by progression of disability from onset, without plateaus or remissions or with occasional plateaus and temporary minor improvements. A person with PPMS, by definition, does not experience acute attacks. Ten percent of diagnosed MS are PPMS. Relapsing remitting (RR) MS represents 85% of clinical diagnoses of the disease. It is characterized by clearly defined acute attacks with full recovery or with residual deficit upon recovery. Periods between disease relapses are characterized by a lack of disease progression. Diagnosis No single test gives a definitive diagnosis for MS, and variable symptoms and disease course make early diagnosis a challenge. Most presumptive diagnoses of MS are based on the clinical symptoms seen in an acute attack. These presumptions are then supported by a combination of diagnostic imaging with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), antibody testing of the fluid found in the CNS, measurements to evaluate how efficiently nerves conduct impulses (since demyelination slows nerve conduction) and evaluation of how the symptoms progress through time.58 7 Conventional Therapies A cure for MS has yet to be discovered, and although recent efforts have brought advances in available treatments, substantial room for improvement remains. Presently, conventional medical treatment typically focuses on strategies to treat acute attacks, to slow the progression of the disease, and to treat symptoms. Conventional Medical Treatments to Treat Acute Disease Flares Corticosteroids. For acute MS flares, corticosteroids, such as methylprednisolone, are commonly administered in high doses to suppress the immune system and decrease the production of proinflammatory factors. These drugs are often prescribed for short periods and can be effective at alleviating the symptoms of MS. Corticosteroids should not be used for long-term therapy, however, because of their many side effects, including increased risk of infection, osteoporosis, high blood pressure, cataracts, elevated blood sugar, mood swings and weight gain. Also, while corticosteroids may reduce the symptoms of the disease, they have no effect on its progression.59 Plasma exchange (plasmapheresis). Plasmapheresis is a process in which whole blood is separated into blood cells and plasma, the liquid part of blood. In MS patients the plasma contains unusually high levels of antibodies and proinflammatory factors that exacerbate symptoms. Plasma exchange helps remove these factors quickly and is sometimes used to help combat severe symptoms of multiple sclerosis relapses in people who are not responding to intravenous steroids. Conventional Medical Treatment to Modify the Course of the Disease Beta interferons. Beta interferons (Avonex, Betaseron) reduce inflammation and slow progression of the disease, but like many medications used in conventional medical treatment of MS, the mechanism of action is poorly understood60,61 This specific treatment may be accompanied by adverse effects such as suicidal depression, liver damage, flu-like symptoms, and injection site reactions.62 Glatiramer acetate. Glatiramer acetate (Copaxone) is an MS treatment that yields fewer adverse side effects than beta interferon while still remaining clinically effective. Glatiramer has a chemical structure similar to the protective myelin sheath around nerves and serves as a decoy for antibodies that would otherwise attack this sheath.63 Side effects may include flushing, rapid heartbeat, nausea, shortness of breath after injection, and injection site reactions.64 Mitoxantrone and fingolimod. Mitoxantrone (Novantrone) and fingolimod (Gilenya) are immunosuppressants. Clinical data show these drugs can slow the rates at which disability progresses and the rate at which new lesions form in the brain and spinal cord. These therapies, however, are not used as a first-line treatment as they can cause severe side effects including heart disease, leukemia, decreased white blood cell counts, and increased rates of infection.65 Natalizumab. Natalizumab (Tysabri) is thought to block a protein that allows white blood cells to enter the brain and spinal cord and cause disease progression in MS. Due to an association with three cases of a potentially fatal infection of the CNS,66 this is a controversial drug that is only available for patients enrolled in the Tysabri Outreach Unified Commitment to Health (TOUCH) program.67 This medication is reserved for people who do not see results from other types of treatments. Dalfampridine. Dalfampridine (Ampyra) is a medication approved in 2010 that increases the ability of nerve cells to conduct impulses.68 This drug represents a new class of therapies that is aimed at addressing neurologic deficits directly. Medications to Treat Symptoms Muscle relaxants. Multiple sclerosis patients may experience painful or uncontrollable muscle stiffness or spasms, particularly in the legs. Muscle relaxants such as baclofen (Lioresal) and tizanidine (Zanaflex) may improve muscle spasticity. However, baclofen may increase weakness in the legs, and tizanidine may cause drowsiness or a dry mouth. Medications to reduce fatigue. Drugs such as amantadine (Symmetrel) may help reduce fatigue. Other medications. Medications may also be prescribed for depression, pain and bladder or bowel control problems that may be associated with multiple sclerosis. Medications on the Horizon There are approximately 20 experimental therapies that are on the pathway to approval by the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA). Investigators are making progress toward developing treatments that may be capable of protecting the CNS as well as encouraging repair of brain and spinal cord lesions. Many of these drugs are potentially valuable as treatments for MS, but are months or years from traversing all phases of the FDA process. Laquinimod. Laquinimodhas been shown to decrease proinflammatory factors and increase factors that promote nerve protection without increasing risk of infection. Laquinimod was well tolerated by most patients, with only a few reports of adverse effects.69 Alemtuzumab. Alemtuzumab (Campath) is an antibody specific for mature white blood cells that targets them for destruction by the immune system. This drug is approved for the treatment of certain types of lymphoma and leukemia. In one study, it was shown to be more effective than beta interferon in reducing disability progression and relapse rate, however, the trial was discontinued early due to serious side effects.70 Fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is a substance that has been used in the treatment of psoriasis and shows promise in MS to decrease white blood cell infiltration into the spinal cord.71 Therapy and Rehabilitation to Improve Quality of Life In addition to one or more drug-based therapies, MS patients will often participate in rehabilitation programs intended to maintain or improve their ability to perform at home and at work. More specifically these programs focus on general fitness and aim to address problems related to mobility, speech and swallowing, and cognitive deficits. Common rehabilitation strategies include: Physical therapy. Practices that aide mobility and functionality through structured physical activity on a scheduled basis. Occupational therapy. Skills aimed at using work, self-care, and leisure activities to foster development and limit disability. Speech therapy. Work with speech therapists can help MS patients overcome speech and language difficulties and help with troublesome swallowing. Cognitive rehabilitation. Assistance in managing difficulties with memory, high order thinking, and perception. A variety cognitive rehabilitation options are available. For example, playing chess regularly is a great way to promote neuronal function and communication; computer-based ""brain training"" programs are also helpful. Vocational rehabilitation. Support in making career plans, gaining job skills, and approaches to remaining gainfully employed. 8 Multiple Sclerosis Nutritional Protocol Most patients that employ complementary treatments for MS do so as an accompaniment with conventional drug treatments and find both classes of therapy to provide clinical benefits.72 The following section outlines key details and evidence-based findings concerning the latest complementary approaches to treating MS. Vitamin D As previously mentioned, mainstream medicine has overlooked a critical missing link in MS management—vitamin D. This hormone-like vitamin is capable of safely interacting directly with the genome to modulate a variety of physiological functions, including aspects of immune function involved in autoimmune diseases like MS. Two human clinical trials demonstrated that individuals with MS using vitamin D tended to have fewer relapses and less inflammation.17,73,74 In a year-long Vitamin D study, recurrence rate of MS ""attacks"" was 27% lower compared to baseline.74 In another large-dose Vitamin D trial, MS patients given 28,000‒280,000 IU weekly were found to have fewer active lesions during the 28-week long study.75 In light of the accumulating epidemiological and clinical evidence of the importance of vitamin D in this disease, supplementing the diet with vitamin D appears to be a low cost means to address this risk. Omega-3 Fatty Acids Omega-3 fatty acids (FAs) are polyunsaturated FAs which cannot be synthesized in humans and therefore must be provided via dietary sources. Both plant and animal foods are potential sources of omega-3 FAs. For example, linolenic acid, found in flaxseed, flaxseed oil, and preferably, fish and fish oils have very high levels of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). A small study looking at the effects of omega-3 FAs on MS found that immune cells from treated patients and healthy controls produced significantly fewer pro-inflammatory cytokines after three months of treatment with 6 grams of fish oil per day.76 One double-blind placebo-controlled study exists to date looking at the effect of omega-3 FAs on MS disease progression. In this study 312 patients were given either fish oil or olive oil placebo for two years. The results of this trial exhibited a trend toward decreased disease severity in the omega-3 FA group when compared with control.77 More recent studies have shown that MS patients given 10 grams of fish oil per day for three months exhibited significantly reduced levels of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), a factor correlated with disease progression, and also had greater concentrations of omega-3 FAs in their red blood cell membranes.78 Other work has shown that MS patients, while on a low-fat diet with omega-3 FA supplementation, experienced significantly reduced fatigue and lower relapse rates.79 Based upon clinical data and patient accounts, omega-3 FAs appear to be well tolerated and safe with no reports of adverse events. Linoleic Acid and Omega-6 Fatty Acids Linoleic acid is converted to gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), a beneficial omega-6 FA, after it is taken orally. However, this conversion is occasionally impaired, especially during inflammatory disease states.48,80 GLA has been shown to quell inflammation and research involving an animal model of MS has demonstrated that GLA administration significantly improved clinical outcomes when compared with control treatment.81 Some studies have shown significantly reduced relapse rates and disease progression scores, while others have found no differences between treatment and control groups.81-83 A closer look at data from these trials revealed that patients with lower levels of disability at the beginning of the trial exhibited a smaller increase in disability over the study period than did controls. In addition, linoleic acid was found to reduce the severity and duration of MS episodes in patients at all levels of disease severity.84 Selenium and Vitamin E Patients who have MS tend to have abnormally low levels of glutathione peroxidase, a powerful endogenous antioxidant.85,86 Researchers in Denmark conducted a small study in which patients with MS were given an antioxidant mixture containing about 2,000 mcg selenium, 2 grams vitamin C, and 480 mg vitamin E once daily for five weeks. Although glutathione peroxidase levels were initially lower in patients with MS than in normal control subjects, after five weeks of antioxidant therapy, levels of this antioxidant enzyme increased five-fold and reported side effects were minimal.85 ""[O]xidative stress plays an important role in pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis. This finding also suggests the importance of antioxidants in diet and therapy of MS patients.""87 N-Acetylcysteine An effective strategy for increasing the body's supply of the powerful antioxidant glutathione is taking the oral supplement N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a potent antioxidant that serves as a precursor to glutathione.48,88 NAC's potential benefit in the context of MS has been noted by some researchers.48,89 In a rodent MS model, NAC was able to diminish clinical symptoms and pathological evidence of CNS injury, and attenuate inflammation.90 Lipoic Acid Lipoic acid (LA) is a dietary supplement with antioxidant properties and has been studied specifically in MS. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), generated primarily by immune cells, are implicated as mediators of demyelination and nerve damage.91,92 Known to cross the blood-brain barrier, LA decreases the activity of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), which is thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of MS. It is believed that ICAM-1 and other adhesion molecules are responsible for allowing certain pro-inflammatory immune cells, like T-lymphocytes, to enter the CNS, paving the way for induction or exacerbation of inflammation and tissue damage.93-95 In an animal MS model, LA produced a significant reduction of demyelination and infiltration of the CNS by T lymphocytes.96-98 Other researchers have followed up on these studies. In a pilot clinical trial, 37 patients with MS were randomly assigned to receive various doses of LA (up to 2,400 mg/day) or placebo. After two weeks, patients were assessed for levels of ICAM-1 and tolerability of high-dose LA. In addition to being well tolerated by patients, LA treatment was associated with reduced ICAM-1 levels and reduced T-cell migration into the CNS.99 Coenzyme Q10 Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is an antioxidant that is an essential part of healthy mitochondrial function and energy production with potential usefulness in treating MS. Decreased levels of CoQ10 are associated with many disease states, including heart disease, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases.100,101 CoQ10 was low in patients with MS.102 Several clinical trials of CoQ10 have been performed in neurodegenerative disease, such as Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, Alzheimer disease, Friedreich's ataxia, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.103 CoQ10 is a powerful lipid-soluble antioxidant that is also capable of regenerating the antioxidant capacity of vitamin E in the body. Based upon clinical evidence, CoQ10 appears to be well tolerated and safe with potential usefulness in the management of MS. Vitamin B12 Some data suggest patients with MS have abnormally low levels of vitamin B12 in their cerebrospinal fluid, blood serum, or both.104 In fact, clinical vitamin B12 deficiency and MS share remarkably similar characteristics, occasionally rendering correct diagnosis difficult.105 Notably, vitamin B12 plays a key role in the generation of myelin and thus, for decades, integrative physicians have prescribed B12 injections for patients who have MS. Data suggest patients given vitamin B12 supplements have experienced clinical improvements in their symptoms.48 For example, in the United Kingdom, researchers investigated the effects of six months of vitamin B12 (1 mg/week injection) on 138 patients with MS. The researchers concluded that the clinical course of patients with MS improved after beginning vitamin B12 treatment.106 Ginkgo Biloba Ginkgo biloba extracts are primarily composed of flavonoids and terpenoids and have been reported to have properties that can influence neural activity and improve cognitive performance. While controlled trials of the effects of ginkgo biloba on cognitive function have generated inconsistent findings, more recent studies found encouraging results for patients with MS.107-109 In one study, patients received 120 mg of ginkgo biloba extract or placebo twice per day for 12 weeks. Those patients taking ginkgo biloba exhibited improved measures of attention and reported fewer difficulties with memory. Green Tea (Epigallocatechin-3-Gallate) Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is one of many active ingredients of green tea that have been reported to have beneficial effects on the nervous and immune systems. In an animal study of MS, ECGC was found to prevent severity of clinical signs by decreasing inflammation and protecting nerve cells.110 According to animal research, green tea has the ability to significantly increase regulatory T cells which are critical to providing balance to the immune system and suppressing autoimmunity.111 Curcumin Curcumin is an active component of turmeric, a popular Indian spice. Laboratory studies have demonstrated that curcumin has potent anti-inflammatory effects.112 A research group carrying out animal studies has demonstrated exciting findings that curcumin treatment results in a significant reduction in disease severity and a reduction in duration of acute attacks.113 In a follow-up study, laboratory researchers found curcumin not only suppressed disease severity, but also was associated with reduction of levels of IL-17 a cytokine that has been directly implicated in the progression of MS.114 Biotin Biotin, a water-soluble B-complex vitamin, is sometimes referred to as vitamin B7. Biotin participates in biochemical reactions catalyzed by decarboxylase enzymes, supporting energy production and fatty acid and myelin synthesis.115,116 The Adequate Intake for biotin is 30 micrograms, and low-to-moderate amounts are common in multivitamin supplements.117,118 Biotin's role in neuron functioning is evidenced by its therapeutic effect in a rare genetic disease known as biotin-thiamine responsive basal ganglia disease.118 Children affected by this disease experience progressive neurological dysfunction, including speech and motor dysfunction, mental retardation, seizures, and possibly death. Early treatment with biotin and thiamine (vitamin B1) appears to prevent progression in most cases.119,120 More recently, researchers have been exploring biotin's potential benefits in patients with MS. In the first clinical trial to demonstrate the potential of high-dose biotin in MS therapy, 23 patients with progressive MS were treated with 100–300 mg biotin daily for an average of 9.2 months. While improvements were not seen for two to eight months after initiating biotin therapy—suggesting biotin may instigate a slow and progressive repair of MS-related nerve damage—vision improved in all four participants with MS-related optic nerve injury, and motor function and overall disability improved in 16 of 18 participants (89%) with prominent spinal cord involvement.116,118 In a randomized controlled trial, 154 patients with progressive MS received either 100 mg biotin three times daily or placebo for 12 months. Thirteen (12.6%) of the biotin-treated subjects versus none of the placebo subjects exhibited improvements in measures of MS-related disability after nine months that persisted through the end of the trial. In addition, only 4.2% of biotin-treated subjects compared with 13.6% of placebo subjects had progressively worsening disability scores at nine months. At the end of the 12 months, placebo subjects were switched to high-dose biotin, and overall stabilization of disability was seen in all subjects at a 24-month follow-up.121 Biotin levels in the cerebrospinal fluid of MS patients have been observed to be lower than those of healthy people, leading to speculation that low biotin availability may contribute to the pathology of MS.122 Although the mechanism of biotin's ability to prevent or repair nerve damage is unknown, biotin may prevent progressive demyelination by improving mitochondrial function, increasing brain energy production, supporting myelin production by increasing lipid synthesis, and affecting gene expression.118,123 Biotin is excreted through the urinary system, and high doses appear to be well tolerated in trials to date.118,124 However, high doses of biotin may interfere with certain lab tests, including thyroid function tests, leading to misdiagnosis of thyrotoxicosis.117,125,126 In addition, the possibility of teratogenicity has been suggested by animal research124; therefore, the safety of high-dose biotin in pregnancy is not established. Swank Diet Dr. Roy Swank first proposed a connection between increased consumption of saturated animal fat and the incidence of MS in 1950.127 He conducted a study which enrolled 208 patients with MS in the early 1950s, all of whom had experienced at least two acute relapses, and followed their progress over 34 years.128 In this study, patients maintained the now termed Swank diet, which consists of: less than 15 grams/day of saturated animal fat, 10‒15 grams/day of vegetable oil, 5 grams/day of cod liver oil, and one multivitamin. Long-term follow-up results from this study indicate that the patients adhering to the Swank diet experienced reduced MS disease activity and progression of disability when compared to patients that did not follow the regimen. While these results are encouraging, this trial is criticized for its lack of a proper control group and un-blinded design. Nevertheless, the Swank diet remains one of the most popular complementary approaches to treating MS. Swank Low-Fat Diet: Detailed Guidelines Saturated fat should remain less than 15 grams per day Unsaturated fat should be approximately 20‒50 grams per day No red meat should be consumed during the first year After the first year, a maximum of 3 oz. of red meat per week Dairy products must have 1% butterfat or less Processed foods containing saturated fat should not be eaten A source of omega-3, a multivitamin, and a mineral supplement are recommended daily Wheat, gluten or dairy product quantities are not restricted, unless they are foods which cause allergies or reactions. 9 Hormone Therapy Because women often experience improvement of MS symptoms while pregnant, hormone therapy using estrogen has been studied as a treatment for the disease. In human studies, estriol treatment (8 mg/day) in nonpregnant women with MS was associated with reduced lesion numbers and lesion volumes and when treatment ceased, these values returned to levels observed before treatment.37 Patients given estriol also had enhanced cognitive function. With respect to immune studies, estriol was associated with reduced pro-inflammatory and increased anti-inflammatory cytokine production and these changes correlated well with the reduced formation of lesions.39 Other studies have shown that male MS patients treated with 10 mg of testosterone exhibited improved cognitive performance and reduced brain atrophy, although MRI data showed no change in lesion formation.129 In another similar study, testosterone treatment in males was associated with reduced production of inflammatory cytokines and increased production of neuroprotective factors.130 There is currently debate among researchers about the role of hormones with MS and how that relationship may be exploited as a means of therapy. Some studies argue for hormone replacement as a new therapeutic approach.131 More information can be found in Life Extension's ""Male Hormone Restoration"" and ""Female Hormone Restoration"" protocols.

ef9b593c-0a6b-4a6f-8177-00e867f42e12,"Standardized assessment of the signal intensity increase on unenhanced T1-weighted images in the brain: the European Gadolinium Retention Evaluation Consortium (GREC) Task Force position statement   , on behalf of the GREC, European Gadolinium Retention Evaluation Consortium and the ESNR, European Society of Neuroradiology , –() After the initial report in 2014 on T1-weighted (T1w) hyperintensity of deep brain nuclei following serial injections of linear gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs), a multitude of studies on the potential of the marketed GBCAs to cause T1w hyperintensity in the brain have been published. The vast majority of these studies found a signal intensity (SI) increase for linear GBCAs in the brain—first and foremost in the dentate nucleus—while no SI increase was found for macrocyclic GBCAs. However, the scientific debate about this finding is kept alive by the fact that SI differences do not unequivocally represent the amount of gadolinium retained. Since the study design of the SI measurement in various brain structures is relatively simple, MRI studies investigating gadolinium-dependent T1w hyperintensity are currently conducted at multiple institutions worldwide. However, methodological mistakes may result in flawed conclusions. In this position statement, we assess the methodological basis of the published retrospective studies and define quality standards for future studies to give guidance to the scientific community and to help identify studies with potentially flawed methodology and misleading results. • A multitude of studies has been published on the potential of the marketed GBCAs to cause T1w hyperintensity in the brain. • The gadolinium-dependent T1w hyperintensity in the brain depends on patient’s history, types of GBCAs used (i.e., vs. macrocyclic GBCAs) and MR imaging setup and protocols. • Quality standards for the design of future studies are needed to standardize methodology and avoid potentially misleading results from retrospective studies.

Quality of life (QoL) has gained increasing importance in multiple sclerosis (MS). We aimed to assess QoL and potentially associated factors such as depression, sexual dysfunction and work absenteeism in patients starting glatiramer acetate (GA) in clinical practice. A prospective cohort study carried out in relapsing-remitting MS patients starting GA as first-line treatment. Patient information on QoL (Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life-54 [MSQoL-54]), depression (Beck Depression Inventory), sexual dysfunction (Multiple Sclerosis Intimacy and Sexuality Questionnaire-19) and work absenteeism was assessed from starting GA to week 96. Ninety-eight evaluable patients were enrolled in the study (mean age, 38.0 ± 8.4 years; female, 69.4%; mean MS duration, 42.6 ± 62.9 months; annual relapse rate since MS diagnosis, 0.4), and followed up at weeks 24 (n=96), 48 (n=94), 72 (n=89) and 96 (n=80). Patient QoL was preserved during the study, with improvements on the MSQoL-54 subscales of change in health (p<0.05) and health distress (p<0.05). Depression, primary and secondary sexual dysfunction remained stable, but the number of patients with tertiary sexual dysfunction decreased at week 96 (p<0.05). Work absenteeism also decreased over the study (p<0.01). Depression, sexual dysfunction and work absenteeism affected MSQoL-54 physical and mental health composites (p<0.05). QoL of our patients was preserved during the 96-week administration of GA. Though depression, sexual dysfunction and work absenteeism impair patient QoL, they remained stable or even improved during the study. Absenteeism; Depression; Glatiramer acetate; Quality of life; Multiple sclerosis; Sexual dysfunction Quality of life assessment in patients with has gained increasing importance as it encompasses all aspects of patients lives that may be affected by the disease. Though patients quality of life worsens as multiple sclerosis progresses and physical function deteriorates, it depends not only on the disability caused by physical limitations but also on their emotional status, which may also affect the perception of wellbeing and quality of life [-]. In this scenario, depression has been shown to have a notable impact on quality of life, and is considered a significant and independent predictor of impaired quality of life [-]. Sexual dysfunction is another common and often underestimated clinical symptom of multiple sclerosis that, along with its emotional , has been shown to affect patients quality of life [,]. The information available on the impact of sexual dysfunction on quality of life, however, is still limited. The consequences of multiple sclerosis often negatively affect patients working life and may even lead to permanent unemployment []. This unemployment represents one of the factors that most modifies patients way of living as a result of its influence on their usual activities or interests and its impact on increasing emotional distress [], while sustaining employment has been shown to be associated with improved quality of life [,]. First-line disease-modifying drugs for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis including (INFb)-1a, INFb-1b and glatiramer acetate have been shown to improve the course of the disease. However, their effect on patients quality of life has not yet been fully clarified. Indeed, the information available on INFb's effect on quality of life is controversial, ranging from some benefit [] to absence of effect [-] or even to quality of life detriment []. The effect of glatiramer acetate treatment on quality of life has not been well assessed, and improvements in quality of life have been reported in treatment-naïve patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis six months after starting GA treatment that were sustained for another six months []. In light of the above, this study aimed to expand the information available on quality of life and potentially associated factors such as depression, and work absenteeism in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis starting glatiramer acetate as first-line treatment in clinical practice. This study was conducted in the Departments of at 37 Spanish hospitals in accordance with the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki, all its amendments and national regulations. The study was approved by the ethic committee of Hospital Donostia (San Sebastián, Spain) and all patients gave their written informed consent. Between November 2009 and November 2010, all patients meeting selection criteria who agreed to participate in the study were consecutively recruited into the study. Inclusion criteria were patients aged 18 to 60 years, with a diagnosis of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, no previous treatment for multiple sclerosis and a score of 5.5 or less on the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). Patients were to start (Copaxone®, Teva Pharmaceuticals Ltd., London, United Kingdom) for multiple sclerosis treatment and must not have had any cognitive impairment that precluded understanding of the patients information sheet and informed consent form. This was a prospective cohort study conducted in patients with -remitting multiple sclerosis receiving glatiramer acetate treatment for multiple sclerosis and followed-up for two years according to clinical practice. All treatments were administered from commercial sources and according to routine clinical practice. No restrictions regarding patients treatment were specified in the study protocol. Patients information was retrieved from their medical charts at the start of glatiramer acetate treatment (baseline) and at weeks 24, 48, 72 and 96. The data retrieved at these visits included , medical history of multiple sclerosis, patients disability according to the EDSS [], quality of life measured according to scores on the Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Live-54 (MSQoL-54) questionnaire [,], depression according to scores on the 21-item Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) [,], sexual disfunction according to the Multiple Sclerosis Intimacy and Sexuality Questionnaire-19 (MSISQ-19), [,] and work absenteeism related to multiple sclerosis according to the occurrence of work absenteeism, the number of working days missed and the causes of work absenteeism. EDSS scores, which range from 0 (normal neurological status) to 10 (death from multiple sclerosis), were obtained by the same researcher in a given patient. The MSQoL-54 questionnaire consists of 54 items distributed in 12 multiple-item scales and two single-item scales, including questions from the Short Form 36-Item Health Survey as a generic core measure and 18 additional items specific for multiple sclerosis that assess health , sexual function, overall quality of life, cognitive function and energy. Physical and mental health composite scores are calculated as a simplified two-dimension solution to MSQoL-54 questionnaire. The composites scores range from 0 (poor health) to 100 (optimal health). The BDI is composed of 21 categories of symptoms and attitudes which describe a specific behavioral manifestation of depression and consist of a graded series of four to five self-evaluative statements. Numerical values are assigned for each statement from 0 (neutral) to 3 (maximal severity) indicating the degree of severity of the manifestations of depression. Total scores range from 0 to 63, where higher scores indicate worse depressive states. Patients may also be categorized as having ups and downs considered normal if their BDI scores were 10 or less, as having mild mood disturbance if their BDI scores were between 11 and 16, as having borderline clinical depression if their BDI scores were between 17 and 20, as having moderate depression if their BDI scores were between 21 and 30, as having severe depression if their BDI scores were between 31 and 40 and as having extreme depression if their BDI scores were higher than 40. The cut-off value of at least 17 points was established as suggestive of the presence of depression. The MSISQ-19 consists of 19 items assessing the perceived influence of multiple sclerosis symptoms on sexual activity and satisfaction. Scores on the MSISQ-19 show the presence of primary, secondary and tertiary sexual dysfunction. Primary sexual dysfunction occurs as a result of neurologic changes related to multiple sclerosis that directly affect sexual feelings and/or sexual response, secondary sexual dysfunction refers to physical changes related to multiple sclerosis that affect the sexual response indirectly and tertiary sexual dysfunction refers to psychological, emotional, social and cultural aspects of multiple sclerosis that impact upon sexuality. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change in patients quality of life during the 96-week study period, measured according to scores on the physical and mental health composites of the MSQoL-54 questionnaire. Sample size was calculated to fulfill the primary objective of the study. At the time of study design, the only data available on the impact of multiple sclerosis therapy on quality of life measured by the MSQoL-54 questionnaire was reported by Simone et al., who found that multiple sclerosis patients followed up for two years experienced a decrease of six or more points in 80% of MSQoL-45 measurements (dimensions and summary composite scores), with an standard deviation of approximately 20 points []. Taking into account these data, an alpha risk of 0.05 and a beta risk of 0.20 in a two-sided analysis, the number of evaluable patients needed to be enrolled into the study to detect a difference of six or more points in MSQoL-54 scores would be of 92 patients; considering a percentage of missing data of 20% or lower, e.g. due to non-evaluable patients, the total sample size would be of 110 patients. Analysis of the primary endpoint included the calculation of mean scores and standard deviations (SD) of both physical and mental health composites of MSQoL-54 questionnaire throughout the study. Comparison of these scores during the study was performed using the repeated measures general linear model. Comparison of scores on the MSQoL-54 questionnaire at baseline with those reported at week 24, 48, 72 and 96 were also performed using paired t-tests. The secondary endpoints included assessment of depression, sexual dysfunction and work absenteeism at baseline. Other secondary endpoints were the change in depression, sexual dysfunction and work absenteeism during the study and their impact on patients quality of life. The distribution of patients according to the following categories of the BDI was calculated as the frequency and valid percentage in each study visit: ups and downs considered normal (BDI scores, =10), mild mood disturbance (BDI scores, 11-16), borderline clinical depression (BDI scores, 17-20), moderate depression (BDI scores, 21-30), severe depression (BDI scores, 31-40) and extreme depression (BDI scores, >40). The overall frequency of patients with depression, which was defined as a BDI score =17, was also calculated. Comparison of mean BDI scores and the proportion of patients within the above categories during the study was performed using paired t-tests and McNemars tests, respectively. The impact of depression on patients quality of life was assessed comparing the scores on the physical and mental health composites of MSQoL-54 questionnaire reported by patients with those without depression using t-tests or Mann-Whitney tests. The frequencies and valid percentages of patients with primary, secondary and tertiary sexual dysfunction according to MSISQ-19 scores were calculated in each study visit. The overall frequency of sexual dysfunction in each study visit was also assessed according to patients with at least one of these categories (primary, secondary or tertiary sexual dysfunction). Changes during the study were assessed using McNemars tests. The impact of sexual dysfunction on patients quality of life was assessed comparing the scores on the physical and mental health composites of MSQoL-54 questionnaire between patients without sexual dysfunction and those with any kind of sexual dysfunction by using Mann-Whitney tests. Work absenteeism related to multiple sclerosis was assessed according to the frequency and valid percentage of patients missing at least one day from work, the mean (SD) number of working days missed and the causes for work absenteeism. Changes in the frequency of patients absent from work and the number of working days missed during the study were assessed using McNemars tests and Wilcoxon tests, respectively. The impact of work absenteeism on patients quality of life was assessed by comparing the scores on the physical and mental health composites of the MSQoL-54 questionnaire in patients at least one day absent from work versus those with no day absent from work using Mann-Whitney tests. A correction method for multiple testing was not performed in the statistical analysis for the present study due to the controversy about its use in observational studies leading to potential risks and errors [,]. Further information on this subject is provided in Appendix 1. Missing data were not considered in the analyses and a significance level of 0.05 was used for statistical testing. The statistical analyses were performed with the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA). A total of 101 patients agreed to participate in the study, three of whom were excluded from the analysis due to insufficient available data. Therefore, the evaluable population comprised a total of 98 patients, whose characteristics are described in Table 1. Patients disposition during the study is shown in Figure 1. When paired comparisons were performed to assess differences in EDSS scores from baseline, it was shown that the mean EDSS scores remained stable throughout the study period but with a slight tendency to improvement at week 96 (mean [SD], 1.1 [0.3] versus 1.0 [0.2], p=0.058). In addition, the proportion of patients with minimal disability slightly increased and the proportion of patients with moderate disability that did not need any technical aid slightly decreased, though not significantly, reaching 95.0% (n=76) and 5.0% (n=4) of patients, respectively, at week 96. Even though scores on the MSQoL-54 questionnaire improved slightly during the 96-week study period, the results obtained from the repeated measures general linear model showed that statistically significant differences were not attained in either the physical or mental health composites (Figure 3). Similarly, comparison of scores on the physical and mental health composites between baseline and weeks 24, 48, 72 and 96 only showed statistically significant differences in the mental health composite at week 72, in which the scores were significantly higher than baseline (mean [SD], 70.6 [15.3] versus 73.9 [15.9], p<0.05; Figure 4). In addition, consistent statistically significant improvements from baseline to weeks 24, 48, 72 and 96 were observed in the MSQoL-54 subscales of change in health and health distress (Figure 4). A total of 65 (66.3%) patients reported experiencing ups and downs considered normal according to the BDI at baseline, while 20 (20.4%) patients showed mild mood disturbance, 10 (10.2%) borderline clinical depression and 3 (3.1%) patients moderate depression. Therefore, a total of 13 (13.3%) patients showed overall depression (Table 2). No significant differences were found in either the mean BDI scores or the distribution of patients among the BDI categories throughout the study. The analysis of the impact of depression on patients quality of life showed that patients with depression reported worse scores on both physical and mental health composites of the MSQoL-54 questionnaire throughout the study period (Figure 5a). Multiple sclerosis intimacy and sexuality questionnaire-19 The overall frequency of patients with baseline sexual dysfunction according to MSISQ-19 scores reached 43 (45.3%) patients, and remained stable throughout the 96-week study period. When the type of sexual dysfunction according to MSISQ-19 was analyzed at baseline, primary sexual dysfunction was found in 31 (32.6%) patients, secondary sexual dysfunction in 21 (22.1%) patients and tertiary sexual dysfunction in 17 (17.9%) patients (Table 2). Distribution of patients with primary and secondary sexual dysfunction did not significantly change from baseline to weeks 24, 48, 72 or 96. However, the proportion of patients with tertiary sexual dysfunction tended to decrease from baseline to week 72 (p=0.057), reaching statistically significance at week 96 (p<0.05). The presence of sexual dysfunction was shown to worsen patients quality of life, as patients with sexual dysfunction reported lower scores on the physical and mental health composites of the MSQoL-54 questionnaire during the whole study period (Figure 5b). *p<0.001; p<0.005; p<0.01; §p<0.05. D: depression; MHC: mental health composite; ND: no depression; NSD: no sexual dysfunction; NWA: no work absenteeism; PHC: physical health composite; SD: sexual dysfunction; WA: work absenteeism. At baseline, 46 (52.9%) patients reported having missed at least one day from work in the previous six months due to multiple sclerosis. The mean (SD) number of working days missed was 45.8 (56.5) days and the main reasons for work absenteeism were clinical signs of multiple sclerosis and disease relapses (Table 2). When work absenteeism was analyzed over the whole study, statistically significant decreases from baseline were observed in the proportion of patients missing at least one day from work at week 24 (p<0.01), week 48 (p<0.001), week 72 (p<0.01) and week 96 (p<0.01). Even though the number of working days missed from work decreased from baseline, statistically significant differences were only reached at week 48 (p<0.05). Work absenteeism was associated with patients quality of life during the 96-week study period, as patients absent from work reported worse scores on both the physical and mental health composites of the MSQoL-54 questionnaire at baseline, week 24, week 48, week 72 and week 96 (Figure 5c). This prospective cohort study showed that the quality of life of our population of patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis was preserved during the 96-week administration of glatiramer acetate under clinical practice conditions. Although glatiramer acetate treatment may have played a role in slowing down worsening of multiple sclerosis, this finding must be considered with caution since our patient population had intrinsically low disease activity in terms of EDSS scores and annual relapse rate. However, other studies also showed low disease activity in patients treated under clinical practice conditions [,], and another reported early gain in quality of life measured by the Leeds Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life scale in patients receiving glatiramer acetate in daily practice []. A protective effect on quality of life of other first-line treatments for multiple sclerosis such as IFNb has also been previously suggested in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis[], whose quality of life measured by the MSQoL-54, Short Form 36-Item Health Survey and Functional Assessment of Multiple Sclerosis questionnaires remained stable for up to three years [-]. However, though some improvements in the physical health composite of the MSQoL-54 questionnaire have been reported after two years of treatment with IFNb [], detriments in patients quality of life have also been reported during the same duration of IFNb treatment, mainly as a result of worsening of the mental health composite []. In our study, disability, depression, primary sexual dysfunction and secondary sexual dysfunction were observed to remain stable during the study period, while tertiary sexual dysfunction and work absenteeism due to multiple sclerosis were significantly improved at week 96. Maintenance of disability even during 15 years of glatiramer acetate administration has been previously reported, showing a mean EDSS change of 0.6 points from the start of treatment []. However, since the EDSS is highly dependent on ambulation and does not provide information on parameters associated with patients wellbeing [], other parameters that might be potentially associated with patients wellbeing needed to be assessed. Indeed, our results support the influence of depression, sexual dysfunction and work absenteeism on the quality of life of patients with relapsing remitting-multiple sclerosis. These results are in line with previous studies reporting that multiple sclerosis patients with lifetime major depression show lower quality of life measured by the MSQoL-54 questionnaire, mainly in terms of energy, mental health, cognitive function, general quality of life, and emotional role limitations []. Depression measured according to the BDI or the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression has been reported to be associated with both physical and mental health composites of the MSQoL-54 questionnaire [-], regardless of the disease-related physical disability and disease type []. Depression has been claimed to be a significant independent predictor of impaired patient quality of life measured using the MSQoL-54 and Functional Assessment of Multiple Sclerosis questionnaires [-]. Patients with sexual dysfunction have also been shown to have poorer quality of life, with significantly lower scores on all scales of the Short Form 36-Item Health Survey [] and on all of scales of the MSQoL-54 questionnaire except for pain and cognitive function []. Similar detriments in quality of life were observed in unemployed versus unemployed patients, who had lower scores on most dimensions of the MSQoL-54 questionnaire [,], suggesting the importance of sustained employment after the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis []. Though the low disease activity of our study patient population does not allow conclusions to be drawn about the effect of glatiramer acetate, decreased work absenteeism has previously been reported in patients receiving this agent [,]. In addition, there is no evidence that glatiramer acetate aggravates depression and it might even induce an antidepressant effect through its neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory activity []. Indeed, switching to glatiramer acetate has been recommended when a depressive episode is confirmed in patients receiving INFb []. Moreover, recently published data on patients switching from IFNb to glatiramer acetate [], and preliminary results from ongoing studies in patients switching to glatiramer acetate [,] showed patients quality of life remained stable or even improved. The authors acknowledge that although observational studies provide valuable information on treatments administered in clinical practice, their limitations should be considered when interpreting the results. The open-label study design, the absence of a comparator group and the potential regression to the mean effect should also be taken into account. In addition, data on other factors that might have influenced patients quality of life such as relapses, fatigue and treatment-related adverse events were not retrieved, and longer follow-up might have been needed for potential differences to become evident. The low disease activity of the study patient population precluded drawing conclusions about the effect of glatiramer acetate and may limit the representativeness of the study findings. Though caution is advisable when interpreting the study results, we consider that they still provide helpful information to physicians when treating multiple sclerosis in clinical practice. In conclusion, the study results show that the quality of life of our population of patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis was preserved during the 96-week administration of glatiramer acetate in clinical practice conditions. Depression, sexual dysfunction and work absenteeism due to multiple sclerosis are factors that significantly impair patients quality of life. However, our study shows stable disability, depression and primary/secondary sexual dysfunction as well as improved tertiary sexual dysfunction and work absenteeism. The study findings should be interpreted with caution based on the low disease activity of the patient population. Further research is still needed to confirm the effect of glatiramer acetate, and to increase knowledge of other potentially associated factors, the long-term effect of multiple sclerosis therapies and the impact of the switch to glatiramer acetate on patients quality of life. There is currently no unanimity about the use of multiple test corrections (methods such as those of Bonferroni, Holm, Benjamini, etc.). In general, these methods reduce the probability of making type I errors, but they increase the probability of making type II errors. It seems cautious to prioritize minimizing the probability of type I errors over type II errors in studies where: several treatments are compared, probabilistic independence is expected between analysis groups and/or variables that would give rise to multiple tests, results have confirmatory implications for practical use. Methods of correcting for multiple testing provide solutions for these situations. However, if any of the above conditions are not a priority or are not applicable to the study, it would be cautious to minimize the probability of making a type II error rather than a type I error. Using multiple test corrections would minimize type I errors, but it would also increase the probability of type II errors, which would imply that differences that are really related to the phenomena under study would not be detected. In the present study, the effect of only one treatment was assessed during the study follow-up, and its use was supported by certain evidence of effectiveness. Therefore, it appears reasonable to assume the overall absence of probabilistic independence in the measurements of variables of patients included in the study. Consequently, the authors decided to prioritize the avoidance of increasing the probability of committing type II errors. For readers who may be interested in the effect of multiple test corrections, Bonferroni correction would result in a p-value that was estimated to be of 0.0003 for the analyses carried out in this study. The authors would also like to explain that significant p-values of the study analyses were classified to be shown in the article as p<0.05, p<0.01, p<0.005 or p<0.001. The data included in this appendix is intended to provide the reader interested in knowing more about multiple test corrections with some information to interpret the study results based on the multiple test correction approach used. Finally, the authors would like to advise the reader that the study conclusions should not be considered as definitive. As mentioned in the article, the study findings should be interpreted with caution and further research is still needed to confirm them.
