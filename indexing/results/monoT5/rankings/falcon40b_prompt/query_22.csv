To find out if you're at risk of developing type 2 diabetes in the next five years, complete this short 12 question health check. The Australian Type 2 Diabetes Risk Assessment Tool was developed by the Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute on behalf of the Australian, state and territory governments as part of the COAG initiative to reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. Age, family history, genetics and your lifestyle can have an effect on whether you develop type 2 diabetes. The older you are the more you are at risk. People of Aboriginal, Torres Strait Islander, Pacific Island or Maori descent have a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes that the rest of the Australian population. Where you were born can increase your risk of developing type 2 diabetes. If a family member lives with diabetes, you may have an increased risk of developing it too. For example as the result of a blood test or during pregnancy. High blood pressure, combined with other risk factors such as being overweight or smoking, can put you at a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes. A healthy diet includes 2 serves of fruit and 5 serves of vegetables every day. Healthy eating can reduce your risk of developing type 2 diabetes. For example, 30 minutes a day on 5 or more days a week. If you have a tape measure, run it halfway between the bottom of your ribs and the top of your hipbone, in line with your navel. If you don't have a tape measure choose from the drop size menu. This means your risk of developing type 2 diabetes within 5 years is Low. It’s important to keep up the good work and maintain your healthy diet and active lifestyle. This means your risk of developing type 2 diabetes within 5 years is It’s important to keep up the good work and maintain your healthy diet and active lifestyle.

We suggest that you make an appointment with your doctor asap for a diabetes test. It’s important to act now and make changes that include a balanced diet and exercise to prevent type 2 diabetes. Approximately one person in every 100 will develop diabetes. Approximately one person in every 50 will develop diabetes. Approximately one person in every 30 will develop diabetes. Approximately one person in every 14 will develop diabetes. Approximately one person in every 7 will develop diabetes. Approximately one person in every 3 will develop diabetes. You scored . Here are details on your score and what each category means for your health. Age is among the risk factors for type 2 diabetes. The older you are the more at risk you are. Gender can impact your risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Men have a higher incidence of type 2 diabetes than women. 3. Are you of Aboriginal, Torres Strait Islander, Pacific Islander, or Maori descent? Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are around three times more likely than non-Indigenous Australians to develop diabetes or pre-diabetes. 4. Are you of Asian descent (including Indian sub-continent)? People born in Asia (including the Indian subcontinent) have an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. People born in Asia, on the Indian subcontinent and some in parts of Europe have an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. 6. Have either of your parents, or any of your brothers or sisters, been diagnosed with diabetes? (type 1 or type 2) Family history is a risk factor for type 2 diabetes. If anyone in your family is living with diabetes, you have an increased risk of developing the condition. 7. Have you ever been told by a doctor that you have high blood glucose (sugar)? A person with high blood glucose levels is at a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes than those with normal blood glucose levels. 8. Are you currently taking medication for high blood pressure? High blood pressure, when combined with other risk factors such as being overweight or smoking, can put you at a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes. 9. Do you currently smoke cigarettes or any other tobacco products on a daily basis? Your lifestyle can increase your risk of developing type 2 diabetes. There is a direct link between smoking and many health conditions. The more you smoke, the more at risk you are. Quitting smoking isn’t easy, but it is one of the best things you can do for your health. A healthy diet which includes daily serves of fresh fruit and vegetables can reduce your risk of developing type 2 diabetes 11. On average, would you say you do at least 2.5 hours of physical activity per week? An active lifestyle helps maintain a healthy weight and reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. People who are inactive are at a higher risk of developing the condition. Maintaining a healthy weight is important for good health. Waist measurement is one way to measure being overweight. If you are overweight, you are at higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes. A full copy of our privacy policy is located at or can be obtained by calling .

1e619e7a-bd5e-4a2a-ad14-4e0197c7c6b6,"Type 2 diabetes develops when your body's cells are unable to take in and process the insulin your pancreas produces. You develop what is called ""insulin resistance.""  In some cases, your body may not be able to produce enough insulin to get the needed glucose into your cells. People who have the following medical conditions are also more likely to develop type 2 diabetes: (Hypertension). People who have consistent readings of 140/90 mm Hg or higher. Women with this disorder have problems that may include infertility, lack of menstrual periods, obesity and insulin resistance. Genetics plays a major role in type 2 diabetes. Having a parent or sibling with diabetes is one of the strongest risk factors. However, you must also have environmental risk factors. People who have strong family histories without environmental factors may not develop the disease. Some of the environmental triggers for type 2 diabetes include: High-fat, high-calorie diets and little exercise contribute to obesity, one of the strongest triggers for developing type 2 diabetes. About 80 percent of people who have type 2 diabetes are overweight. The risk of diabetes due to obesity increases among children and people who have been overweight for a long period of time. People in the U.S. and Europe who eat a Westernized diet that is high in fat and low in fiber often develop type 2 diabetes. People who spend more time sitting than moving and who get little exercise are more apt to develop type 2 diabetes.

However, having a family member with type 1 diabetes slightly increases the risk of developing the disease. Environmental factors and exposure to some viral infections have also been linked to the risk of developing type 1 diabetes. Several risk factors have been associated with and include: *Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) is a category of higher than normal blood glucose, but below the threshold for diagnosing diabetes. Changes in diet and physical activity related to rapid development and urbanisation have led to sharp increases in the numbers of people developing diabetes. Pregnant women who are overweight, have been diagnosed with IGT, or have a family history of diabetes are all at increased risk of developing gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). In addition, having been previously diagnosed with gestational diabetes or being of certain ethnic groups puts women at increased risk of developing GDM. Brief questionnaires are simple, practical and inexpensive ways to quickly identify people who may be at a higher risk of type 2 diabetes and who need to have their level of risk further investigated. The , developed in 2001, is an example of an effective questionnaire that can be used as the basis for developing national questionnaires which take into account local factors. It has eight scored questions, with the total test score providing a measure of the probability of developing type 2 diabetes over the following 10 years. The reverse of the form contains brief advice on what the respondent can do to lower their risk of developing the disease, and whether they should seek advice or have a clinical examination. The test takes only a couple of minutes to complete and can be done online, in pharmacies or at various public campaign events. IDF has developed an IDF type 2 diabetes online diabetes risk assessment which aims to predict an individual’s risk of developing type 2 diabetes within the next ten years. The test is based on the Finnish Diabetes Risk Score (FINDRISC) developed and designed by Adj. Prof Jaana Lindstrom and Prof. Jaakko Tuomilehto from the National Institute for Health and Welfare, Helsinki, Finland. Click on the image below to take the test. The International Diabetes Federation (IDF) is an umbrella organization of over 230 national diabetes associations in 170 countries and territories. It represents the interests of the growing number of people with diabetes and those at risk. The Federation has been leading the global diabetes community since 1950.

Reviewed By: Type 2 diabetes can affect all people, regardless of age. Early symptoms of type 2 diabetes may be missed, so those affected may not even know they have the condition. An estimated one out of every three people within the early stages of type 2 diabetes are not aware they have it. Diabetes interferes with the body's ability to metabolize carbohydrates for energy, leading to high levels of blood sugar. These chronically high blood sugar levels increase a person's risk of developing serious health problems. Over the long term, potential consequences of untreated high blood sugar include: Although people with type 2 diabetes may not have specific symptoms, an increase in thirst is one symptom that is characteristic of the condition. The increased thirst can accompany other symptoms like frequent urination, feelings of unusual hunger, dry mouth, and weight gain or loss. Other symptoms that can occur if high blood sugar levels persist are fatigue, blurred vision, and headaches. Often, type 2 diabetes is only identified after its negative health consequences are apparent. Certain infections and sores that take a long time to heal are a warning sign. Other possible signs include frequent yeast infections, urinary tract infections, and itchy skin. Sexual problems can occur as a result of type 2 diabetes. Since diabetes can damage the blood vessels and nerves in the sex organs, decreased sensation can develop, potentially leading to difficulties with orgasm. Vaginal dryness in women and impotence in men are other complications of diabetes. Estimates suggest that between 35% and 70% of men with diabetes will eventually suffer from impotence. Statistics for women show that about one-third of women with diabetes will have some sexual dysfunction. Certain risk factors related to both lifestyle choices and medical conditions can increase your risk of developing type 2 diabetes. These include: Being overweight or obese, especially around the waist Consuming a diet that is high in processed meat, fat, sweets, and red meats Low levels of “good” HDL cholesterol (below 35 mg/dL) Some risk factors for diabetes can't be controlled. Hispanics, Native Americans, Asians, and African Americans have a higher than average risk for getting diabetes. Having a family history (parent or sibling) with diabetes increases your risk. Those over 45 have a higher risk of type 2 diabetes than younger people. Women who developed gestational diabetes in pregnancy have a higher risk for developing type 2 diabetes later in life. The same goes for women who have babies larger than 9 pounds. Polycystic ovary syndrome is a health problem characterized by many small cysts in the ovaries, irregular periods, and high levels of androgen hormones. Because one symptom of polycystic ovary syndrome is insulin resistance, women with this condition are considered at higher risk for diabetes as well. Insulin is a hormone that allows the body to efficiently use glucose as fuel. After carbohydrates are broken down into sugars in the stomach, glucose enters the blood circulation and stimulates the pancreas to release insulin in the proper amount. Insulin allows body cells to uptake glucose as energy. In type 2 diabetes, the body's cells cannot take up glucose properly, leading to high levels of glucose in the blood. Insulin resistance means that although the body can produce insulin, the body's cells do not respond properly to the insulin that is made. Over time, the pancreas reduces the amount of insulin that it produces. The hemoglobin A1c test measures the amount of glycosylated hemoglobin (hemoglobin bound to glucose) in your blood and provides information about your average blood glucose levels over the previous 2 to 3 months. Hemoglobin A1c levels over 6.5% are suggestive of diabetes. Another diagnostic test is the fasting blood glucose test. If your fasting blood glucose level is over 126, this establishes that diabetes is present. Random blood glucose levels over 200 are also consistent with diabetes. Keeping good control over blood sugar levels can help reduce the risk of getting complications from diabetes. Your doctor can refer you to a registered dietician or diabetes counselor to help you formulate a healthy eating plan. Many people with type 2 diabetes will need to monitor intake of carbohydrates and reduce calories. Watching total fat and protein consumption is also recommended. Regular exercise, including walking, can help people with type 2 diabetes lower their blood glucose levels. Physical activity also reduces body fat, lowers blood pressure, and helps prevent cardiovascular disease. It’s recommended that people with type 2 diabetes get 30 minutes of moderate exercise on most days. Stress is particularly worrisome for people with diabetes. Stress not only increases blood pressure, but it can also increase blood glucose levels. Many people with diabetes find that relaxation techniques can help manage their condition. Examples are visualization, meditation, or breathing exercises. Taking advantage of social support networks is also helpful, like talking with a relative or friend, member of the clergy, or counselor. Oral medication is recommended for people with type 2 diabetes who cannot adequately control their blood sugar with diet and exercise. Many types of oral diabetes medications are available, and these may be used in combination for the best results. Some increase insulin production, others improve the body’s use of insulin, while still others partially block the digestion of starches. Your doctor can determine the best medication for your individual requirements. Some people with type 2 diabetes also take insulin, sometimes in combination with oral medications. Insulin is also used in ""beta-cell failure,"" a condition in which the pancreas no longer produces insulin in response to elevated blood glucose. This can occur in people with type 2 diabetes. If insulin is not produced, insulin treatment is necessary. There are other non-insulin drugs given in injection form that are used to treat type 2 diabetes. Examples are pramlintide (Symlin), exenatide (Byetta), and liraglutide (Victoza). These drugs stimulate the release of insulin. Your doctor can suggest how often you should test your blood glucose. Testing can give a good idea of the extent to which your diabetes is under control and can tell you if your management plan needs to be altered. Around two out of every three people with diabetes die of heart disease. Over time, elevated blood sugar levels damage the blood vessels, leading to an increased risk of clots. This increases the risk of heart attack. People with diabetes are also at an increased risk for stroke because of the damage to blood vessels. The risk for developing chronic kidney disease increases with time in people with diabetes. Diabetes is the most common cause of renal failure, making up about 44% of cases. Keeping your diabetes under control can reduce the risk of kidney failure. Medications are also used to reduce the risk of kidney disease in people with diabetes. Diabetic retinopathy is damage to the tiny blood vessels within the retina of the eye due to high blood sugar levels over time. This can cause progressive and permanent vision loss. Diabetic retinopathy is the most common cause of new blindness in people between 20 and 74. This image shows pools of blood, or hemorrhages, in the retina. Tingling, numbness, and a sensation of ""pins and needles"" are all symptoms of diabetic neuropathy, or nerve damage related to diabetes. This is most common in the hands, feet, fingers, or toes. Controlling diabetes can help prevent this complication. Damage to nerves caused by diabetes can make it hard to feel injuries to the feet. At the same time, damage to the blood vessels can reduce circulation in the feet of people with diabetes. Sores that heal poorly and even gangrene are complications of diabetes that can occur in the feet. Amputation may be the result in severe cases. Type 2 diabetes is preventable in many patients. At the least, it is possible to reduce the incidence of complications of diabetes by eating a healthy diet, getting moderate exercise, and maintaining a healthy weight. It’s also helpful for people at risk to be screened for diabetes and prediabetes, so that management can begin early in the course of the disease. This reduces the risk of long-term problems.

6f12a8af-bed2-4e8a-b56e-beb9e6c78476,"By Laura Hieronymus, MSEd, RN, MLDE, BC-ADM, CDE, FAADE, and Gena Teutsch Miller, MD Diabetes affects 29.1 million Americans, or 9.3% of the U.S. population — and of all people with diabetes, about 95% have Type 2[1]. When you live with Type 2 diabetes, you quickly realize that your immediate family lives with it, too. Family support is essential when it comes to day-to-day management of diabetes and avoiding serious health issues related to the disease. Diabetes can affect the entire family in several ways. In particular, your blood relatives should be aware that a family history of Type 2 diabetes puts them at higher risk for developing both Type 2 and prediabetes[2]. Prediabetes is diagnosed when blood glucose is higher than normal but not high enough for a diagnosis of diabetes; it’s a risk factor for the development of Type 2 diabetes. It is well documented that Type 2 diabetes runs in families. If you have it, your family members — especially close relatives such as siblings and children — have a strong genetic tendency to develop the disease. Your children’s risk of developing diabetes correlates with the age at which you were diagnosed. If you were diagnosed before age 50, your offspring have a one in seven chance of developing Type 2 diabetes; if you were diagnosed after age 50, the possibility drops to one in 13. Some research suggests that a child’s risk for developing Type 2 diabetes increases if the parent with Type 2 is the mother, and that the risk goes up to about 50% if both parents have it. If you’re an identical twin with Type 2 diabetes, your twin’s risk is almost three in four. In fact, if you have Type 2 diabetes but can’t think of any relatives who have it, chances are that some do have it but don’t know it yet. Currently, almost 30% of people with Type 2 diabetes are unaware they have it, and 51% of people aged 65 years or older have prediabetes. The risk for Type 2 diabetes is also higher if your family is of Asian American, African American, Native American, Alaskan native, or Hispanic descent. Gestational diabetes[3] occurs during pregnancy and usually disappears once the baby is delivered. A family history of Type 2 diabetes raises the risk of developing gestational diabetes, and having gestational diabetes significantly raises a woman’s risk of developing Type 2 diabetes later in life. If you have Type 2 diabetes and have a daughter of childbearing age who is considering pregnancy, be sure she is aware of these risks. In addition, when a woman has a history of gestational diabetes, her child’s risk of developing Type 2 diabetes increases. You can be an advocate for your family members by discussing and addressing their higher risk for Type 2 diabetes, prediabetes, and gestational diabetes. Genetics and ethnicity cannot be changed, but being aware of these risk factors can encourage your family members to attend to any modifiable risks they may have, and sooner rather than later. (For expert tips from an endocrinologist on how to engage your family members in learning about their own risk, click here[4].) Encourage your family members to make changes that may help lower their risk for Type 2 diabetes. For example, being overweight or obese and maintaining a sedentary lifestyle increases the risk for Type 2 diabetes. The degree of risk increases as one’s body-mass index[5] (BMI) increases — in fact, around 85% of those with Type 2 diabetes are heavier than their ideal body weight. Since these risk factors can be modified, you and your family members will benefit from focusing on lifestyle changes that not only help your own diabetes treatment plan but also put your family members on a preventive path. Data show that people with prediabetes are at high risk for developing Type 2 diabetes, but prediabetes isn’t inevitable. The adoption of healthy eating patterns, a weight reduction of 5% to 10% of total body weight, and regular physical activity can bring blood glucose levels back to normal and possibly prevent or postpone the onset of Type 2 diabetes. Dietary changes and physical activity are also cornerstones for the treatment of gestational diabetes. After delivery, women who have had gestational diabetes can substantially lower their risk of developing gestational diabetes with future pregnancies and Type 2 diabetes later on by following a program of healthy eating and exercise. A healthful meal plan is an important part of your treatment plan when you have Type 2 diabetes. A consultation with a registered dietitian (RD) is essential to help you learn things such as interpreting nutrition facts labels, managing portion size, learning the effect and balance of carbohydrate-containing foods, and modifying caloric intake to achieve a healthy body weight. Various meal-planning options are acceptable for diabetes management; an RD will consider your personal preferences and diabetes treatment goals to help customize your meal plan. Medicare and many health insurance plans cover counseling sessions with an RD for people with diabetes. Take advantage of this resource with periodic return visits to help you stay on top of your healthful eating efforts; also, bring a family member along who can benefit from the experience. Of course, healthy eating is recommended for everyone, and your family members who don’t have Type 2 diabetes are no exception. In fact, people at high risk for developing Type 2 diabetes can reduce that risk with a moderate weight loss — approximately 7% of body weight — using dietary strategies that include eating fewer calories and reducing their intake of dietary fat. (See the “All in the Family”[6] sidebar for ideas on managing your Type 2 diabetes and reducing your family members’ risk.) Most Americans, including people with Type 2 diabetes, fall far short of recommended daily allowances for fiber and whole grains. To improve both your and your family’s intake of fiber and whole grains, eat five or more servings of fruits and vegetables each day. Beans — kidney beans, black beans, and red beans — contain lots of soluble fiber that lowers total blood cholesterol, which is often elevated in individuals with diabetes. A good rule of thumb is to “stick close to Mother Nature,” because less processed foods typically have more fiber. Start by trying to make at least half of your grains whole by choosing 100% whole wheat bread for sandwiches, popcorn (hold the butter) for a healthy snack, and whole grain breakfast cereals. Even healthy foods can contain carbohydrate, so it’s important to use nutrition facts labels to help you balance the carbohydrate in your meal plan. Help your family members learn to read labels; it can be eye-opening. If you’re not already doing so, get the family together for meals. Did you know that some research suggests that eating together as a family reduces the risk of being overweight and having eating disorders? In addition, the family that eats together appears to consume more healthful foods. Adults with Type 2 diabetes should work toward increasing physical activity[7] to at least 150 minutes on a weekly basis. The ideal is moderate aerobic activity such as walking (2 miles in 30 minutes) spread over at least three days each week, with no more than two days in a row without exercising. Some other examples of moderate physical activity include bicycling (4 miles in 15 minutes), water aerobics (30 minutes), stair walking (15 minutes), gardening (30 to 45 minutes), and raking leaves (30 minutes). During physical activity, try to maintain a heart rate between 50% and 70% of your maximum heart rate. To calculate your maximum heart rate, subtract your age from 220. If you’re 60 years old your maximum heart rate is 220 minus 60, or 160 beats per minute, so 50% to 70% of your maximum heart rate would be 80 to 112 beats per minute. During the first few weeks, aim for the lowest part of your target rate, then gradually build up to the higher number. Unless your health-care provider advises you not to, add resistance or strength training to your regimen at least twice a week to build and maintain muscle. Regular physical activity and exercise can help improve hemoglobin A1C[8] (an estimate of your average blood glucose level over the past two or three months), overall fitness, heart health, muscle strength, and sensitivity to insulin, the hormone that helps control blood glucose levels. If physical activity hasn’t been a regular part of your diabetes treatment plan, start slowly and build up. And it’s always a good idea to discuss any plans with your health-care provider, just to make sure that you’re in shape to handle added physical activity. Let your family members know about your regular physical activity — joining in and exercising with you may help them avoid developing Type 2 diabetes. Regular moderate activity of 150 minutes per week has been shown to reduce blood glucose in those at risk and decrease the rate of onset of Type 2 diabetes over time. Even young children in your family who are risk for Type 2 diabetes can benefit by engaging in at least 60 minutes of daily physical activity. Equally important, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends limiting a child’s total entertainment screen time — that is to say, sedentary time — to less than two hours per day. To increase the whole family’s activity levels, try to include more “NEAT” (non-exercise activity thermogenesis) activities like walking up and down stairs and walking in place during TV commercials in everyday life. Lead by example where physical activity and exercise is concerned; it will help with your own day-to-day diabetes management and, if they follow you, could lower your family’s risk for Type 2 diabetes. For holidays and birthdays, consider fitness-oriented gifts with each family member’s interests in mind, and think “family activity” during every season. Winter workouts may include building a snowman or, when the weather is too cold to be outside, walking in the mall. In the spring, plan a family vacation or weekend outing that includes exercise. As the weather warms up, skip the drive-through car wash and tackle the job as a family. During the summer months, make going for a walk, run, or bike ride together a scheduled event. Take up a new family hobby such as inline skating, tennis, or hiking. And in the autumn, sign up as a family and train together for a charity run, walk, or bike ride, or take weekend walks in different places around town. Your blood relatives should tell their health-care providers about their family history of Type 2 diabetes and be tested for it. Adults of any age who are overweight and have any other risk factors should be tested for diabetes; adults with no risk factors should be tested initially at age 45 and, if those test results are normal, at least every three years afterward. When an adult has risk factors for Type 2 diabetes but normal blood glucose levels upon testing, a health-care provider may choose to test more frequently than every three years. Children who are overweight and match two of the following factors should be monitored for Type 2 diabetes at age 10 or at the onset of puberty, whichever comes first: • a family history of Type 2 in first- or second-degree relative; • Native American, African American, Latino, Asian American, or Pacific Islander ethnic heritage; • signs of insulin resistance or conditions associated with insulin resistance; or • a mother with a history of diabetes or gestational diabetes while carrying the child. Encourage your family members to be proactive in their efforts to minimize their risks for Type 2 diabetes. Increased physical activity, healthy food choices, and sustained weight reduction all improve insulin sensitivity and therefore decrease insulin resistance[9]. These positive lifestyle behaviors also lower blood pressure and blood fat levels, which also can help lower the risk of heart disease. With awareness, information, and proactive conversation, make sure that your legacy is not Type 2 diabetes, but a habit of healthy family living.

Also Read - Diabetes: Epigenetic changes precede onset of the disease However, having parents or other family members with diabetes does not guarantee that you’ll develop it too. A combination of many other factors that you can control can increase your risk of developing the disease. While you can’t do much about inherited abnormal genes, there is a lot you can do to reduce your chances of developing Studies have shown that it is possible to delay or prevent Type 2 diabetes by losing weight if you are overweight, eating fewer calories, and being more physically active. A genetic mutation may make you susceptible to Type 2 diabetes, but certain lifestyle choices can greatly influence how well your body uses insulin. These include: Physical inactivity can cause muscle cells to lose their sensitivity to insulin, which regulates blood sugar levels, thus increasing diabetes risk. Regular benefits people with diabetes as well as those at risk for diabetes by helping manage weight, improving blood sugar levels, boosting the body’s sensitivity to insulin, and improving heart health. A diet high in fat, calories, and cholesterol increases the likelihood of type 2 diabetes. A poor diet can lead to – the single most important risk factor for type 2 diabetes – and other health problems. A healthy diet high in fibre and low in fat, cholesterol, salt, and sugar can help you manage your blood sugar levels and weight. Research suggests that obese people (those having a BMI of 30 or greater) are up to 80 times more likely to develop type 2 diabetes than those with a BMI of less than 22. People with excess are much more prone to developing Type 2 diabetes. This is because abdominal fat cells can release inflammatory chemicals that reduce the body’s ability to incorporate and utilize insulin. If you’re overweight, losing weight can help improve your body’s ability to effectively respond to insulin and reduce your chances of developing diabetes. Unhealthy habits, such as smoking and drinking too much alcohol, can contribute to the conditions that cause type 2 diabetes. Quitting these bad habits is better for everyone, whether they have diabetes risk or not. Note: If you have a family member with Type 2 diabetes, it’s a good idea to regularly check your blood glucose, blood pressure and blood cholesterol levels.

There is a stronger family history link for developing type 2 diabetes compared to type 1 diabetes. But as families tend to have similar lifestyles, it can be difficult to determine if type 2 diabetes is caused by lifestyle or genetics. People who are at higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes include those from Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander, Pacific Islander, the Indian sub-continent, South-East Asian, Arabic and African ethnic backgrounds. The risk of developing type 2 diabetes in a lifetime is 40% if you have one parent diagnosed with it, and if both parents are affected the risk of developing it increases to 70%. First degree relatives are three times more likely to be diagnosed with type 2 diabetes than someone with no family history. It is important to consider that while there is a strong heritability for type 2 diabetes in families, lifestyle plays a significant role in the development. The factors that lead to increased risk of type 2 diabetes include carrying extra weight, particularly around the waistline, being sedentary, having a high intake of saturated fat, having a high stress level, and smoking. These lifestyle risk factors may be modified. Maturity-onset Diabetes of The Young (MODY) is a genetic defect or mutation of a particular gene that limits the ability of the pancreas to produce insulin. There are over 10 different gene mutations that can cause MODY and this type of diabetes usually occurs in adolescence and early adulthood. Depending how MODY presents in the individual it can be confused with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes, depending on the timeframe of onset of presentation and the weight range of the person with MODY. Typically, if there is a family history in multiple generations of diabetes, MODY genes may be present. Treatment for MODY can be either insulin or sulfonylureas. (GDM) is a form of diabetes that occurs in pregnancy. Women are usually screened between 24-28 weeks of pregnancy for gestational diabetes. Hormones produced during the pregnancy reduce the action of the mother’s insulin, leading to insulin resistance. Women that experience GDM are at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes in the next 10 years. Some women can have ongoing high blood glucose levels after delivery and be diagnosed at that point.

32b5e723-0d17-4cb9-a97e-8d067aae56c3,"Monday, 25 May 2020 Australians living with have a 60 per cent higher chance of developing dementia than those without diabetes, and are twice as likely to develop some types of cancer, according to a new report analysing the full impact of the condition. Released today by the , The report shines light on high-risk areas that are becoming increasingly recognised as complications of diabetes. The latest national snapshot of type 2 diabetes shows a better approach is needed to address the wider health risks for the 1.5 million Australians currently living with , especially the growing number of those under 40 who may live with the disease for decades. The report’s lead author and Head of Clinical Diabetes and Population Health at the Baker Institute, Professor Jonathan Shaw said diabetes increased the risk of numerous other diseases that most people may not understand were linked. “This is what we are calling ‘the dark shadow of type 2 diabetes’, as it can cast a much wider shadow than many realise,” Professor Shaw said. A recent meta-analysis involving data from two million people showed those living with type 2 diabetes had a 60 per cent greater risk of developing dementia compared to people without diabetes, with women more at risk than men. Professor Shaw said people with were also more likely to develop many types of cancer. “They are two to three times more likely to develop pancreatic cancer – one of the most deadly cancers – are twice as likely to develop liver or endometrial cancer, have a 50 per cent higher chance of getting bowel cancer and a 20 per cent greater risk of breast cancer,” he said. “Increased cancer risk is of particular concern for the growing number of people under 40 living with type 2 diabetes. This group saw a significant increase in deaths from cancer between 2000 and 2011.” On average, a 45 year old person with diabetes can expect to live six years less than a person free of diabetes, and Professor Shaw said many of these earlier deaths were due to heart disease. “Heart disease is still the biggest killer of people with type 2 diabetes, and our report shows that heart failure is a leading cause,” he said. “People with type 2 diabetes are up to eight times more likely to suffer from heart failure, compared to those without diabetes.” But Professor Shaw said the report also highlighted recent advances around the world showing that some of the newer diabetes medications had the potential to significantly reduce the number of people with diabetes who develop heart and kidney disease. “It’s vital that all those who could benefit from newer medications are receiving them whenever possible,” he said. “With the burden of diabetes complications in our community casting such a long shadow – in terms of death rates, disability and impact on the health system – we need greater education and support for those living with diabetes, as well as their GPs. “In addition to controlling , it is essential Australians living with type 2 diabetes are supported to keep blood pressure and cholesterol at healthy levels.” Other serious outlined in The Dark Shadow of Type 2 Diabetes report: The prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty-liver disease is very high among people with type 2 diabetes, and can ultimately lead to liver failure and the need for liver transplants. Those with type 2 diabetes are 10 times more likely to develop kidney failure, than those without diabetes. For Indigenous Australians, diabetes is the primary cause of 70 per cent of all cases of kidney failure. Amputations remain a major complication of type 2 diabetes. Diabetic eye disease remains a leading cause of vision loss and blindness in working-age adults worldwide. A wide range of other diseases and conditions are also more common in people with diabetes, including depression, osteoporosis, sleep apnoea, hearing impairment and gum disease. Researchers at the Baker Institute are currently working to understand more about diabetes and how to prevent some of its devastating effects through large-scale research projects, including the PREDICT study.

Type 2 diabetes makes it difficult for a person’s body to use the insulin it produces. This is called insulin resistance: the cells of your body do not easily recognize your insulin. If the insulin is not recognized, the ""door"" to your cells will not open to allow sugar to move from the blood into the cell. Sugar remains in the blood, leading to higher than normal blood sugars. Anyone can develop diabetes. However, people who have a family history of diabetes are more likely to develop it. The risk of developing type 2  diabetes also increases as people become older, sedentary, or overweight. Ethnic background is also an important factor. People of Native American, Latino, African American, and Asian American descent are at greater risk for diabetes. Additionally, people who develop diabetes while pregnant (known as ) are at higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes . People of any age can get type 2 diabetes. It is seen most frequently  in adults, but type 2 diabetes is rapidly increasing in children and adolescents. Federal statistics estimate that 18.2 million children and adults in the United States — 6.3 percent of the population — have diabetes. While an estimated 13 million of these have been diagnosed with diabetes, 5.2 million are estimated to have type 2 diabetes and not know it. Most people with diabetes have type 2 diabetes. African American, Asian American, Hispanic, Native American or Pacific Islander heritage History of gestational diabetes or having a baby weighing over 9 pounds Having high cholesterol and/or high blood pressure For those with a family history of type 2 diabetes, weight gain and an inactive lifestyle can increase insulin resistance. As insulin resistance increases, your body fights to maintain normal blood sugar levels. It does this by increasing the amount of insulin made in the pancreas. During this phase you may develop pre-diabetes (glucose intolerance). The extra insulin helps for a while, but eventually your pancreas becomes tired and can no longer produce enough insulin to maintain normal blood sugars. It is at this point you may be diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Over time, the pancreas of people with type 2 diabetes may naturally lose its ability to make insulin. Therefore it is expected that you may move from controlling diabetes with meal planning and exercise to adding oral medications and possibly insulin. Remember, it is most important to maintain normal blood sugars, and you may need to add oral medication or insulin to meal planning and physical activity. Treatment for type 2 diabetes focuses on keeping your blood sugars as close to normal as possible. This is the best way to prevent the complications of diabetes. The components of diabetes care include: You can live a long, healthy life if you keep your diabetes in good control. Diabetes care needs to be an important part of your life so you can accomplish everything else you want to do. Work with your healthcare team to develop a self-care plan that works for you. If you have type 2 diabetes, there are several ways you can be involved with the care and resources at U-M. To make an appointment with a clinician, reach out to one of the locations listed below.

be14e1c5-2047-4479-90d7-311d6747e098,"More than 29 million people in the U.S. have diabetes, and about 8 million of them don’t know they have it. So now is as good a time as any to find out if you (or a loved one) might have Type 1[1] or Type 2 diabetes[2]. • Type 1 (T1) diabetes: The body’s immune system attacks the insulin-making beta cells in the pancreas, and, as a result, the body stops making insulin. Those with Type 1 diabetes must take insulin to survive. Type 1 affects both children and adults, and accounts for between 5% and 10% of those who have diabetes. • Type 2 (T2) diabetes: The body doesn’t use insulin efficiently (a condition called insulin resistance[3]) and/or doesn’t make enough insulin to keep blood sugar (glucose) levels in a safe range. Type 2 diabetes can be managed with lifestyle changes, but many people need to take medication, including insulin. Type 2 accounts for 90% to 95% of diabetes cases. Type 1 diabetes risk factors include: • Family history: Having a parent or sibling with Type 1. • Age: Anyone at any age can get Type 1, but there’s a strong prevalence in children ages 4–7 and ages 10–14. • Race/ethnicity: Caucasians are at higher risk than African-Americans and Hispanics. • Viral infection: Viruses including Epstein-Barr, mumps, and Coxsackie may increase the risk for Type 1. • Geography: People living in northern climates have a higher risk for getting Type 1. • Autoimmune conditions: Other autoimmune conditions, such as thyroid disease, celiac disease, and pernicious anemia, are associated with an increased risk. • Family history: Having a parent or sibling with Type 2. • Age: Being age 45 or older. • Weight: Having overweight or obesity. • Race/ethnicity: African-Americans, Hispanics, Asian Americans, Native Americans, and Pacific Islanders have a higher risk than Caucasians. • Gestational diabetes: Having diabetes during pregnancy or giving birth to a baby weighing 9 pounds or more. • Not being physically active. • High blood pressure. • High triglycerides (blood fats) or low HDL (“good”) cholesterol. • Higher-than-normal blood sugar levels (prediabetes). Symptoms for both Type 1 diabetes and Type 2 diabetes can vary. In the case of Type 2, you may not have any symptoms. • Being very thirsty and/or hungry • Having to urinate frequently • Extreme fatigue • Bedwetting in children • Weight loss • Blurry vision • Cuts or sores that don’t heal quickly • Numbness or tingling in the feet • Frequent yeast infections in women • Being very thirsty and/or hungry • Frequent urination • Fatigue • Blurry vision • Cuts or sores that don’t heal quickly • Frequent yeast infections in women • Or, no symptoms! If you have any of the risk factors and/or symptoms listed above, it’s time to pay a visit to your doctor. For the most part, the tests used to diagnose diabetes are the same for Type 1 and Type 2. There may be additional tests used to check for Type 1 diabetes, however. There are different types of blood tests used to diagnose diabetes. If the first test indicates a diagnosis of diabetes, it should be repeated on a different day to confirm the diagnosis. Also, these tests should be done at a doctor’s office and not by a fingerstick at a health fair or pharmacy or by using a home blood glucose meter. Here’s how diabetes is diagnosed: This blood test measures your average blood sugar over the past 2–3 months. You don’t need to fast (avoid eating or drinking) before getting this test done. An A1C of 6.5% or higher indicates diabetes. This blood test checks your fasting (first thing in the morning without having eating anything for the previous 12 hours) blood sugar. A fasting plasma glucose level of 126 mg/dl or higher indicates diabetes. For this test, your blood sugar is checked before you drink a very sweet beverage, and again two hours later. A blood sugar of 200 mg/dl or higher two hours later indicates diabetes This test can be done at any time of the day (without fasting) if you have symptoms of diabetes, such as extreme thirst or frequent urination. A result of 200 mg/dl indicates possible diabetes. If your doctor suspects Type 1 diabetes or perhaps isn’t sure what type you may have, he or she may order: This blood test measures antibodies that indicate autoimmune activity. This fasting blood test measures C-peptide, which is a by-product of insulin production. Low levels usually indicate Type 1 diabetes. The presence of ketones (by-products of burning fat instead of glucose for energy) in the urine usually indicates Type 1, not Type 2, diabetes. If your doctor tells you that you have Type 1 diabetes, the treatment is pretty straightforward: You’ll need to take insulin. You have options for how you can take insulin: • With a syringe • With an insulin pen • With an insulin pump • With an inhaler (only for a certain type of fast-acting insulin; you will still need to inject a long-acting insulin) There is no insulin pill that you can take at this time. Certain factors will help to determine what the best way for you to take insulin, such as your lifestyle, your vision and dexterity, and your health-plan coverage. Ask to meet with a diabetes educator to learn how to properly take your insulin. If you have Type 2 diabetes, your treatment will likely depend on how high your blood sugar and/or A1C level is at diagnosis. You may initially be able to manage your diabetes with weight loss, a healthy eating plan, and regular exercise. However, most treatment plans recommend starting off on a diabetes pill, such as metformin[4]. If your blood sugar and/or A1C is above a certain level, you may even need to start taking insulin. It’s important to ask about your options for how your diabetes should best be treated. Regardless of what type of diabetes you have, learning how to check your blood sugar[5] with a meter is pretty much essential. Your blood sugar checks help you — and your health-care team — understand how your food, activity, stress, illness, and medication are working to help you keep your blood sugars in a safe range. Your doctor just told you that you have diabetes. Now what? Most likely, you’re feeling shocked, scared, sad, or overwhelmed. Or all of these things. However, you need to ask questions. You might bring someone with you to your appointment; you might even need to make a follow-up appointment and be prepared with a list of questions. Here are examples of questions to ask[6] (you likely will have many more!) • What type of diabetes do I have? • How will it be treated? Do I have to take medication? • Should I be checking my blood sugar, and, if so, when and how often? • What should my blood sugar level be? • How can I prevent complications[7], such as eye, heart, and kidney disease? • How can I learn more about my diabetes and how to manage it? • What should I be eating? • Can I still work/exercise/travel? (The answer is “yes” to all of them, by the way!) Diabetes is a serious, but manageable, condition. There’s a lot that you will need to do to take care of yourself. You’ll need support from your health-care team, family, friends — and maybe a support group or an online community. Just remember: You can live a long, healthy life with diabetes. When your child has a physical challenge such as diabetes, one of the hardest things can be walking the line between keeping him safe and letting him grow, says Amy Mercer.

The CDC also notes that 90 to 95 percent of cases involve . In the past, type 2 diabetes was most prevalent in older adults. But due to widespread poor lifestyle habits, it’s more common in younger people than ever before. Type 2 diabetes is often preventable. Learn what you can do to prevent or delay its onset, no matter your age. Middle-aged and older adults are still at the highest risk for developing type 2 diabetes. According to the CDC’s 2017 , there were around 1.5 million new total diabetes cases among adults in 2015. In 2015, adults aged 45 to 64 were the most diagnosed age group for diabetes. New cases of both in people aged 18 years and older were distributed as follows: Type 2 diabetes used to be prevalent only in adults and was once called “adult-onset” diabetes. Now that it’s becoming more common , it’s simply called “type 2” diabetes. is more common in children and young adults, and it’s believed to be caused by an reaction. However, type 2 diabetes is rising in incidence, attributed in part to poor lifestyle habits. According to the SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth Study, 5,300 people from ages 10 to 19 were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes between 2011 and 2012. A published in the ADA Journal Diabetes Care considered the potential future number of diabetes cases in people under the age of 20. The study found that, at current rates, the number of people under the age of 20 with type 2 diabetes could increase by up to 49 percent by 2050. If the rates of incidence increase, the number of type 2 cases in youth could quadruple. Type 2 diabetes may result from a culmination of health issues and an unhealthy lifestyle. Specific factors can , but an unhealthy lifestyle is the broader issue in many cases. Fixed risk factors, which you can’t change, include: being of Asian, Pacific Islander, Native American, Latino, or African descent Some health conditions are associated with type 2 diabetes. Risk factors include having: low levels of , or “good” cholesterol a history of or a history of delivering a baby weighing over 9 pounds or other indicators of Having a history of is an important risk factor. Prediabetes doesn’t mean you’ll necessarily develop type 2 diabetes. But if you have high blood sugar, type 2 diabetes is possible. That’s why it’s important to take .

By: | Diabetes: Men are far more likely to develop type 2 diabetes as compared to women [4]. A study published in the journal Diabetologia revealed that biologically, men are far more susceptible to develop diabetes after studying a little more than 95,000 men and women living with this lifestyle disease. Children born with low birth weight due to genetic factors are at increased risk of developing Type 2 diabetes, finds a new study. The findings showed that the low birth weight was actually causing excess risk in Type 2 diabetes. A genetically lowered birth weight was associated with increased susceptibility to , said Tiange Wang from Tulane University in the US. Low birth can cause restricted intrauterine growth (foetal growth) — a condition in which an unborn baby is smaller than it should be because it is not growing at a normal rate inside the womb. Also Read - Underweight newborns at greater risk of developing poor cardiorespiratory fitness later in life Also Read - Low birth weight linked with chronic health conditions later in life Further, this restricted foetal growth also represents a risk factor for the low birth weight and in turn causing the Type 2 diabetes. Risk factors for restricted intrauterine growth include malnutrition, anaemia, infections and placental insufficiency. Our findings support a potential causal relation between birth weight and risk of Type 2 diabetes, providing novel evidence to support the role of intrauterine exposures in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes, Wang added. Evidence from both population and experimental studies has suggested that restricted early life development has long-term structural and functional influence on individuals’ predisposition to an increased risk of metabolic diseases such as Type 2 diabetes, said the paper published in the journal Diabetologia. can lead to low birth weight in babies.

The team created a genetic risk score (GRS) based on five low birth weight-related genetic variations known as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The analysis showed that for each one point increase in GRS (with the score ranging from 1-10), the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes increased by six per cent.

Pre-diabetes has no signs or symptoms, but like type 2 diabetes pre-diabetes is a result of the body’s insulin not working effectively. There are two pre-diabetes conditions – and having either condition can increase your risk of developing type 2 diabetes: IGT occurs when the blood glucose level is higher than normal after meals, but not to the level to be diagnosed with diabetes. IFG occurs when the fasting blood glucose levels are higher than normal but not to the level to be diagnosed with diabetes. It is possible to have both impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and impaired fasting glucose (IFG). It is estimated that 2 million Australians have pre-diabetes and are at risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Pre-diabetes increases the risk of cardiovascular (heart and blood vessel) disease which may lead to heart attack and stroke. Making positive lifestyle changes can reduce your risk for developing type 2 diabetes. Risk factors for pre-diabetes are similar to those for type 2 diabetes and include: Being overweight – especially excess weight around the waistline (more than 94cm for men and more than 80cm for women) A family history of type 2 diabetes and/or heart disease Women who had gestational diabetes in pregnancy or have given birth to a big baby (more than 4.5kg) Those from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander background Those from certain ethnic backgrounds such as the Pacific Islands, Asia and the Indian sub-continent Pre-diabetes is diagnosed by an oral glucose tolerance test, ordered by a doctor and performed at a pathology lab. The test involves a blood sample being taken before and two hours after a glucose drink has been consumed.  Treatment for pre-diabetes requires the same lifestyle changes recommended for people with diabetes. This includes regular physical activity, healthy eating and weight loss if necessary. Healthy eating – a healthy eating plan encourages regular meals and snacks (if required) based on foods high in fibre, low in fat (particularly saturated fat) and low in sodium.

9cac2a46-f7fa-4b1d-8bef-51105ffebe06,"Type 2 diabetes is a common metabolic condition that develops when the body fails to produce enough insulin or when insulin fails to work properly, which is referred to as insulin resistance. Insulin is the hormone that stimulates cells to uptake glucose from the blood to use for energy. When this is the case, cells are not instructed by insulin to take up glucose from the blood, meaning the blood sugar level rises (referred to as hyperglycemia). People usually develop type 2 diabetes after the age of 40 years, although people of South Asian origin are at an increased risk of the condition and may develop diabetes from the age of 25 onwards. The condition is also becoming increasingly common among children and adolescents across all populations. Type 2 diabetes often develops as a result of overweight, obesity and lack of physical activity and diabetes prevalence is on the rise worldwide as these problems become more widespread. Type 2 diabetes accounts for approximately 90% of all diabetes cases (the other form being type 1 diabetes) and treatment approaches include lifestyle changes and the use of medication. Also known of as juvenile diabetes, type 1 diabetes usually occurs in childhood or adolescence. In type 1 diabetes, the body fails to produce insulin. Patients have to be given the hormone, which is why the condition is also known of as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). Type 2 diabetes mellitus is also called non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), since it can be treated with lifestyle changes and/or types of medication other than insulin therapy. Type 2 diabetes is significantly more common than type 1 diabetes. The increased blood glucose level seen in diabetes can eventually damage a person’s blood vessels, nerves and organs. The body attempts to remove the excess glucose through urination and the most common symptoms of type 2 diabetes include the following: Polyuria (increased frequency of urination), especially during the night Extreme fatigue, weight loss and sudden loss of muscle bulk. Some of these symptoms are also seen in type 1 diabetes, but type 2 diabetes symptoms tend to develop more gradually and can take months or years to manifest. This can make it more difficult for people to tell they have an underlying health condition and often people have had type 2 diabetes for a long time before it is finally diagnosed. Genetic analysis reveals novel traits associated with COVID-19 severity The Prospects of Semaglutide for Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes Patients Several factors can increase a person’s risk of developing diabetes. Examples include: Waist measurement of 31.5 inches or more among women Waist measurement of more than 37 inches among men A family history of the diabetes also increases a person’s risk of developing the condition. Studies have shown that the offspring of families where one parent has diabetes, are at a 15% increased risk of developing the condition and that offspring born to two parents with diabetes have a 75% increased risk. The high blood glucose seen in diabetes can damage blood vessels, nerves and organs, leading to a number of potential complications. Some examples of the complications caused by diabetes include the following: A persistently high blood glucose level can increase the risk of blood vessels becoming narrowed and clogged with fatty plaques (atherosclerosis). This can disrupt blood flow to the heart causing angina and in some cases, heart attack. If blood vessels that supply the brain are affected, this can lead to stroke. Excess glucose in the blood can damage small blood vessels in the nerves causing a tingling sensation or pain in the fingers, toes and limbs. Nerves that lie outside of the central nervous system may also be damaged, which is referred to as peripheral neuropathy. If nerves of the gastrointestinal tract are affected, this may cause vomiting, constipation and diarrhea. Damage to the retina may occur if tiny vessels in this layer of tissue become blocked or start to leak. Light then fails to pass through the retina properly which can cause vision loss. Blockage and leakage of vessels in the kidneys can affect kidney function. This usually happens as a result of high blood pressure and blood pressure management is an important part of managing type 2 diabetes. Nerve damage in the feet can mean small cuts are not felt or treated, which can lead to a foot ulcer developing. This happens to around 10% of . Blood sugar should be regularly monitored so that any problems can be detected and treated early. Treatment involves lifestyle changes such as eating a healthy and balanced diet and regular physical exercise. If lifestyle changes alone are not enough to regulate the blood glucose level, anti-diabetic medication in the form of tablets or injections may be prescribed. In some cases, people who have had type 2 diabetes for many years are eventually prescribed insulin injections. Maintaining a healthy blood glucose level, blood pressure and cholesterol is essential to preventing the complications of type 2 diabetes. Overweight or obese individuals with diabetes often significantly reduce the extent of their symptoms by making adjustments to their lifestyle. http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Diabetes-type2/Pages/Introduction.aspx http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/cg66fullguideline0509.pdf http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/live/13472/54345/54345.pdf http://www.diabetes.ca/files/Prediabetes-Fact-Sheet_CPG08.pdf http://www.who.int/diabetes/publications/en/screening_mnc03.pdf www.diabetes.org.uk/Diabetes-the-basics/What-is-Type-2-Diabetes/ http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Diabetes-type2/Pages/Introduction.aspx Last Updated: Feb 27, 2019 Dr. Ananya Mandal is a doctor by profession, lecturer by vocation and a medical writer by passion.

An Unhealthy Diet And Lack Of Exercise Can Lead To Type 2 Diabetes – But So Can Your Genes One’s genes are just as real a risk factor for type 2 diabetes as one’s dietary habits and level of physical activity. This is why you can develop type 2 diabetes even if you lead a healthy lifestyle. It’s also why a family history of diabetes is a key predictor of this disease. Here, you’ll discover how genetics can play a role in the risk of type 2 diabetes. Depending on your genes, you can develop type 2 diabetes even if you lead a healthy lifestyle. First, though, we’ll lay some groundwork by exploring a bit of the biology of type 2 diabetes. (Feel free to skip this next section if you’re somewhat familiar with insulin resistance and its relationship to type 2 diabetes.) Type 2 diabetes occurs when your blood sugar levels are much too high because of insulin resistance (you can check your blood sugar levels – as an average over the past 90 days – with ). Your body breaks down some of the food you eat – carbs, for example – into small molecules called glucose (also known as “sugar”). These glucose molecules then make their way into the bloodstream. The bloodstream transports glucose to the many cells in your body. Your body breaks down some of the food you eat – carbs, for example – into small molecules called glucose (also known as “sugar”). Your body can’t function without glucose, because the energy from glucose powers many of the vital activities of your cells, tissues, and organs. In fact, your brain – which uses a hefty amount of energy – . Now, where does insulin – and insulin resistance – fit in this picture? Insulin is a hormone – or a signaling molecule. When your blood sugar levels climb – say, after you’ve enjoyed a scoop of ice cream – one of your body’s organs, the pancreas, squirts insulin molecules into the bloodstream. Imagine what happens, though, when your cells are insulin resistant – that is, when they don’t respond to the signal from insulin. In this scenario, your blood sugar levels will remain high – and your cells won’t get to burn glucose for energy. Over time, this can devastate your body’s health. Insulin resistance can be caused by a number of different factors. Smoking tobacco, for example, – and so can your eating habits: a diet high in refined sugar can result in insulin resistance and, ultimately, diabetes. Then there’s a lack of exercise, . A diet high in refined sugar can result in insulin resistance and, ultimately, diabetes. You might have noticed that these are all behavioral risk factors for insulin resistance. However, behavioral factors aren’t the only things involved in insulin resistance. Genetics can play a central role, as well. There are a whole host of genes connected with insulin signaling in the body, many of which have been carefully studied by geneticists. One such gene, for example, is the LPL gene – which codes for an enzyme called lipoprotein lipase. Some individuals who are born with defective copies of this gene face a greater risk of developing insulin resistance. This is just one example – out of many – of a genetic risk factor for insulin resistance. And since insulin resistance is a main cause of diabetes, certain defective genes – which people are born with and are thus not linked to behavior – can put someone at an increased risk for diabetes. In fact, there are about 150 different genetic variations that are known to heighten the risk of diabetes. And – perhaps not surprisingly – the greater the number of defective genes you are born with (assuming these genes are involved in insulin signaling in some way), the greater your risk of type 2 diabetes. GENETIC OR BEHAVIORAL RISK FACTORS – WHICH PLAYS A BIGGER ROLE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF DIABETES? Currently, studies show that both genetic and behavioral risk factors can contribute to diabetes. But which plays a bigger role in the development of this disease? There’s no hard-and-fast answer to this question since scientists have a lot more research to do in this area. However, experts believe that behavior – in the form of eating habits and exercise, for example – can affect the genetic risk factors behind diabetes: when it comes to diabetes, healthier behaviors can lessen the negative impacts of one’s genetics. When it comes to diabetes, healthier behaviors (like regular exercise) can lessen the negative impacts of one’s genetics. For that reason, even if your risk for diabetes is largely the result of your genetics, you can still help try to keep this condition at bay with healthy eating and regular exercise. Chronically high blood sugar levels – the result of insulin resistance – can trigger type 2 diabetes. Insulin resistance, in turn, is caused by many different possible factors – including diet, exercise levels, and defective genes. So, because various genetic defects are significantly associated with insulin resistance, your individual genetic makeup can place you at a greater risk for diabetes. But this doesn’t mean that behavior is in any way irrelevant to the management of diabetes, as healthy eating and regular exercise can lessen some of the negative effects of your genetics. And, finally, a friendly reminder: if you’d like to evaluate your blood sugar levels from the past 90 days, simply take from the convenience of home.

de8d17d2-2ed7-4eee-8315-6ed1304da584,"— A meta-analysis of nearly 6 million people links smoking with a higher risk for developing type 2 diabetes and also concludes the more you smoke, the higher your risk. A new report confirms that smokers and those exposed to secondhand smoke have an increased risk for developing type 2 diabetes. Researchers from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, Huazhong University of Science and Technology in China, and the National University of Singapore published the report in . They conducted a meta-analysis of 88 previous studies on the link between smoking and type 2 diabetes risk, examining data from almost 6 million study participants. “It is well established that secondhand smoke is implicated in many tobacco-caused diseases, but the link between exposure to someone else’s smoke and increased diabetes risk is new,” said Dr. Michael Steinberg, director of the at Robert Wood Johnson Medical School. The researchers say that 11 percent of type 2 diabetes cases in men and 2.4 percent in women (more than 27 million cases worldwide) may be attributed to active smoking. Compared with people who never lit up, current smoking boosted the risk of type 2 diabetes by 37 percent. In former smokers, it increased the risk by 14 percent. In those exposed to secondhand smoke, it raised the risk for type 2 diabetes by 22 percent.

Light smokers had a 21 percent higher risk while moderate smokers had a 34 percent higher risk, and heavy smokers had a 57 percent risk for developing type 2 diabetes. “Despite the global efforts to combat the tobacco epidemic, cigarette use remains the leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide,” said An Pan, the first author of the study and professor of epidemiology at the School of Public Health at the Tongji Medical College at China’s Huazhong University of Science and Technology, in a press release. Pan said it also stresses the need to make public places free from smoke. The researchers say the risk for type 2 diabetes went down over time after smokers kicked the habit. There was a 54 percent increased risk of type 2 diabetes in people who quit smoking within the past five years. That went down to 18 percent after five years and decreased to 11 percent after a decade. Earlier this year, the same journal that found diabetes patients who quit smoking may see a temporary impairment in glycemic control that may last for up to three years.

In 2014, the contained a section on smoking and diabetes risk and mentioned the causal relation between them. That report did not touch on the link between passive smoking and smoking cessation with diabetes risk. “The current study goes a step further and suggests that secondhand smoke may also increase the risk of diabetes,” Steinberg told Healthline. Steinberg said the findings reinforce the importance of tobacco control policies. Though it’s not clear how smoking causes diabetes, Steinberg said that further research will be vital to improving public health. Tobacco and diabetes are two of the leading risk factors for cardiovascular disease, he added. Dr. Frank Hu, professor of nutrition and epidemiology and coauthor of the report, told Healthline how smoking can be a pathway for diabetes development. Smokers tend to be leaner than nonsmokers, but they also have increased abdominal obesity and visceral fat. That is a critical risk factor for insulin resistance and diabetes. Smoking is tied to increased chronic inflammation, another underlying risk factor for insulin resistance and diabetes. In addition, toxic chemicals can damage human beta cells, leading to their dysfunction and impaired insulin secretion. “Cigarette smoking should be considered as a key modifiable risk factor for diabetes. Public health efforts to reduce smoking will have a substantial impact on the global burden of type 2 diabetes,” Hu said in a statement.

You can go back to this later in your Five million people at high risk of Type 2 diabetes Five million people in England have blood glucose (blood sugar) levels indicating a high risk of developing Type 2 diabetes, according to a new report published today by Public Health England (PHE). The report, compiled by PHE’s National Cardiovascular Health Intelligence Network (NCVIN), provides the most accurate and robust estimate of how many people over 16 in England have blood sugar levels in a range indicating a high risk of developing Type 2 diabetes, otherwise known as non-diabetic hyperglycaemia. It was commissioned by the NHS Diabetes Prevention Programme (NHS DPP), which will support people in reducing their risk of developing Type 2 diabetes by helping them lose weight, be more active and have a healthier diet. The new estimate further underlines the need to act on Type 2 diabetes, especially as it already results in 22,000 early deaths and costs the NHS £8.8 billion every year. An evidence review also published today by PHE shows programmes similar to the NHS DPP can be successful in preventing 26 per cent of people at high risk of Type 2 diabetes from going on to develop the condition. People supported by diabetes prevention programmes lose on average 1.57kg more weight than those not on a programme aiming to significantly reduce diabetes risk. Both reports have shaped what the NHS DPP will offer – at least nine months of information, support, group and one-to-one sessions on weight loss, physical activity and diet. Practitioners, clinicians, academics and the public are currently being consulted on a proposed outline of the programme. Consultation responses will further inform the programme, with a phased national roll-out starting in 2016. Duncan Selbie, Chief Executive of PHE, said: “We know how to lower the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes: lose weight, exercise and eat healthily, but it’s hard to do it alone. PHE’s evidence review shows that supporting people along the way will help them protect their health and that’s what our prevention programme will do.” Professor Jonathan Valabhji, National Clinical Director for Diabetes and Obesity, NHS England said: “There are too many people on the cusp of developing Type 2 diabetes and we can change that. The growing body of evidence makes us confident that our NHS Diabetes Prevention Programme will reduce the numbers of those at risk going on to develop the debilitating disease.” Barbara Young, Chief Executive of Diabetes UK, said: “Having high blood glucose significantly increases your risk of developing Type 2 diabetes, which is a serious health condition which affects 2.9 million people in England, and can lead to devastating complications such as blindness, amputations and strokes, and ultimately early death. “This is why we are delighted to be a part of England’s first ever evidence-based National Diabetes Prevention Programme and we fully support the programme’s ambition to help people at high risk of Type 2 diabetes to reduce their risk by supporting them to become more active and have a healthier diet. The evidence shows that this is the right approach as these types of interventions can help people to lose significant amounts of weight, and can also lower their blood glucose levels, therefore providing them with the best possible chance to delay or avoid Type 2 diabetes. “As well as helping to reduce the human cost of Type 2 diabetes, this would also go a long way to helping to reduce economic costs to the NHS. The NHS spends 10 per cent of its entire budget managing diabetes, and unless we get better at preventing Type 2 diabetes this figure will rise to unsustainable levels.” “While the NHS Diabetes Prevention Programme is a major step in the right direction, we now hope to see greater support from all areas of national and local Government to encourage people to lead healthy and active lives.” The data on non-diabetic hyperglycaemia are broken down by local authority for the first time, ranging from 8.5 per cent of people in Brighton and Hove to 14 per cent in Harrow. Higher rates are found in areas with large ethnic minority populations or older populations, or both – the groups traditionally at higher risk of Type 2 diabetes. In addition to the inherent factors of ageing and ethnic background, lifestyle factors, including weight, physical activity levels and diet, also play a role in determining the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. The NHS DPP will focus on providing support to participants on changing their behaviour in these areas to reduce their risk. According to the evidence review, programmes more aligned with the NICE guidance on preventing or delaying the onset of Type 2 diabetes help people lose on average 3kg more weight and significantly reduce blood sugar levels. Aside from reducing incidences of Type 2 diabetes, the NHS DPP also aims to reduce the life-changing complications associated with the disease, like heart disease, stroke, kidney, eye and foot problems, and reduce costs to the NHS in the long term. People identified with a high risk of developing Type 2 diabetes, either through an NHS Health Check or through an existing blood test result, will be offered a place on the NHS DPP when it launches in 2016.

03d8d5ea-1254-4356-beca-beeabb3a592c,"— Type 2 diabetes is a chronic disease that affects millions of people worldwide. Uncontrolled cases can cause blindness, kidney failure, heart disease and other serious conditions. Before diabetes is diagnosed, there is a period where blood sugar levels are high but not high enough to be diagnosed as diabetes. This is known as prediabetes. It’s estimated that up to 70% of people with prediabetes go on to develop type 2 diabetes. Fortunately, progressing from prediabetes to diabetes isn’t inevitable (). Although there are certain factors you can’t change — such as your genes, age or past behaviors — there are many actions you can take to reduce the risk of diabetes. Eating and can put at-risk individuals on the fast track to developing diabetes. Your body rapidly breaks these foods down into small sugar molecules, which are absorbed into your bloodstream. The resulting rise in blood sugar stimulates your pancreas to produce , a hormone that helps sugar get out of the bloodstream and into your body’s cells. In people with prediabetes, the body’s cells are resistant to insulin’s action, so sugar remains high in the blood. To compensate, the pancreas produces more insulin, attempting to bring blood sugar down to a healthy level. Over time, this can lead to progressively higher blood sugar and insulin levels, until the condition eventually turns into type 2 diabetes. Many studies have shown a link between the frequent consumption of sugar or refined carbs and the risk of diabetes. What’s more, replacing them with foods that have less of an effect on blood sugar may help reduce your risk (, , , , ). A detailed analysis of 37 studies found that people with the highest intakes of fast-digesting carbs were 40% more likely to develop diabetes than those with the lowest intakes (). Eating foods high in refined carbs and sugar increases blood sugar and insulin levels, which may lead to diabetes over time. Avoiding these foods may help reduce your risk. Performing on a regular basis may help prevent diabetes. Exercise increases the insulin sensitivity of your cells. So when you exercise, less insulin is required to keep your blood sugar levels under control. One study in people with prediabetes found that moderate-intensity exercise increased insulin sensitivity by 51% and high-intensity exercise increased it by 85%. However, this effect only occurred on workout days (). Many types of physical activity have been shown to reduce insulin resistance and blood sugar in overweight, obese and prediabetic adults. These include aerobic exercise, high-intensity interval training and strength training (, , , , , ). Working out more frequently seems to lead to improvements in insulin response and function. One study in people at risk of diabetes found that burning more than 2,000 weekly via exercise was required to achieve these benefits (). Therefore, it’s best to choose physical activity that you enjoy, can engage in regularly and feel you can stick with long-term. Performing physical activity on a regular basis can increase insulin secretion and sensitivity, which may help prevent the progression from prediabetes to diabetes. is by far the most natural beverage you can drink. What’s more, sticking with water most of the time helps you avoid beverages that are high in sugar, preservatives and other questionable ingredients. Sugary beverages like soda and punch have been linked to an increased risk of both type 2 diabetes and latent autoimmune diabetes of adults (LADA). LADA is a form of type 1 diabetes that occurs in people over 18 years of age. Unlike the acute symptoms seen with type 1 diabetes in childhood, LADA develops slowly, requiring more treatment as the disease progresses (). One large observational study looked at the diabetes risk of 2,800 people. Those who consumed more than two servings of sugar-sweetened beverages per day had a 99% increased risk of developing LADA and a 20% increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes (). Researchers of one study on the effects of sweet drinks on diabetes stated that neither artificially sweetened beverages nor were good beverages for diabetes prevention (). By contrast, consuming water may provide benefits. Some studies have found that increased water consumption may lead to better blood sugar control and insulin response (, ). One 24-week study showed that overweight adults who replaced diet sodas with water while following a weight loss program experienced a decrease in insulin resistance and and insulin levels (). Drinking water instead of other beverages may help control blood sugar and insulin levels, thereby reducing the risk of diabetes. Although not everyone who develops type 2 diabetes is overweight or obese, the majority are. What’s more, those with prediabetes tend to carry excess weight in their midsection and around abdominal organs like the liver. This is known as visceral fat. Excess visceral fat promotes inflammation and insulin resistance, which significantly increase the risk of diabetes (, , , ). Although losing even a small amount of weight can help reduce this risk, studies show that the more you lose, the more benefits you’ll experience (, ). One study of more than 1,000 people with prediabetes found that for every kilogram (2.2 lbs) of weight participants lost, their risk of diabetes reduced by 16%, up to a maximum reduction of 96% (). There are many healthy options for losing weight, including , Mediterranean, paleo and vegetarian diets. However, choosing a way of eating you can stick with long-term is key to helping you maintain the . One study found that obese people whose blood sugar and insulin levels decreased after losing weight experienced elevations in these values after gaining back all or a portion of the weight they lost (). Carrying excess weight, particularly in the abdominal area, increases the likelihood of developing diabetes. Losing weight may significantly reduce the risk of diabetes. Smoking has been shown to cause or contribute to many serious health conditions, including heart disease, emphysema and cancers of the lung, breast, prostate and digestive tract (). There’s also research linking smoking and second-hand smoke exposure to type 2 diabetes (, , , ). In an analysis of several studies totaling over one million people, smoking was found to increase the risk of diabetes by 44% in average smokers and 61% in people who smoked more than 20 cigarettes daily (). One study followed the risk of diabetes in middle-aged male smokers after they quit. After five years their risk had reduced by 13%, and after 20 years they had the same risk as people who had never smoked (). Researchers stated that even though many of the men gained weight after quitting, after several smoke-free years, their risk of diabetes was lower than if they’d continued smoking. Smoking is strongly linked to the risk of diabetes, especially in heavy smokers. Quitting has been shown to reduce this risk over time. Following a or very-low-carb diet can help you avoid diabetes. Although there are a number of ways of eating that promote weight loss, very-low-carb diets have strong evidence behind them. They have consistently been shown to lower blood sugar and insulin levels, increase insulin sensitivity and reduce other diabetes risk factors (, , , , ). In a 12-week study, prediabetic individuals consumed either a low-fat or low-carb diet. Blood sugar dropped by 12% and insulin dropped by 50% in the low-carb group. In the low-fat group, meanwhile, blood sugar dropped by only 1% and insulin dropped by 19%. Thus, the low-carb diet had better results on both counts (). If you minimize your carb intake, your blood sugar levels won’t rise very much after you eat. Therefore, your body needs less insulin to maintain your blood sugar within healthy levels. What’s more, very-low-carb or ketogenic diets may also reduce fasting blood sugar. In a study of obese men with prediabetes who followed a ketogenic diet, average fasting blood sugar decreased from 118 to 92 mg/dl, which is within the normal range. Participants also lost weight and improved several other health markers (). For more info, check out this . Following a ketogenic or very-low-carb diet can help keep blood sugar and insulin levels under control, which may protect against diabetes. Whether or not you decide to follow a low-carb diet, it’s important to avoid large portions of food to reduce the risk of diabetes, especially if you are overweight. Eating too much food at one time has been shown to cause higher blood sugar and insulin levels in people at risk of diabetes (). On the other hand, decreasing portion sizes may help prevent this type of response. A two-year study in prediabetic men found that those who reduced food portion sizes and practiced other healthful nutrition behaviors had a 46% lower risk of developing diabetes than the men who made no lifestyle changes (). Another study looking at weight loss methods in people with prediabetes reported that the group practicing portion control lowered their blood sugar and insulin levels significantly after 12 weeks (). Avoiding large portion sizes can help reduce insulin and blood sugar levels and decrease the risk of diabetes. It’s important to avoid being sedentary if you want to prevent diabetes. If you get no or very little physical activity, and you sit during most of your day, then you lead a sedentary lifestyle. Observational studies have shown a consistent link between sedentary behavior and the risk of diabetes (, ). A large analysis of 47 studies found that people who spent the highest amount of time per day engaged in sedentary behavior had a 91% increased risk of developing diabetes (). Changing sedentary behavior can be as simple as from your desk and walking around for a few minutes every hour. Unfortunately, it can be hard to reverse firmly entrenched habits. One study gave young adults at risk of diabetes a 12-month program designed to change sedentary behavior. Sadly, after the program ended, the researchers found that participants hadn’t reduced how much time they sat (). Set realistic and achievable goals, such as standing while talking on the phone or taking the stairs instead of the elevator. Committing to these easy, concrete actions may be the best way to reverse sedentary tendencies. Avoiding sedentary behaviors like excessive sitting has been shown to reduce your risk of getting diabetes. Getting is beneficial for gut health and weight management. Studies in obese, elderly and prediabetic individuals have shown that it helps keep blood sugar and insulin levels low (, , , ). Fiber can be divided into : soluble and insoluble. Soluble fiber absorbs water, whereas insoluble fiber does not. In the digestive tract, soluble fiber and water form a gel that slows down the rate at which food is absorbed. This leads to a more gradual rise in blood sugar levels (). However, insoluble fiber has also been linked to reductions in blood sugar levels and a decreased risk of diabetes, although exactly how it works is not clear (, , ). Most unprocessed plant foods contain fiber, although some have more than others. Check out this list of for many excellent sources of fiber. Consuming a good fiber source at each meal can help prevent spikes in blood sugar and insulin levels, which may help reduce your risk of developing diabetes. Indeed, studies have found that people who don’t get enough vitamin D, or whose blood levels are , have a greater risk of all types of diabetes (, , , ). Most health organizations recommend maintaining a vitamin D blood level of at least 30 ng/ml (75 nmol/l). One study found that people with the highest blood levels of vitamin D were 43% less likely to develop type 2 diabetes than those with the lowest blood levels (). Another observational study looked at Finnish children who received supplements containing adequate levels of vitamin D. Children who took the vitamin D supplements had a 78% lower risk of developing type 1 diabetes than children who received less than the recommended amount of vitamin D (). Controlled studies have shown that when people who are deficient take vitamin D supplements, the function of their insulin-producing cells improves, their blood sugar levels normalize and their risk of diabetes reduces significantly (, ). Good food sources of vitamin D include fatty fish and cod liver oil. In addition, sun exposure can increase vitamin D levels in the blood. However, for many people, supplementing with 2,000–4,000 IU of vitamin D daily may be necessary to achieve and maintain optimal levels. Consuming foods high in vitamin D or taking supplements can help optimize vitamin D blood levels, which can reduce your risk of diabetes. One clear step you can take to improve your health is to minimize your consumption of processed foods. They’re linked to all sorts of health problems, including heart disease, obesity and diabetes. Studies suggest that cutting back on packaged foods that are high in vegetable oils, refined grains and additives may help reduce the risk of diabetes (, , ). This may be partly due to the protective effects of whole foods like nuts, vegetables, fruits and other plant foods. One study found that poor-quality diets that were high in processed foods increased the risk of diabetes by 30%. However, including nutritious whole foods helped reduce this risk (). Minimizing processed foods and focusing on whole foods with protective effects on health may help decrease the risk of diabetes. Although water should be your primary beverage, research suggests that including or tea in your diet may help you avoid diabetes. Studies have reported that drinking coffee on a daily basis by 8–54%, with the greatest effect generally seen in people with the highest consumption (, , , , , ). Another review of several studies that included caffeinated tea and coffee found similar results, with the largest risk reduction in women and overweight men (). Coffee and tea have antioxidants known as polyphenols that may help protect against diabetes (). In addition, contains a unique antioxidant compound called epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) that has been shown to reduce blood sugar release from the liver and increase insulin sensitivity (, ). Drinking coffee or tea may help reduce blood sugar levels, increase insulin sensitivity and reduce the risk of diabetes. There are that may help increase insulin sensitivity and reduce the likelihood of diabetes progression. is a component of the bright gold spice turmeric, which is one of the main ingredients in curries. It has strong anti-inflammatory properties and has been used in India for centuries as part of Ayurvedic medicine. Research has shown it can be very effective against arthritis and may help reduce inflammatory markers in people with prediabetes (, ). There’s also impressive evidence that it may decrease insulin resistance and reduce the risk of diabetes progression (, ). In a controlled nine-month study of 240 prediabetic adults, among the group who took 750 mg of curcumin daily, no one developed diabetes. However, 16.4% of the control group did (). In addition, the curcumin group experienced an increase in insulin sensitivity and improved functioning of insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. is found in several herbs and has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for thousands of years. Studies have shown that it fights inflammation and lowers cholesterol and other heart disease markers (). In addition, several studies in people with type 2 diabetes have found that berberine has strong blood-sugar-lowering properties (, , , ). In fact, a large analysis of 14 studies found that berberine is as effective at lowering blood sugar levels as metformin, one of the oldest and most widely used diabetes medications (). Because berberine works by increasing insulin sensitivity and reducing the release of sugar by the liver, it might theoretically help people with prediabetes avoid diabetes. However, at this point there are no studies that have looked at this. In addition, since its effects on blood sugar are so strong, it should not be used in conjunction with other diabetes medications unless authorized by a doctor. The herbs curcumin and berberine increase insulin sensitivity, reduce blood sugar levels and may help prevent diabetes. You have control over many of the factors that influence diabetes. Rather than viewing prediabetes as a stepping stone to diabetes, it may be helpful to see it as a motivator for making changes that can help reduce your risk. Eating the right foods and adopting other lifestyle behaviors that promote healthy blood sugar and insulin levels will give you the best chance at avoiding diabetes. — What’s the Connection Between Hypoglycemia and Pregnancy?

de160ded-218b-4b16-a1d2-7d64ff9e7f81,"— Type 2 diabetes is a chronic disease that affects millions of people worldwide. Uncontrolled cases can cause blindness, kidney failure, heart disease and other serious conditions. Before diabetes is diagnosed, there is a period where blood sugar levels are high but not high enough to be diagnosed as diabetes. This is known as prediabetes. It’s estimated that up to 70% of people with prediabetes go on to develop type 2 diabetes. Fortunately, progressing from prediabetes to diabetes isn’t inevitable (). Although there are certain factors you can’t change — such as your genes, age or past behaviors — there are many actions you can take to reduce the risk of diabetes. Eating and can put at-risk individuals on the fast track to developing diabetes. Your body rapidly breaks these foods down into small sugar molecules, which are absorbed into your bloodstream. The resulting rise in blood sugar stimulates your pancreas to produce , a hormone that helps sugar get out of the bloodstream and into your body’s cells. In people with prediabetes, the body’s cells are resistant to insulin’s action, so sugar remains high in the blood. To compensate, the pancreas produces more insulin, attempting to bring blood sugar down to a healthy level. Over time, this can lead to progressively higher blood sugar and insulin levels, until the condition eventually turns into type 2 diabetes. Many studies have shown a link between the frequent consumption of sugar or refined carbs and the risk of diabetes. What’s more, replacing them with foods that have less of an effect on blood sugar may help reduce your risk (, , , , ). A detailed analysis of 37 studies found that people with the highest intakes of fast-digesting carbs were 40% more likely to develop diabetes than those with the lowest intakes (). Eating foods high in refined carbs and sugar increases blood sugar and insulin levels, which may lead to diabetes over time. Avoiding these foods may help reduce your risk. Performing on a regular basis may help prevent diabetes. Exercise increases the insulin sensitivity of your cells. So when you exercise, less insulin is required to keep your blood sugar levels under control. One study in people with prediabetes found that moderate-intensity exercise increased insulin sensitivity by 51% and high-intensity exercise increased it by 85%. However, this effect only occurred on workout days (). Many types of physical activity have been shown to reduce insulin resistance and blood sugar in overweight, obese and prediabetic adults. These include aerobic exercise, high-intensity interval training and strength training (, , , , , ). Working out more frequently seems to lead to improvements in insulin response and function. One study in people at risk of diabetes found that burning more than 2,000 weekly via exercise was required to achieve these benefits (). Therefore, it’s best to choose physical activity that you enjoy, can engage in regularly and feel you can stick with long-term. Performing physical activity on a regular basis can increase insulin secretion and sensitivity, which may help prevent the progression from prediabetes to diabetes. is by far the most natural beverage you can drink. What’s more, sticking with water most of the time helps you avoid beverages that are high in sugar, preservatives and other questionable ingredients. Sugary beverages like soda and punch have been linked to an increased risk of both type 2 diabetes and latent autoimmune diabetes of adults (LADA). LADA is a form of type 1 diabetes that occurs in people over 18 years of age. Unlike the acute symptoms seen with type 1 diabetes in childhood, LADA develops slowly, requiring more treatment as the disease progresses (). One large observational study looked at the diabetes risk of 2,800 people. Those who consumed more than two servings of sugar-sweetened beverages per day had a 99% increased risk of developing LADA and a 20% increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes (). Researchers of one study on the effects of sweet drinks on diabetes stated that neither artificially sweetened beverages nor were good beverages for diabetes prevention (). By contrast, consuming water may provide benefits. Some studies have found that increased water consumption may lead to better blood sugar control and insulin response (, ). One 24-week study showed that overweight adults who replaced diet sodas with water while following a weight loss program experienced a decrease in insulin resistance and and insulin levels (). Drinking water instead of other beverages may help control blood sugar and insulin levels, thereby reducing the risk of diabetes. Although not everyone who develops type 2 diabetes is overweight or obese, the majority are. What’s more, those with prediabetes tend to carry excess weight in their midsection and around abdominal organs like the liver. This is known as visceral fat. Excess visceral fat promotes inflammation and insulin resistance, which significantly increase the risk of diabetes (, , , ). Although losing even a small amount of weight can help reduce this risk, studies show that the more you lose, the more benefits you’ll experience (, ). One study of more than 1,000 people with prediabetes found that for every kilogram (2.2 lbs) of weight participants lost, their risk of diabetes reduced by 16%, up to a maximum reduction of 96% (). There are many healthy options for losing weight, including , Mediterranean, paleo and vegetarian diets. However, choosing a way of eating you can stick with long-term is key to helping you maintain the . One study found that obese people whose blood sugar and insulin levels decreased after losing weight experienced elevations in these values after gaining back all or a portion of the weight they lost (). Carrying excess weight, particularly in the abdominal area, increases the likelihood of developing diabetes. Losing weight may significantly reduce the risk of diabetes. Smoking has been shown to cause or contribute to many serious health conditions, including heart disease, emphysema and cancers of the lung, breast, prostate and digestive tract (). There’s also research linking smoking and second-hand smoke exposure to type 2 diabetes (, , , ). In an analysis of several studies totaling over one million people, smoking was found to increase the risk of diabetes by 44% in average smokers and 61% in people who smoked more than 20 cigarettes daily (). One study followed the risk of diabetes in middle-aged male smokers after they quit. After five years their risk had reduced by 13%, and after 20 years they had the same risk as people who had never smoked (). Researchers stated that even though many of the men gained weight after quitting, after several smoke-free years, their risk of diabetes was lower than if they’d continued smoking. Smoking is strongly linked to the risk of diabetes, especially in heavy smokers. Quitting has been shown to reduce this risk over time. Following a or very-low-carb diet can help you avoid diabetes. Although there are a number of ways of eating that promote weight loss, very-low-carb diets have strong evidence behind them. They have consistently been shown to lower blood sugar and insulin levels, increase insulin sensitivity and reduce other diabetes risk factors (, , , , ). In a 12-week study, prediabetic individuals consumed either a low-fat or low-carb diet. Blood sugar dropped by 12% and insulin dropped by 50% in the low-carb group. In the low-fat group, meanwhile, blood sugar dropped by only 1% and insulin dropped by 19%. Thus, the low-carb diet had better results on both counts (). If you minimize your carb intake, your blood sugar levels won’t rise very much after you eat. Therefore, your body needs less insulin to maintain your blood sugar within healthy levels. What’s more, very-low-carb or ketogenic diets may also reduce fasting blood sugar. In a study of obese men with prediabetes who followed a ketogenic diet, average fasting blood sugar decreased from 118 to 92 mg/dl, which is within the normal range. Participants also lost weight and improved several other health markers (). For more info, check out this . Following a ketogenic or very-low-carb diet can help keep blood sugar and insulin levels under control, which may protect against diabetes. Whether or not you decide to follow a low-carb diet, it’s important to avoid large portions of food to reduce the risk of diabetes, especially if you are overweight. Eating too much food at one time has been shown to cause higher blood sugar and insulin levels in people at risk of diabetes (). On the other hand, decreasing portion sizes may help prevent this type of response. A two-year study in prediabetic men found that those who reduced food portion sizes and practiced other healthful nutrition behaviors had a 46% lower risk of developing diabetes than the men who made no lifestyle changes (). Another study looking at weight loss methods in people with prediabetes reported that the group practicing portion control lowered their blood sugar and insulin levels significantly after 12 weeks (). Avoiding large portion sizes can help reduce insulin and blood sugar levels and decrease the risk of diabetes. It’s important to avoid being sedentary if you want to prevent diabetes. If you get no or very little physical activity, and you sit during most of your day, then you lead a sedentary lifestyle. Observational studies have shown a consistent link between sedentary behavior and the risk of diabetes (, ). A large analysis of 47 studies found that people who spent the highest amount of time per day engaged in sedentary behavior had a 91% increased risk of developing diabetes (). Changing sedentary behavior can be as simple as from your desk and walking around for a few minutes every hour. Unfortunately, it can be hard to reverse firmly entrenched habits. One study gave young adults at risk of diabetes a 12-month program designed to change sedentary behavior. Sadly, after the program ended, the researchers found that participants hadn’t reduced how much time they sat (). Set realistic and achievable goals, such as standing while talking on the phone or taking the stairs instead of the elevator. Committing to these easy, concrete actions may be the best way to reverse sedentary tendencies. Avoiding sedentary behaviors like excessive sitting has been shown to reduce your risk of getting diabetes. Getting is beneficial for gut health and weight management. Studies in obese, elderly and prediabetic individuals have shown that it helps keep blood sugar and insulin levels low (, , , ). Fiber can be divided into : soluble and insoluble. Soluble fiber absorbs water, whereas insoluble fiber does not. In the digestive tract, soluble fiber and water form a gel that slows down the rate at which food is absorbed. This leads to a more gradual rise in blood sugar levels (). However, insoluble fiber has also been linked to reductions in blood sugar levels and a decreased risk of diabetes, although exactly how it works is not clear (, , ). Most unprocessed plant foods contain fiber, although some have more than others. Check out this list of for many excellent sources of fiber. Consuming a good fiber source at each meal can help prevent spikes in blood sugar and insulin levels, which may help reduce your risk of developing diabetes. Indeed, studies have found that people who don’t get enough vitamin D, or whose blood levels are , have a greater risk of all types of diabetes (, , , ). Most health organizations recommend maintaining a vitamin D blood level of at least 30 ng/ml (75 nmol/l). One study found that people with the highest blood levels of vitamin D were 43% less likely to develop type 2 diabetes than those with the lowest blood levels (). Another observational study looked at Finnish children who received supplements containing adequate levels of vitamin D. Children who took the vitamin D supplements had a 78% lower risk of developing type 1 diabetes than children who received less than the recommended amount of vitamin D (). Controlled studies have shown that when people who are deficient take vitamin D supplements, the function of their insulin-producing cells improves, their blood sugar levels normalize and their risk of diabetes reduces significantly (, ). Good food sources of vitamin D include fatty fish and cod liver oil. In addition, sun exposure can increase vitamin D levels in the blood. However, for many people, supplementing with 2,000–4,000 IU of vitamin D daily may be necessary to achieve and maintain optimal levels. Consuming foods high in vitamin D or taking supplements can help optimize vitamin D blood levels, which can reduce your risk of diabetes. One clear step you can take to improve your health is to minimize your consumption of processed foods. They’re linked to all sorts of health problems, including heart disease, obesity and diabetes. Studies suggest that cutting back on packaged foods that are high in vegetable oils, refined grains and additives may help reduce the risk of diabetes (, , ). This may be partly due to the protective effects of whole foods like nuts, vegetables, fruits and other plant foods. One study found that poor-quality diets that were high in processed foods increased the risk of diabetes by 30%. However, including nutritious whole foods helped reduce this risk (). Minimizing processed foods and focusing on whole foods with protective effects on health may help decrease the risk of diabetes. Although water should be your primary beverage, research suggests that including or tea in your diet may help you avoid diabetes. Studies have reported that drinking coffee on a daily basis by 8–54%, with the greatest effect generally seen in people with the highest consumption (, , , , , ). Another review of several studies that included caffeinated tea and coffee found similar results, with the largest risk reduction in women and overweight men (). Coffee and tea have antioxidants known as polyphenols that may help protect against diabetes (). In addition, contains a unique antioxidant compound called epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) that has been shown to reduce blood sugar release from the liver and increase insulin sensitivity (, ). Drinking coffee or tea may help reduce blood sugar levels, increase insulin sensitivity and reduce the risk of diabetes. There are that may help increase insulin sensitivity and reduce the likelihood of diabetes progression. is a component of the bright gold spice turmeric, which is one of the main ingredients in curries. It has strong anti-inflammatory properties and has been used in India for centuries as part of Ayurvedic medicine. Research has shown it can be very effective against arthritis and may help reduce inflammatory markers in people with prediabetes (, ). There’s also impressive evidence that it may decrease insulin resistance and reduce the risk of diabetes progression (, ). In a controlled nine-month study of 240 prediabetic adults, among the group who took 750 mg of curcumin daily, no one developed diabetes. However, 16.4% of the control group did (). In addition, the curcumin group experienced an increase in insulin sensitivity and improved functioning of insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. is found in several herbs and has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for thousands of years. Studies have shown that it fights inflammation and lowers cholesterol and other heart disease markers (). In addition, several studies in people with type 2 diabetes have found that berberine has strong blood-sugar-lowering properties (, , , ). In fact, a large analysis of 14 studies found that berberine is as effective at lowering blood sugar levels as metformin, one of the oldest and most widely used diabetes medications (). Because berberine works by increasing insulin sensitivity and reducing the release of sugar by the liver, it might theoretically help people with prediabetes avoid diabetes. However, at this point there are no studies that have looked at this. In addition, since its effects on blood sugar are so strong, it should not be used in conjunction with other diabetes medications unless authorized by a doctor. The herbs curcumin and berberine increase insulin sensitivity, reduce blood sugar levels and may help prevent diabetes. You have control over many of the factors that influence diabetes. Rather than viewing prediabetes as a stepping stone to diabetes, it may be helpful to see it as a motivator for making changes that can help reduce your risk. Eating the right foods and adopting other lifestyle behaviors that promote healthy blood sugar and insulin levels will give you the best chance at avoiding diabetes. — What’s the Connection Between Hypoglycemia and Pregnancy?

When You’re Living With Type 2 Diabetes, Your Family Lives With It As Well By Laura Hieronymus, DNP, MSEd, RN, MLDE, BC-ADM, CDCES, FADCES, Diabetes affects 29.1 million Americans, or 9.3% of the U.S. population — and of all people with diabetes, about 95% have . When you live with Type 2 diabetes, you quickly realize that your immediate family lives with it, too. Family support is essential when it comes to day-to-day management of diabetes and avoiding serious health issues related to the disease. Diabetes can affect the entire family in several ways. In particular, your blood relatives should be aware that a family history of Type 2 diabetes puts them at higher risk for developing both Type 2 and . Prediabetes is diagnosed when blood glucose is higher than normal but not high enough for a diagnosis of diabetes; it’s a risk factor for the development of Type 2 diabetes. It is well documented that Type 2 diabetes runs in families. If you have it, your family members — especially close relatives such as siblings and children — have a strong genetic tendency to develop the disease. Your children’s risk of developing diabetes correlates with the age at which you were diagnosed. If you were diagnosed before age 50, your offspring have a one in seven chance of developing Type 2 diabetes; if you were diagnosed after age 50, the possibility drops to one in 13. Some research suggests that a child’s risk for developing Type 2 diabetes increases if the parent with Type 2 is the mother, and that the risk goes up to about 50% if both parents have it. If you’re an identical twin with Type 2 diabetes, your twin’s risk is almost three in four. In fact, if you have Type 2 diabetes but can’t think of any relatives who have it, chances are that some do have it but don’t know it yet. Currently, almost 30% of people with Type 2 diabetes are unaware they have it, and 51% of people aged 65 years or older have prediabetes. The risk for Type 2 diabetes is also higher if your family is of Asian American, African American, Native American, Alaskan native, or Hispanic descent. occurs during pregnancy and usually disappears once the baby is delivered. A family history of Type 2 diabetes raises the risk of developing gestational diabetes, and having gestational diabetes significantly raises a woman’s risk of developing Type 2 diabetes later in life. If you have Type 2 diabetes and have a daughter of childbearing age who is considering pregnancy, be sure she is aware of these risks. In addition, when a woman has a history of gestational diabetes, her child’s risk of developing Type 2 diabetes increases. You can be an advocate for your family members by discussing and addressing their higher risk for Type 2 diabetes, prediabetes, and gestational diabetes. Genetics and ethnicity cannot be changed, but being aware of these risk factors can encourage your family members to attend to any modifiable risks they may have, and sooner rather than later. (For expert tips from an endocrinologist on how to engage your family members in learning about their own risk, .) Encourage your family members to make changes that may help lower their risk for Type 2 diabetes. For example, being overweight or obese and maintaining a sedentary lifestyle increases the risk for Type 2 diabetes. The degree of risk increases as one’s (BMI) increases — in fact, around 85% of those with Type 2 diabetes are heavier than their ideal body weight. Since these risk factors can be modified, you and your family members will benefit from focusing on lifestyle changes that not only help your own diabetes treatment plan but also put your family members on a preventive path. Data show that people with prediabetes are at high risk for developing Type 2 diabetes, but prediabetes isn’t inevitable. The adoption of healthy eating patterns, a weight reduction of 5% to 10% of total body weight, and regular physical activity can bring blood glucose levels back to normal and possibly prevent or postpone the onset of Type 2 diabetes. Dietary changes and physical activity are also cornerstones for the treatment of gestational diabetes. After delivery, women who have had gestational diabetes can substantially lower their risk of developing gestational diabetes with future pregnancies and Type 2 diabetes later on by following a program of healthy eating and exercise. A healthful meal plan is an important part of your treatment plan when you have Type 2 diabetes. A consultation with a registered dietitian (RD) is essential to help you learn things such as interpreting nutrition facts labels, managing portion size, learning the effect and balance of carbohydrate-containing foods, and modifying caloric intake to achieve a healthy body weight. Various meal-planning options are acceptable for diabetes management; an RD will consider your personal preferences and diabetes treatment goals to help customize your meal plan. Medicare and many health insurance plans cover counseling sessions with an RD for people with diabetes. Take advantage of this resource with periodic return visits to help you stay on top of your healthful eating efforts; also, bring a family member along who can benefit from the experience. Of course, healthy eating is recommended for everyone, and your family members who don’t have Type 2 diabetes are no exception. In fact, people at high risk for developing Type 2 diabetes can reduce that risk with a moderate weight loss — approximately 7% of body weight — using dietary strategies that include eating fewer calories and reducing their intake of dietary fat. (See the sidebar for ideas on managing your Type 2 diabetes and reducing your family members’ risk.) Most Americans, including people with Type 2 diabetes, fall far short of recommended daily allowances for fiber and whole grains. To improve both your and your family’s intake of fiber and whole grains, eat five or more servings of fruits and vegetables each day. Beans — kidney beans, black beans, and red beans — contain lots of soluble fiber that lowers total blood cholesterol, which is often elevated in individuals with diabetes. A good rule of thumb is to “stick close to Mother Nature,” because less processed foods typically have more fiber. Start by trying to make at least half of your grains whole by choosing 100% whole wheat bread for sandwiches, popcorn (hold the butter) for a healthy snack, and whole grain breakfast cereals. Even healthy foods can contain carbohydrate, so it’s important to use nutrition facts labels to help you balance the carbohydrate in your meal plan. Help your family members learn to read labels; it can be eye-opening. If you’re not already doing so, get the family together for meals. Did you know that some research suggests that eating together as a family reduces the risk of being overweight and having eating disorders? In addition, the family that eats together appears to consume more healthful foods. Adults with Type 2 diabetes should work toward increasing to at least 150 minutes on a weekly basis. The ideal is moderate aerobic activity such as walking (2 miles in 30 minutes) spread over at least three days each week, with no more than two days in a row without exercising. Some other examples of moderate physical activity include bicycling (4 miles in 15 minutes), water aerobics (30 minutes), stair walking (15 minutes), gardening (30 to 45 minutes), and raking leaves (30 minutes). During physical activity, try to maintain a heart rate between 50% and 70% of your maximum heart rate. To calculate your maximum heart rate, subtract your age from 220. If you’re 60 years old your maximum heart rate is 220 minus 60, or 160 beats per minute, so 50% to 70% of your maximum heart rate would be 80 to 112 beats per minute. During the first few weeks, aim for the lowest part of your target rate, then gradually build up to the higher number. Unless your health-care provider advises you not to, add resistance or strength training to your regimen at least twice a week to build and maintain muscle. Regular physical activity and exercise can help improve hemoglobin (an estimate of your average blood glucose level over the past two or three months), overall fitness, heart health, muscle strength, and sensitivity to insulin, the hormone that helps control blood glucose levels. If physical activity hasn’t been a regular part of your diabetes treatment plan, start slowly and build up. And it’s always a good idea to discuss any plans with your health-care provider, just to make sure that you’re in shape to handle added physical activity. Let your family members know about your regular physical activity — joining in and exercising with you may help them avoid developing Type 2 diabetes. Regular moderate activity of 150 minutes per week has been shown to reduce blood glucose in those at risk and decrease the rate of onset of Type 2 diabetes over time. Even young children in your family who are risk for Type 2 diabetes can benefit by engaging in at least 60 minutes of daily physical activity. Equally important, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends limiting a child’s total entertainment screen time — that is to say, sedentary time — to less than two hours per day. To increase the whole family’s activity levels, try to include more “NEAT” (non-exercise activity thermogenesis) activities like walking up and down stairs and walking in place during TV commercials in everyday life. Lead by example where physical activity and exercise is concerned; it will help with your own day-to-day diabetes management and, if they follow you, could lower your family’s risk for Type 2 diabetes. For holidays and birthdays, consider fitness-oriented gifts with each family member’s interests in mind, and think “family activity” during every season. Winter workouts may include building a snowman or, when the weather is too cold to be outside, walking in the mall. In the spring, plan a family vacation or weekend outing that includes exercise. As the weather warms up, skip the drive-through car wash and tackle the job as a family. During the summer months, make going for a walk, run, or bike ride together a scheduled event. Take up a new family hobby such as inline skating, tennis, or hiking. And in the autumn, sign up as a family and train together for a charity run, walk, or bike ride, or take weekend walks in different places around town. Your blood relatives should tell their health-care providers about their family history of Type 2 diabetes and be tested for it. Adults of any age who are overweight and have any other risk factors should be tested for diabetes; adults with no risk factors should be tested initially at age 45 and, if those test results are normal, at least every three years afterward. When an adult has risk factors for Type 2 diabetes but normal blood glucose levels upon testing, a health-care provider may choose to test more frequently than every three years. Children who are overweight and match two of the following factors should be monitored for Type 2 diabetes at age 10 or at the onset of puberty, whichever comes first: • a family history of Type 2 in first- or second-degree relative; • Native American, African American, Latino, Asian American, or Pacific Islander ethnic heritage; • signs of insulin resistance or conditions associated with insulin resistance; or • a mother with a history of diabetes or gestational diabetes while carrying the child. Encourage your family members to be proactive in their efforts to minimize their risks for Type 2 diabetes. Increased physical activity, healthy food choices, and sustained weight reduction all improve insulin sensitivity and therefore decrease . These positive lifestyle behaviors also lower blood pressure and blood fat levels, which also can help lower the risk of heart disease. With awareness, information, and proactive conversation, make sure that your legacy is not Type 2 diabetes, but a habit of healthy family living.

843630f7-b6c4-4abc-91d2-3f7a421b32de,"BMI May Be a Bigger Risk Factor for Type 2 Diabetes Than Genetics — by Michael Crescione Researchers say body mass index (BMI) may be a higher risk factor for type 2 diabetes than genetics. Other experts say genetics is actually the number one factor for developing diabetes, but they note that lowering BMI can help delay or even prevent the onset of the disease. They say you can lower your risk for type 2 diabetes by having your blood sugar screened every 3 years after age 45 as well as exercising regularly, eating a healthy diet, and not smoking. Of those risk factors, the only one you have any control over is weight. Managing your weight may prevent type 2 diabetes, delay onset, or even reverse it in some cases, according to new presented at the European Society of Cardiology Congress 2020. The study involved more than 445,000 people in the United Kingdom. Participants were divided into groups according to genetic risk and . Average age was about 57 years. Researchers followed participants to an average age of 65 years. During that time, more than 31,000 people developed type 2 diabetes. The group with the highest BMI was found to have the greatest risk over other groups, independent of genetic risk. The researchers suggest that BMI has a more powerful impact on diabetes risk than genetics. They also theorize there’s a certain BMI threshold where blood sugar levels become abnormal. This, researchers say, may differ from person to person. , an endocrinologist at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, specializes in treating people with diabetes. We need to look at this data carefully, Wyne advised Healthline. “Review of data from the U.K. shows that while there is diabetes in the 45- to 55-year-old age group, it really starts to take off in this older group, around the age they studied,” she explained. Wyne contrasts that with the United States, where as early as 2000, the average age at diagnosis is the early 40s. “The other problem with this analysis is that they took a very heterogenous disease and tried to create groups based on BMI and clusters from the genes they included in the analysis,” she said. Wyne notes that a single gene doesn’t cause type 2 diabetes. Multiple genes with partial or complete defects are likely to cause it. “What would be interesting is to compare the gene profiles in the most lean and most obese of the people who did develop diabetes. Or take the … then ask where these people fit into those phenotypic groups and look at their gene cluster. I doubt the obese people would all sort into the same one of the five groups, thereby proving that obesity does not identify a homogeneous risk group,” Wyne said. According to Wyne, the single biggest factor is genetics. “However, you have control over when you get the diabetes. This is related to the combination of weight and activity level. At the same weight, the more active person is more insulin sensitive and less likely to progress to diabetes. If you keep your weight down, then you can possibly put off your diabetes until you are in your 70s,” Wyne said. is an endocrinologist with Santa Clara Valley Medical Center in San Jose, California. Hsu emphasizes the new research is specific to , the form, as opposed to type 1 or rare forms of diabetes. “In general, type 2 diabetes is the result of insulin resistance. The body’s blood sugars are too high despite your body making enough insulin, a hormone made in the pancreas that allows sugar to be utilized by your cells,” he told Healthline. “The frustrating thing about type 2 diabetes is that there is no one definitive cause and no one magic bullet. It’s what we call multifactorial, meaning many things may increase or decrease your risk. It would be hard to say there is one single biggest factor. This research identifies that obesity is a large contributor,” Hsu said. Not all people with obesity develop diabetes, and some people with a moderate weight do. “There are many more nuances to obesity, such as the distribution of fat and whether it is more central or peripheral (often different between women and men), and ethnic differences that we don’t completely understand. For example, the risk of diabetes starts at a lower BMI for South Asians and East Asians compared to Caucasians or Africans,” Hsu said. is the deputy chief medical officer for L.A. Care Health Plan in Los Angeles, California. “In terms of primary causes of diabetes, we’re shifting from a genetic component to more social or maybe environmental changes,” Li told Healthline. He cites factors such as food availability, increasingly sedentary lifestyle, and longer life expectancy. Li says everyone should have their blood sugar checked on a regular basis. “There’s a general desire in the health community to test early and to detect early enough,” he said. “Part of the new framework adapted 8 to 10 years ago is to look for people with and recognize there might be a progression of those at risk for diabetes. So, if blood sugar is elevated, but not high enough to be diabetes, you’re at least giving people a chance to take a more active role in their health.” Absent risk factors, the recommends that people start screening at age 45 and then every 3 years if results are normal. “However, adults with risk factors should be screened earlier, and a very large percentage of the country is considered at higher risk,” Hsu said. “Unfortunately, most of the time there are no obvious clinical signs for diabetes, so the diagnosis may be missed for a long time if someone doesn’t go for a checkup. Rarely, someone with a very high sugar level may present with frequent thirst, frequent urination, and/or blurry vision,” he added. Diabetes the risk of heart disease and stroke. It’s also the of death in the United States. Despite that reality, Li wants people to know that diabetes isn’t a death sentence. “Many people are able to get it under control. However, if one doesn’t control it, one can easily go blind, have increased risk of heart attack and stroke, as well as losing limbs or nerve sensations,” Li said. “We try to paint a broad picture that you have ability to turn this around. Increasing physical activity and lowering calorie intake seems to be effective enough in the prediabetic phase. It’s also possible after a diabetes diagnosis, but basically, one has to work harder,” he added. “Many times, antidiabetic medication is needed to control blood sugar. Some may need insulin for a period of time. Some can potentially get off insulin again and let the body’s natural insulin production help modulate one’s blood sugar. Others may become insulin dependent. It depends on one’s own innate ability to produce insulin and the response to natural insulin still available in the body,” Li explained. Dramatic changes are usually not sustainable, he cautions. “When you go slow and steady in changing your behavior, you can adapt to a better lifestyle,” Li said. Hsu advises first checking with your doctor to make sure the changes you want to make are safe, as well as these tips: If you’re sedentary, any additional activity is good. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise a day. If you smoke, quit. Quitting can be very difficult, so . Replace processed foods, red meats, and simple carbohydrates with whole grains, nuts, beans, and fresh fruits and vegetables. “There are other ‘hot topic’ areas of research, such as gut microbiota, artificial sweeteners, environmental pollutants, and endocrine disruptors, etc.,” Hsu said. The bottom line, though, is still eating less, choosing more fresh foods over processed, and exercising, he says. “These are the foundations of a healthier and happier life,” Hsu said. Wyne says many people with diabetes are actually doing better through the . They have more time to focus on healthy eating and taking daily walks. Wyne suspects there may be an increase in type 2 diabetes diagnoses during the next year. That’s because the pandemic has pushed some people into a more sedentary lifestyle. If you do develop type 2 diabetes, Wyne doesn’t want you to think it’s your own fault. “It is clearly inherited. But, as mentioned earlier, you have control over when you get it. Hopefully you can put it off until you are in your 70s, or maybe even 80s or 90s, by staying active and eating healthy,” she said. — by Michael Crescione Is COVID-19 Triggering Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes?

By: | Tags:          The study, involving 94,250 women across the United States, was led by San Diego State University. The co-authored study, led by Heather L. Corliss, investigated the incidence of in lesbian and bisexual women and heterosexual women. Also Read - Also Read - For the study, the team analysed survey results dating back to 1989 from women participating in the Nurses’ Health Study II, which is one of the largest investigations into the risk factors for major chronic diseases in women. All women were between the ages 24 to 44 at the start of the study and were assessed for a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes every other year to identify the incidence, from 1989 to 2013. The women self-identified their sexual orientation and, of the participants, 1,267 identified as lesbian or bisexual and 92,983 identified as heterosexual. Diabetes was assessed by self-reported clinician diagnosis. Also Read - Can diabetes be prevented? Things to do if you are at risk Corliss and her colleagues found over that 24-year time period that lesbian and women had a 27 percent higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes than heterosexual women. In 2013, 6,399 women had developed type 2 diabetes with lesbian and bisexual women having a 22 percent greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes. The team also found that lesbian and bisexual women developed type 2 diabetes at younger ages than heterosexual women and that a higher body mass index in lesbian and bisexual women was an important contributor to disparities found. “Given the significantly higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes before age 50 years among LB women, and their potentially longer duration of living with type 2 diabetes, LB women may also be more likely to experience complications compared with heterosexual women,” the researchers wrote in the paper. Stress is an important consideration, here. The team noted that stress related to discrimination, violence victimization and psychological distress, were reportedly higher for lesbian and bisexual women, and these factors may contribute to higher rates of health-related issues for those women. “Although it is important to address behavioral factors such as physical activity,sedentary behaviour and dietary intake, focusing on these factors alone may not be sufficient to eliminate LB women’s disparities in chronic disease,” the team explained.

fc6907ef-ecab-4863-b90a-47234e5f5138,"Utility of genetic and non-genetic risk factors in prediction of type 2 diabetes: Whitehall II prospective cohort study Utility of genetic and non-genetic risk factors in prediction of type 2 diabetes: Whitehall II prospective cohort study ; , , , , , , Centre of Cardiovascular Genetics, Department of Medicine, University College London, London WC1E 6JF Genetic Epidemiology Group, Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London, London WC1E 6BT Centre for Clinical Pharmacology, University College London, London WC1E 6JF Correspondence to: P J Talmud  To assess the performance of a panel of common single nucleotide polymorphisms (genotypes) associated with type 2 diabetes in distinguishing incident cases of future type 2 diabetes (discrimination), and to examine the effect of adding genetic information to previously validated non-genetic (phenotype based) models developed to estimate the absolute risk of type 2 diabetes. Workplace based prospective cohort study with three 5 yearly medical screenings. 5535 initially healthy people (mean age 49 years; 33% women), of whom 302 developed new onset type 2 diabetes over 10 years. Non-genetic variables included in two established risk models—the Cambridge type 2 diabetes risk score (age, sex, drug treatment, family history of type 2 diabetes, body mass index, smoking status) and the Framingham offspring study type 2 diabetes risk score (age, sex, parental history of type 2 diabetes, body mass index, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting glucose)—and 20 single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with susceptibility to type 2 diabetes. Cases of incident type 2 diabetes were defined on the basis of a standard oral glucose tolerance test, self report of a doctor’s diagnosis, or the use of anti-diabetic drugs. A genetic score based on the number of risk alleles carried (range 0-40; area under receiver operating characteristics curve 0.54, 95% confidence interval 0.50 to 0.58) and a genetic risk function in which carriage of risk alleles was weighted according to the summary odds ratios of their effect from meta-analyses of genetic studies (area under receiver operating characteristics curve 0.55, 0.51 to 0.59) did not effectively discriminate cases of diabetes. The Cambridge risk score (area under curve 0.72, 0.69 to 0.76) and the Framingham offspring risk score (area under curve 0.78, 0.75 to 0.82) led to better discrimination of cases than did genotype based tests. Adding genetic information to phenotype based risk models did not improve discrimination and provided only a small improvement in model calibration and a modest net reclassification improvement of about 5% when added to the Cambridge risk score but not when added to the Framingham offspring risk score. The phenotype based risk models provided greater discrimination for type 2 diabetes than did models based on 20 common independently inherited diabetes risk alleles. The addition of genotypes to phenotype based risk models produced only minimal improvement in accuracy of risk estimation assessed by recalibration and, at best, a minor net reclassification improvement. The major translational application of the currently known common, small effect genetic variants influencing susceptibility to type 2 diabetes is likely to come from the insight they provide on causes of disease and potential therapeutic targets. Around one in 10 middle aged Europeans develop type 2 diabetes over a 10 year period. This may rise with the threatened epidemic of type 2 diabetes, driven partly by the increase in obesity, which is projected to result in a prevalence of type 2 diabetes worldwide of 366 million by 2030 (). This will place a considerable burden on healthcare systems, as type 2 diabetes is a common cause of renal failure and blindness and increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases and mortality. Estimation of people’s absolute risk of coronary heart disease, based on the Framingham, PROCAM, and QRISK equations, has become established as a means of targeting preventive interventions to those at highest risk. Earlier risk functions for estimating the risk of type 2 diabetes required an oral glucose tolerance test, which is impractical for screening large numbers of people. Despite evidence that some interventions prevent or delay development of type 2 diabetes in people at high risk, the prediction of risk of new onset type 2 diabetes has not been part of routine clinical practice. Two risk scores were published in 2007 and 2008. They were based on demographic, anthropometric, and biochemical measures but did not require information from an oral glucose tolerance test. The Cambridge type 2 diabetes risk score is a pragmatic algorithm incorporating the routinely assessed variables age, sex, drug treatment, family history of type 2 diabetes, body mass index, and smoking status. In validating this risk score in the EPIC-Norfolk study, Rahman et al reported that the model performed well in distinguishing cases of later type 2 diabetes (discrimination), with an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.75 (where 1 indicates perfect discrimination and 0.5 indicates no discrimination). The Framingham offspring type 2 diabetes risk score also makes use of routinely collected clinical data and biochemical measures including age, sex, parental history of type 2 diabetes, body mass index, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and fasting glucose. This model also provided good discrimination of incident cases of diabetes, with an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.85. Notably, the addition of other non-routinely collected measures of glucose metabolism such as the homoeostasis model assessment, fasting insulin, or two hour oral glucose tolerance test did not improve the risk prediction. Both risk algorithms include information on family history of type 2 diabetes. However, family history reflects shared environment as well as genotype, and whereas biochemical and non-biochemical features associated with type 2 diabetes alter with age, genetic predisposition is determined at conception and fixed through life. Identifying genotypes that alter susceptibility to type 2 diabetes, and using them on their own or in combination with existing phenotype based risk algorithms, might therefore improve prediction of risk, particularly if genotypes identify differences in the activity of pathways unmeasured in non-genetic risk models. Large case-control studies using whole genome arrays of single nucleotide polymorphisms (genome-wide association studies) have identified multiple common risk alleles for type 2 diabetes, many of which reside in or near genes not previously implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetes, in addition to confirming loci identified by previous candidate gene studies. Around 20 single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with type 2 diabetes have been identified, for which the findings from the discovery study have been independently replicated in additional datasets and the effect sizes evaluated precisely by meta-analysis (as detailed in web table A). For all loci identified to date, effect sizes have been modest, with odds ratios for risk of type 2 diabetes ranging from 1.37 for single nucleotide polymorphisms in the gene to 1.09 for those in the gene , raising the question of whether information on genotype would be useful for prediction of risk. Moreover, risk alleles have been discovered mainly by using case-control studies, which, although efficient for the discovery of disease associated single nucleotide polymorphisms, are suboptimal for evaluating their performance as predictors of risk. This is optimally assessed by genotyping the genetic markers in prospective studies of initially healthy people in whom cases of incident disease accrue over time. However, the study designs, the number of disease associated single nucleotide polymorphisms evaluated, the metrics used to evaluate predictive performance, and the methods used to compare the performance of genotype with non-genetic risk factors have been variable. Despite this, genetic tests for the prediction of type 2 diabetes have already become available in the commercial sector (for example, and ). In this study, we first compared the ability of two phenotype based risk algorithms, the Cambridge risk score and the Framingham offspring risk score, with genotype based risk models for the discrimination of incident cases of type 2 diabetes in the prospective Whitehall II study of civil servants in the United Kingdom. We then evaluated the effect of addition of genotypes to the two non-genetic risk algorithms on the ability to discriminate between people who developed type 2 diabetes and those who remained free of the disease. We further assessed the effect of adding genotype to the calibration of the risk models (which involves assessing the closeness of the observed event rate to the predicted risk in different risk categories) as well as reclassification (which assesses the extent to which addition of genetic information shifts people to categories of predicted risk that better reflect their eventual outcome). Between 1985 and 1988, all civil servants aged between 35 and 55 years in 20 departments in central London were invited to a medical examination at their workplace. With 73% participation, the cohort included 10 308 participants at entry to the study. At phase 3 in 1991-3, all participants known to be alive and in the country were invited to the screening clinic, which included an oral glucose tolerance test; 6058 men and 2758 women (85.5% of the original sample) attended. For this analysis, phase 3 (when an oral glucose tolerance test was done for the first time) serves as the baseline. Biochemical screening was repeated at phase 5 (1997-9) and phase 7 (2003-4). Additional questionnaire-only phases assessed diabetes status at phase 4 (1995-6) and phase 6 (2001). Of the baseline participants, 6156 participated in phase 7 screening, at which DNA was collected. We measured age, sex, body mass index, waist circumference, blood pressure, lipids, C reactive protein, fibrinogen, glucose, smoking, and coronary heart disease and diabetes status at baseline. Weight was measured in underwear to the nearest 0.1 kg on Soehnle electronic scales. We measured height in bare feet to the nearest 1 mm by using a stadiometer with the participant standing erect with head in the Frankfort plane. We calculated body mass index as weight (kilograms)/height (metres) squared. We measured waist circumference, taken as the smallest circumference at or below the costal margin, with participants unclothed in the standing position by using a fibreglass tape measure at 600 g tension. We measured systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure twice in the sitting position after five minutes’ rest with the Hawksley random zero sphygmomanometer. We took the average of the two readings to be the measured blood pressure. We took venous blood in the fasting state or at least five hours after a light, fat free breakfast, before a two hour 75 g oral glucose tolerance test was done. Serum for lipid analyses was refrigerated at −4°C and assayed within 72 hours. We used a Cobas Fara centrifugal analyser (Roche Diagnostics System, Nutley, NJ) to measure cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations. We measured high density lipoprotein cholesterol by precipitating non-high density lipoprotein cholesterol with dextran sulfate-magnesium chloride with the use of a centrifuge and measuring cholesterol in the supernatant fluid. We used the Friedewald formula to calculate low density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration. We measured C reactive protein in serum stored at −70°C with a high sensitivity immunonephelometric assay in a BN ProSpec nephelometer (Dade Behring, Milton Keynes). We measured fibrinogen by an automated Clauss assay in an MDA-180 coagulator (Organon Teknika, Cambridge), using the manufacturer’s reagents and the international fibrinogen standard. We measured blood glucose by the glucose oxidase method on a YSI Model 23A glucose analyser, and serum insulin with an in-house human insulin radioimmunoassay. We defined prevalent coronary heart disease as meeting MONICA criteria, giving positive responses to questions about chest pain, physician’s diagnosis, evidence from medical records, or positive electrocardiographic findings. Diabetes, HbA, and homoeostasis model assessment We determined diabetes status on the basis of a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (phases 3, 5, and 7), use of anti-diabetic drugs, or self report of a doctor’s diagnosis (phases 3 to 7). We defined diabetes by a two hour glucose of at least 11.1 mmol/l or fasting glucose of at least 7 mmol/l. Glycated haemoglobin (HbA) was measured at phase 7 in EDTA whole blood on a calibrated HPLC system with automated haemolysis before injection. HbA is resolved as a separate peak, which does not interfere with quantification of HbA. We calculated homoeostasis model assessment as (fasting glucose (mmol/l) × fasting insulin (mU/l)/22.5). Non-fasting participants (fasting less than five hours) were assigned a missing value (n=435, 9.1%). We extracted DNA from blood samples by using magnetic bead technology (Medical Solutions, Nottingham). Medical Solutions used SNPLex (Applied Biosciences) to determine the following single nucleotide polymorphisms, chosen because their association with diabetes risk has been replicated and the effect size has been estimated with precision from large scale meta-analysis (web table A): rs4607103, rs3792267, rs12779790, rs10811661, rs1421085 (which is complete LD with rs9930506), rs1111875, rs1800574, rs440296, rs864745, rs521, rs10923931, rs1801282, rs13266634, rs4430796, rs12255372, rs7578597, and rs7961581. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in rs10490072, rs17036101, rs7901695, and rs9472138 were genotyped by using the 50K IBC CVD chip (web table B). All single nucleotide polymorphisms were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (χ, P>0.05). We used two sample tests to compare mean baseline values of continuous variables in people who developed diabetes and those who did not. Where appropriate, we log transformed variables and present geometric means and approximate standard deviations. We used the χ test to compare categorical variables. We assessed the association of each genotype with risk of diabetes by logistic regression analysis and summarised the data by odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. We used published regression coefficients to calculate the Cambridge type 2 diabetes risk score and Framingham offspring study type 2 diabetes risk score for each participant. In addition, we calculated two genetic scores. In the first, we assigned each person a score based simply on the number of risk alleles carried. Thus for , , , , , , , , , and , we coded genotypes “0” for common allele homozygotes, “1” for heterozygotes, and “2” for rare allele homozygotes, and for , , , , , , , , and , coding was “2” for common allele homozygotes and “0” for rare allele homozygotes, as the rare allele is reported to be protective (see web table B). In the second score, we calculated a genetic risk function by using weights derived from the risk coefficient for each gene based on odds ratios reported in previous meta-analyses (web table A). Risk estimates for each allele were available for 18 genes, and we multiplied these coefficients by 0, 1, or 2 according to the number of risk alleles carried by each person. Where effect estimates were reported for carriage of either one or two copies of each risk allele as a single group ( and ), we multiplied risk coefficients by a score of 0 or 1. We assumed genetic and clinical variables to be independent and added the weighted genetic score to each of the risk algorithms to provide a combined phenotypic and genetic score. We assessed discrimination with the detection rate, which is equivalent to sensitivity and defined as the proportion of all cases detected for a pre-specified false positive rate, as well as the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve. We assessed the calibration of the Cambridge risk score and Framingham offspring risk score in the estimation of the absolute risk of type 2 diabetes by comparing the difference between observed and expected event rates in different categories of risk with the Hosmer-Lemeshow test, with Akaike’s information criterion and the likelihood ratio test as global measures of model fit. We used the net reclassification improvement measure to assess the extent to which adding the genetic variables reassigned people to risk categories that better reflected their final outcome. Web table C shows the baseline characteristics of the study participants. We excluded 103 people with prevalent type 2 diabetes at baseline from subsequent analysis. Of the 5135 participants followed for a median of 11.7 years to phase 7, with complete phenotype and genotype measures, 302 had developed type 2 diabetes by phase 7. The odds ratio for developing diabetes was 8.4 (95% confidence interval 5.1 to 13.9) for people in the top fifth of the Cambridge risk score distribution compared with those in the bottom fifth, and the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve was 0.72 (95% confidence interval 0.69 to 0.76) at phase 7 (table 1). The odds ratio for type 2 diabetes in participants in the top fifth of the Framingham offspring risk score distribution compared with those in the bottom fifth was 18.2 (9.8 to 33.8), with a significantly greater area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.78 (0.75 to 0.82) (P=0.01) (table 1 and fig 1). Detection rates (sensitivity) for a 5% false positive rate were 19.7 (95% confidence interval 14.1 to 25.3) for the Cambridge risk score (cut-off point 0.34) and 30.6 (24.1 to 37.1) for the Framingham offspring risk score (cut-off point 0.08). The respective detection rates for a 10% false positive rate were 34.2 (27.5 to 40.9; cut-off point 0.26) and 43.0 (36.0 to 50.0; cut-off point 0.05) (table 1).  Odds ratios and area under receiver operating characteristics curve for Cambridge type 2 diabetes risk score, Framingham offspring type 2 diabetes risk score, and genetic risk scores alone and in combination in Whitehall II study  Receiver operating characteristics curves for gene count score alone (area under curve 0.54, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.58), Framingham offspring risk score (area under curve 0.78, 0.75 to 0.82), and gene count score incorporated into Framingham offspring risk score (area under curve 0.78, 0.75 to 0.81) Web table B shows details of the 20 single nucleotide polymorphisms typed, together with risk estimates for type 2 diabetes from published meta-analyses (web table A). All genotypes were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. In line with previous reports, rs1421085 was associated with body mass index (P<0.001). rs10811661 (P=0.001), rs5219 (P<0.01), and rs7901695 (P<0.002) were associated with two hour glucose after an oral glucose tolerance test. rs3792267 was associated with significant differences in concentrations of total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (P=0.01). We found no other associations between genotypes and phenotypes included in either of the non-genetic risk models at phase 3 or phase 7 (web tables D-J). The point estimates of the effect sizes were consistent with previous meta-analyses involving many thousands of cases of type 2 diabetes (web table A). However, as would be expected in a prospective study with fewer cases of diabetes and in agreement with the previous report from a prospective study of similar size, most associations were not significant at P<0.05 in this dataset. Figure 2 shows the distribution of the gene count score in people who developed type 2 diabetes and those who remained free of diabetes; the web figure shows the equivalent data for genetic risk function. Fourteen per cent of people with type 2 diabetes were in the top fifth of the gene count score compared with 13.9% of those without type 2 diabetes (web table K). The odds ratio for type 2 diabetes for participants in the top fifth of the score was 1.6 (0.9 to 2.5) compared with those in the bottom fifth. Twenty-five per cent of people with type 2 diabetes were in the top fifth of the genetic risk function, compared with 20% of those without diabetes, giving an odds ratio for type 2 diabetes of 2.3 (1.5 to 3.8) (web table K). The mean gene count score was 21.1 (SD 2.6) in people with type 2 diabetes and 20.5 (2.7) in those without type 2 diabetes (web table K). The simple gene count and the genetic risk function gave very similar discrimination, with areas under the receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.54 (0.50 to 0.58) (fig 1) and 0.55 (0.51 to 0.59) (table 1). Table 1 shows the detection rates at 5% and 10% false positive rates.  Percentage of participants in each gene count score category among those who developed type 2 diabetes and those who remained free from diabetes. Risk of developing diabetes according to gene count shown as fitted line from regression analysis Effect of adding genetic information to discrimination and calibration of risk models The addition of genetic information to either of the phenotype based risk models (using the simple gene count or the genetic risk function) did not improve discrimination (table 1). Because part of the information included in the family history component of a risk score could reflect carriage of common genotypes, this may have undermined the incremental value of genetic information for predicting risk. However, the variants we studied explain only a small proportion of the familial aggregation of diabetes, and a formal analysis of the effect of inclusion or exclusion of the family history variable had almost no effect on the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (data available on request). The addition of genetic information did little to alter the accuracy of the phenotype based models when assessed with the Hosmer-Lemeshow test of calibration (table 2). Although the improvement in fit of the model was statistically significant when the Cambridge risk score was supplemented by the genetic risk function, the magnitude of the change was very small and unlikely to have any worthwhile clinical impact.  Effect of adding genetic information to global model fit and calibration of risk models to examine indices of model fit We generated four 10 year risk categories for type 2 diabetes for each of the two phenotype based risk models (≤5%, 5-9.9%, 10-14.9%, and ≥15%) and then compared the observed and predicted event rates in each category of risk to assess if the addition of genetic information improved calibration (that is, the closeness of the observed event rate to the predicted risk) (table 3). The phenotype based risk models accurately estimated the rates of diabetes in each of the four categories of predicted risk.  Prevalence and percentage of incident cases of type 2 diabetes in categories of predicted risk calculated by using phenotype based risk models alone, and same models with addition of genetic data We used the net reclassification index to assess the extent to which adding genotype data to the phenotype based risk models resulted in the movement of participants into risk categories that more accurately reflected their eventual outcome. In these analyses, we used the same four risk categories (≤5%, 5-9.9%, 10-14.9%, and ≥15%) and did the analyses separately for people diagnosed as having type 2 diabetes on follow-up and those who remained healthy. Among the eventual cases, a shift to a higher risk category on the addition of genetic information is classed as a correct reclassification and a downward shift as an incorrect reclassification. The opposite is the case for people who remained healthy. The addition of the simple gene count to the Cambridge risk score resulted in a net reclassification improvement of −1.1% (95% confidence interval −6.0% to 3.8%) (table 4), and the addition of information from the genetic risk function produced a net reclassification improvement of 4.6% (−2.0% to 11.3%) (P=0.17) (web table L). Neither the simple gene count score (net reclassification improvement 0.2%, −5.1 to 4.7) (table 5) nor the genetic risk function (net reclassification improvement −3.2%, −9.9 to 3.5) (web table M) resulted in a net reclassification improvement when added to the Framingham offspring risk score.  Net reclassification improvement based on addition of gene count score to Cambridge risk score  Net reclassification improvement based on addition of gene count score to Framingham offspring risk score In a British cohort (the Whitehall II study), a panel of 20 genotypes associated with type 2 diabetes performed less well than the Cambridge and Framingham offspring type 2 diabetes risk scores in discriminating incident cases of type 2 diabetes. Adding the genetic panel to the phenotype based risk models did not improve discrimination and produced only minimal improvement in accuracy of risk estimation assessed by recalibration and, at best, a minor net reclassification improvement. Over the past five years, the pace of identification of genetic loci underlying susceptibility to common diseases has increased rapidly, leading to interest in how this information might best be used to improve personal and public health. One potential application is the use of genetic information to help predict susceptibility to disease in initially healthy people, so as to focus preventive interventions on those at the highest risk of future disease. This targeted approach to prevention is exemplified by the established use of risk equations based on non-genetic variables to estimate risk of coronary heart disease and guide blood pressure lowering and cholesterol lowering treatment. This approach to the prevention of vascular disease, for which diabetes is a major risk factor, will become more systematic in the next two years, through the Department of Health’s vascular health check scheme (www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_083822). Preventive interventions also exist for type 2 diabetes, which motivated the recent evaluation of risk scores (including those studied here) for the prediction of type 2 diabetes. The Cambridge risk score and the Framingham offspring risk score are based on a combination of demographic, family history, anthropometric, and biochemical data, but neither includes genetic information. Although these phenotype based risk models seem to perform well, an important question is whether typing a panel of validated genetic risk factors might improve their ability to predict type 2 diabetes. Some studies in this area have used case-control datasets. Although efficient for gene discovery, these are a suboptimal design for evaluating the predictive performance of a marker, as risk information is available only in relative terms and the range of metrics that can be derived to assess predictive performance is more limited than for prospective studies with incident cases of disease. Those prospective studies that have previously evaluated the performance of genetic markers have been set outside the UK, typed fewer type 2 diabetes risk alleles, or reported only some of a range of metrics available to evaluate the performance of a predictive test (table 6). In a prospective study set in the UK, we therefore tested the performance of a panel of 20 common genes associated with type 2 diabetes, each of which confers a small to moderate increase in the risk of type 2 diabetes, and compared prediction based on genetic information alone, phenotypic information alone, and both, by using a range of metrics to assess predictive performance.  Comparison of published studies that have used genetic information with or without non-genetic risk factors to discriminate between people with and without type 2 diabetes, in case-control, cross sectional, or prospective settings We found that risk functions based on routinely measured clinical variables better discriminated incident type 2 diabetes cases than did a panel of 20 diabetes associated single nucleotide polymorphisms. The inclusion of genetic information in the risk models did not improve the discrimination of cases of type 2 diabetes, and nor did it provide clinically important improvement in the accuracy of these models when assessed by calibration. The addition of genetic data to phenotype based risk models also provided minimal net reclassification improvement. The addition of genetic information resulted in the reassortment of people into different risk categories, but not all the shifts were helpful. Although some eventual cases were upgraded to higher risk categories, almost as many had their risk downgraded, and the opposite was true for many of those who remained healthy. Our findings are consistent with the nine previous published reports of 10 study populations (table 6), even though the number and range of genotypes and the phenotype based risk models used for prediction varied across studies (see Forrest plots at ). All models included age, body mass index, and sex, and much of the predictive information in any phenotype based model is likely to be encompassed in these terms. The relations shown in figure 2 and the web figure illustrate one reason for the poor predictive performance of a panel of single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with common diseases. Although people carrying multiple risk alleles are at more extreme risk of type 2 diabetes than those carrying fewer copies, they represent only a small proportion of the population, because the inheritance of each risk allele is an independent event—the probability of inheriting multiple risk alleles is a function of the frequency of each allele in the population. For example, the probability of inheriting 10 independent risk alleles with frequencies around 0.3 is 0.3 (about 6×10). People with an intermediate number of risk alleles would therefore be expected to account for the major portion of cases of type 2 diabetes, because of the large number of people at intermediate risk in the population. This explains the substantial overlap of the distribution of risk alleles among people who developed diabetes and those who remained disease-free, which makes it difficult to set a cut-off point of a gene count (or genetic risk function) that reliably discriminates later cases of type 2 diabetes. Although genetic tests for type 2 diabetes, based on a subset of the alleles studied here, can already be purchased in the commercial sector, our findings suggest that much more rigorous evaluation of their use as a health technology is needed before such tests should be adopted by healthcare organisations. As a technology, however, genotype based tests have several inherent advantages over non-genetic tests. Genotype based assays are cheap, have high fidelity, and can be multiplexed, in contrast to multiple phenotypic risk factors and biomarkers, many of which require different methods for their measurement, and which are more affected by biological variability and measurement error than is genotyping. Moreover, because genotype is invariant it offers the prospect of risk assessment from much earlier in life than is possible with phenotype based tests. In the case of cardiovascular risk factors, evidence shows that greater benefits accrue from earlier intervention among people at higher risk (for example, in the form of smoking cessation or cholesterol lowering). The findings of our study should thus not lead to the premature dismissal of genotype based risk prediction as a health technology. Rather, increased efforts should be made to understand the strengths and limitations of such tests as well as their optimal place in health care, a conclusion highlighted in the recent House of Lords Science and Technology Committee’s report on genomic medicine (www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldselect/ldsctech/107/107i.pdf). Some limitations of our study should be noted. Although prospective, the Whitehall II study is workplace based and therefore not necessarily representative of the general population. However, the excellent performance in Whitehall II of the non-genetic risk functions for type 2 diabetes, both of which were developed and validated in general populations, suggests that this is unlikely to bias our conclusions substantially. Moreover, our findings are consistent with those of prospective studies set in representative general populations. Our findings are also not generalisable to people of non-European ancestry, who we excluded from this analysis. Although DNA was collected some time after baseline, which could have introduced a survivor bias, we think that this is unlikely to have affected our results given the modest effect of the alleles we studied on risk of diabetes and the long natural history of the development of the life threatening complications of diabetes. The two risk tools studied, based on non-genetic markers, performed better than genotype based tests despite the fact that the models, which were developed in different datasets, were not specifically recalibrated for the Whitehall II population. The common diabetes associated single nucleotide polymorphisms we studied might have greater incremental value in the prediction of type 2 diabetes when evaluated against some of the other validated risk models. However, we chose the Framingham and Cambridge risk scores because they are contemporary (which could be important, given the recent increase in the incidence and prevalence of type 2 diabetes), were developed in populations with a similar profile to the Whitehall II participants, and were based on studies set in the United States and the UK, where many of the genetic studies were done. Moreover, both include variables that are routinely measured in clinical practice. We did not evaluate QDRisk, which is based on routinely collected primary care data (including deprivation scores, ethnicity, and current drug treatment for hypertension or cardiovascular disease and corticosteroid use), which was reported during the preparation of this manuscript. Because part of the information included in the family history component of a risk score will reflect common genotypes, this may have undermined the incremental value of genetic information for risk prediction. However, the variants we studied explain only a small proportion of the familial aggregation of diabetes. Whether genotypes have greater predictive utility in particular categories of patient (such as among leaner people or those of a particular ancestry) could be assessed by pooling participant level data from a large number of prospective studies with the relevant information to ensure adequate power. Our current analysis is limited to the 20 common risk alleles for type 2 diabetes identified by large association or genome-wide studies. However, sequence variants of intermediate frequency but larger effect size are likely to be uncovered by future research, so our interpretation on the predictive utility of genotype should be regarded as interim. Moreover, as the actual causal variants at each gene/region remain for the most part uncertain, the predictive utility of genetic markers may also have been underestimated. Our conclusions about the performance of genetic testing for type 2 diabetes are confined to the use of single common alleles at each locus. Other common risk alleles are likely to exist at the same genetic loci (including the causal variants), which could provide additional information relevant to prediction. Our conclusions are also not transferrable to other common diseases. For example, genetic variants underlying the susceptibility to age related macular degeneration have been identified, at least one of which is both common and large in its effect on risk. We previously examined the predictive utility of a common single nucleotide polymorphism associated with the risk of coronary heart disease at the 9p23.1 chromosomal locus (rs10757274) when added to a risk function that included variables incorporated in the Framingham coronary heart disease risk equation. Although this genotype added minimally to the ability of the Framingham risk score to discriminate future events, improving the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve by only 3%, it did significantly improve reclassification of risk of coronary heart disease, albeit modestly. Moreover, for some disorders, including age related macular degeneration, few if any non-genetic biomarkers or risk factors exist that can be used to estimate risk of future disease. Phenotype based risk models (the Framingham offspring and Cambridge risk scores) provided greater discrimination for type 2 diabetes than did models based on 20 common independently inherited alleles associated with risk of type 2 diabetes. The addition of 20 common genotypes associated with modest risk to phenotype based risk models produced only minimal improvement in the accuracy of risk estimation assessed by recalibration and at best a minor net reclassification improvement. The major translational application of the currently known common, small effect genetic variants influencing susceptibility to type 2 diabetes is likely to come from the insight they provide on causes of disease and potential therapeutic targets. Several routinely used anthropometric and biological measures are included in the validated Cambridge and the Framingham offspring type 2 diabetes risk models Common single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with susceptibility to type 2 diabetes have been identified from whole genome and candidate gene association studies The extent to which a comprehensive panel of genotypes will help in predicting incident diabetes in the UK is not known A panel of 20 type 2 diabetes associated genotypes performed less well than the Cambridge and Framingham offspring type 2 diabetes risk scores in discriminating incident cases of type 2 diabetes Including the genetic panel did not improve discrimination, calibration, or reclassification when added to the Cambridge or Framingham risk models The major translational application of currently known common type 2 diabetes associated genotypes is likely to arise from the insight they provide on causes of disease and therapeutic targets We thank all participating civil service departments and their welfare, personnel, and establishment officers; the Occupational Health and Safety Agency; the Council of Civil Service Unions; all participating civil servants in the Whitehall II study; and all members of the Whitehall II study team.

Diabetes is the name given to a group of conditions in which there is too much glucose in the blood. Glucose is the body’s main source of fuel or energy. This is where insulin enters the story. Insulin is a hormone made by the pancreas. It opens the channels that let glucose move from the blood to the body’s cells, where energy can be used. Without insulin doing its job, the glucose channels are shut and glucose builds up in the blood. This can lead to high blood glucose levels, which can cause the many health problems linked to diabetes.  In type1 diabetes, the body’s own immune system destroys the cells that make insulin. The exact cause of this is unknown, and there is currently no cure. People with type 1 diabetes have to inject insulin several times every day for the rest of their lives.  The onset of type 2 diabetes is usually more gradual than type 1 diabetes, as the body becomes resistant to insulin and/or doesn’t produce enough insulin in the pancreas. There are known risk factors and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are over three times more likely to develop type 2 diabetes compared with non-Aboriginal people. People with type 2 diabetes have to carefully manage their health every day for the rest of their lives.  This is a type of diabetes that can occur during pregnancy. It needs to be managed carefully to protect the health of the mother and unborn baby. Gestational diabetes is usually resolved upon delivery. However, women who have had gestational diabetes have an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes later in life. If blood glucose levels remain too high (known as hyperglycaemia) over a long period of time, this puts the person at risk of developing complications such as vision loss, stroke, kidney failure and heart attack. These complications do not develop overnight. However, they are serious and may be prevented with careful management of diabetes. If blood glucose levels are too low (known as hypoglycaemia or a hypo), this can make it hard to concentrate, put the person at risk of collapse or injury and make it dangerous to drive or operate machinery. Around 1.7 million Australians live with diabetes. This includes over 1.2 million people registered with the National Diabetes Services Scheme, as well as an estimated 500,000 with undiagnosed type 2 diabetes. These people may not have any warning signs indicating something is amiss in their bodies. Diabetes Victoria estimates that there are currently in excess of 430,000 people living with diabetes in our state – more than 320,000 registered with the NDSS and 125,000 with undiagnosed type 2 diabetes. Every day, approximately 80 Victorians develop diabetes. It is estimated that 3 million Australians are at high-risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Pre-diabetes is when blood glucose levels are higher than normal, but not high enough for type 2 diabetes to be diagnosed. Pre-diabetes is an invisible condition, so many people may not know they are at risk. Diabetes is a serious and complex health condition. The symptoms may not be obvious, so it’s important to check your risk. The good news is that if you find that you are at high risk, there is something you can do about it. Around 60% of type 2 diabetes cases can be prevented or delayed by making small lifestyle changes, including maintaining a healthy weight, eating well and being active.

This is especially the case for type 2 diabetes, the most common form of diabetes. Here are nine myths about type 2 diabetes — and the facts that debunk them. Diabetes is a serious, chronic disease. In fact, people with diabetes will die from cardiovascular-related episodes, such as a heart attack or stroke. However, diabetes can be controlled with proper medications and lifestyle changes. 2. If you’re overweight, you’ll automatically get type 2 diabetes. Being overweight or obese is a serious risk factor, but there are other factors that put you at an increased risk. Having a family history of diabetes, having high blood pressure, or being sedentary are just some of these other factors. 3. Exercising when you have diabetes only increases your chances of experiencing low blood sugar. Don’t think that just because you have diabetes you can skip out on your workout! Exercise is crucial to controlling diabetes. If you’re on insulin, or a medication that increases insulin production in the body, you have to balance exercise with your medication and diet. Talk to your doctor about creating an exercise program that’s right for you and your body. Insulin is a lifesaver, but it’s also difficult to manage for some people. New and improved insulin allows for much tighter blood sugar control with lower risk of low or high blood sugar. Testing your blood sugar levels, however, is the only way to know how your treatment plan is working for you. 5. Having diabetes means your body isn’t producing enough insulin. People with type 2 diabetes typically have enough insulin when they’re first diagnosed. The insulin just isn’t working properly. This means the insulin doesn’t cause their cells to absorb glucose from food. Eventually the pancreas may stop producing enough insulin, so they will need injections. Those with prediabetes often produce enough insulin, but the cells of the body are resistant to it. This means the sugar can’t move from the blood into the cells. Over time, the pancreas is unable to produce enough insulin to keep blood sugar levels in the normal range. This can cause you to progress from prediabetes to type 2 diabetes. While injectable medications require shots, there are many other treatments available. These include insulin pens, blood sugar meters, and oral medications that don’t require injections. 7. I always know when my sugar is high or low, so I don’t need to test it. You can’t rely on how you’re feeling when it comes to your blood sugar level. You may feel shaky, lightheaded, and dizzy because your blood sugar is low, or you may be coming down with a cold or the flu. You may urinate a lot because your glucose is high or because you have a bladder infection. The longer you have diabetes, the less accurate those feelings become. The only way to know for sure is to check your blood sugar. There’s no reason people with type 2 diabetes can’t eat sweets, as long as they fit into a normal meal plan. However, try to eat small portions and include them with other foods. This can help slow down digestion. Highly sugared drinks and desserts are digested more quickly and can cause a quick spike in blood sugar level. When eaten in large quantities or by themselves, sweets can wreck havoc on your blood sugar. 9. Being on insulin means you don’t have to make any lifestyle changes. When you’re first diagnosed, your blood sugar may be controlled adequately by diet, exercise, and oral medications. Eventually, however, your medications may not be as effective as they were, and you’ll likely need insulin injections to help control your blood sugar levels. Managing your diet and exercise with insulin is very important to help keep blood sugar levels in their target range and to help avoid complications.

16b0575e-8b67-4866-a2a4-7d9d8ca20ad8,"Discovery could lead to early identification of children at high risk of future type 2 diabetes Discovery could lead to early identification of children at high risk of future type 2 diabetes Wednesday, 29 January 2020 Researchers at the University of Plymouth and Nestlé have revealed new insights into the factors that predispose children to developing in adult life. The findings have emerged from , that followed 300 healthy children in Plymouth, UK, for 15 years to determine who would become at risk of developing type 2 diabetes, and why. The EarlyBird researchers monitored the children from five years of age to early adulthood to explore how the metabolism changes during growth. The findings, appearing in a series of peer-reviewed scientific publications, have shed new light on the biological and physiological factors that are relevant for metabolic health in childhood. The latest results, published in (), show that the earliest event leading to pre-diabetes (the earliest signs of diabetes) is dysfunction of the pancreatic beta-cell, independent of body weight. Beta-cells in the pancreas produce insulin, the hormone that regulates blood glucose levels. The study also showed that this beta-cell dysfunction was associated with the presence of genetic factors previously associated with type 2 diabetes in adults. This discovery could lead to the early identification of children that are at high risk of future type 2 diabetes. Jon Pinkney, Professor of Endocrinology and Diabetes in the University of Plymouth’s Peninsula Medical School and Honorary Consultant Physician in Endocrinology and Diabetes at University Hospitals Plymouth NHS Trust said: “The rapidly rising prevalence of is one of the biggest global health challenges, and there is an urgent need to develop effective strategies for early intervention and prevention. “The research partnership between University of Plymouth and Nestlé has shown how the risks of future type 2 diabetes can be predicted in childhood. This opens up the possibility of individualised advice and early intervention to reduce the risks of future type 2 diabetes”. “In this study we show that beta-cell dysfunction is an early event in the onset of pre-diabetes in children and that this effect is body weight independent”, said François-Pierre Martin, an expert in metabolism who led the collaboration at Nestlé Research. “However, we also report in this study that subsequent weight gain during puberty aggravates the progression from pre-diabetes to diabetes. This stresses the importance of lifestyle and nutritional interventions in childhood to reduce the risks to develop diabetes.” Jörg Hager, a genetics expert at Nestlé Research who designed the genetic part of the study said: “Our research has important implications for potentially identifying children at risk of developing pre-diabetes through genetic markers. The new findings will allow us to develop new nutritional approaches that target the insulin response to a meal, and the body’s ability to regulate blood sugar level.” Begun in the early 2000s, when the obesity epidemic was still in its infancy and the idea that children could develop type 2 diabetes almost unheard of, EarlyBird was able to develop strong relationships between families and researchers and retain a high proportion of children over the course of the study. The detailed metabolomic and genetic data collected over such a long period of childhood are unique. As a consequence, researchers have been able to make a number of vital discoveries about the relationships between lifestyle, genetics and health.

8bc57425-9b45-41f8-b54d-027fb5673877,"Predicting risk of type 2 diabetes in England and Wales: prospective derivation and validation of QDScore Predicting risk of type 2 diabetes in England and Wales: prospective derivation and validation of QDScore ; , professor of clinical epidemiology and general practice, , , , professor of primary care research and development, Division of Primary Care, Tower Building, University Park, Nottingham NG2 7RD Centre for Health Sciences, Queen Mary’s School of Medicine and Dentistry, London E1 2AT Centre for Population Health Sciences: GP Section, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh EH8 9DX Avon Primary Care Research Collaborative, Bristol Primary Care Trust, Bristol BS2 8EE Correspondence to: J Hippisley-Cox  To develop and validate a new diabetes risk algorithm (the QDScore) for estimating 10 year risk of acquiring diagnosed type 2 diabetes over a 10 year time period in an ethnically and socioeconomically diverse population. Prospective open cohort study using routinely collected data from 355 general practices in England and Wales to develop the score and from 176 separate practices to validate the score. 2 540 753 patients aged 25-79 in the derivation cohort, who contributed 16 436 135 person years of observation and of whom 78 081 had an incident diagnosis of type 2 diabetes; 1 232 832 patients (7 643 037 person years) in the validation cohort, with 37 535 incident cases of type 2 diabetes. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate effects of risk factors in the derivation cohort and to derive a risk equation in men and women. The predictive variables examined and included in the final model were self assigned ethnicity, age, sex, body mass index, smoking status, family history of diabetes, Townsend deprivation score, treated hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and current use of corticosteroids; the outcome of interest was incident diabetes recorded in general practice records. Measures of calibration and discrimination were calculated in the validation cohort. A fourfold to fivefold variation in risk of type 2 diabetes existed between different ethnic groups. Compared with the white reference group, the adjusted hazard ratio was 4.07 (95% confidence interval 3.24 to 5.11) for Bangladeshi women, 4.53 (3.67 to 5.59) for Bangladeshi men, 2.15 (1.84 to 2.52) for Pakistani women, and 2.54 (2.20 to 2.93) for Pakistani men. Pakistani and Bangladeshi men had significantly higher hazard ratios than Indian men. Black African men and Chinese women had an increased risk compared with the corresponding white reference group. In the validation dataset, the model explained 51.53% (95% confidence interval 50.90 to 52.16) of the variation in women and 48.16% (47.52 to 48.80) of that in men. The risk score showed good discrimination, with a D statistic of 2.11 (95% confidence interval 2.08 to 2.14) in women and 1.97 (1.95 to 2.00) in men. The model was well calibrated. The QDScore is the first risk prediction algorithm to estimate the 10 year risk of diabetes on the basis of a prospective cohort study and including both social deprivation and ethnicity. The algorithm does not need laboratory tests and can be used in clinical settings and also by the public through a simple web calculator (). The prevalence of type 2 diabetes and the burden of disease caused by it have increased very rapidly worldwide. This has been fuelled by ageing populations, poor diet, and the concurrent epidemic of obesity. The health and economic consequences of this diabetes epidemic are huge and rising. Strong evidence from randomised controlled trials shows that behavioural or pharmacological interventions can prevent type 2 diabetes in up to two thirds of high risk cases. Cost effectiveness modelling suggests that screening programmes aid earlier diagnosis and help to prevent type 2 diabetes or improve outcomes in people who develop the condition, making the prevention and early detection of diabetes an international public health priority. Early detection is important, as up to half of people with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes have one or more complications at the time of diagnosis. Although several algorithms for predicting the risk of type 2 diabetes have been developed, no widely accepted diabetes risk prediction score has been developed and validated for use in routine clinical practice. Previous studies have been limited by size, and some have performed inadequately when tested in ethnically diverse populations. A new diabetes risk prediction tool with appropriate weightings for both social deprivation and ethnicity is needed given the prevalence of type 2 diabetes, particularly among minority ethnic communities, appreciable numbers of whom remain without a diagnosis for long periods of time. Such patients have an increased risk of avoidable morbidity and mortality. We present the derivation and validation of a new risk prediction algorithm for assessing the risk of developing type 2 diabetes among a very large and unselected population derived from family practice, with appropriate weightings for ethnicity and social deprivation. We designed the algorithm (the QDScore) so that it would be based on variables that are readily available in patients’ electronic health records or which patients themselves would be likely to know—that is, without needing laboratory tests or clinical measurements—thereby enabling it to be readily and cost effectively implemented in routine clinical practice and by national screening initiatives. We did a prospective cohort study in a large population of primary care patients from version 19 of the QResearch database (). This is a large, validated primary care electronic database containing the health records of 11 million patients registered with 551 general practices using the Egton Medical Information System (EMIS) computer system. Practices and patients contained on the database are nationally representative for England and Wales and similar to those on other large national primary care databases using other clinical software systems. We included all QResearch practices in England and Wales once they had been using their current EMIS system for at least a year, so as to ensure completeness of recording of morbidity and prescribing data. We randomly allocated two thirds of practices to the derivation dataset and the remaining third to the validation dataset; we used the simple random sampling utility in Stata to assign practices to the derivation or validation cohort. We identified an open cohort of patients aged 25-79 years at the study entry date, drawn from patients registered with eligible practices during the 15 years between 1 January 1993 and 31 March 2008. We used an open cohort design, rather than a closed cohort design, as this allows patients to enter the population throughout the whole study period rather than requiring registration on a fixed date; our cohort should thus reflect the realities of routine clinical practice. We excluded patients with a prior recorded diagnosis of diabetes (type 1 or 2), temporary residents, patients with interrupted periods of registration with the practice, and those who did not have a valid postcode related Townsend deprivation score (about 4% of the population). For each patient, we determined an entry date to the cohort, which was the latest of their 25th birthday, their date of registration with the practice, the date on which the practice computer system was installed plus one year, and the beginning of the study period (1 January 1993). We included patients in the analysis once they had a minimum of one year’s complete data in their medical record. For each patient, we determined the right censor date, which was the earliest of the date of diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, date of death, date of deregistration with the practice, date of last upload of computerised data, or the study end date (31 March 2008). Our primary outcome measure was the first (incident) diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus as recorded on the general practice computer records. We identified patients with diabetes by searching the electronic health record for a diagnosis Read code for diabetes (C10%). As in other studies, we classified patients as having type 1 diabetes if they had a diagnosis of diabetes and had been prescribed insulin under the age of 35 and classified the remaining patients as having type 2 diabetes. We examined the following variables for inclusion in our analysis, all of which are known or thought to affect risk of developing diabetes, and are also likely to be recorded in the patients’ electronic records as part of routine clinical practice: self assigned ethnicity (nine categories); age at study entry (in single years); body mass index (continuous); smoking status (current smoker, not a current smoker); Townsend deprivation score (2001 census data evaluated at output areas as a continuous variable) ranging from −6 in the most affluent to 11 in the most deprived; recorded family history of diabetes in a first degree relative (binary variable yes/no); diagnosis of cardiovascular disease at baseline (binary variable yes/no); treated hypertension at baseline—that is, diagnosis of hypertension plus more than two prescriptions for antihypertensive drugs (binary variable yes/no); systemic corticosteroids at baseline—that is, at least two prescriptions within the preceding six months (binary variable yes/no). We restricted all values of these variables to those that had been recorded in the person’s electronic healthcare record before the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes (or before censoring for those who did not develop type 2 diabetes). We used Read codes for ethnicity to denote self assigned ethnicity. The Read classification is the coding system in use in general practice in England and Wales (ICD-10 is the equivalent coding system in use in hospitals). We grouped the codes into the English National Health Service standard 16+1 categories for the initial descriptive analysis. We then combined these 16+1 categories into the final nine reporting groups, thereby ensuring sufficient numbers of events in each group to enable a meaningful analysis. The “white or not recorded” category comprised British, Irish, and other white background, as well as those whose ethnicity was not recorded. We designated this as the reference category. We combined the group for whom ethnicity was not recorded with the white ethnic group; assuming the study population is comparable to the United Kingdom population, 93% or more of people without ethnicity recorded would be expected to be from a white ethnic group. The “other including mixed category” comprised “white and black Caribbean,” “white and black African,” “white and Asian,” “other mixed,” “other black, and other ethnic group.” The “other Asian” category included Read codes for East African Asian, Indo-Caribbean, Punjabi, Kashmiri, Sri Lankan, Tamil, Sinhalese, Caribbean Asian, British Asian, mixed Asian, or Asian unspecified. For body mass index and smoking status, we used the values recorded closest to the study entry date. We used body mass index rather than waist circumference, as the latter is not well recorded on clinical computer systems in the UK. We calculated crude incidence rates of type 2 diabetes according to age, ethnic group, and deprivation in fifths. We then directly age standardised the incidence rates by ethnic group and deprivation by using the age distribution in five year bands of the entire derivation cohort as the standard population. We also used the same method to age standardise the means of continuous variables and proportions with risk factors by ethnic group. We used a Cox proportional hazards model in the derivation dataset to estimate the coefficients and hazard ratios associated with each potential risk factor for the first ever recorded diagnosis of diabetes for men and women separately. As in a previous study, we used the Bayes information criterion to compare models. This is a likelihood measure in which lower values indicate better fit and in which a penalty is paid for increasing the number of variables in the model. We used fractional polynomials to model non-linear risk relations with continuous variables where appropriate. We tested for interactions between each variable and age and between smoking and deprivation and included significant interactions in the final model. Continuous variables were centred for analysis. We used multiple imputation to replace missing values for smoking status and body mass index, and we used these values in our main analyses. We fitted our final model on the basis of multiply imputed datasets by using Rubin’s rules to combine estimates of effects and standard errors of estimates to allow for the uncertainty caused by missing data. Multiple imputation is a statistical technique designed to reduce the biases that can occur in “complete case” analysis along with a substantial loss of power and precision. The imputation technique involves creating multiple copies of the data and replaces missing values with imputed values on the basis of a suitable random sample from their predicted distribution. Multiple imputation therefore allows patients with incomplete data to still be included in analyses, thereby making full use of all the available data, and thus increasing power and precision, but without compromising validity. We used the ICE procedure in Stata to obtain five imputed datasets (further details are available from the corresponding author). We took the regression coefficient (that is, the log of the hazard ratio) for each variable from the final model and used these as weights for the new disease risk equations for type 2 diabetes. We combined these weights with the baseline survivor function for diagnosis of diabetes evaluated at 10 years and centred on the means of continuous risk factors to derive a risk equation for 10 years’ follow-up. We have presented the Townsend coefficients in standard deviation units so that this can be applied in a non-UK setting where other indices of deprivation might apply. We compared our final model (model A) with three other models in order to determine the additional contribution to the fit (using the Bayes information criterion in which lower values indicate better fit) and performance of the model of including both ethnicity and deprivation in the algorithm. Our first supplementary model (model B) included all the variables except for deprivation and ethnicity, the second model (model C) included deprivation but not ethnicity, and the third (model D) included ethnicity but not deprivation. We tested the performance of the final algorithm (the QDScore) in the validation dataset. We calculated the 10 year estimated risk of acquiring type 2 diabetes for each patient in the validation dataset by using multiple imputations to replace missing values for smoking status and body mass index, as in the derivation dataset. We calculated the mean predicted risk and the observed risk of diabetes at 10 years and compared these by 10th of predicted risk. The observed risk at 10 years was obtained by using the 10 year Kaplan-Meier estimate. We calculated the Brier score (a measure of goodness of fit where lower values indicate better accuracy) by using the censoring adjusted version adapted for survival data, D statistic (a measure of discrimination where higher values indicate better discrimination), and an R statistic (a measure of explained variation for survival data, where higher values indicate that more variation is explained). We also calculated the area under the receiver operator curve, where higher values indicate better discrimination. We also compared the performance of the QDScore with the Cambridge risk score, which includes age, sex, body mass index, smoking status, corticosteroids, antihypertensive treatment, and family history of diabetes. We calculated the proportion of patients in the validation sample who had an estimated 10 year risk of diagnosed diabetes of ≥10%, ≥15%, ≥20%, ≥30%, ≥40%, and ≥50% by age, sex, ethnic group, and deprivation according to the QDScore. We used all the available data on the QResearch database and therefore did not do a pre-study sample size calculation. We used Stata (version 10) for all analyses and chose a significance level of 0.01 (two tailed). Description of the derivation and validation dataset Overall, 531 UK practices met our inclusion criteria, of which 355 were randomly assigned to the derivation dataset and 176 to the validation dataset. We excluded 20 practices: four practices had not completely uploaded all their electronic data for the relevant study period, seven practices were from Scotland, and nine practices were from Northern Ireland. The derivation cohort contained 2 594 578 patients, of whom 53 825 had type 1 or type 2 diabetes before the start of the study and were therefore excluded leaving 2 540 753 patients (1 283 135; 50.50% women) aged 25-79 years and free of diabetes at baseline for analysis. The validation cohort contained 1 261 419 patients aged 25-79, of whom 28 587 had a previous diagnosis of type 1 or type 2 diabetes leaving 1 232 832 patients for analysis (50.49% women). Overall, we studied 3 773 585 patients contributing 24 079 172 person years, of whom 115 616 patients (78 081 in the derivation cohort and 37 535 in the validation cohort) had a new diagnosis of type 2 diabetes during follow-up. Table 1 compares the characteristics of eligible patients in the derivation and validation cohorts. Although this validation cohort was drawn from an independent group of practices, the baseline characteristics were very similar to those for the derivation cohort. Overall, 898 461 patients (23.81% of 3 773 585) had ethnicity recorded, and 122 736 (13.66%) of these were from a non-white ethnic group. Practices in areas where the proportion of patients from a non-white ethnic group is higher according to the 2001 census (such as London (28.9%), East Midlands (6.5%), and West Midlands (11.3%)) also have higher rates of completeness of recording of ethnicity on the QResearch database (40.1%, 21.4%, and 30.1% for the above areas).  Characteristics of patients aged 25-79 free of diabetes at baseline in derivation and validation cohorts between 1993 and 2008. Values are numbers (percentages) unless stated otherwise Table 1 shows that 78.97% of women in the derivation cohort had body mass index recorded and 90.00% had smoking status recorded; 78.03% had both body mass index and smoking status recorded. For men, the corresponding figures were 71.19%, 83.24%, and 70.12%. Overall, 22.97% of women and 29.88% of men had either smoking or body mass index imputed by multiple imputation (data were not imputed for ethnicity—all patients with missing ethnicity were treated as white/not recorded). Similar figures were observed for men and women in the validation cohort, where multiple imputation was also used. Table 2 shows the characteristics of men and women with complete data for smoking and body mass index compared with those who had missing data. Women with missing data had different patterns of risk factors—for example, women with complete data for body mass index were more likely to have a family history of diabetes, to be recorded as current smokers, and to have treated hypertension. They also had a lower 10 year observed risk of diabetes compared with women with missing body mass index data. Women with complete data for smoking were more likely to have a diagnosis of cardiovascular disease, a diagnosis of treated hypertension, and a family history of diabetes. The 10 year observed risk of diabetes was lower than for women whose smoking status was missing. The pattern was similar for men for most risk factors, except that the observed risks of diabetes were lower among men with missing data.  Characteristics of men and women in derivation cohort with and without complete data for body mass index and smoking. Values are numbers (percentages) unless stated otherwise Table 3 shows the crude and age standardised rates of type 2 diabetes by sex, deprivation, and ethnicity in the derivation cohort. The age standardised rates for the white reference group were 4.13 (95% confidence interval 4.08 to 4.17) per 1000 person years for women and 5.31 (5.26 to 5.36) per 1000 person years for men. The crude and age standardised incidence rates of type 2 diabetes in the derivation cohort varied widely between ethnic groups, as shown in table 3. Age standardised rates were significantly higher for men in every ethnic group compared with the white reference group, except for Chinese men. In women, age standardised incidence rates were higher for every group compared with the white reference group. The highest age standardised rates were in South Asians, and significant differences existed between the South Asian groups. For example, the rate for Bangladeshi women was 18.20 (12.93 to 23.47) per 1000 person years and that for Bangladeshi men was 19.34 (14.28 to 24.4) per 1000 person years. For Pakistanis, the corresponding rates per 1000 person years were 11.19 (9.16 to 13.21) for women and 13.22 (11.24 to 15.21) for men.  Crude and age standardised incidence of type 2 diabetes per 1000 person years by sex, deprivation fifth, and ethnicity in derivation dataset We also found a marked difference in the age standardised incidence rates of type 2 diabetes by deprivation, with a more than twofold difference for women when comparing the most deprived fifth (6.39 (6.25 to 6.54) per 1000 person years) with the most affluent fifth (3.00 (2.93 to 3.08) per 1000 person years). A similar, but less steep gradient was seen for men. The rates seen in the validation cohort were similar to those for the derivation cohort (data not shown). Table 4 shows the age standardised distribution of risk factors across each of the main ethnic groups. Substantial heterogeneity exists across the ethnic groups for risk factors, and the distribution also differs between men and women within ethnic groups. The notable results include substantial differences in the age standardised prevalence of smoking among men of Bangladeshi (46.04%, 95% confidence interval 43.16% to 48.92%), Caribbean (40.45%, 38.99% to 41.91%), Pakistani (32.82%, 31.29% to 34.35%), white/not recorded (33.49%, 33.40% to 33.58%), Chinese (26.63%, 24.23% to 29.03%), Indian (22.71%, 21.60% to 23.81%), and black African (17.95%, 16.76% to 19.14%) origin. Smoking rates were lower for women in each ethnic group compared with men but varied widely between women from different groups.  Distribution of risk factors for type 2 diabetes by ethnic group in men and women in derivation cohort. Values are age standardised means and proportions with 95% confidence intervals Treated hypertension was highest among black Caribbean and black African men and women and more than twice as high as that for the white reference group. Recorded family history of diabetes was highest among black Caribbean women (32.63%, 31.41% to 33.85%) and Indian men (29.95%, 28.78% to 31.11%), which was more than three times that for the white reference group who had the lowest rates (11.32%, 11.27% to 11.38% for women and 8.07%, 8.02% to 8.12% for men). Bangladeshi men and women had the highest age standardised mean deprivation scores, followed by those of black African and black Caribbean origin. Indians and the white reference group had the lowest mean deprivation scores, as shown in table 4. The highest mean body mass index was seen among black African women (age standardised mean 28.44, 28.29 to 28.58) compared with 25.47 (25.46 to 25.48) for women in the white reference group. The lowest value was in Chinese women (age standardised mean 22.87, 22.68 to 23.06). Similar patterns, although slightly less marked, were seen for men across the ethnic groups. Finally, 9.70% (7.76% to 11.65%) of Bangladeshi men had a recorded diagnosis of cardiovascular disease at baseline, which was more than twice that for men in the white reference group (4.54%, 4.50% to 4.57%) and more than four times that found in Chinese men (2.26%, 1.15% to 3.37%). Table 5 shows the results of the Cox regression analysis for the QDScore. After adjustment for all other variables in the model, we found significant associations with risk of type 2 diabetes in both men and women for age, body mass index, family history of diabetes, smoking status, treated hypertension, use of corticosteroids, diagnosed cardiovascular disease, social deprivation, and ethnicity. We therefore included these variables in the final model and risk prediction algorithm.  Adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence interval) for QDScore in derivation cohort (see fig 1 for graphical representation of interaction terms) We found significant heterogeneity of risk of type 2 diabetes by ethnic group compared with the white reference population, having adjusted for age, body mass index, deprivation, family history of diabetes, smoking status, treated hypertension, diagnosed cardiovascular disease, use of corticosteroids, and diagnosed cardiovascular disease, as shown in table 4. For example, among Bangladeshis, the adjusted hazard ratio for women was 4.07 (95% confidence interval 3.24 to 5.11) and that for men was 4.53 (3.67 to 5.59). These were significantly higher than the increased hazard ratios in Pakistani women and men (2.15, 1.84 to 2.52; and 2.54, 2.20 to 2.93). Both Pakistani and Bangladeshi men had significantly higher hazard ratios than Indian men. Black African men and Chinese women had increased risks compared with the corresponding white reference group. The only groups to have significantly lower risks than the white reference group were black African women (0.81, 0.66 to 0.98) and black Caribbean women (0.80, 0.70 to 0.92). The fractional polynomial terms selected for inclusion in the model were as follows. For age in women the two terms were (age/10) and (age/10). For body mass index in women, the two terms were (bmi/10) and (bmi/10). For men, the two age terms were log(age/10) and (age/10) and the two terms for body mass index were (bmi/10) and (bmi/10). Figure 1 shows the estimated adjusted hazard ratios by age and body mass index for these fractional polynomial terms in men and women.  Graphical representation of age interactions for men and women for risk of type 2 diabetes We identified significant interactions between age and body mass index, age and family history of diabetes, and age and smoking status. We therefore included these interactions in the final model, and the general direction of the effects was that body mass index and family history of diabetes tended to have a greater impact on risk of diabetes at younger ages, as shown in fig 1. Smoking had a more complex relation with age; the risk peaked in middle age for both men and women. In a comparison of models, the median Bayes information criterion for women for our final model (model A) was 875 203, for the model without deprivation and ethnicity (model B) it was 876 400, for the model without ethnicity (model C) it was 875 270, and for the model without deprivation (model D) it was 876 198, indicating that the model that incorporated both ethnicity and deprivation was superior to the other three. For men, the corresponding figures were 1 086 755, 1 087 745, 1 087 034, and 1 087 369, similarly supporting the inclusion of both ethnicity and deprivation into the final model. Table 6 shows the results for the validation statistics for men and women after application of the QDScore and the Cambridge risk score in the validation dataset. The QDScore shows higher levels of discrimination than the Cambridge risk score. For example, in women the D statistic for the QDScore was 2.11 (95% confidence interval 2.08 to 2.14) compared with 1.88 (1.85 to 1.91) with the Cambridge risk score; a 0.1 difference in the D statistic indicates an important difference in prognostic separation between two risk algorithms. The QDScore explained a higher proportion of the variation—it explained 51.53% of the variation in women and 48.16% of that in men. The corresponding values for the Cambridge risk score were 45.77% and 41.82%. The Brier score, however, was slightly lower for the Cambridge risk score in both men and women.  Validation statistics for QDScore and Cambridge risk score in validation cohort. Values are mean (95% confidence interval) Figure 2 compares the mean predicted scores from the QDScore with the observed risks at 10 years within each 10th of predicted risk in order to assess the calibration of the model in the validation sample. The close correspondence between predicted and observed 10 year risks within each model 10th suggests that the model was well calibrated. For example, in the top 10th of risk, the mean predicted risk was 18.31% (95% confidence interval 18.24% to 18.38%) in women and the observed risk was 18.82% (18.39% to 19.26%). The ratio of predicted to observed risk in this tenth was 0.97, indicating almost perfect calibration (a ratio of 1 indicates perfect calibration—that is, no under-prediction or over-prediction). We found similar results for men, with a ratio of 0.99 in the top 10th of predicted risk.   QDScore predicted and observed risk of diabetes by 10th of predicted risk Predictions with age, sex, deprivation, and ethnicity Table 7 shows the percentages of men and women in the validation dataset with a 10 year predicted risk of being diagnosed as having type 2 diabetes according to a range of thresholds and by age band. For example, at the 10% threshold, 10.60% of women and 15.06% of men had a 10% or higher predicted risk of being diagnosed as having type 2 diabetes over 10 years. This varied markedly by age such that 21.43% of women aged 55-59 and 30.99% of women aged 65-69 had a 10% or greater risk of being diagnosed as having type 2 diabetes over 10 years. The corresponding figures for men were 33.28% and 44.08%.  Percentage of patients in validation dataset with 10 year predicted risk of type 2 diabetes from QDScore of ≥10%, ≥15%, ≥20%, ≥30%, ≥40%, and ≥50% by age and sex Tables 8 and 9 show the 10 year risk of type 2 diabetes among men and women of different ethnic groups and for those living in the most deprived and affluent areas. For example, 33.83% of Bangladeshi women had a 10 year risk of being diagnosed as having diabetes of 10% or more compared with 10.48% of women in the white reference group, and 15.03% of women in the most deprived fifth had a 10% or higher risk of developing diabetes over the next 10 years compared with 6.52% of women in the most affluent fifth. The difference between affluent and deprived fifths is more marked for women than for men; the corresponding figures are 15.65% for men in the most deprived fifth and 13.21% for men in the most affluent fifth.  Percentage of patients in validation dataset with 10 year predicted risk of type 2 diabetes from QDScore of ≥10%, ≥15%, ≥20%, ≥30%, ≥40%, and ≥50% by ethnicity and sex  Percentage of patients in validation dataset with 10 year predicted risk of diabetes from QDScore of ≥10%, ≥15%, ≥20%, ≥30%, ≥40%, and ≥50% by deprivation fifth and sex Overall, almost half (15 545/32 450; 47.9%) of cases of diabetes occurred in the top 10th of the distribution (risk of ≥10.38%) and almost 70% (22 476/32 450) occurred in the top fifth (risk of ≥5.98%). The QDScore is the first diabetes prediction algorithm developed and validated by using routinely collected data to predict the 10 year risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Our final model includes both deprivation and ethnicity as well as age, sex, smoking, treated hypertension, body mass index, family history of diabetes, current treatment with corticosteroids, and previous diagnosis of cardiovascular disease. The QDScore does not require any laboratory testing or clinical measurements and so can be used in many settings, including by individual members of the public who have access to a computer. This risk prediction tool might be used to identify and proactively intervene in people identified as having an increased risk. This algorithm, like other algorithms that predict cardiovascular disease, relies on routinely collected data and has the advantage that it is readily implementable. Furthermore, it is likely to reduce, rather than exacerbate, widespread and persistent health inequalities. The QDScore performed well compared with the Cambridge risk score. Assuming that the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of suitable interventions shown in randomised controlled trials extend to unselected patients from primary care, the QDScore could be used to identify patients at increased risk of diabetes who might benefit from interventions to reduce their risk. The traditional method for identifying patients at increased risk of type 2 diabetes has involved the detection of impaired glucose tolerance requiring an inconvenient and expensive oral glucose tolerance test. Targeted screening of higher risk groups has been proposed as a more cost effective solution, as the risk factors for diabetes and cardiovascular outcomes overlap considerably. Less expensive and more practical methods of identifying patients at increased risk are needed; these should ideally be based on models developed from contemporaneous data in ethnically and socioeconomically diverse populations obtained from the clinical setting in which these models will subsequently be applied. Simple clinical models using readily available data can offer similar discrimination to more complex models using laboratory data or biomarkers, and clinical models that do not need clinical measurements may have a further utility in settings where clinical measurements are not available or are too costly to collect. UK datasets derived from family practices have the advantage of having large and broadly representative populations with historical data tracking back well over a decade in most practices. These databases also contain data on many of the key variables known to be associated with risk of type 2 diabetes, such as age, sex, ethnicity, smoking, body mass index, family history of diabetes, treated hypertension, current use of corticosteroids, and social deprivation. Deprivation is not only strongly associated with increased prevalence of diabetes and diabetes related risk factors such as diet, obesity, and smoking but is also associated with poorer outcomes and intermediate measures such as achievement of lipid targets. Particular strengths of our study are the use of a large representative population from a validated database, our prospective cohort design, and the substantial numbers of patients with self assigned ethnicity for use in the analysis. We have modelled interactions with age and included these in the final model, so our algorithm takes account of the differential effect of three key variables (family history of diabetes, body mass index, and smoking) at different ages. Another important strength of the QDScore is that all the variables used in the algorithm will either be known to an individual patient or are collected as part of routine clinical practice and recorded within an individual patient’s primary healthcare record in most economically developed countries. This means that the algorithm can be used by patients for self assessment in a web based calculator () similar to the one available for self assessment of cardiovascular disease (). Alternatively, it can be implemented within clinical computer systems used in primary care and be used to stratify the practice population (aged 25-79) for risk on a continuing basis without the need for manual entry of data. Although no widely agreed thresholds for classification of patients at “high risk” exist, the QDScore could act as a basis for a systematic programme to identify patients at increased risk for intervention or to aid earlier diagnosis. Importantly, appropriate weighting for ethnicity and social deprivation should furthermore help to avoid widening health inequalities associated with introduction of systematic programmes of disease prevention activities. Despite its strengths, our study has limitations compared with an ideal study. In the ideal study, a large representative and tightly phenotyped primary care cohort would be assembled and followed longitudinally over the course of a decade. No patients would be lost to follow-up, and all patients would be subjected to repeated oral glucose tolerance tests throughout follow-up to confirm or refute the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. Although such a study would be very welcome, it would take at least 15 years to carry out and report, it would be unlikely to be feasible in routine primary care, and calibration would be inaccurate in more socially and ethnically diverse populations with different baseline risks. Our study offers a practical alternative approach, which can be implemented into primary care in a cost effective manner, while acknowledging the potential biases and their likely impact. Potential sources of misclassification, bias, and confounding One limitation of our study is that the main outcome was type 2 diabetes diagnosed by a clinician and recorded on the clinical computer system. The outcome was not formally validated, and we have not used the results of laboratory tests to confirm the diagnosis. However, this diagnosis would be unlikely to be recorded if the patient did not have diabetes—other studies of similar databases have shown good levels of accuracy for common chronic conditions, especially those that are now included in the UK quality and outcomes framework. Undiagnosed diabetes is a well recognised problem and is not specifically considered by our study. It is estimated to affect approximately 3% of the population according to the health survey for England. Some evidence suggests that South Asian women are more likely to have undiagnosed diabetes than are the general population, so our hazard ratios might underestimate the association for these patients. The risk factors for diagnosed diabetes are very similar to those for undiagnosed diabetes. Nevertheless, most previously undiagnosed cases are likely to have been included in the identified high risk groups and to have been picked up by systematic further evaluation, because risk stratification improves yield. Our study might have been affected by recording bias if a patient diagnosed as having diabetes was not recorded as having diabetes on the practice computer system. The recording bias could lead to misclassification of patients either at baseline or at follow-up and is part of the justification for having a targeted approach. Any misclassification bias of the outcome, if non-differential, would tend to bias the hazard ratio towards one and reduce discrimination. Recording of a positive family history of diabetes was higher among women than among men. This could reflect recording bias or information biases resulting from differences in family history among women or greater opportunity for the information to be recorded as women tend to have higher consultation rates than men. Our study might have been affected by an ascertainment bias caused by differential testing of patients for diabetes by ethnic group or in those with specific risk factors. This could lead to increased rates of detection among patients with specific risk factors, including South Asian ethnicity, a family history of diabetes, or obesity—increased awareness among patients and clinicians might increase the likelihood of testing and therefore of clinical diagnosis. The effect of this would be to increase the apparent strength of the association between the risk factors and incident diabetes. Nonetheless, our hazard ratios for the risk factors in the model are generally of a similar magnitude to those found in other studies which tested for diabetes in the entire study cohort. In addition, the assessment and recording of these factors in clinical practice is becoming increasingly routine and complete, so limiting the effect of this potential bias. Another potential limitation of our study is that 25% of patients had missing values for either body mass index or smoking status. Patients with complete data tended to have different risks than those with missing data. We therefore used the technique of multiple imputation to substitute missing values for smoking and body mass index, rather than excluding these patients, as this is a less biased approach that makes the most efficient use of available data. The differences in risk factors and in the observed risks of diabetes between patients with and without missing data support the use of multiple imputation rather than a complete case analysis. Clinicians had recorded our predictor variables on the clinical computer system before the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, so these will not have been subject to recall bias. We have used the entire population registered with the QResearch practices contributing to the database from England and Wales. Consequently, the population is unlikely to be affected by selection bias, in contrast to the selection bias that inevitably occurs when patients are individually recruited to clinical cohorts or clinical trials. We have included a proxy measure of material deprivation, the Townsend score, which is based on the patient’s postcode at the level of the output area (corresponding to around 150 households) and is a composite score comprising lack of a car, unemployment, over-crowding, and non-home ownership. Some people living within an output area will not be typical of the other residents, resulting in some misclassification. Deprivation is likely to be associated with other factors known to increase risk of diabetes, such as poor diet, lack of exercise, and increased alcohol intake, and so will account at least in part for some of the effect of these factors. Lastly, we included treated hypertension as a predictor as both blood pressure and some antihypertensive drugs (such as thiazides) may have contributed to the increased hazard ratios associated with this variable. We used self assigned ethnicity in our analyses, as reported by patients to their general practices, which has advantages over analyses in which ethnicity is assigned by an informant rather than the patient, is imputed geographically, or is related to country of birth. The last of these is particularly problematic as increasing numbers of people from minority ethnic groups are now being born in the UK. We have also been able to disaggregate the South Asian groups and report on them separately, which answers concerns with studies that tend to combine them into one group when they differ in risk factor exposure, disease rates, and outcomes. One important limitation is that only one quarter of patients overall had self assigned ethnicity recorded. Among those with a recorded value, 13.66% were recorded as from a minority ethnic group, which is higher than the estimated figure for 2006 based on the 2001 census, indicating over-representation of practices from ethnically diverse areas, that practices in ethnically diverse areas are more likely to record ethnicity, or most likely a combination of both. We have assumed that where patients have self assigned ethnicity recorded (as Bangladeshi, for example) this is accurate and the patient was indeed Bangladeshi. Where patients did not have ethnicity recorded, we have assumed they were white. Any misclassification arising from these assumptions is most likely to affect the reference category of “white or not recorded,” but because of the mix of the populations of England and Wales, less than 7% of such patients are likely to be from a non-white ethnic group. This misclassification error is likely to be non-differential and if so will tend to underestimate the relative effect of ethnicity on risk of type 2 diabetes rather than generating spurious associations. Misclassification would also tend to reduce levels of discrimination and underestimate risk in some misclassified patients. We restricted all values of variables in the model to those that had been recorded in the person’s electronic healthcare record before the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes (or before censoring for those who did not develop type 2 diabetes) in order to avoid recording bias. We validated the QDScore in a separate sample of general practices from those used to develop the score. The QDScore has good discrimination (that is, ability to separate out people who did and those who did not subsequently develop type 2 diabetes) and explains approximately 50% of the total variation in times to diagnosis of diabetes. The D statistic, which is a measure of discrimination appropriate for survival type data, was higher than in our cardiovascular disease algorithm and that reported in some other studies. This increases the likelihood that the algorithm will more accurately predict risk for an individual patient. An important limitation of our validation is that a degree of over-optimism could exist as, although we have used a completely physically discrete set of general practices for the validation, these practices use the same clinical computer system (EMIS) as those used to derive the algorithm. This system is, however, currently in use in 60% of UK general practices, so the diabetes clinical risk algorithm is at least likely to perform well for well over half of the UK’s population. A more stringent test of performance would involve practices using a different clinical computer system; however, recording of ethnicity in other general practice databases is at present likely to be too low for a meaningful comparison, as EMIS has more practices in ethnically diverse areas. Nonetheless, our previous algorithm for cardiovascular disease, developed with similar methods and the same database, has subsequently performed well on another database containing primary care data from practices using a different clinical computer system. Heterogeneity of risk factors and risk of type 2 diabetes Our study has good face validity, as the prevalence of established risk factors reported here corresponds to that reported elsewhere. We found a significant heterogeneity of risk factors, incidence rates, and hazard ratios for type 2 diabetes across the ethnic groups. The high prevalence of a recorded family history among South Asians may reflect a true increased rate or could be due to differences in what constitutes a first degree relative (for example, cousins may be regarded as siblings). Of particular interest are the significant differences in hazard ratios between the South Asian groups; Bangladeshi men and women had higher risks than Pakistanis, who in turn had higher risks than Indians. Routinely collected data from electronic primary healthcare records have been used to develop other risk prediction algorithms. For example, data from 531 general practices was used to develop and validate the QRISK2 cardiovascular disease risk tool, which is being implemented in clinical settings in the UK. The Cambridge diabetes risk score was developed by combining data from two different general practice samples. The first sample consisted of half of the participants recruited for the study, in which patients were tested for diabetes by using an oral glucose tolerance test in one general practice in Cambridgeshire. The second sample consisted of half of the incident cases of diabetes identified over a 12 month period from 41 practices in the south of England. The combined data from a total of 650 patients, including 126 cases of diabetes, were then used to derive a risk score designed to identify patients with undiagnosed diabetes at a point in time. The score was then validated in the remaining half of the recruited patients from the practice in Cambridgeshire. The Cambridge risk score has since been applied to a prospective cohort to estimate the risk of incident diabetes in 25 000 people from Norfolk. One advantage of the QDScore is the use of a larger and more representative cohort, which is more likely to generalise to the UK. Another advantage is the inclusion of both deprivation and self assigned ethnicity, which are independently associated with risk of incident diabetes; this is likely to help with the problems identified with the Cambridge risk score in its performance in ethnically diverse populations. The QDScore explained significantly more of the variation and had improved discrimination compared with the Cambridge risk score. Overall, almost half (15 545/32 450; 47.9%) of cases of diabetes occurred in the top 10th of the distribution and almost 70% (22 476/32 450) occurred in the top fifth based on the diabetes clinical risk score. This compared with 27.3% and 50% for the top 10th and fifth reported in the Cambridge risk score paper. We cannot determine the calibration of the Cambridge risk score, as it does not give a measure of absolute risk over a given time period. Our validation has some limitations. Although our validation cohort consisted of separate practices and patients, the practices used the same clinical computer system (EMIS) and so there may be a degree of over-optimism. Future studies could test the performance of the QDScore in other databases based on practices using a different clinical computer system or in cohorts in which formal diagnostic testing may be possible. We did not do comparisons with other prospective studies that have developed a risk prediction score for which laboratory tests are needed (such as measurement of high density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, or fasting glucose) or that have included variables which are difficult to measure consistently and reliably such as waist circumference and which, unlike body mass index, are not routinely recorded in general practice. Other diabetes scores have been developed within specific ethnic groups (for example, Mexican Americans, Japanese Americans), but we have too few patients in the UK in these ethnic groups to allow a meaningful comparison to be made within this analysis. Nonetheless, our receiver operator curve statistic of 0.85 for women and 0.83 for men is substantially higher than those in many studies, which have reported values ranging between 0.71 and 0.80 ; it is very comparable to the three studies reporting the highest receiver operator curve statistics, with values of 0.85 and 0.86. Lastly, although data on fasting and random glucose are recorded to some extent within primary care electronic health records, we did not think that these were suitable for use in a prediction score, as they are the basis for making diagnoses of diabetes in this context rather than being recorded in a representative sample of patients at baseline. In addition, we were interested to develop a score that did not require laboratory measurements. Simple risk algorithms have performed well in comparison with more complex clinical evaluations in studies of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. This algorithm to predict risk of type 2 diabetes has the unique advantage of including both ethnicity and social deprivation, can be derived without laboratory measurements, and thus is suitable for use both in clinical settings and for self assessment. The QDScore could be used to identify patients at high risk of diabetes who might benefit from interventions to reduce their risk. Good evidence shows that behavioural or pharmacological interventions can prevent type 2 diabetes in up to two thirds of patients at high risk and that early diagnosis is likely to improve outcomes In 2009 the Department of Health will start a major vascular screening programme, which includes identification and management of patients at high risk of diabetes for preventive care No widely accepted and validated risk prediction score takes account of both social deprivation and ethnicity and can be applied in primary care in the UK The QDScore is a new risk prediction algorithm for type 2 diabetes developed in a very large and unselected family practice derived population, with appropriate weightings for ethnicity and social deprivation The final algorithm includes self assigned ethnicity, age, sex, body mass index, smoking status, family history of diabetes, Townsend deprivation score, treated hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and current use of corticosteroids The performance of the QDScore in an independent sample of practices showed good discrimination and calibration We acknowledge the contribution of Egton Medical Information System (EMIS) and practices using EMIS and contributing to the QResearch database.

Prospective open cohort study using routinely collected data from 355 general practices in England and Wales to develop the score and from 176 separate practices to validate the score. 2 540 753 patients aged 25-79 in the derivation cohort, who contributed 16 436 135 person years of observation and of whom 78 081 had an incident diagnosis of type 2 diabetes; 1 232 832 patients (7 643 037 person years) in the validation cohort, with 37 535 incident cases of type 2 diabetes. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate effects of risk factors in the derivation cohort and to derive a risk equation in men and women. The predictive variables examined and included in the final model were self assigned ethnicity, age, sex, body mass index, smoking status, family history of diabetes, Townsend deprivation score, treated hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and current use of corticosteroids; the outcome of interest was incident diabetes recorded in general practice records. Measures of calibration and discrimination were calculated in the validation cohort. A fourfold to fivefold variation in risk of type 2 diabetes existed between different ethnic groups. Compared with the white reference group, the adjusted hazard ratio was 4.07 (95% confidence interval 3.24 to 5.11) for Bangladeshi women, 4.53 (3.67 to 5.59) for Bangladeshi men, 2.15 (1.84 to 2.52) for Pakistani women, and 2.54 (2.20 to 2.93) for Pakistani men. Pakistani and Bangladeshi men had significantly higher hazard ratios than Indian men. Black African men and Chinese women had an increased risk compared with the corresponding white reference group. In the validation dataset, the model explained 51.53% (95% confidence interval 50.90 to 52.16) of the variation in women and 48.16% (47.52 to 48.80) of that in men. The risk score showed good discrimination, with a D statistic of 2.11 (95% confidence interval 2.08 to 2.14) in women and 1.97 (1.95 to 2.00) in men. The model was well calibrated. The QDScore is the first risk prediction algorithm to estimate the 10 year risk of diabetes on the basis of a prospective cohort study and including both social deprivation and ethnicity. The algorithm does not need laboratory tests and can be used in clinical settings and also by the public through a simple web calculator (). The prevalence of type 2 diabetes and the burden of disease caused by it have increased very rapidly worldwide. This has been fuelled by ageing populations, poor diet, and the concurrent epidemic of obesity. The health and economic consequences of this diabetes epidemic are huge and rising. Strong evidence from randomised controlled trials shows that behavioural or pharmacological interventions can prevent type 2 diabetes in up to two thirds of high risk cases. Cost effectiveness modelling suggests that screening programmes aid earlier diagnosis and help to prevent type 2 diabetes or improve outcomes in people who develop the condition, making the prevention and early detection of diabetes an international public health priority. Early detection is important, as up to half of people with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes have one or more complications at the time of diagnosis. Although several algorithms for predicting the risk of type 2 diabetes have been developed, no widely accepted diabetes risk prediction score has been developed and validated for use in routine clinical practice. Previous studies have been limited by size, and some have performed inadequately when tested in ethnically diverse populations. A new diabetes risk prediction tool with appropriate weightings for both social deprivation and ethnicity is needed given the prevalence of type 2 diabetes, particularly among minority ethnic communities, appreciable numbers of whom remain without a diagnosis for long periods of time. Such patients have an increased risk of avoidable morbidity and mortality. We present the derivation and validation of a new risk prediction algorithm for assessing the risk of developing type 2 diabetes among a very large and unselected population derived from family practice, with appropriate weightings for ethnicity and social deprivation. We designed the algorithm (the QDScore) so that it would be based on variables that are readily available in patients’ electronic health records or which patients themselves would be likely to know—that is, without needing laboratory tests or clinical measurements—thereby enabling it to be readily and cost effectively implemented in routine clinical practice and by national screening initiatives. We did a prospective cohort study in a large population of primary care patients from version 19 of the QResearch database (). This is a large, validated primary care electronic database containing the health records of 11 million patients registered with 551 general practices using the Egton Medical Information System (EMIS) computer system. Practices and patients contained on the database are nationally representative for England and Wales and similar to those on other large national primary care databases using other clinical software systems. We included all QResearch practices in England and Wales once they had been using their current EMIS system for at least a year, so as to ensure completeness of recording of morbidity and prescribing data. We randomly allocated two thirds of practices to the derivation dataset and the remaining third to the validation dataset; we used the simple random sampling utility in Stata to assign practices to the derivation or validation cohort. We identified an open cohort of patients aged 25-79 years at the study entry date, drawn from patients registered with eligible practices during the 15 years between 1 January 1993 and 31 March 2008. We used an open cohort design, rather than a closed cohort design, as this allows patients to enter the population throughout the whole study period rather than requiring registration on a fixed date; our cohort should thus reflect the realities of routine clinical practice. We excluded patients with a prior recorded diagnosis of diabetes (type 1 or 2), temporary residents, patients with interrupted periods of registration with the practice, and those who did not have a valid postcode related Townsend deprivation score (about 4% of the population). For each patient, we determined an entry date to the cohort, which was the latest of their 25th birthday, their date of registration with the practice, the date on which the practice computer system was installed plus one year, and the beginning of the study period (1 January 1993). We included patients in the analysis once they had a minimum of one year’s complete data in their medical record. For each patient, we determined the right censor date, which was the earliest of the date of diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, date of death, date of deregistration with the practice, date of last upload of computerised data, or the study end date (31 March 2008). Our primary outcome measure was the first (incident) diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus as recorded on the general practice computer records. We identified patients with diabetes by searching the electronic health record for a diagnosis Read code for diabetes (C10%). As in other studies, we classified patients as having type 1 diabetes if they had a diagnosis of diabetes and had been prescribed insulin under the age of 35 and classified the remaining patients as having type 2 diabetes. We examined the following variables for inclusion in our analysis, all of which are known or thought to affect risk of developing diabetes, and are also likely to be recorded in the patients’ electronic records as part of routine clinical practice: self assigned ethnicity (nine categories); age at study entry (in single years); body mass index (continuous); smoking status (current smoker, not a current smoker); Townsend deprivation score (2001 census data evaluated at output areas as a continuous variable) ranging from −6 in the most affluent to 11 in the most deprived; recorded family history of diabetes in a first degree relative (binary variable yes/no); diagnosis of cardiovascular disease at baseline (binary variable yes/no); treated hypertension at baseline—that is, diagnosis of hypertension plus more than two prescriptions for antihypertensive drugs (binary variable yes/no); systemic corticosteroids at baseline—that is, at least two prescriptions within the preceding six months (binary variable yes/no). We restricted all values of these variables to those that had been recorded in the person’s electronic healthcare record before the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes (or before censoring for those who did not develop type 2 diabetes). We used Read codes for ethnicity to denote self assigned ethnicity. The Read classification is the coding system in use in general practice in England and Wales (ICD-10 is the equivalent coding system in use in hospitals). We grouped the codes into the English National Health Service standard 16+1 categories for the initial descriptive analysis. We then combined these 16+1 categories into the final nine reporting groups, thereby ensuring sufficient numbers of events in each group to enable a meaningful analysis. The “white or not recorded” category comprised British, Irish, and other white background, as well as those whose ethnicity was not recorded. We designated this as the reference category. We combined the group for whom ethnicity was not recorded with the white ethnic group; assuming the study population is comparable to the United Kingdom population, 93% or more of people without ethnicity recorded would be expected to be from a white ethnic group. The “other including mixed category” comprised “white and black Caribbean,” “white and black African,” “white and Asian,” “other mixed,” “other black, and other ethnic group.” The “other Asian” category included Read codes for East African Asian, Indo-Caribbean, Punjabi, Kashmiri, Sri Lankan, Tamil, Sinhalese, Caribbean Asian, British Asian, mixed Asian, or Asian unspecified. For body mass index and smoking status, we used the values recorded closest to the study entry date. We used body mass index rather than waist circumference, as the latter is not well recorded on clinical computer systems in the UK. We calculated crude incidence rates of type 2 diabetes according to age, ethnic group, and deprivation in fifths. We then directly age standardised the incidence rates by ethnic group and deprivation by using the age distribution in five year bands of the entire derivation cohort as the standard population. We also used the same method to age standardise the means of continuous variables and proportions with risk factors by ethnic group. We used a Cox proportional hazards model in the derivation dataset to estimate the coefficients and hazard ratios associated with each potential risk factor for the first ever recorded diagnosis of diabetes for men and women separately. As in a previous study, we used the Bayes information criterion to compare models. This is a likelihood measure in which lower values indicate better fit and in which a penalty is paid for increasing the number of variables in the model. We used fractional polynomials to model non-linear risk relations with continuous variables where appropriate. We tested for interactions between each variable and age and between smoking and deprivation and included significant interactions in the final model. Continuous variables were centred for analysis. We used multiple imputation to replace missing values for smoking status and body mass index, and we used these values in our main analyses. We fitted our final model on the basis of multiply imputed datasets by using Rubin’s rules to combine estimates of effects and standard errors of estimates to allow for the uncertainty caused by missing data. Multiple imputation is a statistical technique designed to reduce the biases that can occur in “complete case” analysis along with a substantial loss of power and precision. The imputation technique involves creating multiple copies of the data and replaces missing values with imputed values on the basis of a suitable random sample from their predicted distribution. Multiple imputation therefore allows patients with incomplete data to still be included in analyses, thereby making full use of all the available data, and thus increasing power and precision, but without compromising validity. We used the ICE procedure in Stata to obtain five imputed datasets (further details are available from the corresponding author). We took the regression coefficient (that is, the log of the hazard ratio) for each variable from the final model and used these as weights for the new disease risk equations for type 2 diabetes. We combined these weights with the baseline survivor function for diagnosis of diabetes evaluated at 10 years and centred on the means of continuous risk factors to derive a risk equation for 10 years’ follow-up. We have presented the Townsend coefficients in standard deviation units so that this can be applied in a non-UK setting where other indices of deprivation might apply. We compared our final model (model A) with three other models in order to determine the additional contribution to the fit (using the Bayes information criterion in which lower values indicate better fit) and performance of the model of including both ethnicity and deprivation in the algorithm. Our first supplementary model (model B) included all the variables except for deprivation and ethnicity, the second model (model C) included deprivation but not ethnicity, and the third (model D) included ethnicity but not deprivation. We tested the performance of the final algorithm (the QDScore) in the validation dataset. We calculated the 10 year estimated risk of acquiring type 2 diabetes for each patient in the validation dataset by using multiple imputations to replace missing values for smoking status and body mass index, as in the derivation dataset. We calculated the mean predicted risk and the observed risk of diabetes at 10 years and compared these by 10th of predicted risk. The observed risk at 10 years was obtained by using the 10 year Kaplan-Meier estimate. We calculated the Brier score (a measure of goodness of fit where lower values indicate better accuracy) by using the censoring adjusted version adapted for survival data, D statistic (a measure of discrimination where higher values indicate better discrimination), and an R statistic (a measure of explained variation for survival data, where higher values indicate that more variation is explained). We also calculated the area under the receiver operator curve, where higher values indicate better discrimination. We also compared the performance of the QDScore with the Cambridge risk score, which includes age, sex, body mass index, smoking status, corticosteroids, antihypertensive treatment, and family history of diabetes. We calculated the proportion of patients in the validation sample who had an estimated 10 year risk of diagnosed diabetes of ≥10%, ≥15%, ≥20%, ≥30%, ≥40%, and ≥50% by age, sex, ethnic group, and deprivation according to the QDScore. We used all the available data on the QResearch database and therefore did not do a pre-study sample size calculation. We used Stata (version 10) for all analyses and chose a significance level of 0.01 (two tailed). Description of the derivation and validation dataset Overall, 531 UK practices met our inclusion criteria, of which 355 were randomly assigned to the derivation dataset and 176 to the validation dataset. We excluded 20 practices: four practices had not completely uploaded all their electronic data for the relevant study period, seven practices were from Scotland, and nine practices were from Northern Ireland. The derivation cohort contained 2 594 578 patients, of whom 53 825 had type 1 or type 2 diabetes before the start of the study and were therefore excluded leaving 2 540 753 patients (1 283 135; 50.50% women) aged 25-79 years and free of diabetes at baseline for analysis. The validation cohort contained 1 261 419 patients aged 25-79, of whom 28 587 had a previous diagnosis of type 1 or type 2 diabetes leaving 1 232 832 patients for analysis (50.49% women). Overall, we studied 3 773 585 patients contributing 24 079 172 person years, of whom 115 616 patients (78 081 in the derivation cohort and 37 535 in the validation cohort) had a new diagnosis of type 2 diabetes during follow-up. Table 1 compares the characteristics of eligible patients in the derivation and validation cohorts. Although this validation cohort was drawn from an independent group of practices, the baseline characteristics were very similar to those for the derivation cohort. Overall, 898 461 patients (23.81% of 3 773 585) had ethnicity recorded, and 122 736 (13.66%) of these were from a non-white ethnic group. Practices in areas where the proportion of patients from a non-white ethnic group is higher according to the 2001 census (such as London (28.9%), East Midlands (6.5%), and West Midlands (11.3%)) also have higher rates of completeness of recording of ethnicity on the QResearch database (40.1%, 21.4%, and 30.1% for the above areas).  Characteristics of patients aged 25-79 free of diabetes at baseline in derivation and validation cohorts between 1993 and 2008. Values are numbers (percentages) unless stated otherwise Table 1 shows that 78.97% of women in the derivation cohort had body mass index recorded and 90.00% had smoking status recorded; 78.03% had both body mass index and smoking status recorded. For men, the corresponding figures were 71.19%, 83.24%, and 70.12%. Overall, 22.97% of women and 29.88% of men had either smoking or body mass index imputed by multiple imputation (data were not imputed for ethnicity—all patients with missing ethnicity were treated as white/not recorded). Similar figures were observed for men and women in the validation cohort, where multiple imputation was also used. Table 2 shows the characteristics of men and women with complete data for smoking and body mass index compared with those who had missing data. Women with missing data had different patterns of risk factors—for example, women with complete data for body mass index were more likely to have a family history of diabetes, to be recorded as current smokers, and to have treated hypertension. They also had a lower 10 year observed risk of diabetes compared with women with missing body mass index data. Women with complete data for smoking were more likely to have a diagnosis of cardiovascular disease, a diagnosis of treated hypertension, and a family history of diabetes. The 10 year observed risk of diabetes was lower than for women whose smoking status was missing. The pattern was similar for men for most risk factors, except that the observed risks of diabetes were lower among men with missing data.  Characteristics of men and women in derivation cohort with and without complete data for body mass index and smoking. Values are numbers (percentages) unless stated otherwise Table 3 shows the crude and age standardised rates of type 2 diabetes by sex, deprivation, and ethnicity in the derivation cohort. The age standardised rates for the white reference group were 4.13 (95% confidence interval 4.08 to 4.17) per 1000 person years for women and 5.31 (5.26 to 5.36) per 1000 person years for men. The crude and age standardised incidence rates of type 2 diabetes in the derivation cohort varied widely between ethnic groups, as shown in table 3. Age standardised rates were significantly higher for men in every ethnic group compared with the white reference group, except for Chinese men. In women, age standardised incidence rates were higher for every group compared with the white reference group. The highest age standardised rates were in South Asians, and significant differences existed between the South Asian groups. For example, the rate for Bangladeshi women was 18.20 (12.93 to 23.47) per 1000 person years and that for Bangladeshi men was 19.34 (14.28 to 24.4) per 1000 person years. For Pakistanis, the corresponding rates per 1000 person years were 11.19 (9.16 to 13.21) for women and 13.22 (11.24 to 15.21) for men.  Crude and age standardised incidence of type 2 diabetes per 1000 person years by sex, deprivation fifth, and ethnicity in derivation dataset We also found a marked difference in the age standardised incidence rates of type 2 diabetes by deprivation, with a more than twofold difference for women when comparing the most deprived fifth (6.39 (6.25 to 6.54) per 1000 person years) with the most affluent fifth (3.00 (2.93 to 3.08) per 1000 person years). A similar, but less steep gradient was seen for men. The rates seen in the validation cohort were similar to those for the derivation cohort (data not shown). Table 4 shows the age standardised distribution of risk factors across each of the main ethnic groups. Substantial heterogeneity exists across the ethnic groups for risk factors, and the distribution also differs between men and women within ethnic groups. The notable results include substantial differences in the age standardised prevalence of smoking among men of Bangladeshi (46.04%, 95% confidence interval 43.16% to 48.92%), Caribbean (40.45%, 38.99% to 41.91%), Pakistani (32.82%, 31.29% to 34.35%), white/not recorded (33.49%, 33.40% to 33.58%), Chinese (26.63%, 24.23% to 29.03%), Indian (22.71%, 21.60% to 23.81%), and black African (17.95%, 16.76% to 19.14%) origin. Smoking rates were lower for women in each ethnic group compared with men but varied widely between women from different groups.  Distribution of risk factors for type 2 diabetes by ethnic group in men and women in derivation cohort. Values are age standardised means and proportions with 95% confidence intervals Treated hypertension was highest among black Caribbean and black African men and women and more than twice as high as that for the white reference group. Recorded family history of diabetes was highest among black Caribbean women (32.63%, 31.41% to 33.85%) and Indian men (29.95%, 28.78% to 31.11%), which was more than three times that for the white reference group who had the lowest rates (11.32%, 11.27% to 11.38% for women and 8.07%, 8.02% to 8.12% for men). Bangladeshi men and women had the highest age standardised mean deprivation scores, followed by those of black African and black Caribbean origin. Indians and the white reference group had the lowest mean deprivation scores, as shown in table 4. The highest mean body mass index was seen among black African women (age standardised mean 28.44, 28.29 to 28.58) compared with 25.47 (25.46 to 25.48) for women in the white reference group. The lowest value was in Chinese women (age standardised mean 22.87, 22.68 to 23.06). Similar patterns, although slightly less marked, were seen for men across the ethnic groups. Finally, 9.70% (7.76% to 11.65%) of Bangladeshi men had a recorded diagnosis of cardiovascular disease at baseline, which was more than twice that for men in the white reference group (4.54%, 4.50% to 4.57%) and more than four times that found in Chinese men (2.26%, 1.15% to 3.37%). Table 5 shows the results of the Cox regression analysis for the QDScore. After adjustment for all other variables in the model, we found significant associations with risk of type 2 diabetes in both men and women for age, body mass index, family history of diabetes, smoking status, treated hypertension, use of corticosteroids, diagnosed cardiovascular disease, social deprivation, and ethnicity. We therefore included these variables in the final model and risk prediction algorithm.  Adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence interval) for QDScore in derivation cohort (see fig 1 for graphical representation of interaction terms) We found significant heterogeneity of risk of type 2 diabetes by ethnic group compared with the white reference population, having adjusted for age, body mass index, deprivation, family history of diabetes, smoking status, treated hypertension, diagnosed cardiovascular disease, use of corticosteroids, and diagnosed cardiovascular disease, as shown in table 4. For example, among Bangladeshis, the adjusted hazard ratio for women was 4.07 (95% confidence interval 3.24 to 5.11) and that for men was 4.53 (3.67 to 5.59). These were significantly higher than the increased hazard ratios in Pakistani women and men (2.15, 1.84 to 2.52; and 2.54, 2.20 to 2.93). Both Pakistani and Bangladeshi men had significantly higher hazard ratios than Indian men. Black African men and Chinese women had increased risks compared with the corresponding white reference group. The only groups to have significantly lower risks than the white reference group were black African women (0.81, 0.66 to 0.98) and black Caribbean women (0.80, 0.70 to 0.92). The fractional polynomial terms selected for inclusion in the model were as follows. For age in women the two terms were (age/10) and (age/10). For body mass index in women, the two terms were (bmi/10) and (bmi/10). For men, the two age terms were log(age/10) and (age/10) and the two terms for body mass index were (bmi/10) and (bmi/10). Figure 1 shows the estimated adjusted hazard ratios by age and body mass index for these fractional polynomial terms in men and women.  Graphical representation of age interactions for men and women for risk of type 2 diabetes We identified significant interactions between age and body mass index, age and family history of diabetes, and age and smoking status. We therefore included these interactions in the final model, and the general direction of the effects was that body mass index and family history of diabetes tended to have a greater impact on risk of diabetes at younger ages, as shown in fig 1. Smoking had a more complex relation with age; the risk peaked in middle age for both men and women. In a comparison of models, the median Bayes information criterion for women for our final model (model A) was 875 203, for the model without deprivation and ethnicity (model B) it was 876 400, for the model without ethnicity (model C) it was 875 270, and for the model without deprivation (model D) it was 876 198, indicating that the model that incorporated both ethnicity and deprivation was superior to the other three. For men, the corresponding figures were 1 086 755, 1 087 745, 1 087 034, and 1 087 369, similarly supporting the inclusion of both ethnicity and deprivation into the final model. Table 6 shows the results for the validation statistics for men and women after application of the QDScore and the Cambridge risk score in the validation dataset. The QDScore shows higher levels of discrimination than the Cambridge risk score. For example, in women the D statistic for the QDScore was 2.11 (95% confidence interval 2.08 to 2.14) compared with 1.88 (1.85 to 1.91) with the Cambridge risk score; a 0.1 difference in the D statistic indicates an important difference in prognostic separation between two risk algorithms. The QDScore explained a higher proportion of the variation—it explained 51.53% of the variation in women and 48.16% of that in men. The corresponding values for the Cambridge risk score were 45.77% and 41.82%. The Brier score, however, was slightly lower for the Cambridge risk score in both men and women.  Validation statistics for QDScore and Cambridge risk score in validation cohort. Values are mean (95% confidence interval) Figure 2 compares the mean predicted scores from the QDScore with the observed risks at 10 years within each 10th of predicted risk in order to assess the calibration of the model in the validation sample. The close correspondence between predicted and observed 10 year risks within each model 10th suggests that the model was well calibrated. For example, in the top 10th of risk, the mean predicted risk was 18.31% (95% confidence interval 18.24% to 18.38%) in women and the observed risk was 18.82% (18.39% to 19.26%). The ratio of predicted to observed risk in this tenth was 0.97, indicating almost perfect calibration (a ratio of 1 indicates perfect calibration—that is, no under-prediction or over-prediction). We found similar results for men, with a ratio of 0.99 in the top 10th of predicted risk.   QDScore predicted and observed risk of diabetes by 10th of predicted risk Predictions with age, sex, deprivation, and ethnicity Table 7 shows the percentages of men and women in the validation dataset with a 10 year predicted risk of being diagnosed as having type 2 diabetes according to a range of thresholds and by age band. For example, at the 10% threshold, 10.60% of women and 15.06% of men had a 10% or higher predicted risk of being diagnosed as having type 2 diabetes over 10 years. This varied markedly by age such that 21.43% of women aged 55-59 and 30.99% of women aged 65-69 had a 10% or greater risk of being diagnosed as having type 2 diabetes over 10 years. The corresponding figures for men were 33.28% and 44.08%.  Percentage of patients in validation dataset with 10 year predicted risk of type 2 diabetes from QDScore of ≥10%, ≥15%, ≥20%, ≥30%, ≥40%, and ≥50% by age and sex Tables 8 and 9 show the 10 year risk of type 2 diabetes among men and women of different ethnic groups and for those living in the most deprived and affluent areas. For example, 33.83% of Bangladeshi women had a 10 year risk of being diagnosed as having diabetes of 10% or more compared with 10.48% of women in the white reference group, and 15.03% of women in the most deprived fifth had a 10% or higher risk of developing diabetes over the next 10 years compared with 6.52% of women in the most affluent fifth. The difference between affluent and deprived fifths is more marked for women than for men; the corresponding figures are 15.65% for men in the most deprived fifth and 13.21% for men in the most affluent fifth.  Percentage of patients in validation dataset with 10 year predicted risk of type 2 diabetes from QDScore of ≥10%, ≥15%, ≥20%, ≥30%, ≥40%, and ≥50% by ethnicity and sex  Percentage of patients in validation dataset with 10 year predicted risk of diabetes from QDScore of ≥10%, ≥15%, ≥20%, ≥30%, ≥40%, and ≥50% by deprivation fifth and sex Overall, almost half (15 545/32 450; 47.9%) of cases of diabetes occurred in the top 10th of the distribution (risk of ≥10.38%) and almost 70% (22 476/32 450) occurred in the top fifth (risk of ≥5.98%). The QDScore is the first diabetes prediction algorithm developed and validated by using routinely collected data to predict the 10 year risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Our final model includes both deprivation and ethnicity as well as age, sex, smoking, treated hypertension, body mass index, family history of diabetes, current treatment with corticosteroids, and previous diagnosis of cardiovascular disease. The QDScore does not require any laboratory testing or clinical measurements and so can be used in many settings, including by individual members of the public who have access to a computer. This risk prediction tool might be used to identify and proactively intervene in people identified as having an increased risk. This algorithm, like other algorithms that predict cardiovascular disease, relies on routinely collected data and has the advantage that it is readily implementable. Furthermore, it is likely to reduce, rather than exacerbate, widespread and persistent health inequalities. The QDScore performed well compared with the Cambridge risk score. Assuming that the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of suitable interventions shown in randomised controlled trials extend to unselected patients from primary care, the QDScore could be used to identify patients at increased risk of diabetes who might benefit from interventions to reduce their risk. The traditional method for identifying patients at increased risk of type 2 diabetes has involved the detection of impaired glucose tolerance requiring an inconvenient and expensive oral glucose tolerance test. Targeted screening of higher risk groups has been proposed as a more cost effective solution, as the risk factors for diabetes and cardiovascular outcomes overlap considerably. Less expensive and more practical methods of identifying patients at increased risk are needed; these should ideally be based on models developed from contemporaneous data in ethnically and socioeconomically diverse populations obtained from the clinical setting in which these models will subsequently be applied. Simple clinical models using readily available data can offer similar discrimination to more complex models using laboratory data or biomarkers, and clinical models that do not need clinical measurements may have a further utility in settings where clinical measurements are not available or are too costly to collect. UK datasets derived from family practices have the advantage of having large and broadly representative populations with historical data tracking back well over a decade in most practices. These databases also contain data on many of the key variables known to be associated with risk of type 2 diabetes, such as age, sex, ethnicity, smoking, body mass index, family history of diabetes, treated hypertension, current use of corticosteroids, and social deprivation. Deprivation is not only strongly associated with increased prevalence of diabetes and diabetes related risk factors such as diet, obesity, and smoking but is also associated with poorer outcomes and intermediate measures such as achievement of lipid targets. Particular strengths of our study are the use of a large representative population from a validated database, our prospective cohort design, and the substantial numbers of patients with self assigned ethnicity for use in the analysis. We have modelled interactions with age and included these in the final model, so our algorithm takes account of the differential effect of three key variables (family history of diabetes, body mass index, and smoking) at different ages. Another important strength of the QDScore is that all the variables used in the algorithm will either be known to an individual patient or are collected as part of routine clinical practice and recorded within an individual patient’s primary healthcare record in most economically developed countries. This means that the algorithm can be used by patients for self assessment in a web based calculator () similar to the one available for self assessment of cardiovascular disease (). Alternatively, it can be implemented within clinical computer systems used in primary care and be used to stratify the practice population (aged 25-79) for risk on a continuing basis without the need for manual entry of data. Although no widely agreed thresholds for classification of patients at “high risk” exist, the QDScore could act as a basis for a systematic programme to identify patients at increased risk for intervention or to aid earlier diagnosis. Importantly, appropriate weighting for ethnicity and social deprivation should furthermore help to avoid widening health inequalities associated with introduction of systematic programmes of disease prevention activities. Despite its strengths, our study has limitations compared with an ideal study. In the ideal study, a large representative and tightly phenotyped primary care cohort would be assembled and followed longitudinally over the course of a decade. No patients would be lost to follow-up, and all patients would be subjected to repeated oral glucose tolerance tests throughout follow-up to confirm or refute the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. Although such a study would be very welcome, it would take at least 15 years to carry out and report, it would be unlikely to be feasible in routine primary care, and calibration would be inaccurate in more socially and ethnically diverse populations with different baseline risks. Our study offers a practical alternative approach, which can be implemented into primary care in a cost effective manner, while acknowledging the potential biases and their likely impact. Potential sources of misclassification, bias, and confounding One limitation of our study is that the main outcome was type 2 diabetes diagnosed by a clinician and recorded on the clinical computer system. The outcome was not formally validated, and we have not used the results of laboratory tests to confirm the diagnosis. However, this diagnosis would be unlikely to be recorded if the patient did not have diabetes—other studies of similar databases have shown good levels of accuracy for common chronic conditions, especially those that are now included in the UK quality and outcomes framework. Undiagnosed diabetes is a well recognised problem and is not specifically considered by our study. It is estimated to affect approximately 3% of the population according to the health survey for England. Some evidence suggests that South Asian women are more likely to have undiagnosed diabetes than are the general population, so our hazard ratios might underestimate the association for these patients. The risk factors for diagnosed diabetes are very similar to those for undiagnosed diabetes. Nevertheless, most previously undiagnosed cases are likely to have been included in the identified high risk groups and to have been picked up by systematic further evaluation, because risk stratification improves yield. Our study might have been affected by recording bias if a patient diagnosed as having diabetes was not recorded as having diabetes on the practice computer system. The recording bias could lead to misclassification of patients either at baseline or at follow-up and is part of the justification for having a targeted approach. Any misclassification bias of the outcome, if non-differential, would tend to bias the hazard ratio towards one and reduce discrimination. Recording of a positive family history of diabetes was higher among women than among men. This could reflect recording bias or information biases resulting from differences in family history among women or greater opportunity for the information to be recorded as women tend to have higher consultation rates than men. Our study might have been affected by an ascertainment bias caused by differential testing of patients for diabetes by ethnic group or in those with specific risk factors. This could lead to increased rates of detection among patients with specific risk factors, including South Asian ethnicity, a family history of diabetes, or obesity—increased awareness among patients and clinicians might increase the likelihood of testing and therefore of clinical diagnosis. The effect of this would be to increase the apparent strength of the association between the risk factors and incident diabetes. Nonetheless, our hazard ratios for the risk factors in the model are generally of a similar magnitude to those found in other studies which tested for diabetes in the entire study cohort. In addition, the assessment and recording of these factors in clinical practice is becoming increasingly routine and complete, so limiting the effect of this potential bias. Another potential limitation of our study is that 25% of patients had missing values for either body mass index or smoking status. Patients with complete data tended to have different risks than those with missing data. We therefore used the technique of multiple imputation to substitute missing values for smoking and body mass index, rather than excluding these patients, as this is a less biased approach that makes the most efficient use of available data. The differences in risk factors and in the observed risks of diabetes between patients with and without missing data support the use of multiple imputation rather than a complete case analysis. Clinicians had recorded our predictor variables on the clinical computer system before the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, so these will not have been subject to recall bias. We have used the entire population registered with the QResearch practices contributing to the database from England and Wales. Consequently, the population is unlikely to be affected by selection bias, in contrast to the selection bias that inevitably occurs when patients are individually recruited to clinical cohorts or clinical trials. We have included a proxy measure of material deprivation, the Townsend score, which is based on the patient’s postcode at the level of the output area (corresponding to around 150 households) and is a composite score comprising lack of a car, unemployment, over-crowding, and non-home ownership. Some people living within an output area will not be typical of the other residents, resulting in some misclassification. Deprivation is likely to be associated with other factors known to increase risk of diabetes, such as poor diet, lack of exercise, and increased alcohol intake, and so will account at least in part for some of the effect of these factors. Lastly, we included treated hypertension as a predictor as both blood pressure and some antihypertensive drugs (such as thiazides) may have contributed to the increased hazard ratios associated with this variable. We used self assigned ethnicity in our analyses, as reported by patients to their general practices, which has advantages over analyses in which ethnicity is assigned by an informant rather than the patient, is imputed geographically, or is related to country of birth. The last of these is particularly problematic as increasing numbers of people from minority ethnic groups are now being born in the UK. We have also been able to disaggregate the South Asian groups and report on them separately, which answers concerns with studies that tend to combine them into one group when they differ in risk factor exposure, disease rates, and outcomes. One important limitation is that only one quarter of patients overall had self assigned ethnicity recorded. Among those with a recorded value, 13.66% were recorded as from a minority ethnic group, which is higher than the estimated figure for 2006 based on the 2001 census, indicating over-representation of practices from ethnically diverse areas, that practices in ethnically diverse areas are more likely to record ethnicity, or most likely a combination of both. We have assumed that where patients have self assigned ethnicity recorded (as Bangladeshi, for example) this is accurate and the patient was indeed Bangladeshi. Where patients did not have ethnicity recorded, we have assumed they were white. Any misclassification arising from these assumptions is most likely to affect the reference category of “white or not recorded,” but because of the mix of the populations of England and Wales, less than 7% of such patients are likely to be from a non-white ethnic group. This misclassification error is likely to be non-differential and if so will tend to underestimate the relative effect of ethnicity on risk of type 2 diabetes rather than generating spurious associations. Misclassification would also tend to reduce levels of discrimination and underestimate risk in some misclassified patients. We restricted all values of variables in the model to those that had been recorded in the person’s electronic healthcare record before the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes (or before censoring for those who did not develop type 2 diabetes) in order to avoid recording bias. We validated the QDScore in a separate sample of general practices from those used to develop the score. The QDScore has good discrimination (that is, ability to separate out people who did and those who did not subsequently develop type 2 diabetes) and explains approximately 50% of the total variation in times to diagnosis of diabetes. The D statistic, which is a measure of discrimination appropriate for survival type data, was higher than in our cardiovascular disease algorithm and that reported in some other studies. This increases the likelihood that the algorithm will more accurately predict risk for an individual patient. An important limitation of our validation is that a degree of over-optimism could exist as, although we have used a completely physically discrete set of general practices for the validation, these practices use the same clinical computer system (EMIS) as those used to derive the algorithm. This system is, however, currently in use in 60% of UK general practices, so the diabetes clinical risk algorithm is at least likely to perform well for well over half of the UK’s population. A more stringent test of performance would involve practices using a different clinical computer system; however, recording of ethnicity in other general practice databases is at present likely to be too low for a meaningful comparison, as EMIS has more practices in ethnically diverse areas. Nonetheless, our previous algorithm for cardiovascular disease, developed with similar methods and the same database, has subsequently performed well on another database containing primary care data from practices using a different clinical computer system. Heterogeneity of risk factors and risk of type 2 diabetes Our study has good face validity, as the prevalence of established risk factors reported here corresponds to that reported elsewhere. We found a significant heterogeneity of risk factors, incidence rates, and hazard ratios for type 2 diabetes across the ethnic groups. The high prevalence of a recorded family history among South Asians may reflect a true increased rate or could be due to differences in what constitutes a first degree relative (for example, cousins may be regarded as siblings). Of particular interest are the significant differences in hazard ratios between the South Asian groups; Bangladeshi men and women had higher risks than Pakistanis, who in turn had higher risks than Indians. Routinely collected data from electronic primary healthcare records have been used to develop other risk prediction algorithms. For example, data from 531 general practices was used to develop and validate the QRISK2 cardiovascular disease risk tool, which is being implemented in clinical settings in the UK. The Cambridge diabetes risk score was developed by combining data from two different general practice samples. The first sample consisted of half of the participants recruited for the study, in which patients were tested for diabetes by using an oral glucose tolerance test in one general practice in Cambridgeshire. The second sample consisted of half of the incident cases of diabetes identified over a 12 month period from 41 practices in the south of England. The combined data from a total of 650 patients, including 126 cases of diabetes, were then used to derive a risk score designed to identify patients with undiagnosed diabetes at a point in time. The score was then validated in the remaining half of the recruited patients from the practice in Cambridgeshire. The Cambridge risk score has since been applied to a prospective cohort to estimate the risk of incident diabetes in 25 000 people from Norfolk. One advantage of the QDScore is the use of a larger and more representative cohort, which is more likely to generalise to the UK. Another advantage is the inclusion of both deprivation and self assigned ethnicity, which are independently associated with risk of incident diabetes; this is likely to help with the problems identified with the Cambridge risk score in its performance in ethnically diverse populations. The QDScore explained significantly more of the variation and had improved discrimination compared with the Cambridge risk score. Overall, almost half (15 545/32 450; 47.9%) of cases of diabetes occurred in the top 10th of the distribution and almost 70% (22 476/32 450) occurred in the top fifth based on the diabetes clinical risk score. This compared with 27.3% and 50% for the top 10th and fifth reported in the Cambridge risk score paper. We cannot determine the calibration of the Cambridge risk score, as it does not give a measure of absolute risk over a given time period. Our validation has some limitations. Although our validation cohort consisted of separate practices and patients, the practices used the same clinical computer system (EMIS) and so there may be a degree of over-optimism. Future studies could test the performance of the QDScore in other databases based on practices using a different clinical computer system or in cohorts in which formal diagnostic testing may be possible. We did not do comparisons with other prospective studies that have developed a risk prediction score for which laboratory tests are needed (such as measurement of high density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, or fasting glucose) or that have included variables which are difficult to measure consistently and reliably such as waist circumference and which, unlike body mass index, are not routinely recorded in general practice. Other diabetes scores have been developed within specific ethnic groups (for example, Mexican Americans, Japanese Americans), but we have too few patients in the UK in these ethnic groups to allow a meaningful comparison to be made within this analysis. Nonetheless, our receiver operator curve statistic of 0.85 for women and 0.83 for men is substantially higher than those in many studies, which have reported values ranging between 0.71 and 0.80 ; it is very comparable to the three studies reporting the highest receiver operator curve statistics, with values of 0.85 and 0.86. Lastly, although data on fasting and random glucose are recorded to some extent within primary care electronic health records, we did not think that these were suitable for use in a prediction score, as they are the basis for making diagnoses of diabetes in this context rather than being recorded in a representative sample of patients at baseline. In addition, we were interested to develop a score that did not require laboratory measurements. Simple risk algorithms have performed well in comparison with more complex clinical evaluations in studies of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. This algorithm to predict risk of type 2 diabetes has the unique advantage of including both ethnicity and social deprivation, can be derived without laboratory measurements, and thus is suitable for use both in clinical settings and for self assessment. The QDScore could be used to identify patients at high risk of diabetes who might benefit from interventions to reduce their risk. Good evidence shows that behavioural or pharmacological interventions can prevent type 2 diabetes in up to two thirds of patients at high risk and that early diagnosis is likely to improve outcomes In 2009 the Department of Health will start a major vascular screening programme, which includes identification and management of patients at high risk of diabetes for preventive care No widely accepted and validated risk prediction score takes account of both social deprivation and ethnicity and can be applied in primary care in the UK The QDScore is a new risk prediction algorithm for type 2 diabetes developed in a very large and unselected family practice derived population, with appropriate weightings for ethnicity and social deprivation The final algorithm includes self assigned ethnicity, age, sex, body mass index, smoking status, family history of diabetes, Townsend deprivation score, treated hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and current use of corticosteroids The performance of the QDScore in an independent sample of practices showed good discrimination and calibration We acknowledge the contribution of Egton Medical Information System (EMIS) and practices using EMIS and contributing to the QResearch database.

You need insulin to process the glucose in your food to give you energy. Symptoms include feeling tired, hungry or thirsty, and passing more urine. Lack of exercise, weight gain and a poor diet increase the risk of type 2 diabetes. Keeping active, with a healthy diet and weight, can help prevent or delay it. Type 2 diabetes develops when the body does not make enough insulin or does not use insulin efficiently. Insulin is a hormone that the body needs to break down glucose (sugar) in food so it can be used for energy. In type 2 diabetes, the body’s cells do not respond effectively to insulin. This causes glucose to stay in the blood, leading to a of glucose in the body. Many people with type 2 diabetes do not experience any symptoms at first. If they do have symptoms, these may include: Over time, diabetes can lead to complications, which can then cause other symptoms. — Use our diabetes and find out if you need to seek medical help.

Type 1 diabetes is an auto-immune disease where the body's immune system attacks the insulin-producing cells of the pancreas. Type 2 diabetes is associated with hereditary factors and lifestyle risk factors such as poor diet, insufficient physical activity and being overweight or obese. Many people with type 2 diabetes do not experience any symptoms at first. If they do have symptoms, these may include being very thirsty, passing more urine than usual, feeling tired, feeling hungry or having cuts that heal slowly. Type 2 diabetes cannot be cured, but people with the condition may be able to manage their type 2 diabetes through lifestyle changes and, if needed, diabetes medications to control blood sugar levels.

Nutrition Strategies for Controlling Type 2 Diabetes Many diabetic people are hardwired to eat the worst things for their condition, and you may find a great deal of resistance to the idea of changing their diet. It is always better to control this condition with diet than with medication or injections. It is estimated that 280 Australians develop diabetes every day. Around 4,400 amputations are performed regularly at Australian hospitals each year and researchers believe that 85% of diabetes-related amputations are avoidable if correct care and prevention are observed. In the last trimester of pregnancy, approximately 7% of women have such high levels of glucose in their blood their body can't produce enough insulin to absorb it all. Known as gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), it can be dangerous for both mother and baby if not managed appropriately (NHS 2018). Very low or very high blood glucose levels are primary causes of diabetic coma occurring in people with diabetes. There are 3 types of diabetic coma: diabetic ketoacidosis coma; hyperosmolar coma and hypoglycaemic coma. Diabetic coma is regarded as a medical emergency requiring immediate treatment. Hyperglycaemia is the medical condition in which a patient presents with abnormally high levels of glucose circulating in their bloodstream (Better Health Channel 2014). It is common for people not to experience the symptoms of hyperglycaemia until their blood sugar levels reach this high level. The main causes of amputation are trauma, cancer, diabetes, vascular disease, congenital differences, and infection. Alarmingly, Limbs4Life (2013) state that ‘every 3 hours in Australia a limb will be lost as a direct result of diabetes-related foot disease’. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is one of eight main forms of chronic disease in Australia.

You need insulin to process the glucose in your food to give you energy. Symptoms include feeling tired, hungry or thirsty, and passing more urine. Lack of exercise, weight gain and a poor diet increase the risk of type 2 diabetes. Keeping active, with a healthy diet and weight, can help prevent or delay it. Type 2 diabetes develops when the body does not make enough insulin or does not use insulin efficiently. Insulin is a hormone that the body needs to break down glucose (sugar) in food so it can be used for energy. In type 2 diabetes, the body’s cells do not respond effectively to insulin. This causes glucose to stay in the blood, leading to a of glucose in the body. Many people with type 2 diabetes do not experience any symptoms at first.

60a2010f-89bb-4420-a20c-9c1bc3a97704,"Heart Failure Risk Higher in Women With Type 1 Diabetes Over time, type 1 diabetes[1] can contribute to a number of cardiovascular problems. One of these is heart failure, in which your heart isn’t capable of adequately pumping blood throughout your body. It’s long been known that diabetes — both type 1 and type 2[2] — raises the risk of heart failure, but when it comes to the magnitude of risk for men and women separately, many studies have come to different conclusions. So for a new study, researchers at the University of Oxford in Britain pooled data from many earlier studies, in what’s known as a meta-analysis. The earlier studies were conducted in the United States, Canada, Britain, Italy, Sweden, Japan, China, Taiwan, South Korea and Australia, as noted in a press release[3] on the new research. To get cutting-edge diabetes news, strategies for blood glucose management, nutrition tips, healthy recipes, and more delivered straight to your inbox, sign up for our free newsletter[4]! Published in the journal the new analysis includes data from 47 different groups of participants — over 12 million people in total. During the combined study period, over 250,000 participants experienced heart failure. This includes people with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, and those without diabetes. After controlling for factors other than diabetes that could affect the risk of heart failure — such as age and other health conditions — the researchers found that men with type 1 diabetes were 3.47 times as likely as those without diabetes to experience heart failure. But the risk for women with type 1 diabetes was even greater by comparison: they were 5.15 times as likely as women without diabetes to develop heart failure. Both men and women with type 2 diabetes were also at an increased risk for heart failure, but to a lesser and more equal degree. Men with type 2 diabetes were 1.74 times as likely to develop heart failure as those without diabetes, while women with type 2 diabetes were 1.95 times as likely to develop heart failure. While it’s not exactly clear what explains the difference in heart failure risk between men and women with type 1 diabetes, the researchers have some ideas. “Some major concerns are that women are […] being undertreated for diabetes,” says study coauthor Dr. Sanne Peters, who adds that women potentially “are not taking the same levels of medications as men, and are less likely to receive intensive care.” Want to learn more about recent type 1 diabetes research?

581bd5fc-aeef-4556-8a85-de2c8278bd2f,"Medically reviewed by — — Diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs because the body is unable to use blood sugar (glucose) properly. The exact cause of this malfunction is unknown, but genetic and environmental factors play a part. Risk factors for diabetes include obesity and high levels of cholesterol. Some specific causes are discussed below. This is primarily the cause of type 1 diabetes. It occurs when insulin-producing cells are damaged or destroyed and stop producing insulin. Insulin is needed to move blood sugar into cells throughout the body. The resulting insulin deficiency leaves too much sugar in the blood and not enough in the cells for energy. This is specific to type 2 diabetes It occurs when insulin is produced normally in the pancreas, but the body is still unable move glucose into the cells for fuel. At first, the pancreas will create more insulin to overcome the body’s resistance. Eventually the cells “wear out.” At that point the body slows insulin production, leaving too much glucose in the blood. This is known as . A person with prediabetes has a blood sugar level higher than normal but not high enough for a diagnosis of diabetes. Unless tested, the person may not be aware, as there are no clear symptoms. Type 2 diabetes occurs as insulin production continues to decrease and resistance increases. Genetics plays a role in determining how likely you are to develop some type of diabetes. Researchers don’t fully understand the role of genetics in the development of diabetes. According to the , statistics show that if you have a parent or sibling with diabetes, your odds of developing it yourself increase. Although research is not conclusive, some ethnic groups seem to have a higher rate of diabetes. This is true for: Genetic conditions like and can both damage the pancreas leading to a higher likelihood of developing diabetes. Monogenic forms of diabetes result from single gene mutations. Monogenic forms of diabetes are rare, accounting for only of all cases of diabetes found in young people. A small percentage of pregnant women may develop gestational diabetes. It’s thought that hormones developed in the placenta interfere with the body’s insulin response. This leads to insulin resistance and high levels of glucose in the blood. Women who develop gestational diabetes during pregnancy are at higher risk for developing type 2 diabetes later in life. According to the , women that deliver a baby that weighs more than 9 pounds are also at greater risk. According to the , your risk of developing type 2 diabetes increases as you age. Your risk goes up after age 45 in particular. However, the incidence of type 2 diabetes is increasing dramatically among children, adolescents, and younger adults. Likely factors include reduced exercise, decreased muscle mass, and weight gain as you age. Type 1 diabetes is usually diagnosed by the age of 30. Excess body fat can cause insulin resistance. Fatty tissue may cause inflammation that can lead to insulin resistance. But many overweight people never develop diabetes, and more research is needed on the link between and diabetes. Poor nutrition may contribute to type 2 diabetes. A diet high in calories, fat, and cholesterol increases your body’s resistance to insulin. Exercise makes muscle tissue respond better to insulin. This is why regular aerobic exercise and resistance training can lower your diabetes risk. Talk to your doctor about an exercise plan that is safe for you. Although rare, certain hormonal conditions can also lead to diabetes. The following conditions can sometimes cause insulin resistance: : Cushing’s syndrome causes high levels of cortisol, which is the stress hormone in your blood. This raises blood glucose levels and may cause diabetes. : Acromegaly results when the body makes too much growth hormone. This can lead to excessive weight gain and diabetes if left untreated. : Hyperthyroidism occurs when the thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormone. Diabetes is one of the possible complications of this condition.

By: | Tags:          Women with diabetes have higher risk of developing heart disease than men. Millions of people are living with worldwide. The International Diabetes Federation (IDF) recorded approximately 463 million adults (20-79 years) with diabetes in 2019 and predcited that the number will rise to 700 million by 2045. According to the IDF Diabetes Atlas Ninth edition 2019, 79% of adults with diabetes were living in low- and middle-income countries.

Also Read - Almost 30% of recovered COVID-19 patients develop complications within 5 months, over 12% die Type 1 diabetes, also known as insulin-dependent diabetes, occurs when the pancreas produces little or no insulin – a hormone needed to allow sugar (glucose) to enter cells to produce energy. In , a person still produces insulin, but the body does not use it efficiently. This is called insulin resistance. Men, especially at ages of 35-54, are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes than women. Also Read - Diabetes: Epigenetic changes precede onset of the disease A study from the University of Glasgow in Scotland suggested that men may be “biologically more susceptible” to the condition. Being , and storing fat in the abdomen are known to increase the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. The University of Glasgow researchers said that men require less weight gain than women to develop the condition. Fat distribution is a possible explanation to the men’s tendency to develop diabetes at lower BMI levels. Typically, women store more fat subcutaneously (under the skin) in areas such as the hips and thighs, but men tend to store more of their fat in the abdomen, they noted. In addition to higher BMI, a variety of factors can increase the risk of developing Type 2, such as age, race, family history, and a personal history of gestational diabetes or prediabetes. Some studies have suggested that lower testosterone levels can increase risk of type 2 diabetes in men by increasing deposition. And it is estimated that 1/6th of all males have low testosterone. Women with diabetes face more serious consequences Globally, diabetes kills more women than men. This is mainly because women with diabetes have higher risk of developing than men. Usually, women with diabetes are more likely than men with the disease to have poor blood glucose control, be obese, and have high blood pressure and unhealthy cholesterol levels. Thus, women with diabetes are more likely to develop heart disease than men with diabetes. A 2007 study published in the European Heart Journal found that heart disease is more deadly in women with diabetes than it is in men with the disease. A Finnish study also revealed that heart attacks are more often fatal for women with diabetes than they are for men with the disease. Over time, poorly controlled diabetes can lead to and this complication is also worse for women than men. Women also have a much greater chance of developing depression related to diabetes. Menopause further adds to the woes of women with diabetes. Diabetes coupled with the change in hormones can lead to further increase in blood glucose, weight gain and exacerbate previous health issues. All this makes diabetes far more life-threatening for women as compared to men.

Whereas the risk for type 1 diabetes reduces after 7 years. The prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and is increasing worldwide. A number of studies have shown that women with GDM are at high risk of developing diabetes later in life. In this latest study, out of Finland, researchers worked with 391 women who delivered a baby between 1984 and 1994. This included 363 women who were diagnosed with gestational diabetes through an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and 28 who were treated with insulin. The women were matched by age, parity and date of delivery with a control group. The women were asked to participate in a questionnaire in 1995 and 1996, between 1 and 11 years after their pregnancy. The questions included details about their GDM treatment, pre-pregnancy weight and height, progression to diabetes, time of diagnosis and medication. A follow-up questionnaire was conducted  in 2012 and 2013, when a total of 297 women with gestational diabetes and 297 matched controls participated. In the follow-up period, more than half of the women in the gestational diabetes group went on to develop either type 1 (5.7%) or type 2 (50.4%) diabetes. All the diagnoses occurred within 7 years of pregnancy, whereas type 2 diabetes diagnoses increased through the end of the study. A period of 20 years. Only 5.5% of women in the control group developed type 2 diabetes, and none developed type 1 diabetes. For the women who developed type 1 diabetes, the most predictive OGTT marker was a 2-hour glucose value at 11.9 mmol/L, which showed a sensitivity of 76.5% and specificity of 96%. For type 2 diabetes, the most predictive OGTT value was a fasting glucose at a level of 5.1 mmol/L, which showed a sensitivity of 63.5% and specificity of 68.2%. Researchers analyzed a subgroup of 48 women from the gestational diabetes cohort who had a fasting glucose of 7 mmol/L or higher or a 2-hour glucose of 11.1 mmol/L or higher during pregnancy Of these women, 46% developed type 2 diabetes and 27% developed type 1 diabetes. Participants who received therapy for their GDM diabetes had greater odds of receiving a diagnosis of type 1 or type 2 diabetes than those who did not receive insulin. For women  who were diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, only 1.2% did not have insulin therapy for their gestational diabetes. The sensitivity of insulin therapy to predict type 1 diabetes was 90.5% and for type 2 diabetes was 56.9%. The time to a diabetes diagnosis was also longer for women who were not treated with insulin. The researchers said that women with gestational diabetes, especially those on insulin treatment, should be carefully monitored for the first decade after the pregnancy, after which the risk for type 1 diabetes becomes negligible. However, the risk for type 2 diabetes remained and warranted an individualized, lifelong follow-up.

7c84bfa9-0b85-4dcc-9831-93dc21ab2f8c,"Blood pressure and weight put young at risk of type 2 Blood pressure and weight put young at risk of type 2 Wednesday, 27 May 2020 A from the Universities of Glasgow and Manchester, which examined known risk factors for heart disease between people with and without at similar ages found that younger people diagnosed with diabetes have a greater difference in weight relative to people without the condition. The difference in weight between those with and without was most marked for white people, especially women. The same was also true for blood pressure: young, white people had a higher difference in blood pressure when diagnosed with type 2 diabetes when measured against those without the condition. While the work confirmed the same patterns were seen in South Asian and Black people, these groups tended to develop type 2 diabetes at much lower BMIs, with less difference in weight between those who did and did. Similar, though less marked patterns by age were seen for blood fat levels. Previous studies have shown that there is a greater loss of life from type 2 diabetes in White people, and the researchers believe these findings may help to explain why. Overall the researchers found that the difference in weight for individuals with and without type 2 diabetes was 20kg, between the ages of 20 and 39 years old. While for those diagnosed over 80 years old, the weight difference was only 5kg. Similarly, the difference in blood pressure was highest in the younger age bracket for those who were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. There was no difference in blood pressure for those with or without type 2 diabetes at over 80 years old. People who develop diabetes at a younger age develop more over their lifetime, and die younger than people who develop diabetes much later in life. However scientists still don’t fully understand why this is case. Researchers say these findings may explain why younger onset of type 2 diabetes could be more damaging to some individuals, as they develop it on top of other health risk factors. Professor Naveed Sattar of the University of Glasgow, who led the study, said: “Our findings could help explain why younger diabetes onset is more damaging, and offer important insights into different groups for the development of type 2 diabetes. “They also suggest a need for greater healthcare emphasis on diabetes and heart disease management in young people developing diabetes, regardless of their sex or ethnicity.” Prof Martin K Rutter of The University of Manchester, and Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust, who col-led the study, said, “Our work also helps to understand why there may be a greater loss of life from type 2 diabetes in White people as we noted that risk factors differences between those with and without diabetes, across nearly all ages, were less in South Asians and Black people compared to White people “Our study also further illustrates how South Asians and Black people are more sensitive to the adverse metabolic effects of weight gain than Whites. These findings may hold some relevance to the current findings where people with diabetes, and of specific ethnicities, are at greater risk for severe outcomes.” The researchers used the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink to identify 187,601 people with type 2 diabetes diagnosed between 1998–2015 in England. The study compared their weight and blood pressure at diagnosis with age-matched people without diabetes, by sex and ethnic group.

0ad0f4f2-95b8-4f2e-a811-2379e94cdb06,"Friday, 13 December 2019 Does your height impact your likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes? According to a study published in the journal shorter people are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes. Tall people might be at greater risk of developing cancer, but short people have their own risks, according to the research. Researchers looked at more than 2,500 middle-aged men and women in Germany from a pool of about 26,000 people. After adjusting for age, lifestyle, education and waist circumference, researchers found that greater height was associated with a lower risk for diabetes. The team evaluated height by taking into account both sitting height and leg length. The heights ranged from under 169.7cm (5’6”) to above 180.3cm (5’11”) for men and under 157.8cm (5’2”) to above 168.1cm (5’6”) for women. It found that, for both men and women, the risk of diabetes was lower by more than 30 per cent for each 10cm difference in height. Part of the association between greater height and a lower risk for diabetes may come from the associations between greater height and lower liver fat content and other diabetes risk factors, like blood lipids, said Matthias Schulze, one of the researchers. The study also argues that shorter people should be monitored for diabetes and risk factors related to . Because liver fat contributes so much to the higher risk in shorter individuals, reducing liver fat may provide a way to reduce the risk of diabetes. Gail Melkus, associate dean for research in NYU’s Rory Meyers College of Nursing and a diabetes researcher, called the study “a piece of the pie” in researching diabetes. Professor Melkus is unaffiliated with the study. “I think that the conclusions have to be cautiously interpreted because it’s a secondary data analysis, meaning they didn’t get a group of people and follow them going forward,” she said. She said the study poses an interesting question: Should short stature be another risk factor for screening for type 2 diabetes, along with family history or obesity? More research needs to be done to determine the answer. Still, she said short people shouldn’t automatically think they’re destined for diabetes, nor should tall people think they’re safe and sound, especially when other risk factors apply to them. “It’s not just one risk factor that we need to consider when screening people for any health condition,” she said.

Type 2 diabetes is a disease that develops when the body's tissues cannot use insulin properly. Over time, the cannot make enough . Insulin is a hormone that helps the body's cells use sugar (glucose) for energy. It also helps the body store extra energy in muscle, fat, and liver cells. Without insulin, the sugar cannot get into the cells to do its work. It stays in the blood instead. This can cause high blood sugar levels. A person has diabetes when the blood sugar stays too high too much of the time. High blood sugar can cause problems with the eyes, heart, blood vessels, nerves, and kidneys. High blood sugar also makes a person more likely to get serious illnesses or infections. In the past, doctors believed that type 2 diabetes was an adult disease and that type 1 diabetes was a children's disease. Now, more and more children are getting type 2 diabetes. Finding out that your child has diabetes can be scary. But your child can live a long, healthy life by learning to manage the disease. Doctors do not know exactly what causes diabetes. Experts believe the main risks for children getting type 2 diabetes are being overweight, not being physically active, and having a family history of the disease. Also, the hormones released during the early teen years make it harder than usual for the body to use insulin correctly. This problem is called insulin resistance. It can lead to diabetes. Most children with type 2 diabetes do not have symptoms when the disease is first found. If there are symptoms, they usually are mild and may include: A simple blood test is usually all that is needed to diagnose diabetes. Your child's doctor may do other blood tests if it is not clear whether your child has type 1 or type 2 diabetes. A doctor may test your child for diabetes if he or she is overweight, gets little physical activity, or has other risk factors for the disease. A risk factor is anything that increases your chances of having a disease. Some children are diagnosed with type 2 diabetes when they have a blood or urine test for some other reason. The key to treating diabetes is to keep your child's blood sugar levels within a target range. To do this: Keep track of your child's blood sugar levels. This will help you and your child learn how different foods and activities affect his or her blood sugar. Your doctor can teach you and your child how to do this. Teach your child to make healthy food choices. Help your child to eat about the same amount of at each meal. This helps keep your child's blood sugar steady. Carbohydrates affect blood sugar more than other nutrients. It is found in sugar and sweets, grains, fruit, starchy vegetables, and milk and yogurt. Talk to your doctor, a diabetes educator, or a dietitian about an eating plan that will work for your child. There are many ways to manage how much and when your child eats. Help your child stay active. Your child does not have to start a strict exercise program, but being more active can help control blood sugar. For example, your child could play outside with friends, take walks with family members, or take part in sports. Set a good example. It will be easier for your child if the rest of the family also eats well and gets regular exercise. This may also reduce the risk that other family members will get the disease. If your child needs medicine for diabetes, make sure that he or she takes it as prescribed. You play a major role in helping your child take charge of his or her diabetes care. Let your child do as much of the care as possible. At the same time, give your child the support and guidance he or she needs. The longer a person has diabetes, the more likely he or she is to have problems, such as diseases of the eyes, heart, blood vessels, nerves, and kidneys. But if your child can control his or her blood sugar levels every day, it may help to delay the start of or prevent some of these problems later on. Even when you are careful and do all the right things, your child can have problems with high or low blood sugar. It is important to know what signs to look for and what to do if this happens. Helping your child stay at a healthy weight and get regular exercise can help prevent type 2 diabetes. Health Tools help you make wise health decisions or take action to improve your health. Decision Points focus on key medical care decisions that are important to many health problems. Actionsets are designed to help people take an active role in managing a health condition.

The exact cause of type 2 diabetes is not known. But experts believe the disease develops in children the same way it does in adults. The body cannot correctly use the hormone insulin that is available. This is called insulin resistance. Over time, the does not produce enough of the hormone . Things that affect the body's resistance to insulin in childhood include: Developmental stage. Growth hormone released during puberty can make it harder than usual for the body to use insulin correctly. Being female. Girls seem to develop more resistance to insulin than boys. Race. Hispanic, African-American, Native American, Asian-American, or Pacific Island ancestry raises risk for type 2 diabetes. Body composition. Insulin resistance increases as the amount of increases. Activity. Exercise may improve how the body's cells use insulin and get the sugar they need. Children often have no symptoms of type 2 diabetes before they are diagnosed, because their blood sugar level has been rising so slowly. As a result, a child may have diabetes for several months or years before being diagnosed. When children do have symptoms, the most common include: Slight increase in the frequency of urination. Your child may have started wetting the bed at night. Frequent infections and slow-healing wounds or sores. Type 2 diabetes usually develops in adulthood, but the number of children being diagnosed with the disease is rising. Children with type 2 diabetes are usually diagnosed during the early teen years. During this time, their bodies are growing and developing rapidly, placing a demand on the to produce additional . The hormones released during puberty can make it harder than usual for the body to use insulin correctly (). Also, children with type 2 diabetes are usually overweight, which also contributes to insulin resistance. If the pancreas cannot produce enough insulin to overcome the resistance, diabetes can develop. Diabetes experts believe the disease progresses as it does in adults. The main risk factors for are the length of time a person has diabetes and the degree of blood sugar control. A child who develops type 2 diabetes may have an increased risk of complications, because he or she will have the disease for a long time. Some complications that children and teens may develop include: Eye disease () and kidney disease (). or , which increases the risk of heart and blood vessel disease later in life. If a child's blood sugar levels remain high for a long time, he or she may grow at an abnormal rate—faster than normal for a while, then slower than normal later. If blood sugar levels stay high during puberty, normal changes and the start of menstruation may be delayed. The way to prevent complications is to always keep blood sugar levels in a . This requires that your child follow his or her treatment plan daily and monitor blood sugar levels often. Your child also will need ongoing diabetes education and regular checkups. Other medical conditions, such as high blood pressure and high cholesterol, need adequate medical care also, because they raise the risk for diabetes complications. Children with type 2 diabetes have to modify their lifestyles. Your child will be more successful if your whole family is involved. These lifestyle changes benefit everyone by reducing the risk for diabetes and heart disease. The major risk factors for type 2 diabetes in children include: Having a parent, sister, or brother with the disease. Race. African-American, Hispanic, Native American, Asian-American, and Pacific Islander children are at greater risk for type 2 diabetes than white American children. The child's mother having diabetes that developed during pregnancy (gestational diabetes). The child being small for at birth. Medical conditions that contribute to the risk of complications in adolescence and beyond include: Fatty liver, in which fat is deposited in the liver. , in which breathing stops briefly during sleep. Teens who have diabetes and smoke have a higher risk of complications from diabetes than do those who do not smoke. if your child: Has symptoms of , such as: Less common in type 2 diabetes is , which has symptoms similar to those of hyperosmolar state. But DKA is still possible and very dangerous. Has passed out (lost consciousness) or has suddenly become very sleepy or confused. (Your child may have very low blood sugar, called .) Is sick and has blood sugar that cannot be controlled. Has been vomiting or has had diarrhea for more than 6 hours. Has blood sugar that stays higher than the level the doctor has set for your child, for example, 240 mg/dL for two or more readings. Has blood sugar that stays lower than the level the doctor has set for your child, for example, 70 mg/dL for two or more readings. Has symptoms of low blood sugar, such as: Often has problems with high or low blood sugar levels. Has trouble knowing when his or her blood sugar is low (). Or you have questions or want to know more about diabetes. Watchful waiting is a period of time during which you and your doctor observe your child's symptoms or condition without using medical treatment. Watchful waiting is appropriate if: You think your child may have symptoms of type 2 diabetes. A simple blood test is all that is needed to determine whether your child has the disease. Your child is overweight and gets little or no exercise. He or she is at risk for diabetes. Early detection and treatment for type 2 diabetes can prevent or delay complications from the disease. You have been told that your child has prediabetes. This condition can lead to type 2 diabetes. If your child eats a healthy diet and exercises regularly, he or she may not develop diabetes. Most doctors can diagnose diabetes. After your child has been diagnosed, your doctor will work with you to build a treatment plan that fits your child's needs. Health professionals who may be involved in the treatment of children with type 2 diabetes include: A , , or . A . A CDE is a registered nurse, dietitian, doctor, pharmacist, or other health professional who has special training and experience in caring for people with diabetes. A , to help build a daily meal plan for your child and your family. A , to help with emotional or family issues that might affect treatment. An exercise specialist, to help your child and family plan a program of regular physical activity. Many children have no symptoms before they are diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. If a doctor suspects that your child may have type 2 diabetes, he or she will do a medical history, physical exam, and blood glucose testing. If the results of these tests meet the established by the American Diabetes Association (ADA), your child has diabetes. If it is hard to tell whether your child has type 2 or type 1 diabetes, your doctor may do a or test for autoantibodies. (Autoantibodies are produced when the body's does not work right. These tests can help diagnose type 1 diabetes.) Another form of diabetes, maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY), is an inherited disease caused by a change (mutation) in a gene. There are many types of MODY depending on the gene that is affected. Genetic testing can help you and your doctor decide how to treat MODY. Because your child is at risk for diabetes complications (eye, heart, kidney, nerve, liver, and blood vessel problems), he or she needs to see a doctor regularly for . If your child is overweight and gets little or no exercise, he or she may be at . Early detection and treatment for type 2 diabetes can prevent or delay problems from the disease. Treatment of type 2 diabetes in children focuses on keeping blood sugar levels within a . Children may need higher blood sugar goals than adults, because their bodies are still developing. Also, they may not be able to recognize symptoms of . To reach his or her target blood sugar, your child needs to eat healthy meals of appropriate portion size and get daily exercise. Treatment also may include medicine. A healthy diet with the right amount of calories will help your child achieve target blood sugar levels and maintain a healthy weight. The meal plan designed for your child will spread (starches and sugary foods) throughout the day. This helps prevent high blood sugar after meals as well as . A registered dietitian can design a meal plan that not only fits your child's needs but also is a healthy eating plan for your family. For more information, see the topic . If your child is overweight, he or she may need to lose weight (or stay at the same weight and not gain more). This depends on his or her age, development, and other risk factors. Physical activity is extremely important. It helps the body use insulin correctly and helps control weight. Your child does not have to start a rigorous exercise program, but being more active can help control blood sugar. For example, your child could play outside with friends, take brisk walks with family members, and take part in individual or team sports. Experts recommend that teens and children (starting at age 6) do moderate to vigorous activity at least 1 hour every day. And 3 or more days a week, what they choose to do should: Make them breathe harder and make the heart beat much faster. Make their muscles stronger. For example, they could play on playground equipment, play tug-of-war, lift weights, or use resistance bands. Make their bones stronger. For example, they could run, do hopscotch, jump rope, or play basketball or tennis. It's okay for them to be active in smaller blocks of time that add up to 1 hour or more each day. Limit your child's screen time. Have your child take breaks from computer, cell phone, and TV use and be active instead. Your child may need medicines if eating healthy meals and getting regular physical activity have not lowered your child's blood sugar to his or her target level. Medicines for diabetes help the body produce more insulin, decrease the body's , or slow the absorption of carbohydrates from the intestine. Your child may need one medicine at some times and more than one at other times. Some children need daily shots—alone or with other medicines. Even if your doctor does not prescribe daily insulin, your child may need to take insulin temporarily when first diagnosed or during illness or surgery. If the progression of diabetes cannot be stopped, your child eventually may need to take insulin daily. Checking blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol Your child's blood sugar level may need to be checked regularly, for example, before breakfast and 2 hours after meals. If your child has high blood pressure or high cholesterol, those conditions need to be treated. High blood pressure is usually treated with or , because these medicines also protect the circulatory system and the kidneys from damage caused by diabetes. Sexually active teens should be warned that ACE inhibitors and ARBs should not be taken during pregnancy. Weight loss and well-controlled blood sugar can help lower your child's cholesterol. Your child's doctor may recommend medicine if these lifestyle changes do not lower cholesterol. Sexually active teens should be warned against becoming pregnant while taking these medicines. Some children have very high blood sugar levels when they are diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. A child with a very high blood sugar level may develop the serious chemical imbalance and need to be treated with insulin in a hospital. After blood sugar returns to a target level, the child usually no longer needs insulin. His or her own body may start making enough insulin again. Treating diabetes with medicine increases the risk for episodes. Your child's doctor will determine the target range for your child's blood sugar that will prevent damage from diabetes while causing as few low blood sugar episodes as possible. The lifestyle changes needed to control diabetes can be especially hard for a child or teen. Your child will have a better chance of being successful if the whole family is involved. Eating a healthy diet and getting regular exercise may help other family members avoid diabetes. Healthy Eating: Helping Your Child Learn Healthy Eating Habits Teens who have or an may have difficulty keeping their blood sugar at a healthy level. Also, teens who smoke or use alcohol or other drugs have problems with blood sugar control. Support groups may help teens deal with diabetes management issues, which can improve the teens' perception of diabetes care and blood sugar control. Healthy meals, physical activity, and weight control can help prevent diabetes or can prevent or delay complications if your child has diabetes. A registered dietitian can help you build a healthy meal plan for your child. Your doctor, exercise specialist, or certified diabetes educator also can help your child find ways to become more physically active. Weight loss is appropriate and he or she has reached adult height. In some severe cases, weight loss before your child reaches his or her full adult height may be needed. See the Having a blood sugar level that is higher than normal but not yet at the level of diabetes () increases a child's risk for type 2 diabetes. If your child has prediabetes, eating a healthy diet and increasing physical exercise may make his or her blood sugar return to a normal range and possibly prevent type 2 diabetes. Your child will still need to see a doctor regularly to check for signs of the disease. Healthy Eating: Helping Your Child Learn Healthy Eating Habits Your child needs to eat healthy meals with appropriate portions to support growth and prevent weight gain. The meal plan for your child will also spread throughout the day to prevent high blood sugar after meals. For information on healthy eating and weight management, see the topic . Healthy Eating: Helping Your Child Learn Healthy Eating Habits Encourage your child (age 6 to 17) to do moderate to vigorous activity at least 1 hour every day. Limit the amount of time your child watches TV and uses the computer and cell phone. You can help your by looking for ways to make activity more fun and by being active along with your child. For children age 2 to 5 years: The American Academy of Pediatrics advises parents to limit screen time to 1 hour a day or less. And it's best for children younger than 2 to not watch TV, watch movies, or play games on a screen. Work with your child's teachers and school to make a plan to handle your child's special needs, including testing blood sugar and eating snacks when needed. Diabetes in Children: Preparing a Care Plan for School Your child can take part in the same activities as other children. For safety: Let the coach know that your child has diabetes. If your child doesn't take insulin, he or she may not be at risk for low blood sugar episodes. But making sure that the coach knows the may still be a good idea. Take your child's to sports practice sessions and games. Check his or her blood sugar level before and after each activity, if needed. Take a to all practice sessions and games in case of a low blood sugar episode. You and your child will need to monitor his or her blood sugar frequently to know how well it is under control. Talk with your doctor about a target range for your child. Young children may need a higher blood sugar goal than adults because of growth needs and to prevent very low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). As your child grows older, the goal can be lowered so that it is closer to the recommended . Diabetes in Children: Checking Blood Sugar in a Child Your child may not need to take insulin if his or her blood sugar levels are staying within a target range with meal planning, exercise, and possibly other medicine. But at some point your child may need to take insulin because the may produce less and less insulin. If your child takes insulin, you and your child need to know how to prepare and give a shot. Diabetes in Children: Giving Insulin Shots to a Child How to recognize and treat high blood sugar. Blood sugar levels that suddenly rise above a target range can lead to an emergency. How to recognize and treat low blood sugar. Your child is not likely to have a sudden drop in blood sugar level unless he or she is taking sulfonylurea or meglitinide medicines for diabetes or insulin injections and is unable to eat regular meals. Wearing at all times. In an emergency, medical identification lets people know that your child has diabetes so they can care for your child appropriately. Where to get support. Many areas of the country have support groups for children and teens with diabetes and for family members. These groups provide encouragement and suggestions that may help you and your child deal with the daily issues of diabetes care. Talk with your doctor about groups in your area. How to care for the feet. Your child needs to wear shoes that fit properly. He or she should not go barefoot outdoors if there is a risk of getting a cut or any foot injury. It's a good idea to begin the habit of inspecting your child's feet periodically or any time he or she has a foot complaint. Look for signs of injury or infection. If you notice a foot problem, even a minor one, talk with your doctor before treating it. What to do for illness. Some general may be helpful. These include checking your child's blood sugar every 4 hours during the illness and encouraging your child to drink fluids to prevent dehydration. Do not give your child any without talking with a doctor or pharmacist. Some of these medicines can affect blood sugar levels. Childhood and the teen years are a difficult time to be diagnosed with diabetes. Normal developmental changes may interfere with your child following his or her treatment. may rebel against treatment or participate in risky behavior, such as using drugs or drinking alcohol. You play a major role in helping your child become independent in his or her diabetes care. Allow your child to do as much of the care as possible. But give your child the support and guidance he or she needs. Your child will be more successful if your family is physically active and has healthy eating habits. Children in elementary school can cooperate in all tasks required for their care. By age 8, children can test their own blood sugar if they are supervised. Children in middle school or junior high school should be able to test their own blood sugar, but they may need help during low blood sugar episodes. By age 10, some children can give insulin injections if they are supervised. With appropriate supervision, teens should be able to handle their care. If the teen needs to take insulin, he or she may choose to use an instead of injections. If your teen chooses to use a pump, be sure to supervise. Medicines that may be prescribed for children with type 2 diabetes are: This is the medicine of choice for children with type 2 diabetes. It is taken as a pill. Your doctor may suggest insulin if metformin doesn't keep your child's blood sugar in the target range. Insulin can be taken as a shot (injection) or through an . Some children need daily insulin. Even if your doctor doesn't prescribe daily insulin, your child may need to take it for a while when first diagnosed or during illness or surgery. Insulin may be given as a single nighttime dose, as several smaller doses throughout the day, or both. Medicines to control blood pressure and cholesterol Some children may need medicines to lower their blood pressure and cholesterol to reduce the risk for later complications. or may be used to lower your child's blood pressure. may be used if a healthy diet and physical activity do not lower cholesterol. Sexually active teens should be warned against becoming pregnant while taking these medicines. When obesity is severe in older adolescents with type 2 diabetes, gastric bypass or other similar surgery may be considered as a last resort. For more information, see the topic . Children who have type 2 diabetes should not try to lose weight by following a fad diet or by enrolling in a quick-fix weight loss program. Most doctors recommend that children who are overweight eat a healthy diet that provides appropriate calories to prevent further weight gain. Weight loss is appropriate if your child is overweight and he or she has reached adult height. In some severe cases, weight loss before your child reaches his or her full adult height may be needed. Along with medical treatment, you may wonder if , especially dietary supplements, may help your child. There isn't enough scientific evidence to say that any dietary supplement can prevent or manage type 2 diabetes. Talk with your doctor about any complementary health practice that you would like your child to try or your child is already using. Your doctor can help you manage your child's health better if he or she knows about all of your child's health practices. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (2008).

94607467-203a-4eff-8946-4761caf36d83,"Preterm birth and risk of type 1 and type 2 diabetes: a national cohort study Preterm birth and risk of type 1 and type 2 diabetes: a national cohort study , –() Preterm birth (gestational age <37 weeks) has been associated with insulin resistance early in life. However, no large population-based studies have examined risks of type 1 and type 2 diabetes and potential sex-specific differences from childhood into adulthood. Clinicians will increasingly encounter adults who were born prematurely and will need to understand their long-term risks. We hypothesised that preterm birth is associated with increased risks of type 1 and type 2 diabetes into adulthood. A national cohort study was conducted of all 4,193,069 singletons born in Sweden during 1973–2014, who were followed up for type 1 and type 2 diabetes identified from nationwide diagnoses and pharmacy data to the end of 2015 (maximum age 43 years; median age at the end of follow-up 22.5 years). Cox regression was used to adjust for potential confounders, and co-sibling analyses assessed the influence of shared familial (genetic and/or environmental) factors. In 92.3 million person-years of follow-up, 27,512 (0.7%) and 5525 (0.1%) people were identified with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, respectively. Gestational age at birth was inversely associated with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes risk. Adjusted HRs for type 1 and type 2 diabetes at age <18 years associated with preterm birth were 1.21 (95% CI, 1.14, 1.28) and 1.26 (95% CI, 1.01, 1.58), respectively, and at age 18–43 years were 1.24 (95% CI, 1.13, 1.37) and 1.49 (95% CI, 1.31, 1.68), respectively, compared with full-term birth. The associations between preterm birth and type 2 (but not type 1) diabetes were stronger among females (e.g. at age 18–43 years, females: adjusted HR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.47, 2.09; males: 1.28; 95% CI, 1.08, 1.53;  < 0.01 for additive and multiplicative interaction). These associations were only partially explained by shared genetic or environmental factors in families. In this large national cohort, preterm birth was associated with increased risk of type 1 and type 2 diabetes from childhood into early to mid-adulthood. Preterm-born children and adults may need early preventive evaluation and long-term monitoring for diabetes. Diabetes is increasing in prevalence and now affects nearly 1 in 10 adults in the US [] and worldwide []. In addition to family history and unhealthy lifestyle factors, early life exposures have been identified as potential risk factors for the development of diabetes later in life. According to Barker’s developmental origins theory, intrauterine nutritional abnormalities may permanently alter the body’s structure and metabolism, resulting in early life programming for future development of diabetes and other cardiometabolic disorders []. Recent evidence has suggested that developmental programming on the background of preterm birth may be particularly important for future outcomes [,,]. Approximately 11% of all births worldwide [] and 10% in the US [, ] occur preterm (gestational age < 37 weeks), and >95% of preterm infants in developed countries now survive into adulthood []. As a result, large numbers of preterm survivors (e.g. >400,000/year in the US) are now reaching adulthood (age ≥18) each year. Clinicians will increasingly encounter adult patients who were born preterm and will need to understand their long-term diabetes risks to guide preventive actions and anticipatory screening across the life course. The largest prior studies of preterm birth and diabetes have focused on childhood (age <15 years) and reported increased risks of type 1 diabetes in preterm-born children [,,,,,]. A few smaller studies have also reported associations with type 2 diabetes in mid-adulthood [,,,]. However, to our knowledge, no large cohort studies have examined the risks of type 1 and type 2 diabetes and potential sex-specific differences from childhood into adulthood. Furthermore, it remains unclear whether such associations might be related to shared familial (genetic and/or environmental) factors that predispose to both preterm birth and diabetes, as opposed to direct effects of preterm birth. To address these knowledge gaps, we conducted a national cohort study of over 4 million people in Sweden. The goals of this study were to examine associations between gestational age at birth and risk of type 1 or type 2 diabetes up to age 43 years, the maximum follow-up currently possible in this large cohort, to assess whether these associations differ according to sex or fetal growth, and to explore for potential confounding by shared familial (genetic and/or environmental) factors using co-sibling analyses. The results will help inform long-term monitoring, preventive actions and timely detection and treatment of diabetes in the growing population who were born prematurely. The Swedish Birth Registry contains prenatal and birth information for nearly all births nationwide since 1973. Using this registry, we identified all 4,201,706 singleton live births in Sweden during 1973–2014. We excluded 8637 (0.2%) people who had missing information for gestational age, leaving 4,193,069 individuals (99.8% of the original cohort) for inclusion in the study. This study was approved by the ethics committee of Lund University in Sweden (No. 2010/476). Participant consent was not required as this study used only de-identified registry-based secondary data. Gestational age at birth was identified from the Swedish Birth Registry based on maternal report of last menstrual period in the 1970s and ultrasonography estimation starting in the 1980s and onward. This was analysed alternatively as a continuous variable or categorical variable with six groups: extremely preterm (22–28 weeks), very preterm (29–33 weeks), late preterm (34–36 weeks), early term (37–38 weeks), full-term (39–41 weeks, used as the reference group), and post-term (≥42 weeks). Early term birth (37–38 weeks) was examined as a separate category because it has previously been associated with increased risk of diabetes-related mortality relative to later term birth [, ]. In addition, the first three groups were combined to provide summary estimates for preterm birth. The study cohort was followed up for the earliest diagnosis of type 1 or type 2 diabetes from birth through the end of follow-up in 2015 (maximum age 43 years; median age at end of follow-up 22.5 years). Type 1 diabetes was defined based on either of the following: (1) any ICD code specific for type 1 diabetes (ICD-9: 250.X1, 250.X3; ICD-10: E10) (for ICD-9 see ; for ICD-10 see http://apps.who.int/classifications/icd10/browse/2016/en); or (2) any other ICD code for diabetes (ICD-8/9: 250; ICD-10: E11-E14) combined with insulin prescription (as described below) before age 30 years, consistent with prior epidemiological criteria []. Type 2 diabetes was defined based on ICD codes for diabetes (ICD-8/9: 250; ICD-10: E11-E14) that did not meet the additional criteria above for type 1. All ICD codes were identified from primary or secondary diagnoses in the Swedish Hospital and Outpatient Registries. The Swedish Hospital Registry was started in 1964 and initially included all hospital discharge diagnoses from the Uppsala region of southern Sweden covering 16% of the national population, but was expanded to cover nearly 80% by 1973 (i.e. the beginning of the Swedish Birth Registry and the present study’s follow-up period) and >99% by 1987 [, ]. Diagnoses in this registry have been reported to have a positive predictive value of ~99% for diabetes [, ], although to our knowledge their ability to distinguish type 1 and type 2 has not been specifically evaluated. The Swedish Outpatient Registry contains all outpatient diagnoses from specialty clinics nationwide starting in 2001. The Swedish Pharmacy Registry includes all medication prescriptions nationwide since 1 July 2005, classified according to the Anatomic Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) System. Insulin prescriptions were identified based on any medication prescription with ATC code A10A. Other perinatal and maternal characteristics that may be associated with gestational age at birth and diabetes were identified using the Swedish Birth Registry and national census data, which were linked using an anonymous personal identification number [,,]. The following were included as adjustment variables: birth year (continuous and categorical by decade), sex, birth order (1, 2, ≥3), maternal age at delivery (continuous), maternal education level (≤9, 10–12, >12 years), maternal birth country or region (Sweden, other Europe/US/Canada, Asia/Oceania, Africa, Latin America, other/unknown), maternal BMI (continuous), maternal smoking (0, 1–9, ≥10 cigarettes/day), diabetes during pregnancy (i.e. pregestational type 1 or type 2 or gestational diabetes as identified in the birth, hospital or outpatient registries; ICD-8: 250; ICD-9: 250, 648.0, 648.8; ICD-10: E10-E14, O24), preeclampsia (ICD-8: 637; ICD-9: 624.4–624.7; ICD-10: O14-O15), and other hypertensive disorders during pregnancy (ICD-8: 400–404; ICD-9: 401–405, 642.0–642.3, 642.9; ICD-10: I10-I15, O10-O11, O13, O15-O16). Maternal BMI and smoking were assessed at the beginning of prenatal care starting in 1982, and were available for 61.1% and 74.2% of participants, respectively. Data were >99% complete for all other variables. Missing data for each covariate were imputed using a standard multiple imputation procedure based on the variable’s relationship with all other covariates and the outcome []. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to compute HRs and 95% CIs for associations between gestational age at birth and incident type 1 or type 2 diabetes. These associations were examined from birth to age 43 years and in narrower age intervals (<18 or 18–43 years) among individuals living in Sweden without a prior diagnosis of the outcome at the beginning of the respective interval. The data were analysed as time-to-event with attained age as the Cox model time axis. To account for competing events that would preclude a diabetes diagnosis, individuals were censored at death as identified in the Swedish Death Registry ( = 41,485; 1.0%) or emigration as determined by absence of a Swedish residential address in census data ( = 258,834; 6.2%). Analyses were conducted both unadjusted and adjusted for covariates (as above). The proportional hazards assumption was assessed by examining log–log plots [], and was met in each model. Co-sibling analyses were performed to assess for potential confounding effects of unmeasured shared familial (genetic and/or environmental) factors among all individuals with at least one full sibling ( = 3,481,247; 83.0% of the cohort). This approach can help further elucidate whether associations observed in the primary analyses are due to direct effects of preterm birth as opposed to shared genetic or environmental factors that predispose to both preterm birth and diabetes. Relevant environmental factors within families may potentially include lifestyle exposures such as poor diet or physical inactivity. These analyses used stratified Cox regression with a separate stratum for each family as identified by the mother’s and father’s anonymous identification numbers. In the stratified Cox model, each set of siblings had its own baseline hazard function that reflects the family’s shared genetic and environmental factors, and thus associations between gestational age at birth and type 1 or type 2 diabetes were examined within families, controlling for their shared factors. In addition, these analyses were further adjusted for the same covariates as in the main analyses. For type 2 diabetes, co-sibling analyses were also performed after stratifying by sex. Potential interactions between preterm birth and sex or fetal growth were examined in relation to type 1 or type 2 diabetes risk on the additive and multiplicative scale. Additive interactions were assessed using the ‘relative excess risk due to interaction’ (RERI), which is computed for binary variables as: RERI = HR − HR − HR + 1. Multiplicative interactions were assessed using the ratio of HRs: HR/(HR × HR). A positive additive interaction is indicated if the RERI is >0, and a positive multiplicative interaction if the ratio of HRs is >1 [, ]. The following secondary analyses were also performed: (1) Associations were examined between fetal growth (small for gestational age [SGA; <10th percentile], appropriate for gestational age [AGA; 10th–90th percentile], large for gestational age [LGA; >90th percentile]) and type 1 or type 2 diabetes. (2) Type 1 and type 2 diabetes risks were explored after stratifying by spontaneous (71.4%) vs medically indicated (28.6%) preterm birth, which was systematically recorded starting in 1990 ( = 2,535,775 [60.5% of the cohort]; maximum age 26 years at end of follow-up). (3) As an alternative to multiple imputation, a sensitivity analysis was performed after restricting to participants without missing data ( = 2,561,146 [61.1% of the cohort]). All statistical tests were 2-sided and used an α-level of 0.05. All analyses were conducted using Stata version 15.1 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA). Table shows perinatal and maternal characteristics by gestational age at birth. Preterm infants were more likely than full-term infants to be male or firstborn; and their mothers were more likely to be at the extremes of age, have low education level, smoke, or have diabetes, preeclampsia or other hypertensive disorders during their pregnancy. Associations between gestational age at birth and diabetes In 92.3 million person-years of follow-up, 27,512 (0.7%) and 5525 (0.1%) individuals were identified with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, respectively. The median age at the end of follow-up was 22.5 years, and median ages at diagnosis were 14.9 years for type 1 and 29.2 years for type 2 diabetes. The type 1 incidence rate (per 100,000 person-years) was 29.80 in the overall cohort, 36.78 among those born preterm, and 28.80 among those born full-term. The corresponding incidence rates for type 2 diabetes were 5.98, 8.48 and 5.56, respectively. Gestational age at birth was inversely associated with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes risk at age <18 years (adjusted HR per additional week of gestation, type 1: 0.96; 95% CI 0.95, 0.97; type 2: 0.95; 0.93, 0.98; Table ). Adjusted HRs for type 1 and type 2 diabetes associated with preterm birth were 1.21 (95% CI, 1.14, 1.28) and 1.26 (1.01, 1.58), respectively. In contrast, children born extremely preterm had a lower risk of type 1 diabetes at age <18 years (adjusted HR, 0.51; 95% CI 0.32, 0.81) but a near-significantly higher risk of type 2 diabetes (2.21; 95% CI, 0.99, 4.95), compared with those born full-term (Table ). Gestational age at birth also was inversely associated with new-onset type 1 and type 2 diabetes at age 18–43 years (adjusted HR per additional week of gestation, type 1: 0.96; 95% CI 0.95, 0.98; type 2: 0.97; 0.95, 0.98). The corresponding HRs comparing preterm vs full-term birth were 1.24 (95% CI 1.13, 1.37) and 1.49 (1.31, 1.68), respectively. Extremely preterm birth was associated with >2-fold risks of both type 1 (adjusted HR, 2.22; 95% CI 1.41, 3.48) and type 2 (2.55; 1.41, 4.62) diabetes. Preterm birth was more strongly associated with type 2 than type 1 diabetes in adulthood ( < 0.001). Across all models, most adjusted HRs were <10% lower than unadjusted HRs (electronic supplementary material [ESM] Table ). Kaplan–Meier curves for type 1 and type 2 diabetes by gestational age group are shown in Figs. and . Significant interactions were found between preterm birth and sex in relation to type 2 but not type 1 diabetes (ESM Tables and ). Among individuals born full-term, type 2 diabetes incidence across all attained ages was slightly higher among males (5.84 per 100,000 person-years) than females (5.27). However, the opposite pattern was observed in those born preterm, with higher incidence among females (9.66) than males (7.52) (ESM Table ). Preterm birth and female sex had a positive interaction on both the additive ( = 0.002) and multiplicative ( = 0.006) scale (i.e. their combined effect on type 2 diabetes risk was greater than the sum or product of their separate effects; ESM Table ). The positive additive interaction indicates that preterm birth accounted for significantly more type 2 diabetes cases among females than males. In contrast, no interactions were found between preterm birth and sex in relation to type 1 diabetes on either the additive ( = 0.22) or multiplicative ( = 0.09) scale (ESM Table ). In sex-stratified analyses, preterm birth was associated with significantly increased risks of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes among females and males at all ages, except type 2 diabetes among males at ages <18 years (Table ). Females born preterm had ~1.3-fold risks and males had ~1.2-fold risks of type 1 diabetes both at ages <18 and 18–43 years. For type 2 diabetes, adjusted HRs at age <18 years were 1.60 (95% CI 1.18, 2.17) among females and 1.01 (0.73, 1.39) among males, and at age 18–43 years were 1.75 (1.47, 2.09) among females and 1.28 (1.08, 1.53) among males. Females born extremely preterm had >3-fold risks of type 2 diabetes both at ages <18 and 18–43 years. Figs. and show adjusted HRs for type 1 and type 2 diabetes risk, respectively, by attained age for different gestational age groups. Co-sibling analyses to control for unmeasured shared familial factors resulted in partial attenuation of most risk estimates (ESM Table ). At age <18 years, the adjusted HR for type 1 diabetes associated with preterm birth was 1.21 (95% CI 1.14, 1.28) in the primary analysis and 1.16 (1.04, 1.30) in the co-sibling analysis; the corresponding HRs for type 2 diabetes were 1.26 (1.01, 1.58) and 1.13 (0.75, 1.70; based on only 21 cases), respectively. At age 18–43 years, the adjusted HR for type 1 diabetes associated with preterm birth was 1.24 (95% CI 1.13, 1.37) in the primary analysis and 1.14 (0.92, 1.41) in the co-sibling analysis. In contrast, the corresponding HR for type 2 diabetes at age 18–43 years in the primary analysis (1.49; 95% CI 1.31, 1.68) was not attenuated in the co-sibling analysis (1.55; 1.12, 2.13). After stratifying by sex, co-sibling analyses of type 2 diabetes yielded similar results. For example, the adjusted HR at age 18–43 years comparing preterm with full-term birth was 1.50 (95% CI 0.78, 2.86) among full sisters and 1.41 (0.75, 2.64) among full brothers. In analyses of fetal growth, SGA was a strong risk factor for type 2 but not type 1 diabetes, compared with AGA (e.g. age <18 years, type 1: adjusted HR, 0.88; 95% CI 0.83, 0.93; type 2: 1.61; 1.38, 1.89; age 18–43 years, type 1: 1.17; 1.09, 1.26; type 2: 1.79; 1.65, 1.93; see ESM Table for complete results). The risk of type 2 diabetes was highest among individuals born both preterm and SGA (adjusted HR, 2.24; 95% CI 1.70, 2.96; relative to those born full-term and AGA). However, there was no evidence of interaction between preterm birth and SGA in relation to type 1 or type 2 diabetes risk on either the additive or multiplicative scale (type 1:  = 0.13 and  = 0.13; type 2:  = 0.81 and  = 0.52, respectively; ESM Tables and ). In a sensitivity analysis that was restricted to AGA births, all results were negligibly changed (e.g. preterm vs full-term, ages <18 years, type 1: adjusted HR, 1.20; 95% CI 1.12, 1.28; type 2: 1.24; 0.96, 1.60; ages 18–43 years, type 1: 1.24; 1.11, 1.39; type 2: 1.49; 1.29, 1.72). Compared with full-term birth, both spontaneous and medically indicated preterm birth were associated with increased risks of type 1 diabetes (adjusted HR, 1.22; 95% CI 1.11, 1.34; and 1.22; 1.09, 1.37, respectively;  = 0.97 for difference in HRs) and type 2 diabetes (1.41; 1.05, 1.90; and 1.45; 1.02, 2.04, respectively;  = 0.92 for difference in HRs). Restricting to participants without missing data resulted in modest changes in most risk estimates (e.g. preterm vs full-term, age <18 years, type 1 diabetes: adjusted HR, 1.22; 95% CI 1.13, 1.32; type 2 diabetes: 1.42; 1.08, 1.87; age 18–43 years, type 1: 1.07; 0.87, 1.31; type 2: 1.96; 1.48, 2.61). In this large national cohort study, preterm birth was associated with increased risks of type 1 and type 2 diabetes from childhood into early to mid-adulthood. Preterm birth was associated with approximately 1.2- and 1.3-fold risk of type 1 and type 2 diabetes, respectively, at age <18 years, and 1.2- and 1.5-fold risk, respectively, at age 18–43 years. The associations between preterm birth and type 2 (but not type 1) diabetes were significantly stronger among females. Early term birth (37–38 weeks) was also associated with modestly increased risk of type 1 and type 2 diabetes from childhood into adulthood. Co-sibling analyses suggested that these findings were only partially explained by shared genetic or environmental factors in families. Several prior studies have linked preterm birth with type 1 diabetes in childhood. A Swedish cohort study of 3.6 million children aged <15 years, who overlapped with the present cohort, reported 10–20% increased risk of type 1 diabetes among those born at 33–36 or 37–38 weeks []. However, consistent with our findings, infants born at <33 weeks had lower risk of type 1 diabetes during childhood compared with those born at term. To our knowledge, this finding remains unexplained and has not been assessed in other studies, and thus will need confirmation in other large independent cohorts. A UK cohort study of 3.8 million children aged <12 years reported 15–30% increased risk of type 1 diabetes among those born preterm or early term compared with full-term, but did not specifically examine earlier gestational ages []. An Australian cohort study of 558,633 children aged <15 years reported 1.4- and 1.2-fold risk among those born preterm or early term, respectively []. A matched cohort study in Taiwan with 37,119 preterm and 162,020 term children (mean age 8–9 years) reported 1.8- and 2.5-fold risks of type 1 and type 2 diabetes, respectively []. A Swedish cohort study of 630,090 adults aged 25–37 years found that those born preterm had modestly (10–25%) increased odds of medication prescription for diabetes, which was predominantly type 1 []. Several smaller studies have also reported associations between preterm birth and type 2 diabetes in mid-adulthood. For example, a Finnish cohort study of 12,813 adults aged >40 years reported a 1.6-fold (95% CI 1.00, 2.52) risk for those born at gestational age <35 vs 37–41 weeks []. A Swedish cohort study of 6425 adults aged 37–62 years reported that those born at <33 weeks had a 1.6-fold (95% CI 1.33, 2.11) risk of type 2 diabetes based on inpatient diagnoses []. A Scottish cohort study of 5973 adults aged 46–50 years found that preterm birth was associated with a 2-fold (95% CI 1.18, 3.53) risk of self-reported type 2 diabetes []. In the largest meta-analysis to date with ~2.2 million participants from 23 studies, the pooled ORs for association between preterm birth and type 1 or type 2 diabetes were 1.18 (95% CI 1.11, 1.25; based on 18 studies) and 1.51 (1.32, 1.72; 5 studies), respectively []. To our knowledge, no prior studies have examined gestational age at birth in relation to both type 1 and type 2 diabetes and potential sex-specific differences from childhood into adulthood. The present study addressed these gaps using nationwide diagnoses in the largest cohort to date, while controlling for multiple potential confounders. In this cohort and in other general populations, type 2 diabetes has a higher overall prevalence among men [, ]. However, we found that preterm birth was more strongly associated with type 2 diabetes and accounted for significantly more cases among women. To our knowledge, this sex-specific difference has not been previously reported and thus warrants confirmation in other well-powered studies. We found that most of the observed associations were partially explained by shared genetic or environmental factors in families. However, the association between preterm birth and type 2 diabetes in adulthood specifically appeared independent of shared familial factors. These findings may have multiple underlying mechanisms that involve pancreatic beta cell function and insulin resistance. Preterm birth interrupts the development of pancreatic beta cells, which are formed predominantly in the third trimester of pregnancy, and might permanently reduce their number or function []. The limited available evidence for beta cell mass and function after preterm birth is conflicting. For example, experimental evidence has shown that induced preterm birth in sheep resulted in a 65% reduction of beta cell mass and reduced insulin secretory capacity that persisted into adulthood []. However, limited evidence from human studies has suggested that prematurity may be associated with appropriate insulin secretion consistent with normal beta cell function in early or mid-adulthood [, ]. Preterm birth also alters immune function including T cell response [], which may potentially mediate its association with type 1 diabetes, consistent with its autoimmune aetiology []. Other contributing factors may include exposure to antenatal corticosteroids and rapid catch-up growth in infancy, leading to visceral adiposity and insulin resistance [,,]. Iatrogenic factors from intensive care, including suboptimal nutrition and adverse effects of medications or procedures, may further impair glucose metabolism []. Several studies have reported reduced insulin sensitivity in preterm-born children or adults compared with term-born controls [,,]. These associations are further modified by lifestyle factors across the life course, including diet, exercise and obesity [], which are important targets for intervention. Because of major advances in neonatal and paediatric care, most preterm infants now survive into adulthood []. As a result, clinicians will increasingly encounter adult patients who were born prematurely. Preterm birth should now be recognised as a chronic condition that predisposes to the development of diabetes across the life course. Physicians currently seldom seek birth histories from adult patients, and thus preterm birth may remain a ‘hidden’ risk factor. Medical records and history-taking in patients of all ages should routinely include birth history, including gestational age, birthweight and perinatal complications [, ,,]. Such information can help identify those born prematurely and facilitate anticipatory screening and early preventive actions, including patient counselling to promote lifestyle prevention of diabetes. A key strength of the present study was the ability to examine gestational age at birth in relation to both type 1 and type 2 diabetes in a large national cohort with follow-up into adulthood, using birth, medical and pharmacy registry data that are highly complete. This study design minimises potential selection or ascertainment biases and enables more robust risk estimates based on a national population. The large sample size enabled well-powered assessment of narrowly defined gestational age groups and sex-specific differences. The results were controlled for other perinatal and maternal factors, as well as unmeasured familial factors using co-sibling analyses. This study also had several limitations. First, laboratory data to verify diagnoses were unavailable. High positive predictive values have been reported for most chronic disorders in the Swedish registries, including diabetes (>99%) [, ]. However, to our knowledge, the validity of registry diagnoses for distinguishing type 1 and type 2 diabetes has not been evaluated. Our observed incidences were slightly lower than those previously reported based on serologic testing of autoantibodies and C-peptide to distinguish type 1 from type 2 diabetes in 1630 Swedish individuals of similar ages (e.g. type 1: 37.8 per 100,000 person-years at age 0–19 years vs 33.3 at age 0–18 years in the present study; type 2: 3.1 per 100,000 person-years at age 0–19 years vs 2.4 at age 0–18 years in the present study) []. It is possible that people born prematurely are more likely to be diagnosed with diabetes because of greater contact with the healthcare system (i.e. detection bias). However, this is most likely to affect relatively asymptomatic conditions early in life. Detection bias is less likely for type 1 diabetes because it is highly symptomatic, or in adulthood when most type 2 diabetes is diagnosed. Second, despite up to 43 years of follow-up, this was still a relatively young cohort. Additional follow-up will be needed to examine diabetes risks in older adulthood when such data become available in this or other large cohorts. Finally, this study was limited to Sweden and will need replication in other countries and diverse populations. In summary, we found that preterm and early term birth were associated with increased risk of type 1 and type 2 diabetes from childhood into early to mid-adulthood in a large population-based cohort. Children and adults who were born prematurely may need early preventive evaluation and long-term follow-up for timely detection and treatment of diabetes. Owing to ethical concerns, supporting data cannot be made openly available.

820e516b-6e80-4a4d-80c2-eb0913328803,"Almost a third of people who have diabetes do not know it. That number comes from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Additionally, most people with prediabetes[1] — a condition that puts people at increased risk of developing Type 2 diabetes[2] — don’t know they have it. So my diabetes story, which began in ignorance, was not so unusual. I had prediabetes for a long time before the complications[3] caused by high blood sugar led to a stroke. This is the reason I made a list of warning signs for Type 2 diabetes. Perhaps you or someone you love will see how important it is to get a simple blood sugar test. If this sneaky condition is caught early, you can avoid serious complications. The symptoms of Type 2 are well known but are easy to miss. Two of them are increased thirst and frequent urination. The word “diabetes” comes from the Greek word for “siphon.” If the beta cells[4] in your pancreas are working, insulin is pumping into your blood to help your body digest carbohydrates like sugar and bread and noodles. But in Type 2 diabetes (or prediabetes) your cells are resistant to insulin, which leaves much of that glucose, or simple sugar, in the bloodstream. When blood glucose levels are above 250 mg/dl, the ability of the kidneys to reabsorb fluids is blocked, leading to the release of large amounts of liquid (and sugar) into the bladder. (A urine test would show high sugar content. This is why for thousands of years, diabetes was called the “sweet urine disease.”) This process uses lots of water, leading to increased thirst. Another sign of prediabetes or Type 2 diabetes is fatigue. Since your muscle cells are resisting insulin, they are not getting fed the glucose from your blood supply. It makes you tired. The problem with using fatigue as a warning sign of diabetes, however, is this: There are many things that can cause fatigue, things like low iron levels or having a virus. The fourth warning sign is blurry vision. When blood sugar levels are high, fluid is pulled from the lenses in the eyes, affecting their ability to focus. A fifth possible sign is high blood pressure, which is known to be twice as common in people with diabetes. Some doctors in India now screen for Type 2 diabetes by checking blood sugar levels in all of their patients who have high blood pressure, which helps them find some of those hidden cases. Are you sleeping very little at night? Researchers have found a link between sleeping fewer than five hours per night and having Type 2 diabetes. This is another potential warning sign. Have you found that you have cuts and sores that heal slowly or that you frequently have infections? These are also potential signs of the high blood sugar levels common to Type 2 and prediabetes. Those are some of the top symptoms to watch for, red flags that warn you to get your blood sugar checked. But there is another list to be aware of. If you are on this list, you ought to ask your doctor for a blood sugar check — not just once, but at every visit. Ask yourself these questions: Among your close relatives, does anyone have diabetes? Genetics plays a huge role in both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, so if the answer is yes, you and your family should be screened for the condition. Are you overweight and/or sedentary? Get your blood sugar checked. Are you over 45? Your risk of having diabetes increases as you age, so get your blood sugar checked. Do you have high triglycerides[5] (a type of blood fat)? The metabolic syndrome, which raises the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes, is composed of factors such as being overweight, having a sedentary lifestyle, having high blood pressure, and having high triglycerides. Are you a woman who has a history of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)[6] or gestational diabetes[7]? Ask your doctor for a diabetes screening, because your risk of developing Type 2 diabetes is increased. Please pay attention to the warning signs. With Type 2 it is possible to bring your blood sugars into the normal range with changes in how you eat and a more active lifestyle. Those two things have also been shown to keep people with prediabetes from developing Type 2 diabetes. Although you cannot change your genetics, at the very least you can avoid serious complications that come from long-term high blood sugar. Because Type 2 diabetes can sneak up on you, it is wise to ask for a blood sugar check at your next doctor visit. The test is simple and takes only a few seconds. These are things I wish I had known before Type 2 diabetes knocked me off my feet. If you already have diabetes, you can use these facts to help your family be wiser than I was. I would love to know how you are doing. Want to learn more about diabetes symptoms?

5297e285-cc3b-4d58-8952-591b778ccd6b,"Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disorder of carbohydrate, fat, and protein metabolism characterized by fasting elevations of blood sugar (glucose) levels and a greatly increased risk of heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, retinopathy, and loss of nerve function. Diabetes can occur when the pancreas does not secrete enough insulin or if the cells of the body become resistant to insulin. Hence, the blood sugar cannot get into the cells, which then leads to serious complications. Diabetes is divided into two major categories: Type 1 and Type 2. About ten percent of all diabetics are Type 1 and about 90% are Type 2. Type 1 is associated with complete destruction of the beta-cells of the pancreas, which manufacture the hormone insulin. Type 1 patients require lifelong insulin for the control of blood sugar levels. Type 1 results from injury to the insulin-producing beta-cells, coupled with some defect in tissue regeneration capacity. In Type 1, the body’s immune system begins to attack the pancreas. Antibodies for beta-cells are present in seventy-five percent of all cases of Type 1, compared to one-half percent to two percent of non-diabetics. It is probable that the antibodies to the beta-cells develop in response to cell damage due to other mechanisms (chemical, free-radical, viral, food allergy, etc.). It appears that normal individuals either do not develop as severe an antibody reaction, or are better able to repair the damage once it occurs. Type 2 historically has had an onset after 40 years of age in overweight individuals but is today even seen in children due to the obesity epidemic present in all age groups in America as well as those exposed to high levels of POPs (persistent organic pollutants). Initially, insulin levels are typically elevated in Type 2, indicating a loss of sensitivity to insulin by the cells of the body. Obesity is a major contributing factor to this loss of insulin sensitivity. Approximately 90% of individuals categorized as having Type 2 are obese. Achieving ideal body weight in these patients is associated with restoration of normal blood glucose levels in many cases. Even if Type 2 has progressed to the point where insulin deficiency is present, weight loss nearly always results in significant improvements in blood glucose control and dramatic reductions in other health risks such as cardiovascular disease. There are other types of diabetes such as gestational diabetes – a type of diabetes that affects about 4% of all pregnant women. About 135,000 cases of gestational diabetes occur each year in the United States. Gestational diabetes occurs more frequently among African Americans, Hispanic/Latino Americans, and American Indians. It is also more common among obese women and women with a family history of diabetes. After pregnancy, 5% to 10% of women with gestational diabetes develop Type 2 and that number increases to 20% to 50% chance of developing diabetes in the 5 to 10 years after pregnancy. Prediabetes (formerly  called “impaired glucose tolerance”) is categorized by fasting glucose being 100-125 mg/dl and/or postprandial glucose of 140-199 mg/dl. It is the first step in insulin resistance and estimated to affect 57 million Americans. Many people with prediabetes will go on to develop full-blown Type 2 despite the fact that prediabetes is usually reversible and, in most cases, diabetes can be completely avoided through dietary and lifestyle changes. Factors implicated in contributing to prediabetes, insulin resistance, and the progression to Type 2 include: a diet high in refined carbohydrates, particularly high fructose corn syrup; elevated saturated fat intake; over-eating due to increased portion sizes of food; increase in inflammatory markers; lack of exercise; industrial pollution; abdominal weight gain; hormonal imbalances; inadequate sleep; and nutrient deficiencies. Research increasingly indicates that prediabetes is accompanied by serious health risks especially an increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Prediabetics often meet the criteria of the metabolic syndrome. The metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a cluster of factors that together carry a significantly greater risk for CVD and developing Type 2 that include: Two of the following: Secondary diabetes (a form of diabetes that is secondary to certain conditions and Syndromes, such as pancreatic disease, hormone disturbances, drugs, and malnutrition) Gestational diabetes (glucose intolerance that occurs during pregnancy) Impaired glucose tolerance (a condition that includes prediabetic or borderline diabetes); individuals with impaired glucose tolerance have blood glucose levels and glucose-tolerance test (GTT) results that are intermediate between normal and clearly abnormal The following criteria are used for diagnosing diabetes: Fasting (overnight): serum glucose (blood sugar) concentration greater than or equal to 126 mg/dl on at least two separate occasions Following ingestion of 75 g of glucose: serum glucose concentration greater than or equal to 200 mg/dl at two hours post-ingestion and at least one other sample during the two-hour test Although the exact cause of Type 1 diabetes is unknown, current theory suggests an autoimmune process leads to destruction of the insulin-producing beta-cells in the pancreas. Antibodies for beta-cells are present in seventy-five percent of all cases of Type 1 diabetes, compared to one-half percent to two percent of non-diabetics. The antibodies to the beta-cells appear to develop in response to cell destruction due to other mechanisms (chemical, free-radical, viral, food allergy, etc.). Approximately ninety percent of individuals with Type II diabetes are obese. Obesity is a major contributing factor to this loss of insulin sensitivity. In most cases, achieving ideal body weight is associated with restoration of normal blood sugar levels in these patients. In other words, achieving ideal body weight is often a “cure” for type 2 diabetes. Diabetes, perhaps more than any other disease, is strongly associated with Western culture and diet as it is uncommon in cultures consuming a more “primitive” diet. However, as cultures switch from their native diets to the “foods of commerce,” their rate of diabetes increases, eventually reaching the same proportions seen in Western societies. Dietary modification and treatment is fundamental to the successful treatment of both Type I and Type II diabetes. All simple, processed, and concentrated carbohydrates must be avoided. Low glycemic load foods should be stressed and saturated fats should be kept to a minimum. Since diabetics have a higher incidence of death from cardiovascular disease (60-to-70 percent, versus 20-to-25 percent in people without diabetes), the dietary recommendations given in are equally appropriate here. Weight loss, in particular a significant decrease in body-fat percentage, is a prime objective in treating the majority of Type 2 diabetics; it improves all aspects of diabetes and may result in cure. For recommendations to promote weight loss see . For both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetics, there are some specific foods that have been shown to produce positive effects on blood sugar control. These foods include olives, soybeans and other legumes, nuts, artichokes, bitter melon, garlic, Jerusalem artichokes, mangoes and onions. These foods all have a low glycemic index and glycemic load and are high in fiber. Cinnamon may also be helpful in controlling blood sugar levels. According to research, cinnamon might be acting as an insulin substitute in type 2 diabetes. A double-blind study of 60 people with type 2 diabetes revealed a significant decrease in fasting serum glucose (18-29%), triglyceride (23-30%), LDL cholesterol (7-27%), and total cholesterol (12-26%) levels after taking cinnamon for 40 days. The effective dosage was as little as 1 gram per day of cinnamon (roughly ¼ teaspoon). What nutritional supplements should I take for Diabetes Mellitus? Along with Dr. Lyon and Natural Factors, I have created the WellBetx – a family of nutritional and herbal products designed to address special nutritional needs of people with diabetes. The WellBetX products are designed to be used in conjunction with proper dietary, lifestyle, and medical treatment of diabetes. WellBetX is not designed to “treat” diabetes, instead it is designed to support the proper utilization of blood glucose and insulin as well as deal with some of the nutritional challenges and deficiencies that many diabetics suffer from. The various WellBetX products are designed to impact one or all of the following goals: Reduce after meal elevations in blood sugar levels. The WellBetX product line consists of the following formulas: – A proprietary fiber blend with remarkable properties in supporting blood sugar control along with a special extract of mulberry leaves. – A delicious way to improve blood sugar levels and promoting satiety. – a high potency formula that provides optimal levels of nutrients to support people with diabetes. – A unique formula of herbal extracts with scientific support for their role in promoting human health. – An alkaloid from goldenseal, barberry bark, and Oregon grape root has shown impressive results in supporting blood sugar control, blood pressure, and blood lipid levels. – A pharmaceutical grade fish oil with the added benefits of GLA from borage oil. If you have diabetes and utilize nutritional and herbal support, you must monitor blood sugar levels, especially if you are on insulin or have relatively uncontrolled diabetes. Typically insulin and drug dosages will have to be altered after employing natural medicines. Under no circumstances should a person suddenly stop taking insulin or oral diabetic drugs without consulting their physician. It is important to monitor blood sugar levels because poor blood sugar control dramatically risk of developing the complications of diabetes. The availability of home glucose monitoring kits makes it easier now than in the past to monitor blood sugar levels, resulting in a major improvement in the care of diabetes. Another major improvement is the measurement of the level of glycosylated hemoglobin (HgbA1c), which allows monitoring of blood sugar levels over a long period of time. I recommend periodic measurement-every three months in poorly controlled diabetes, and every year in well-controlled cases. If a diabetic can keep their HgbA1c between 6 and 7%, the risk for developing any complication of diabetes is dramatically reduced. “Dr. Murray, I know that you are very busy and may not remember talking to me when you came to Houston and talked about your book and research on preventing and treating diabetes. You saved my life that night. I was very ill with Type II diabetes and the medication did not work and I could feel my life was slipping away. I was helpless to do anything until I met you. You gave me hope and helped me to believe that my life could continue and indeed it has. I went immediately and bought the Welbetx and began using it as you told me to that night. On the second day, I came back from my illness! I began to feel well again and I had energy and my sugar began to drop. Today I am 52 pounds lighter, I no longer have diabetes and am off medications and just doing your program and eating correctly and exercising three times a week. I have gone from a size 3XXX to a size Large. My pants have gone from a 48 to size 40. I weighed 268 and now weigh 216. I am well and fit and owe it to you and to the products that you developed. I wish I could do more to thank you for you saved my life. My wife and children are grateful to you too. You make a difference in peoples lives and I know that you saved my life. God Bless You and Your Work and Natural Factors. JG.” “Dr. Murray, the simple words Thank You! cannot begin to encompass the Gratitude I feel, the Hope you have restored to me, and the reality of significantly improved health that I thought may never happen. I have been morbidly obese and continually gained weight for the last twenty years. I have tried various diets during this time only to experience failure and even more weight gain. . . . In March 2004, within a few days of starting the WellBetXT products, the hypoglycemic episodes I would experience even before I got hungry started to level out which allowed me to more comfortably make better food choices. Within three weeks my blood sugar swings completely normalized. What was even more impressive was the PGXT and how it controlled my appetite, for the first time in years I found myself not hungry. I also started using the WellBetXT with PGXT meal replacement shakes for breakfast. Three months later on a follow up visit to my Physician, he came in the room with a smile on his face and showed me my blood test results. WOW! In 90 days my fasting insulin level had dropped from 35.1 to 19.0. It was now well within the normal range along with my fasting glucose levels and . . . that was not all; I had also lost 22 pounds and 23-1/2 inches. I had never had that kind of weight loss before, and yet I was still rarely hungry and I was feeling much better. . . Thank you, LA” On the show I discussed the failure of conventional medicine to address the underlying issues in many health conditions offering little more than drugs as biochemical “band aids.” Glaucoma most often refers to the vision loss caused by increased intraocular pressure (IOP) as a result of greater production than outflow of the fluid of the eye (the aqueous humor). The normal intraocular pressure is about 10 to 21 mm Hg. In chronic glaucoma, the intraocular pressure is usually mildly to moderately elevated (22 to 40 mm Hg). In acute glaucoma, the intraocular pressure is greater than 40 mm Hg. Acute glaucoma is a medical emergency, fortunately it is the rarest form of glaucoma. Chronic open-angle type glaucoma is by far the most common form. It accounts for about 70-75% of the approximately 3 million people in the United States who have glaucoma. In some cases glaucoma develops in people with normal IOP. Referred to as low-tension glaucoma or normotensive glaucoma (NTG), this form accounts for approximately 25 to 30 percent of all glaucoma cases in the United States. NTG is more common in women than in men and affects adults averaging 60 years old. A common risk factor for NTG is low blood pressure. Since many patients with glaucoma have no symptoms, it is important that regular eye exams be included in their annual checkup after the age of sixty. Glaucoma is a serious condition that requires strict attention. Since patients with the early stages of chronic glaucoma rarely have symptoms, it is important that regular eye exams be included in their annual checkup after the age of sixty. Chronic glaucoma can result in the gradual loss of peripheral vision resulting in tunnel vision. Typical signs and symptoms of acute glaucoma include extreme pain, blurring of vision, reddened eyes, and a fixed and dilated pupil. Acute glaucoma is a medical emergency. If you are showing any signs of glaucoma, consult an ophthalmologist immediately. Unless adequately treated within twelve to forty-eight hours, an individual with acute glaucoma will become permanently blind within two to five days. The cause of glaucoma appears to be an abnormality in the composition of the supportive structures of the eye. Specifically, structural changes reflecting poor collagen integrity and function are the hallmark features of glaucoma. These changes lead to blockage in the flow of the aqueous humor and result in elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) readings. For chronic glaucoma, a generally healthful diet is recommended, with a focus on foods high in vitamin C and flavonoids, such as fresh fruits and vegetables. In addition, regular consumption of cold-water fish (e.g., salmon, mackerel, herring, and halibut) is also encouraged due to their high content of omega-3 fatty acids. Animal studies have shown that an increased consumption of omega-3 fatty acids can lower IOP. Chronic glaucoma has been successfully treated by eliminating allergies. In one study, of the 113 patients exposed to a food or environmental allergen demonstrated an immediate rise in IOP of up to 20 mm, in addition to other typical allergic symptoms. To treat glaucoma by eliminating food allergens, follow the guidelines given in FOOD ALLERGIES. What nutritional supplements should I take for GLAUCOMA? High potency multiple vitamin and mineral formula; Vitamin D3 2,000-5,000 IU/day; Fish oil, EPA+DHA 1,000 to 3,000 mg/day. is necessary for proper collagen integrity. Vitamin C supplementation has been shown to lower IOP levels of glaucoma patients in many clinical studies. Although some people respond to as little as 2 grams per day, others may respond only to extremely high doses (35 grams per day). Abdominal discomfort is common when using high doses, but usually tapers off after three to four days. The ability of vitamin C to reduce the IOP lasts only as long as supplementation is continued. contains flavonoids that enhance the effects of vitamin C and stabilize the collagen matrix. The citrus bioflavonoid rutin has also been demonstrated to lower IOP when used as an adjunct in patients who are unresponsive to glaucoma medications alone. Grapeseed extract is a better choice. supplementation lowers IOP in a fashion similar to that of popular drugs used in the treatment of glaucoma. Magnesium works just like the drugs by blocking the entry of calcium to produce relaxation of the arteries. In fact, magnesium has been referred to as “nature’s calcium-channel blocker.” Magnesium supplementation improves the peripheral circulation and seems to have a beneficial effect on the visual field in patients with glaucoma. shows promise in the treatment of glaucoma. In one study of patients with severe chronic glaucoma, although the improvements in IOP were mild, given the poor prognosis for these patients the results were deemed relevant. The recommended dosage of ginkgo extract (24% ginkgo flavonglycosides) is 160 to 240 mg daily. Periodic re-examination by your physician to measure intraocular pressure is important. If the recommendations above are working there should be a gradual improvement in visual function and a normalization of IOP.   For more information, please see the completely revised and updated 3 edition of PQQ may be the perfect answer to preventing or reversing age-related mental decline. kiwiPQQ (short for pyrroloquinoline quinone) is a vitamin-like compound found in plant foods that shows a wide range of benefits for brain function and energy production. Learn more about PQQ with the following Q&A. What Exactly Does PQQ Do? PQQ is an extremely potent antioxidant that is able to carry out the role of an antioxidant in the body more than 20,000 times—which is a rare thing. For example, other antioxidants, such as vitamin C, are only able to accomplish this “cycling” process about four times. Are There Any Food Sources of PQQ? PQQ has been found in all plant foods analyzed to date. Particularly PPQ-rich foods include parsley, green peppers, kiwi, papaya, and tofu. These foods contain 2–3 mcg of PQQ per 100 grams. Green tea provides about the same amount per 4-oz. serving. While these amounts appear to be sufficient in helping our cells carry out their basic functions, research indicates that boosting PQQ through supplementation can produce some amazing effects.

In the present study, we aimed to develop such risk scores, based on simple clinical variables. We studied a population-based cohort of 73,987 adults, aged 18 years and over. After 5.35 ± 1.59 years of follow-up, 4,726 participants (9.58%) in the exploration cohort developed type 2 diabetes and 2,327 participants (9.44%) in the validation cohort developed type 2 diabetes. Age, gender, body mass index, family history of diabetes, education, blood pressure, and resting heart rate were selected to form the concise score with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.67. The variables in the concise score combined with fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and triglyceride (TG) or use of lipid-lowering drugs constituted the accurate score with an AUC value of 0.77. The utility of the two scores was confirmed in the validation cohort with AUCs of 0.66 and 0.77, respectively. In summary, the concise score, based on non-laboratory variables, could be used to identify individuals at high risk of developing diabetes within Chinese population; the accurate score, which also uses FPG and TG data, is better at identifying such individuals. According to the second Global Status Report on Noncommunicable Diseases 2014 released by the World Health Organization, the prevalence of diabetes in adults aged 18 years and over in China is estimated to be 9.5%. The actual number of patients with diabetes in China is therefore a shocking figure because of the country’s large population. The financial costs of diabetes-related health expenditures also weigh heavily on the nation’s economy. Thus, reducing diabetes-related morbidity in China is an important issue. Type 2 diabetes can be prevented and delayed in high-risk individuals by modifying their lifestyle. However, the inconvenience and relatively high cost of the 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), which is generally used to identify high-risk subjects, limits its use. On the other hand, the application of risk assessment tools based on demographic, anthropometric, and simple laboratory tests to screen high-risk subjects is both feasible and economical. A number of risk assessment tools based on readily available clinical variables have been developed to predict the incidence of new diabetes cases. These are derived from European, American, Australian, and Asian studies. However, differences in ethnicities, territories, and lifestyles may limit the application of some of these effective risk scores to the Chinese population. Developing a risk score to specifically identify subjects at high risk of type 2 diabetes that may be widely used in China is therefore both urgent and necessary. Few risk scores have been developed specifically to identify individuals at high risk of type 2 diabetes in China; most have been generated from cross-sectional data, and are limited by small sample size. In the present study, we aimed to develop and validate simple risk scores based on self-assessed information and simple laboratory measurements in the Kailuan study characterizing individuals at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes during a follow-up period of nearly 5.35 years. Furthermore, we compared the performance of other algorithms using our cohort. Our study included 73,987 participants with a mean age of 49.76 ± 12.04 years. Of these, 58,329 (78.8%) were men, and 68,349 (92.4%) had an education level of high school or below. The average body mass index (BMI) was 24.96 ± 3.46 kg/m, and the average fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level was 5.09 ± 0.68 mmol/L. Of the 49,325 participants without diabetes at the baseline examination in the exploration cohort, 4,726 (9.58%) developed diabetes during the mean 5.35 year follow-up period. Among these 4,726 participants who developed diabetes, 3,745 were diagnosed via FPG determination, 319 were diagnosed through their self-reported history of diabetes or use of anti-diabetic medicine, and 662 were diagnosed using two or three criteria. Of the 24,662 participants in the validation cohort, 2,327 (9.44%) developed diabetes. The baseline characteristics of the exploration and validation cohorts are shown in . The values of all variables determined for the validation cohort differed from those of the exploration cohort (all  > 0.05). Participants who developed new-onset diabetes after 5.35 years in both cohorts were more likely to be male, married, older, and heavier and to have a family history of diabetes, cerebrovascular diseases, drinking and smoking habits, and higher waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), FPG, resting heart rate, blood pressure (BP), and BMI. They also had lower education levels and lower income levels than those who did not develop diabetes. There were significant differences between newly diabetic and non-diabetic participants in the exploration cohort, in all variables except for high density lipoprotein (HDL), sleep duration and salt intake at a < 0.05 threshold. However, all the candidate variables except for sleep duration met the model entry criteria at the < 0.2 level. shows the risk scores derived from the exploration cohort using a Cox proportional hazards model. Of the 24 variables that initially entered into the model, only age, gender, BMI, family history of diabetes, education, BP, resting heart rate, FPG, and TG or using lipid-lowering drugs made significant contributions to the score. These statistically significant risk factors constitute the accurate score. Excluding FPG and TG or using lipid-lowering drugs produces the concise score. People with FPG values ≥ 6.1 mmol/L had the highest risk score for predicting incidence of diabetes. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves () demonstrate that the accurate score has a better predictive capacity than the concise score (areas under the curve (AUC) of 0.77 and 0.67, respectively, < 0.001). The total scores for the concise score varied from 0–37, while the accurate score ranged from 0–60. The diagnostic characteristics of the two models using the validation cohort are shown in . The concise score had a performance corresponding to an AUC of 0.66 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.65–0.68); the AUC for the accurate score was 0.77 (95% CI: 0.76–0.78) (). The concise score exhibits a reasonable sensitivity of 0.72 and specificity of 0.52, with an optimum cut-off value of 21. The accurate score exhibits a reasonable sensitivity (0.70), and specificity (0.70) with an optimum cut-off value of 27. Stratified analyses show that the concise score performs better in women than in men (AUC: 0.72 vs. 0.65), as does the accurate score (AUC: 0.81 vs. 0.76), and the concise score performs better for people <60 years compared to those ≥60 years (AUCs of 0.67 and 0.62, respectively), but the accurate score performs slightly better for people ≥60 years (AUC: 0.76 vs. 0.77). and present the calibration plots for the concise and accurate scores using the validation cohort, with the probability of incident diabetes after a mean of 5.35 years on the ordinate, and scores on the abscissa. The dots represent the actual incidence of diabetes, and the vertical lines represent the 95% CIs. The continuous line represents the predicted probability of incident diabetes, which clearly increases with increasing score. At the cut-off value of 21 in the concise score the predicted probability is 9.29%; the corresponding value for the accurate score (at 27) is 9.42%. summarizes the performance of 14 other diabetes risk scores. These include 7 scores containing laboratory variables and 7 scores without laboratory data. When applied to the validation cohort (1/3 of the whole cohort), none of the 7 scores containing laboratory variables outperformed our accurate score. Our concise score also performs better than the other 7 scores that do not contain laboratory variables. Both of our scores (concise and accurate) outperform the New Chinese Diabetes Risk Score devised by Zhou . (AUCs of 0.66 and 0.77 vs. 0.61) when used to predict the incidence of diabetes in individuals. When applied to the whole sample, the diabetes risk score developed by Schmidt . performs the best out of the 14 risk scores (AUC of 0.74). Using two-thirds of the Kailuan cohort, we derived two scoring systems to predict the incidence of diabetes among Chinese adults after a mean follow-up period of 5.35 years. We validated both of the scores using the remaining one-third and confirmed their predictive capacity for incident diabetes. The concise score is non-invasive and can be performed by the individuals themselves. The accurate score is more effective in predicting diabetes but requires simple blood tests. Our scores performed better than the 14 scores derived from other populations. The AUCs for 14 previous diabetes risk scores ranged from 0.62 to 0.87 in their original populations, and ranged from 0.52 to 0.73 in the current study population. Our accurate score performed with a moderately high AUC value (0.77) and our concise score performed with a somewhat low AUC value (0.67). Of note, a model providing an AUC value < 0.80 for predicting incident diabetes may be limited in its clinical utility. However, all predictors included in our scores are readily available clinical variables. If further predictors related to blood testing were included, the scores would perform better. In our scores, the FPG variable is the strongest predictor of incident diabetes (a contribution of up to 20 points). This result is consistent with previous reports. Impaired fasting glucose (IFG) has been defined at the levels from 6.1 to 6.9 mmol/L, and from 5.6 to 6.9 mmol/L. It is not surprising that individuals with IFG have a high risk of developing diabetes. In the accurate score, we also found that the points contributed by the category from 6.1 to 6.9 mmol/L was about twice that of the points contributed by the category from 5.6 to 6.1 mmol/L. The risk of incident diabetes increased with the high FPG level. Age was the second-strongest predictor in our scores; indeed, it has been included in most of the published scores used to predict incident diabetes. Individuals aged ≥60 years have the highest risk of developing diabetes in our scores (accounting for 29.7% of the total score in the concise score), closely followed by individuals in the age range from 40 to 59 years. In contrast, in the simple score used by Aekplakorn ., the category ≥50 years was considered to have the highest point contribution (accounting for 11.8% of the total score). Although they differ in the age cut-off value, these scores are consistent in that older age predicts incident diabetes. In addition, some scores that were developed in a particular age group, included age as a continuous variable, and also suggest that the risk of incident diabetes increases with older age. In our concise score, BMI was the second-strongest predictor after age. In previous diabetes risk scores, BMI or waist circumference were also strong predictors. Compared to height, the variables of weight, waist circumference, and BMI had more statistical significance in the univariate analysis. When all of these factors were entered into the Cox proportional hazards score, only the BMI made a contribution to the scoring system. Similarly, in the clinical diabetes risk scores by Balkau ., both BMI and waist circumference had similar predictive value, but only waist circumference was included in the score. The variables of BMI and waist circumference may not coexist in the same scoring systems. In addition, BMI was not recommended as a candidate variable in the report by Kahn ., because that BMI is a complex index; thus, there is a possibility that the association between BMI and incident diabetes might be driven as much by reduced height as by increased weight. We are not the first researchers to include resting heart rate in a diabetes prediction score. Both the basic and enhanced scores developed by Kahn . included the resting heart rate, and were assigned points of 2 and 5 with mean scores of 38.1 and 33.7, respectively. European studies and a Chinese study from the Kailuan database also demonstrated that an elevated resting heart rate is an independent risk factor for incident diabetes. It has been proposed that sympathetic activation resulting in increased heart rate may lead to insulin resistance which increases diabetes risk. Ultimately, the exact mechanism for this remains to be elucidated. The inclusion of TG and BP in the diabetes risk score is also not new. A widely held viewpoint is that the incidence of type 2 diabetes is the result of complex metabolic processes. Elsewhere, it has been demonstrated that high normal BP and hypertension are associated with an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. As reported in previous studies, higher TG and lower HDL levels are also associated with incident diabetes. However, only TG made a contribution to incident diabetes in our accurate score, which is consistent with the scores by Kanaya . and Gao .. The diabetes risk scores developed by Schmidt ., Wilson ., Chien ., Meigs ., and Kahn ., included both the TG and HDL variables, while the score by Stern . only included the HDL variable. A family history of diabetes is also an important predictor for incident diabetes; genetic and environmental pathways may account for this. ‘Current heavy smoker’ was given the highest point value in the German Diabetes Risk Score. In the clinical scores by Balkau ., smoking was the second most important predictive factor for men, but was not a predictor for women. However, smoking did not contribute to any of our scores, which was consistent with the majority of previously developed diabetes risk scores. Physical activity frequency was also not predictive, possibly because of its negative correlation with BMI. There were some limitations to our study. First, the study is based on residents in the Kailuan community of Tangshan, which might not be representative of the general population of China. In particular, the Kailuan study population is exposed to environmental pollution, and a large proportion of the participants were manual workers, including coalminers. Furthermore, the average BMI of participants included in the current study is higher than the national average. The two scoring systems we developed will need to be validated in other parts of China or in other countries. Second, our scores were derived and validated using the same cohort. This may reduce their ability to predict incident diabetes in other populations. We hope to test these scores in other population samples in the future. Third, we did not collect further parameters related to blood testing. One-hour plasma glucose has been demonstrated as a strong predictor of incident diabetes, and single-nucleotide polymorphisms are known to have associations with the risk of diabetes. These, if included, may have improved the discrimination of the accurate score. Another limitation is that we have not been able to include OGTT data in our diagnostic criteria. This is likely to have led to an underestimate of the association between diabetes and score parameters. On the other hand, our scores used parameters that are easy to obtain, and are appropriate in China. We designed two scores for use as assessment tools to identify subjects at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes among the Chinese population. The concise score is non-invasive and can be used by the individuals themselves. The accurate score provides superior assessment ability but requires simple blood tests. Our scores performed better than other existing diabetes risk scores within the Chinese study population. Further research is required to test the scores we developed in other population samples of China. From June 2006 to October 2007, a population-based cohort of 101,510 people (81,110 males and 20,400 females, 18–98 years old) were recruited for the Kailuan study. The participants consisted of on-job and retired workers in the service of the Kailuan Coal Mine Group Corporation and residing in the Kailuan community. They were recruited from 11 hospitals responsible for the health care of the community. The community is located in the Tangshan area of northern China. Periodic health examinations, including questionnaire interviews, anthropometric measurements, clinical examinations, and laboratory assessments, were performed in 2-year cycles until the present day. We used the data for the period from 2006 to 2012 in this study. Individuals were eligible for enrolment if they were aged 18 years or over, provided informed consent, and updated their health status every 2 years according to the protocol. In the present study, 9,268 participants were excluded due to missing information related to candidate variables, and 8,766 were excluded due to missing follow-up data. Another 9,489 participants were excluded because they had either a baseline FPG level higher than 7.0 mmol/L (≥126 mg/dL), or a history of diabetes (as informed by a physician), or used anti-diabetic medicine. The remaining 73,987 individuals were available for our analyses. The study followed the guidelines of the Helsinki Declaration, and was approved by the Ethics Committees of both the Kailuan General and Beijing Tiantan hospitals. All participants provided their written informed consent. The candidate baseline variables presented in were chosen for their common availability and use in previous diabetes risk scores. The demographic data and information about lifestyle characteristics, medication use, history of diseases, and family history were obtained using questionnaires that were administered by research doctors of the hospitals who were specially trained for the task. The classification of each category variable has been described elsewhere in some detail. To further clarify, the physical activity group ‘very active’ was defined as more than 80 minutes of activity per week, ‘moderately active’ corresponded to less than 80 minutes per week, and ‘inactive’ meant no physical activity. The salt intake group ‘high’ was defined as 10 grams/day, ‘medium’ as 6–10 grams/day, and ‘low’ as 6 grams/day. The ‘smoking occasionally’ group is defined as one cigarette or less per day and ‘smoking frequently’ as smoking daily. The ‘drinking occasionally’ group was defined as drinking 1–3 times every month, while ‘drinking frequently’ was defined as drinking daily. Height, weight, hip circumference, and waist circumference (2.5 cm above the umbilicus) were measured in the standing position, without heavy clothing, to the nearest 0.1 cm or 0.1 kg by nurses responsible for annual routine health examinations. Waist-to-hip ratio was calculated as waist circumference divided by hip circumference. The waist measurement was categorized based on the dividing points of 84 and 90 for men and 77 and 84 for women, in reference to Korean diabetes risk scores in which the population had a similar Asian nature. BMI was calculated according to the equation BMI = weight (kg)/height (m) and was classified based on the common Chinese criteria, i.e., normal corresponds to BMI < 24.0 kg/m, overweight to 24.0 ≤ BMI < 28.0, and obese to BMI ≥ 28.0. Two measurements of BP were taken with a 5-minute interval. If the two measurements differed by more than 5 mmHg, then an additional reading was taken, and the final, average of the readings used for analysis purposes. The resting heart rate was based on the results of a 12-lead electrocardiogram performed with the participants in the supine position. Blood samples were collected in the morning after an overnight fast in the 11 hospitals and analysed at the central laboratory of the Kailuan General Hospital. FPG was measured using the hexokinase/glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase method. TG, TC, HDL, and low density lipoprotein (LDL) levels were all measured enzymatically. According to the criteria of the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III, a TG level of 1.70 mmol/L (150 mg/dL) or greater is considered to be hypertriglyceridemia. Similarly, an HDL level less than 1.03 mmol/L (40 mg/dL) in men, or 1.29 mmol/L (50 mg/dL) in women, was considered low. A TC level of 5.18 mmol/L (200 mg/dL), and LDL level of 3.35 mmol/L (130 mg/dL), were considered borderline-high levels. The outcome of interest in the present study is the first incidence of diabetes at follow-up. This was identified according to either a self-reported history of diabetes diagnosis, taking of anti-diabetic medicine after the baseline examination, or being found to have an FPG level of ≥7.0 mmol/L (126 mg/dL) at any of the periodic examinations. The date of the diagnosis (incidence) was defined as the examination visit date when a new case of diabetes was identified; otherwise follow-up was censored if participants remained nondiabetic at the last follow-up. We used SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) for our analyses. An exploration cohort (49,325 persons) that accounted for two-thirds of the cohort was selected randomly to develop the risk scores for predicting the incidence of diabetes. A Cox proportional hazards model was conducted in a stepwise manner, with candidate variables with a significance of ≤ 0.2 included in the initial model; then, variables with a significance of > 0.05 were removed. We took no account of the interaction terms between the independent variables. We refer to this model, which includes only demographic and anthropometric variables, as the concise model. The concise model supplemented with the laboratory evaluations results in the accurate model. For each model, the hazard ratio and 95% CI were calculated to estimate relative risk. In addition, β-coefficients were calculated to assign points for each risk factor by dividing the sum of the β-coefficients from the two models by 2 and rounding to the nearest integer. Continuous variables included in the model were categorized so that the estimated contribution of these factors to diabetes risk could be expressed through simplified point scores assigned to each of categories. The sum of these points for each model was further calculated to predict the hazard of incidence of diabetes over a follow-up period of a mean of 5.35 years for each person. ROC curves were used to compare the predictive discrimination of different risk scores. Additionally, the AUC (also referred to as C statistic) was used to give a quantitative assessment of the predictive ability of the score. Sensitivity and specificity were used to differentiate the subjects who developed diabetes from those who did not. A cut-off value was identified based on the optimal point that gave the maximum sum of sensitivity and specificity. Our literature reviewed 40 original articles (dated from March 2000 to December 2013) that developed new diabetes risk scores. These included 20 articles that aimed to screen individuals with undiagnosed diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance and 20 articles that aimed to identify individuals at high risk of developing diabetes during a certain period. Among the 20 articles identifying the risk of diabetes incidence, we selected 11 articles for validation using our cohort (according to better AUC, and information scores available in the Kailuan study and different territories). The article by Griffin . was selected for its development of the Cambridge Diabetes Risk Score, which has proven to be effective in identifying those at risk for incident diabetes; for the same reason, we also selected the article by Kanaya .. We also tested the New Chinese Diabetes Risk Score, which was originally developed to detect undiagnosed diabetes. All validations were analysed using a 10-fold cross-validation method. The concise and accurate scores were validated in one-third of the cohort (24,662 participants). The other algorithms from different countries were also separately validated in the validation cohort and the whole cohort. We divided the validation cohort or the whole cohort into 10 smaller samples and validated 9 of them each time. We repeated the cross-validation process 10 times, and then calculated the mean AUC of the 10 validating values for the AUCs. : Wang, A. .

bc100cf3-1bb1-40c2-8a2b-b34a0cae638a,"Development and validation of QDiabetes-2018 risk prediction algorithm to estimate future risk of type 2 diabetes: cohort study Development and validation of QDiabetes-2018 risk prediction algorithm to estimate future risk of type 2 diabetes: cohort study ; , professor of clinical epidemiology and general practice, Division of Primary Care, University of Nottingham, Nottingham NG2 7RD, UK Correspondence to: J Hippisley-Cox  To derive and validate updated QDiabetes-2018 prediction algorithms to estimate the 10 year risk of type 2 diabetes in men and women, taking account of potential new risk factors, and to compare their performance with current approaches.  Routinely collected data from 1457 general practices in England contributing to the QResearch database: 1094 were used to develop the scores and a separate set of 363 were used to validate the scores.  11.5 million people aged 25-84 and free of diabetes at baseline: 8.87 million in the derivation cohort and 2.63 million in the validation cohort.  Cox proportional hazards models were used in the derivation cohort to derive separate risk equations in men and women for evaluation at 10 years. Risk factors considered included those already in QDiabetes (age, ethnicity, deprivation, body mass index, smoking, family history of diabetes in a first degree relative, cardiovascular disease, treated hypertension, and regular use of corticosteroids) and new risk factors: atypical antipsychotics, statins, schizophrenia or bipolar affective disorder, learning disability, gestational diabetes, and polycystic ovary syndrome. Additional models included fasting blood glucose and glycated haemoglobin (HBA1c). Measures of calibration and discrimination were determined in the validation cohort for men and women separately and for individual subgroups by age group, ethnicity, and baseline disease status.  Incident type 2 diabetes recorded on the general practice record.  In the derivation cohort, 178 314 incident cases of type 2 diabetes were identified during follow-up arising from 42.72 million person years of observation. In the validation cohort, 62 326 incident cases of type 2 diabetes were identified from 14.32 million person years of observation. All new risk factors considered met our model inclusion criteria. Model A included age, ethnicity, deprivation, body mass index, smoking, family history of diabetes in a first degree relative, cardiovascular disease, treated hypertension, and regular use of corticosteroids, and new risk factors: atypical antipsychotics, statins, schizophrenia or bipolar affective disorder, learning disability, and gestational diabetes and polycystic ovary syndrome in women. Model B included the same variables as model A plus fasting blood glucose. Model C included HBA1c instead of fasting blood glucose. All three models had good calibration and high levels of explained variation and discrimination. In women, model B explained 63.3% of the variation in time to diagnosis of type 2 diabetes (R), the D statistic was 2.69 and the Harrell’s C statistic value was 0.89. The corresponding values for men were 58.4%, 2.42, and 0.87. Model B also had the highest sensitivity compared with current recommended practice in the National Health Service based on bands of either fasting blood glucose or HBA1c. However, only 16% of patients had complete data for blood glucose measurements, smoking, and body mass index.  Three updated QDiabetes risk models to quantify the absolute risk of type 2 diabetes were developed and validated: model A does not require a blood test and can be used to identify patients for fasting blood glucose (model B) or HBA1c (model C) testing. Model B had the best performance for predicting 10 year risk of type 2 diabetes to identify those who need interventions and more intensive follow-up, improving on current approaches. Additional external validation of models B and C in datasets with more completely collected data on blood glucose would be valuable before the models are used in clinical practice. Diabetes risk assessment tools are used to identify people at increased risk of diabetes so they can have blood tests, and to target interventions to reduce risk. The first QDiabetes model to estimate 10 year risk of type 2 diabetes was published in 2009. Since then it has been updated regularly and recalibrated to the latest version of the QResearch database; the age range across which it applies has also been extended, from 25-79 to 25-84 years, smoking is assessed at five levels instead of two, and the Townsend score has been updated using most recent values from the 2011 census. This helps ensure that the algorithm reflects the changes in population characteristics (such as changes in prevalence of smoking, body mass index, and incidence of type 2 diabetes) and improvements in data quality such as improved recording of risk factors or ascertainment of diabetes. The QDiabetes algorithms have been validated by ourselves and others in independent groups of patients using UK primary care databases such as QResearch, Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), and The Health Improvement Network (THIN). The algorithms have been independently and externally validated in international populations and compared with other diabetes risk prediction models and been shown to have best performance. The use of QDiabetes has also been evaluated in observational studies and systematic reviews. QDiabetes is now integrated into leading UK general practice computer systems and used within the UK National Health Service. It is recommended in the NHS Health Checks and National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance on the prevention of type 2 diabetes in people at high risk. It is also used in occupational health settings and internationally through the publicly available QDiabetes website (). A recent update to the NICE guideline on diabetes prevention in 2017 has highlighted several conditions associated with increased diabetes risk that may not be fully captured by QDiabetes. These include polycystic ovary syndrome, gestational diabetes, learning disabilities, and mental health problems. Furthermore, there is now good evidence from both clinical trials and observational studies that atypical antipsychotics and statins are associated with an increased risk of diabetes. These factors are not specifically identified within QDiabetes, which may result in under-estimation of risk in the relevant patient groups. Once patients with an increased risk of developing diabetes have been identified using a diabetes risk assessment tool such as QDiabetes, then guidelines recommend they undergo a blood glucose test, either for glycated haemoglobin (HBA1c) or fasting blood glucose. This is to determine who already has diabetes; who is at high risk of progression to type 2 diabetes, and who is at moderate risk. International guidelines differ about which thresholds of fasting blood glucose and HBA1c to use to define the high risk group, mainly because of a lack of population based data on which to base the analyses. For example, American guidelines recommend a fasting blood glucose concentration of 5.6-6.9 mmol/L or HBA1c value of 39-46 mmol/mol (5.7-6.4%). UK guidelines recommend a fasting blood glucose concentration of 5.5-6.9 mmol/L or HBA1c value of 42-47 mmol/mol (6.0-6.4%). Widely used risk assessment tools do not incorporate the results of either blood test, making it difficult to provide patients with an accurate estimation of their absolute level of risk after a blood test. We therefore derived and validated a new version of the equation (QDiabetes-2018) to determine whether these factors should be incorporated into the equation and how they could be used to improve the estimation of diabetes risk and communication with patients as well as improve the design of population based diabetes risk assessment strategies. We undertook a cohort study in a large population of primary care patients in England who were registered with practices contributing to the QResearch database (version 42). EMIS Health is the leading commercial supplier of general practice computer systems in the UK and is used by approximately 4400 practices. This is around 58% of all 7613 general practices in England (NHS Information Centre, March 2016). Of these, 1503 (34.2%) contribute to the QResearch database. We included all English practices contributing to QResearch who had been using their EMIS Health computer system for at least a year. We randomly allocated three quarters of practices to the derivation dataset and the remaining quarter to a validation dataset. We identified an open cohort of patients aged 25-84 years registered with practices between 1 January 2005 and 31 December 2016. We excluded patients who did not have a postcode related Townsend score (these usually result from patients moving to newly built houses with new postcodes not yet linked to deprivation data, or from patients being homeless or not having a permanent residence) and those with pre-existing type 1 or type 2 diabetes. We also excluded those with a fasting blood glucose concentration of 7 mmol/L or more or HBA1c value of 48 mmol/mol or more as these patients might be in the process of having further tests to confirm a diagnosis of diabetes. For each patient we determined an entry date to the cohort, which was the latest of the following: 25th birthday, date of registration with the practice plus one year, date on which the practice computer system was installed plus one year, and the beginning of the study period (1 January 2005). Patients were censored at the earliest date of the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, death, deregistration with the practice, last upload of computerised data, or the study end date (31 December 2016). Our primary outcome measure was the first (incident) diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus as recorded on the general practice computer records. We identified patients with diabetes by searching the electronic health record for diagnostic Read codes for diabetes (C10%). As in other studies, we classified patients as having type 2 diabetes if they had a diagnosis of diabetes and had not been prescribed insulin aged less than 35 years. We examined the following predictor variables based on established risk factors already included in the current version of QDiabetes-2017 and new candidate variables highlighted in the literature or NICE guidelines. Where diagnoses are mentioned, these relate to diagnostic codes recorded in the patients’ electronic health record on or before the study entry date. Existing variables from QDiabetes (current 2017 version) • Deprivation (as measured by the Townsend score, where higher values indicate higher levels of material deprivation) • Smoking status: non-smoker, former smoker, light smoker (1-9/day), moderate smoker (10-19/day), heavy smoker (≥20/day) • Family history of diabetes in a first degree relative • Cardiovascular disease (ischaemic heart disease, stroke, or transient ischaemic attack) • Treated hypertension (diagnosis of hypertension and current treatment with at least one antihypertensive drug) • Corticosteroids ( chapter 6.3.2, including oral or injections of systemic prednisolone, betamethasone, cortisone, depo-medrone, dexamethasone, deflazacort, efcortesol, hydrocortisone, methylprednisolone, or triamcinolone) • Diagnosis of schizophrenia or bipolar affective disorder • Prescribed second generation “atypical” antipsychotics (including amisulpride, aripiprazole, clozapine, lurasidone, olanzapine, paliperidone, quetiapine, risperidone, sertindole, and zotepine) From the general practice record we extracted data on the demographic factors, clinical diagnoses, and clinical values. We selected the closest value to cohort entry for body mass index, smoking status, fasting blood glucose level, and HBA1c level, restricting to values recorded before baseline. Use of drugs at baseline was defined as at least two prescriptions in total, with the most recent one no more than 28 days before the date of entry to the cohort. All other predictor variables were based on the latest information recorded in the general practice record before entry to the cohort. We developed and validated the risk prediction equations using established methods. An initial analysis was performed based on patients with complete data. We used multiple imputation with chained equations to replace missing values for body mass index, HBA1c, fasting blood glucose, and smoking status and used these values in our main analyses. So that the imputed values would better match the distribution of observed values, we log transformed values for continuous variables that were not normally distributed for inclusion in the imputation model. In that model we included all predictor variables, along with the Nelson-Aalen estimator of the baseline cumulative hazard, and the outcome indicator. We carried out five imputations, as this has a relatively high efficiency and was a pragmatic approach accounting for the size of the datasets and capacity of the available servers and software. The same imputed dataset was used for all the derivation analyses. To estimate the coefficients for each risk factor in men and women separately we used Cox’s proportional hazards models. We used Rubin’s rules to combine the results across the imputed datasets. We used fractional polynomials to model non-linear risk relations with continuous variables. We selected second degree fractional polynomial terms derived using the data from patients with recorded values. Before running the Cox models we applied the fractional polynomial terms to the imputed data. Initially we fitted full models. For consistency, we included variables from existing QDiabetes models and then retained additional variables if they had an adjusted hazard ratio of less than 0.90 or more than 1.10 (for binary variables) and were statistically significant at the 0.01 level. We used these criteria in conjunction with clinical judgment to ensure that candidate variables were likely to be clinically important and to reduce the possibility of including weak or uninformative predictors that could lead to model over-fitting and optimism. We examined interactions between new predictor variables and age at study entry and included significant interactions in the final models along with interactions already included in the current version of QDiabetes. To compare fit and performance of different models in the derivation cohort we used Akaikes Information Criterion. We developed three main models. Model A included the variables in the existing QDiabetes models and the additional variables that met our inclusion criteria but did not include either fasting blood glucose or HBA1c. Model B is the same as model A except that it included fasting blood glucose but not HBA1c. Model C is the same as model A except that it included HBA1c but not fasting blood glucose. We used the regression coefficients for each variable from the final models as weights, which we combined with non-parametric estimates of the baseline survivor function, evaluated for each year up to 10 years to derive risk equations over 10 years of follow-up. This enabled us to derive risk estimates for each year of follow-up, with a specific focus on 10 year risk estimates. We estimated the baseline survivor function based on zero values of centred continuous variables, with all binary predictor values set to zero. In the validation cohort we used multiple imputation to replace missing values for body mass index, fasting blood glucose, HBA1c, and smoking status. We carried out five imputations. The risk equations for men and women obtained from the derivation cohort were then applied to the validation cohort and measures of discrimination calculated. As in previous studies, we calculated the D statistic (a measure of discrimination where higher values indicate better discrimination), R value (explained variation where higher values indicate a greater proportion of variation explained by the model in time to diagnosis of type 2 diabetes) based on Royston’s D statistic, and Harrell’s C statistic at 10 years and combined these across datasets using Rubin’s rules. Harrell’s C statistic is a measure of discrimination similar to the receiver operating characteristic statistic but takes account of the censored nature of the data. Calibration was assessed by comparing the mean predicted risks at 10 years with the observed risk by 10th of predicted risk. The observed risks were obtained using the Kaplan-Meier estimates evaluated at 10 years. We also evaluated performance by subgroups for each age band (<40, 40-59, ≥60 years), ethnic minority group, and comorbidity and treatment group. We calculated calibration slopes. Performance was also evaluated by calculating Harrell’s C statistics in individual general practices and combining the results using meta-analytical techniques. By applying each equation to the validation dataset we compared performance statistics for the new QDiabetes-2018 models with the latest version of QDiabetes (2017 version). For model A we calculated sensitivity, specificity, and observed risks at different risk thresholds in the validation cohort. We also compared performance of the models with current recommendations from the “two step” approach recommended in the NICE guidance “Preventing type 2 diabetes risk” and the NHS Health Checks best practice guideline. Step 1 currently involves using a risk assessment tool such as QDiabetes to identify “high risk” patients, where high risk is defined for QDiabetes as those who have a 10 year risk of type 2 diabetes of 5.6% or greater. This threshold appears to have been selected predominantly to optimise sensitivity (ie, to avoid missing cases of type 2 diabetes). Step 2 involves a blood test for those identified at high risk to assess whether they have undiagnosed type 2 diabetes, and in the remaining patients to more accurately stratify their risk of progression to diabetes. This blood test can be either for fasting blood glucose or for HBA1c in high risk patients to classify patients into one of three groups: fasting blood glucose ≥7 mmol/L or HBA1c ≥48 mmol/mol = diagnosis of diabetes (or further testing required for confirmation if patient has no symptoms); fasting blood glucose 5.5-6.9 mmol/L or HBA1c 42-47 mmol/mol = “high risk of diabetes” for intensive lifestyle advice or intervention programme; and fasting blood glucose <5.5 mmol/L or HBA1c <42 mmol/mol = “moderate risk of diabetes” for simple lifestyle advice. The updated QDiabetes models were designed to support such an approach, with model A intended to identify patients with an increased risk for whom a blood test could be done. The two further models (model B including fasting blood glucose and model C including HBA1c) could then be used to refine the risk assessment tool once the relevant blood test result was available. Risk assessment at this point could also allow communication of a more accurate risk estimate for patients to inform their decision making and management plans. To compare performance of the models with current recommendations, we calculated the sensitivity for four different strategies for classifying patients as high risk of progression for diabetes using the validation cohort. Patients were classified as at high risk if they had an initial 10 year QDiabetes risk score of 5.6% or more (using model A) and (i) they had a fasting blood glucose concentration between 5.5 and 6.9 mmol/L (strategy 1), (ii) an HBA1c value between 42 and 47 mmol/mol (strategy 2), (iii) a risk score in the top 28% of risk scores using model B (which includes fasting blood glucose values) to correspond to the number of high risk patients for strategy 1 (strategy 3), and (iv) a risk score in the top 28% of risk scores using model C (which includes HBA1c values) to correspond to the number of high risk patients for strategies 1 and 3 (strategy 4). To evaluate the net benefits of the updated risk equations we used decision curve analysis in the validation cohort. This approach assesses the benefits of correctly detecting people who will develop type 2 diabetes compared with the harms from a false positive classification (which could lead to unnecessary intervention). The net benefit of a risk equation at a given risk threshold is given by calculating the difference between the proportion of true positives and the proportion of false positives multiplied by the odds defined by the risk threshold value. We calculated the net benefits of models A, B, and C across a range of threshold probabilities and compared these with alternative strategies, such as assuming no patients will develop type 2 diabetes (no intervention) or assuming all patients will develop type 2 diabetes (intervention in all patients). In general, the strategy with the highest net benefit at any given risk threshold is considered to have the most clinical value. To maximise the power and generalisability of the results, we used all the relevant patients on the database. Stata (version 14) was used for all analyses. We adhered to the TRIPOD statement for reporting. Since the original publication of QDiabetes-2009 there has been public stakeholder discussion about methods for assessment of diabetes risk as part of the development of the NICE guidance and NHS Health Checks. We therefore decided to focus on issues already identified in NICE guidance and the literature. We decided it would be more effective to discuss the addition of new variables once the paper was published and the relative importance of individual risk factors has been quantified. Given the widespread implementation of QDiabetes within the NHS and its inclusion in guidelines, this would allow for feedback from stakeholders (including patient groups and charities) as to which changes would be most beneficial and how improvements might be implemented. Overall, 1457 QResearch practices in England met our inclusion criteria (96.9% of all practices contributing to QResearch). Of these, three quarters (n=1094) were randomly assigned to the derivation dataset, with the remaining quarter (n=363) assigned to a validation cohort. We identified 8 640 363 patients in the derivation cohort aged 25-84 years of whom we sequentially excluded 26 602 (0.3%) who did not have a recorded Townsend score, 34 195 (0.4%) who had a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes at baseline, 342 858 (4.0%) who had a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes at baseline, 23 522 (0.3%) with a fasting blood glucose concentration of 7 mmol/L or more at baseline, and 26 481 (0.3%) with a HBA1c value of 48 mmol/mol or more at baseline. This left 8 186 705 for the derivation analysis. We identified 2 779 075 patients in the validation cohort aged 25-84 years of whom we sequentially excluded 7971 (0.3%) who did not have a recorded Townsend score, 11 076 (0.4%) who had a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes at baseline, 113 653 (4.1%) who had a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes at baseline, 7758 (0.3%) with a fasting blood glucose of 7 mmol/L or more, and 8677 (0.3%) with a HBA1c concentration of 48 mmol/mol or more at baseline. This left 2 629 940 for the validation analysis. Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of men and women in the derivation and validation cohorts. In the derivation cohort, the mean age was 44.9 (SD 15.3) years, and 4 062 142 (49.6%) were men. Self assigned ethnicity was recorded in 5 933 548 (72.5%), smoking status in 7 834 644 (95.7%), body mass index in 6 482 691 (79.2%), fasting blood glucose in 1 189 398 (14.5%), and HBA1c in 506 776 (6.2%). In total, 6 453 196 (78.8%) had complete information for smoking status and body mass index, and 1 367 483 (16.7%) had complete information for smoking, body mass index, and either fasting blood glucose or HBA1c. These values were similar to corresponding values in the validation cohort (table 1). Baseline characteristics of adults aged 25-84 without diabetes at study entry. Values are numbers (percentages) of patients unless stated otherwise Table 1 also shows medical characteristics at study entry. For the new variables of interest: 58 655 (0.7%) patients in the derivation cohort were prescribed atypical antipsychotics, 526 969 (6.4%) were prescribed statins, schizophrenia or bipolar affective disorder was recorded in 62 014 (0.8%), learning disability was recorded in 56 092 (0.7%), gestational diabetes in 17 214 (0.4% of women), and polycystic ovary syndrome in 81 164 (2.0% of women). Supplementary table 1a shows the distribution of risk factors by ethnic group in the derivation cohort. Testing for fasting blood glucose and HBA1c was higher among all non-white ethnic groups other than Chinese compared with the white or not recorded group. Compared with the other ethnic groups, people of South Asian and Caribbean origin tended to have marginally higher mean HBA1c values, and higher proportions had a family history of diabetes. Supplementary table 1b shows similar information for patients with fasting blood glucose or HBA1c recorded compared with those without a value for either test. Table 2 shows the numbers of patients with a new diagnosis of type 2 diabetes during follow-up in the derivation and validation cohorts. In the derivation cohort, we identified 178 314 incident cases of type 2 diabetes arising from 42.7 million person years of observation. Supplementary table 2 shows a breakdown by nine ethnic groups. For example, 6181 incident cases of type 2 diabetes for men and women of Indian ethnicity arose from 795 000 person years of observation. Incidence of type 2 diabetes per 1000 person years with 95% confidence intervals in derivation and validation cohorts The median follow-up in the derivation cohort was 3.90 years (interquartile range 1.54 to 8.50). Overall, 2 027 279 patients had 10 or more years of follow-up. The median follow-up in the validation cohort was 4.22 years (1.57 to 9.25). Overall, 602 661 patients had 10 or more years of follow-up. Table 3 shows the adjusted hazard ratios for models A, B, and C in women in the derivation cohort. Table 4 shows the corresponding values for men. Adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence interval) for type 2 diabetes in women in the derivation cohort for models A, B, and C Adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence interval) for type 2 diabetes in men in the derivation cohort for models A, B, and C Of the new risk factors, all met our model inclusion criteria. Model A includes the variables: age, ethnicity, deprivation, body mass index, smoking status, family history of diabetes in a first degree relative, cardiovascular disease, treated hypertension, corticosteroids, atypical antipsychotics, statins, schizophrenia or bipolar affective disorder, and learning disability. The model in women also included gestational diabetes and polycystic ovary syndrome. Model B is the same as model A except it includes fasting blood glucose. Model C is the same as model A except it includes HBA1c. Supplementary figure S1 shows graphs of the adjusted hazard ratios for models A and B for the fractional polynomial terms for age and body mass index as well as the interaction terms between age and relevant predictor variables as listed in the footnotes of tables 3 and 4. Supplementary figure S1 also shows graphs of the adjusted hazard ratios for fasting blood glucose in model B and HBA1c in model C and their interactions with age. For the new variables of interest in model A, atypical antipsychotics were associated with a 74% (95% confidence interval 60% to 89%) increased risk of type 2 diabetes in women and a 52% (40% to 65%) increased risk for men; statins were associated with a 93% (84% to 103%) increased risk in women and a 79% (74% to 86%) increased risk in men; schizophrenia or bipolar affective disorder was associated with a 30% (21% to 39%) increased risk in women and a 26% (18% to 34%) increased risk in men; learning disability was associated with a 32% (19% to 46%) increased risk in women and a 26% (16% to 38%) increased risk in men. Gestational diabetes was associated with a 359% (332% to 388%) increased risk in women and polycystic ovary syndrome was associated with a 41% (33% to 49%) increased risk. Where there were age interactions, these values relate to risks evaluated at the mean ages. The footnotes for tables 3 and 4 contain the full list of age interactions for each model. In both men and women, among the new variables there were statistically significant interactions between age and learning disability, age and atypical antipsychotics, age and statins, and age and fasting blood glucose (model B), and between age and HBA1c (model C). Hazard ratios for learning disability, atypical antipsychotics and statins, body mass index, and family history of diabetes were higher at younger ages compared with older ages (supplementary figure S1c-g). For example, for model B in men, statins were associated with a 141% increased risk at age 35, a 66% increased risk at age 45, a 30% increased risk at age 55, and a 15% increased risk at age 65 (supplementary figure S1d). Overall the hazard ratios for models B and C tended to be lower than those for model A. The hazard ratios for non-white ethnic groups tended to be lower for model C than for model B. For example, the hazard ratio for Bangladeshi women was 6.07 (5.77 to 6.38) for model A, 4.45 (4.20 to 4.73) for model B, and 3.30 (3.10 to 3.52) for model C. Supplementary tables 3 and 4 show the results of the complete case analysis for each of the three models. The adjusted hazard ratios for models A and B are broadly similar to the analysis based on imputed data. Table 5 shows the performance of each equation in the validation cohort for women and men for each of models A, B, and C compared with the current QDiabetes model. All models had good calibration and high levels of explained variation and discrimination. Model B had the best overall performance, followed by model C. Model A has a similar performance to the current QDiabetes models. Performance of all models was marginally better among women than among men. Performance of models A, B, and C compared with current QDiabetes-2017 model in validation cohort in men and women In women, model A explained 50.5% of the variation in time to diagnosis of type 2 diabetes (R), the D statistic was 2.07, and the Harrell’s C statistic was 0.834. The corresponding values for model A in men were 46.6%, 1.91, and 0.814. In women, model B explained 63.3% of the variation in time to diagnosis of type 2 diabetes (R), the D statistic was 2.69, and the Harrell’s C statistic was 0.889. The corresponding values for model B in men were 58.4%, 2.42, and 0.866. In women, model C explained 60.3% of the variation in time to diagnosis of type 2 diabetes (R), the D statistic was 2.52, and the Harrell’s C statistic was 0.878. The corresponding values for model C in men were 55.5%, 2.28, and 0.855. In addition, we calculated Harrell’s C statistics for model B on the subgroup of patients with complete data for fasting blood glucose and for model C on those with complete data for HBA1c. The results for model B were 0.836 for women and 0.812 for men. The corresponding results for model C were 0.772 and 0.738. Supplementary table 5 shows the D, R, and Harrell’s C statistics for models A and B for women in various subgroups, including three age groups, ethnic groups, and those with specific morbidities. Supplementary table 6 shows the corresponding values for men. The best performance by ethnic group was for model B among Chinese women (R=68.0%, D=2.99, Harrell’s C=0.912). The poorest performance by ethnic group was for model A among Bangladeshi women (R=35.6%, D=1.52, Harrell’s C=0.776). Performance values were highest in the youngest age group (<40 years) and lowest in the oldest age group (≥60 years) for both models. Supplementary figure S2a-d shows plots of Harrell’s C statistic for models A and B in men and women across the 363 practices in the validation cohort. The plots show Harrell’s C values for each general practice versus the number of patients with a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes in each practice. Practices with fewer patients with a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes had wider variation in C statistic than practices with more diagnoses. For example, supplementary figure 2a shows the summary (average) C statistic for model A in women was 0.834 from a random effects meta-analysis. The I value (ie, the percentage of total variation in C statistic due to heterogeneity between practices) was 90.1%. The approximate 95% prediction interval for the true C statistic in women in a new practice was 0.72 to 0.94. Supplementary figure 2c shows the corresponding results for model B in women (summary C statistic=0.891, I=77.5%, 95% prediction interval 0.83 to 0.96). In women, the mean 10 year predicted risk was 3.62% for model A and 3.42% for model B. The observed 10 year risk was 4.21% (95% confidence interval 4.16% to 4.26%). In men, the mean 10 year predicted risk was 4.97% for model A and 4.71% for model B. The observed 10 year risk was 5.56% (5.48% to 5.61%). Figure 1 shows the mean predicted risks and observed risks at 10 years by 10th of predicted risk, applying models A, B, and C to all men and women in the validation cohort. Supplementary table 7 shows values of the calibration slope overall and by subgroup for models A and B. For example, the calibration slope for model A was 0.997 (0.986 to 1.008) in women and 0.986 (0.976 to 0.996) in men. For model B, the corresponding values were 0.993 (0.978 to 1.007) and 0.985 (0.975 to 0.996). The close correspondence between the mean predicted risks and the observed risks within each model 10th for each model indicates that the equations were well calibrated overall and by age group. Calibration within subgroups was variable, although it tended to be better for model B than for model A (see supplementary table 7).  Predicted and observed 10 year risk of diabetes using models A, B, and C Figure 2 compares four strategies for identifying high risk patients based on current recommendations from the NHS Health Checks best practice guide (strategies 1 and 2) and risk assessment using models B and C in combination with model A (strategies 3 and 4). It shows that in the validation cohort for the patients identified as high risk using model A then strategy 3 (based on model B) was the most sensitive when equal sized groups are compared since it identified 28 953 (67.3%) of the 43 010 patients with a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes during 10 years follow-up who were classified as high risk at step 1 (and 49.8% of all 58 130 patients with a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes during 10 years follow-up in the whole validation cohort). Strategy 1 (based on a fasting blood glucose concentration of 5.5-6.9 mmol/L) identified 27 459 (63.8% of 43 010 and 47.2% of 58 130) and strategy 4 (based on model C) identified 27 061 (62.9% of 43 010 and 46.6% of 58 130) patients with a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes during 10 years follow-up. Strategy 2 (based on HBA1c values of 42-47 mmol/mol) identified a lower proportion of high risk patients (19.1%) and the least proportion of patients with a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes during 10 years follow-up, with only 20 037 (46.6% of 43 010 and 34.5% of 58 130) identified.  Comparison of four strategies for identifying patients at high risk of developing diabetes. FBG=fasting blood glucose Supplementary table 8 shows the total population, number of cases of type 2 diabetes identified during follow-up, and the sensitivity, specificity, and observed risk at different thresholds of risk for model A. For example, using a 10 year risk threshold of 11.1% would identify the top 10% of patients with the highest risk of diabetes using model A. At this threshold, the sensitivity was 45.9%, specificity 90.8%, and observed risk 19.3% (95% confidence interval 19.1% to 19.5%). Using a risk threshold of 6.6% (the top 20%) the corresponding values would be 68.1%, 81.1%, and 14.3%. The thresholds for models B and C will vary according to the strategy chosen for the initial identification of patients using model A so are not presented here. Figures 3 and 4 are screenshots of the updated web calculator with several clinical examples to show how QDiabetes-2018 could be used within a consultation. Example 1 (figure 3) shows that a white woman aged 40 years with a body mass index of 30 kg/m and a family history of diabetes has a 10 year estimated risk of type 2 diabetes of 3.6%. If she has polycystic ovary syndrome, her risk is 5.0%. If she also has had gestational diabetes, her risk is 21.1%. If she also has schizophrenia, her risk is 26.5%. If she has a fasting glucose value of 5.5 mmol/L, her 10 year risk is 13.7%. If her fasting glucose was 6.2 mmol/L, her risk would be 67.7%. Example 2 (figure 4) is for a Pakistani man aged 35 who has a body mass index of 30 kg/m. He also has schizophrenia and is prescribed atypical antipsychotics. His 10 year estimated risk of type 2 diabetes is 15.6%. If he is prescribed a statin his 10 year risk is 35.5%. If he has a HBA1c value of 35 mmol/mol, his 10 year risk is 16.8%.  Clinical example 1: Using QDiabetes to calculate absolute risk of diabetes in a female patient. TIA=transient ischaemic attack  Clinical example 2: Using QDiabetes to calculate absolute risk of diabetes in a male patient. TIA=transient ischaemic attack Figure 5 displays the net benefit curves for men and women. These show that the prediction equations for models A, B, and C had higher net benefit than strategies based on considering either no patients or all patients for intervention across a range of thresholds, and these are useful up to an absolute risk threshold of approximately 40%. Model B had slightly improved net benefit compared with model C and both were better than model A. We have developed and validated updated equations to predict the 10 year risk of type 2 diabetes (QDiabetes-2017) in men and women aged 25 to 84 years. The equations incorporate established predictor variables as well as new risk factors associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Three models were produced: model A includes existing risk factors (age, ethnicity, deprivation, body mass index, smoking, family history of diabetes in a first degree relative, cardiovascular disease, treated hypertension, and regular use of corticosteroids) and new risk factors (atypical antipsychotics, statins, schizophrenia or bipolar affective disorder, learning disability, gestational diabetes, and polycystic ovary syndrome). The inclusion of these new risk factors will help ensure more accurate estimation of the level of risk in the affected population to improve information for individual patients and for surveillance strategies. Although the new models are more complex than the existing models, this is unlikely to affect the uptake of the new models as they are all designed to be calculated automatically based on information recorded in the electronic patient record. Figures 3 and 4 included case studies where the impact of additional risk factors for an example patient would lead to different management. For individuals, the presence of these new risk factors could substantially increase their absolute risks of diabetes. These changes in absolute risk could push individuals over a risk threshold, which may then result in different clinical management. However, the actual numbers of people in these groups are comparatively small, so the discrimination statistics are too crude to be able to detect these effects in individuals. In addition, we have developed two further models, which include blood test results in addition to the risk factors from model A. Model B includes fasting blood glucose and model C includes glycated haemoglobin (HBA1c) as continuous values. This approach improves on current approaches using fixed thresholds for fasting blood glucose or HBA1c, as it takes other risk factors into account and allows a more precise estimation of risk to be communicated to patients. The new models can be used to support the two step approach to the identification of patients at high risk of diabetes, as recommended by NICE guidance and the NHS Health Checks. Model A could be used to identify those at high risk of diabetes who require a test for fasting blood glucose or HBA1c. After identifying those patients who meet the criteria for a diagnosis of diabetes, model B could be used to refine the risk estimation in the remaining patients once the result of the fasting blood glucose test is known, since this information provides a more accurate assessment of risk. Similarly, model C could be used when the HBA1c test result is known. Model B had better discrimination and explained more of the variation in time to diagnosis of diabetes than model C. Model B also had the highest sensitivity for identifying cases of diabetes (fig 2), identifying more than two thirds of cases in those determined as being high risk at step 1 compared with the current NHS strategy based on bands of HBA1c that had the lowest sensitivity. Model B also had the highest net benefit, as shown by the decision analysis curve in figure 5, although it was only a small improvement on model C. The strategy based on model B identified a high risk group of 6.7% of the validation cohort, which included nearly half (49.8%) of all patients with a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes over 10 years. Overall, use of model B in strategy 3 and model C in strategy 4 (fig 2) gives more accurate predictions of the future diabetes risk among those tested compared with either strategy 1 or 2 based on blood tests alone. The hazard ratios for the new risk variables included in our final models are similar in both magnitude and direction to those reported in other studies. Antipsychotics, mental health problems, and learning disabilities—Recent published NICE guidance on identification of people at risk of type 2 diabetes highlights the increased risk associated with learning disabilities and mental health problems. Learning disabilities affected approximately 1% of our derivation cohort and were associated with a 32% increased risk of diabetes in women and 26% increased risk in men at the mean age (model A). This is consistent with other studies and is likely to be related to adverse lifestyle factors, including lack of exercise. Schizophrenia or bipolar affective disorder also affected approximately 1% of patients and was associated with a 30% increased risk of diabetes in women and a 26% increased risk in men. Atypical antipsychotics were prescribed for approximately 1% of patients. They were associated with a 74% increased risk of diabetes in women and 52% increased risk in men. This is independent of the risk associated with schizophrenia or bipolar affective disorder, and hence if patients have both factors there will be a compound effect on risk of diabetes. The magnitude of this increased risk was consistent with other studies. Although the prevalence of each of these conditions is approximately 1%, the magnitude of the effect is substantial and likely to represent an important clinical problem for patients. Clinicians will now be able to use QDiabetes-2018 to provide better information to these patients about both the potential effects of atypical antipsychotics and the interventions to reduce the risk of diabetes. —The increased risk of type 2 diabetes associated with statin use is established. A meta-analysis of 13 statin trials reported a 9% (95% confidence interval 2% to 17%) increased risk. The risk associated with statin use was higher in our study than in the trials, which may reflect targeting of statins towards those who are already at higher risk of diabetes. Also, the participants in the meta-analysis trials were substantially older (mean age 65 years) than our study participants (mean age 45 years). When similar age groups are compared, the magnitude of the increased risk associated with statins in our study is broadly comparable with that reported in the meta-analysis of clinical trials, reflecting the interaction between age and statin use. While the magnitude of the diabetes risk associated with statins was of similar magnitude to the increased risk found for atypical antipsychotic drugs, the public health implications may be greater because statins are one of the most commonly prescribed medicines internationally and are targeted at those who already have adverse cardiovascular risk profiles. However, the increased diabetes risk with statins needs to be balanced against the potential reduction in coronary events, making the provision of accurate information on risks and benefits of statins even more important. Gestational diabetes and polycystic ovary syndrome—We studied two risk factors (gestational diabetes and polycystic ovary syndrome) that only occur in women. Polycystic ovary syndrome is known to be associated with an increased prevalence of diabetes. It has recently been identified as a risk factor for type 2 diabetes. We found that polycystic ovary syndrome affected 2% of women at baseline, and it was associated with a 41% increased risk in model A. We also found that gestational diabetes was associated with a 4.6-fold increased risk of diabetes, confirming that it is one of the strongest risk factors for the subsequent development of type 2 diabetes. Although recent NICE guidance on diabetes in pregnancy in 2008 and 2015 recommends annual blood glucose testing postnatally for women with a diagnosis of gestational diabetes, only 20% of such women receive regular screening in primary care. The inclusion of both polycystic ovary syndrome and gestational diabetes in QDiabetes-2018 will ensure the presence of an automated integrated tool available in general practice computer systems to alert clinicians to these patients’ increased risk of diabetes and facilitate proactive follow-up in primary care. Comparison with original version of QDiabetes-2009—Our first QDiabetes model, published in 2009, was based on a cohort followed up between 1993 and 2008. Since then improvements have been made to the QResearch database used to derive the equation, which may have resulted in changes to the model. For example, the number of practices contributing to the database has almost tripled, from 531 in 2009 to 1465 in this study. The size of the derivation cohort has increased threefold, with 178 314 diagnoses of type 2 diabetes arising from 42.7 million person years of observation compared with 78 081 diagnoses of type 2 diabetes arising from 16.4 million person years in 2009. The recorded prevalence of family history of diabetes has increased by 50%, rising from 9.9% to 14.9%. The baseline prevalence of treated hypertension and corticosteroids have each doubled. The recording of self assigned ethnicity has increased threefold, from 24% to 72.5% in the current study. As a result, we have many more events within the various subgroups. This is reflected in the more precise hazard ratios with tighter confidence intervals and improved performance statistics. Interestingly, the hazard ratios by ethnic group varied between the different models, with models B and C tending to have lower values for non-white ethnic groups compared with model A. The discrimination statistics were, however, broadly similar. Overall, the new models are well calibrated when applied to a separate validation cohort and have high levels of discrimination. Although model A had similar performance to the current QDiabetes model, the other two models showed considerable improvement, with the best overall performance for model B. The methods to derive and validate these models are broadly the same as for a range of other clinical risk prediction tools derived from the QResearch database. The strengths and limitations of the approach have already been discussed in detail. In summary, key strengths include size, duration of follow-up, representativeness, and lack of selection, recall, and respondent bias. UK general practices have good levels of accuracy and completeness in recording clinical diagnoses and prescribed drugs. Our study included approximately 20% of all general practices in England, and the characteristics of the population registered with QResearch are similar to the population registered with other large general practice databases using other clinical computer systems. It is therefore likely to be representative of the population overall, especially since approximately 98% of the UK population is registered with a general practice. Of all the patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes excluded at baseline, 9.1% were classified as having type 1 diabetes, which is consistent with other studies using different approaches.We think our study has good face validity as it has been conducted in the setting where most patients in the UK are assessed, treated, and followed up. Limitations of our study include the lack of formal adjudication of diagnoses, information bias, and potential for bias because of missing data. Fractional polynomial terms were identified using complete rather than imputed data. This may have resulted in some bias or less power to detect non-linear trends. Only 16% of patients had complete data for blood glucose measurements, smoking, and body mass index. However, the characteristics of patients and the magnitude of the hazard ratios on the complete case analysis were broadly similar for both magnitude and direction to the analysis based on imputed data (results shown in supplementary tables 3 and 4), which is reassuring. We used five imputations, which may be fewer than recommended because of practical considerations given the huge size of the dataset. However, given the high degree of missing data for models B and C, additional external validation of these models in datasets with more completely collected data would be valuable before the models are used in clinical practice. Some under-ascertainment of diagnoses of type 2 diabetes might be present leading to misclassification bias for the outcome. This is because not all patients will have consulted their general practitioner during the study period and been screened for diabetes. Similarly, there may be under-ascertainment of some of the predictor variables such as polycystic ovary syndrome and gestational diabetes, as the baseline prevalence is lower than in other studies. This may be because gestational diabetes had not been diagnosed or that the diagnosis had not been recorded on the general practice electronic health record. Another limitation is that we have not been able to use oral glucose tolerance testing as a predictor variable as the results of these tests are not stored routinely in the general practice record. We have not taken account of competing risks in this analysis because the results can be counterintuitive and difficult to use in clinical practice. However, not accounting for the competing risk of death in elderly patients is likely to result in risk estimates that are too high in this age group. We excluded patients without a valid deprivation score as this group may represent a more transient population where follow-up could be unreliable or unrepresentative. Their deprivation scores are unlikely to be missing at random so we did not think it would be appropriate to impute them. Some overfitting might have occurred, but this is unlikely given the large number of events. Generally, to avoid overfitting it is recommended that there are at least 10 events per predictor variable, including the interaction terms. Our most complex model (model C in women) had 45 predictor variables. Our derivation sample had 178 314 events, giving 3962 events per predictor variable, which is nearly 400 times the minimum recommended level. The present validation has been done on a randomly selected separate set of practices and individuals to those that were used to develop the score, although the practices all use the same general practice clinical computer system (EMIS, the computer system used by 58% of general practices in England). Some researchers argue that a split sample validation is not necessary when the sample is large enough, as in our study. Others argue that a split sample validation is still valuable. However, since randomly splitting a huge dataset is likely to result in similar populations, it is preferable to split by time or geographical location to obtain a a non-random selection of practices covering a broader range of settings. An independent external validation study would be a more stringent test and should be done, but when such studies have examined QDiabetesand other risk equations, they have shown comparable performance to the validation in the QResearch database. We have published the source code to enable accurate implementation of QDiabetes-2018 on the QDiabetes website () alongside earlier versions of the score from previous updates. The rationale for this is to ensure that those interested in reviewing or using the open source will then be able to find the latest available version as the score continues to be updated. We have developed updated risk equations (QDiabetes-2018) to quantify absolute risks of type 2 diabetes in people aged 25-84 years, which include established risk factors and new risk factors: atypical antipsychotics, statins, schizophrenia or bipolar affective disorder, learning disability, gestational diabetes, and polycystic ovary syndrome. The updated risk equations provide valid measures of absolute risk in the general population of patients, as shown by the performance in a separate validation cohort. The addition of fasting blood glucose to the updated model (model B) had the best discrimination and sensitivity and potentially improves on currently available risk assessment approaches to identify those at risk of diabetes. Methods to identify those at increased risk of type 2 diabetes are needed to identify patients for whom interventions or more frequent assessment may be required QDiabetes is currently widely used to estimate 10 year risk of type 2 diabetes in people aged 25-84 years both to communicate risk to patients and to identify patients at high risk for interventions and active surveillance QDiabetes does not include some well established risk factors and so will underestimate risk in these patients It also does not include fasting blood glucose or HBA1c values Updated algorithms (QDiabetes-2018) were developed to quantify absolute risks of type 2 diabetes in adults aged 25-84, which include established risk factors and new risk factors such as atypical antipsychotics, statins, schizophrenia or bipolar affective disorder, learning disability, gestational diabetes, and polycystic ovary syndrome, and also can incorporate fasting blood glucose and HBA1c values The updated risk algorithms provide valid measures of absolute risk in the general population of patients as shown by the performance in a separate validation cohort The model that includes fasting blood glucose had the best discrimination and the highest sensitivity compared with current recommended practice in the NHS based on bands of either fasting blood glucose or HBA1c A simple web calculator () can be used to implement the QDiabetes-2018 algorithm.

Risk factors considered included those already in QDiabetes (age, ethnicity, deprivation, body mass index, smoking, family history of diabetes in a first degree relative, cardiovascular disease, treated hypertension, and regular use of corticosteroids) and new risk factors: atypical antipsychotics, statins, schizophrenia or bipolar affective disorder, learning disability, gestational diabetes, and polycystic ovary syndrome. Additional models included fasting blood glucose and glycated haemoglobin (HBA1c). Measures of calibration and discrimination were determined in the validation cohort for men and women separately and for individual subgroups by age group, ethnicity, and baseline disease status.  Incident type 2 diabetes recorded on the general practice record.  In the derivation cohort, 178 314 incident cases of type 2 diabetes were identified during follow-up arising from 42.72 million person years of observation. In the validation cohort, 62 326 incident cases of type 2 diabetes were identified from 14.32 million person years of observation. All new risk factors considered met our model inclusion criteria. Model A included age, ethnicity, deprivation, body mass index, smoking, family history of diabetes in a first degree relative, cardiovascular disease, treated hypertension, and regular use of corticosteroids, and new risk factors: atypical antipsychotics, statins, schizophrenia or bipolar affective disorder, learning disability, and gestational diabetes and polycystic ovary syndrome in women. Model B included the same variables as model A plus fasting blood glucose. Model C included HBA1c instead of fasting blood glucose. All three models had good calibration and high levels of explained variation and discrimination. In women, model B explained 63.3% of the variation in time to diagnosis of type 2 diabetes (R), the D statistic was 2.69 and the Harrell’s C statistic value was 0.89. The corresponding values for men were 58.4%, 2.42, and 0.87. Model B also had the highest sensitivity compared with current recommended practice in the National Health Service based on bands of either fasting blood glucose or HBA1c. However, only 16% of patients had complete data for blood glucose measurements, smoking, and body mass index.  Three updated QDiabetes risk models to quantify the absolute risk of type 2 diabetes were developed and validated: model A does not require a blood test and can be used to identify patients for fasting blood glucose (model B) or HBA1c (model C) testing. Model B had the best performance for predicting 10 year risk of type 2 diabetes to identify those who need interventions and more intensive follow-up, improving on current approaches. Additional external validation of models B and C in datasets with more completely collected data on blood glucose would be valuable before the models are used in clinical practice. Diabetes risk assessment tools are used to identify people at increased risk of diabetes so they can have blood tests, and to target interventions to reduce risk. The first QDiabetes model to estimate 10 year risk of type 2 diabetes was published in 2009. Since then it has been updated regularly and recalibrated to the latest version of the QResearch database; the age range across which it applies has also been extended, from 25-79 to 25-84 years, smoking is assessed at five levels instead of two, and the Townsend score has been updated using most recent values from the 2011 census. This helps ensure that the algorithm reflects the changes in population characteristics (such as changes in prevalence of smoking, body mass index, and incidence of type 2 diabetes) and improvements in data quality such as improved recording of risk factors or ascertainment of diabetes. The QDiabetes algorithms have been validated by ourselves and others in independent groups of patients using UK primary care databases such as QResearch, Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), and The Health Improvement Network (THIN). The algorithms have been independently and externally validated in international populations and compared with other diabetes risk prediction models and been shown to have best performance. The use of QDiabetes has also been evaluated in observational studies and systematic reviews. QDiabetes is now integrated into leading UK general practice computer systems and used within the UK National Health Service. It is recommended in the NHS Health Checks and National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance on the prevention of type 2 diabetes in people at high risk. It is also used in occupational health settings and internationally through the publicly available QDiabetes website (). A recent update to the NICE guideline on diabetes prevention in 2017 has highlighted several conditions associated with increased diabetes risk that may not be fully captured by QDiabetes. These include polycystic ovary syndrome, gestational diabetes, learning disabilities, and mental health problems. Furthermore, there is now good evidence from both clinical trials and observational studies that atypical antipsychotics and statins are associated with an increased risk of diabetes. These factors are not specifically identified within QDiabetes, which may result in under-estimation of risk in the relevant patient groups. Once patients with an increased risk of developing diabetes have been identified using a diabetes risk assessment tool such as QDiabetes, then guidelines recommend they undergo a blood glucose test, either for glycated haemoglobin (HBA1c) or fasting blood glucose. This is to determine who already has diabetes; who is at high risk of progression to type 2 diabetes, and who is at moderate risk. International guidelines differ about which thresholds of fasting blood glucose and HBA1c to use to define the high risk group, mainly because of a lack of population based data on which to base the analyses. For example, American guidelines recommend a fasting blood glucose concentration of 5.6-6.9 mmol/L or HBA1c value of 39-46 mmol/mol (5.7-6.4%). UK guidelines recommend a fasting blood glucose concentration of 5.5-6.9 mmol/L or HBA1c value of 42-47 mmol/mol (6.0-6.4%). Widely used risk assessment tools do not incorporate the results of either blood test, making it difficult to provide patients with an accurate estimation of their absolute level of risk after a blood test. We therefore derived and validated a new version of the equation (QDiabetes-2018) to determine whether these factors should be incorporated into the equation and how they could be used to improve the estimation of diabetes risk and communication with patients as well as improve the design of population based diabetes risk assessment strategies. We undertook a cohort study in a large population of primary care patients in England who were registered with practices contributing to the QResearch database (version 42). EMIS Health is the leading commercial supplier of general practice computer systems in the UK and is used by approximately 4400 practices. This is around 58% of all 7613 general practices in England (NHS Information Centre, March 2016). Of these, 1503 (34.2%) contribute to the QResearch database. We included all English practices contributing to QResearch who had been using their EMIS Health computer system for at least a year. We randomly allocated three quarters of practices to the derivation dataset and the remaining quarter to a validation dataset. We identified an open cohort of patients aged 25-84 years registered with practices between 1 January 2005 and 31 December 2016. We excluded patients who did not have a postcode related Townsend score (these usually result from patients moving to newly built houses with new postcodes not yet linked to deprivation data, or from patients being homeless or not having a permanent residence) and those with pre-existing type 1 or type 2 diabetes. We also excluded those with a fasting blood glucose concentration of 7 mmol/L or more or HBA1c value of 48 mmol/mol or more as these patients might be in the process of having further tests to confirm a diagnosis of diabetes. For each patient we determined an entry date to the cohort, which was the latest of the following: 25th birthday, date of registration with the practice plus one year, date on which the practice computer system was installed plus one year, and the beginning of the study period (1 January 2005). Patients were censored at the earliest date of the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, death, deregistration with the practice, last upload of computerised data, or the study end date (31 December 2016). Our primary outcome measure was the first (incident) diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus as recorded on the general practice computer records. We identified patients with diabetes by searching the electronic health record for diagnostic Read codes for diabetes (C10%). As in other studies, we classified patients as having type 2 diabetes if they had a diagnosis of diabetes and had not been prescribed insulin aged less than 35 years. We examined the following predictor variables based on established risk factors already included in the current version of QDiabetes-2017 and new candidate variables highlighted in the literature or NICE guidelines. Where diagnoses are mentioned, these relate to diagnostic codes recorded in the patients’ electronic health record on or before the study entry date. Existing variables from QDiabetes (current 2017 version) • Deprivation (as measured by the Townsend score, where higher values indicate higher levels of material deprivation) • Smoking status: non-smoker, former smoker, light smoker (1-9/day), moderate smoker (10-19/day), heavy smoker (≥20/day) • Family history of diabetes in a first degree relative • Cardiovascular disease (ischaemic heart disease, stroke, or transient ischaemic attack) • Treated hypertension (diagnosis of hypertension and current treatment with at least one antihypertensive drug) • Corticosteroids ( chapter 6.3.2, including oral or injections of systemic prednisolone, betamethasone, cortisone, depo-medrone, dexamethasone, deflazacort, efcortesol, hydrocortisone, methylprednisolone, or triamcinolone) • Diagnosis of schizophrenia or bipolar affective disorder • Prescribed second generation “atypical” antipsychotics (including amisulpride, aripiprazole, clozapine, lurasidone, olanzapine, paliperidone, quetiapine, risperidone, sertindole, and zotepine) From the general practice record we extracted data on the demographic factors, clinical diagnoses, and clinical values. We selected the closest value to cohort entry for body mass index, smoking status, fasting blood glucose level, and HBA1c level, restricting to values recorded before baseline. Use of drugs at baseline was defined as at least two prescriptions in total, with the most recent one no more than 28 days before the date of entry to the cohort. All other predictor variables were based on the latest information recorded in the general practice record before entry to the cohort. We developed and validated the risk prediction equations using established methods. An initial analysis was performed based on patients with complete data. We used multiple imputation with chained equations to replace missing values for body mass index, HBA1c, fasting blood glucose, and smoking status and used these values in our main analyses. So that the imputed values would better match the distribution of observed values, we log transformed values for continuous variables that were not normally distributed for inclusion in the imputation model. In that model we included all predictor variables, along with the Nelson-Aalen estimator of the baseline cumulative hazard, and the outcome indicator. We carried out five imputations, as this has a relatively high efficiency and was a pragmatic approach accounting for the size of the datasets and capacity of the available servers and software. The same imputed dataset was used for all the derivation analyses. To estimate the coefficients for each risk factor in men and women separately we used Cox’s proportional hazards models. We used Rubin’s rules to combine the results across the imputed datasets. We used fractional polynomials to model non-linear risk relations with continuous variables. We selected second degree fractional polynomial terms derived using the data from patients with recorded values. Before running the Cox models we applied the fractional polynomial terms to the imputed data. Initially we fitted full models. For consistency, we included variables from existing QDiabetes models and then retained additional variables if they had an adjusted hazard ratio of less than 0.90 or more than 1.10 (for binary variables) and were statistically significant at the 0.01 level. We used these criteria in conjunction with clinical judgment to ensure that candidate variables were likely to be clinically important and to reduce the possibility of including weak or uninformative predictors that could lead to model over-fitting and optimism. We examined interactions between new predictor variables and age at study entry and included significant interactions in the final models along with interactions already included in the current version of QDiabetes. To compare fit and performance of different models in the derivation cohort we used Akaikes Information Criterion. We developed three main models. Model A included the variables in the existing QDiabetes models and the additional variables that met our inclusion criteria but did not include either fasting blood glucose or HBA1c. Model B is the same as model A except that it included fasting blood glucose but not HBA1c. Model C is the same as model A except that it included HBA1c but not fasting blood glucose. We used the regression coefficients for each variable from the final models as weights, which we combined with non-parametric estimates of the baseline survivor function, evaluated for each year up to 10 years to derive risk equations over 10 years of follow-up. This enabled us to derive risk estimates for each year of follow-up, with a specific focus on 10 year risk estimates. We estimated the baseline survivor function based on zero values of centred continuous variables, with all binary predictor values set to zero. In the validation cohort we used multiple imputation to replace missing values for body mass index, fasting blood glucose, HBA1c, and smoking status. We carried out five imputations. The risk equations for men and women obtained from the derivation cohort were then applied to the validation cohort and measures of discrimination calculated. As in previous studies, we calculated the D statistic (a measure of discrimination where higher values indicate better discrimination), R value (explained variation where higher values indicate a greater proportion of variation explained by the model in time to diagnosis of type 2 diabetes) based on Royston’s D statistic, and Harrell’s C statistic at 10 years and combined these across datasets using Rubin’s rules. Harrell’s C statistic is a measure of discrimination similar to the receiver operating characteristic statistic but takes account of the censored nature of the data. Calibration was assessed by comparing the mean predicted risks at 10 years with the observed risk by 10th of predicted risk. The observed risks were obtained using the Kaplan-Meier estimates evaluated at 10 years. We also evaluated performance by subgroups for each age band (<40, 40-59, ≥60 years), ethnic minority group, and comorbidity and treatment group. We calculated calibration slopes. Performance was also evaluated by calculating Harrell’s C statistics in individual general practices and combining the results using meta-analytical techniques. By applying each equation to the validation dataset we compared performance statistics for the new QDiabetes-2018 models with the latest version of QDiabetes (2017 version). For model A we calculated sensitivity, specificity, and observed risks at different risk thresholds in the validation cohort. We also compared performance of the models with current recommendations from the “two step” approach recommended in the NICE guidance “Preventing type 2 diabetes risk” and the NHS Health Checks best practice guideline. Step 1 currently involves using a risk assessment tool such as QDiabetes to identify “high risk” patients, where high risk is defined for QDiabetes as those who have a 10 year risk of type 2 diabetes of 5.6% or greater. This threshold appears to have been selected predominantly to optimise sensitivity (ie, to avoid missing cases of type 2 diabetes). Step 2 involves a blood test for those identified at high risk to assess whether they have undiagnosed type 2 diabetes, and in the remaining patients to more accurately stratify their risk of progression to diabetes. This blood test can be either for fasting blood glucose or for HBA1c in high risk patients to classify patients into one of three groups: fasting blood glucose ≥7 mmol/L or HBA1c ≥48 mmol/mol = diagnosis of diabetes (or further testing required for confirmation if patient has no symptoms); fasting blood glucose 5.5-6.9 mmol/L or HBA1c 42-47 mmol/mol = “high risk of diabetes” for intensive lifestyle advice or intervention programme; and fasting blood glucose <5.5 mmol/L or HBA1c <42 mmol/mol = “moderate risk of diabetes” for simple lifestyle advice. The updated QDiabetes models were designed to support such an approach, with model A intended to identify patients with an increased risk for whom a blood test could be done. The two further models (model B including fasting blood glucose and model C including HBA1c) could then be used to refine the risk assessment tool once the relevant blood test result was available. Risk assessment at this point could also allow communication of a more accurate risk estimate for patients to inform their decision making and management plans. To compare performance of the models with current recommendations, we calculated the sensitivity for four different strategies for classifying patients as high risk of progression for diabetes using the validation cohort. Patients were classified as at high risk if they had an initial 10 year QDiabetes risk score of 5.6% or more (using model A) and (i) they had a fasting blood glucose concentration between 5.5 and 6.9 mmol/L (strategy 1), (ii) an HBA1c value between 42 and 47 mmol/mol (strategy 2), (iii) a risk score in the top 28% of risk scores using model B (which includes fasting blood glucose values) to correspond to the number of high risk patients for strategy 1 (strategy 3), and (iv) a risk score in the top 28% of risk scores using model C (which includes HBA1c values) to correspond to the number of high risk patients for strategies 1 and 3 (strategy 4). To evaluate the net benefits of the updated risk equations we used decision curve analysis in the validation cohort. This approach assesses the benefits of correctly detecting people who will develop type 2 diabetes compared with the harms from a false positive classification (which could lead to unnecessary intervention). The net benefit of a risk equation at a given risk threshold is given by calculating the difference between the proportion of true positives and the proportion of false positives multiplied by the odds defined by the risk threshold value. We calculated the net benefits of models A, B, and C across a range of threshold probabilities and compared these with alternative strategies, such as assuming no patients will develop type 2 diabetes (no intervention) or assuming all patients will develop type 2 diabetes (intervention in all patients). In general, the strategy with the highest net benefit at any given risk threshold is considered to have the most clinical value. To maximise the power and generalisability of the results, we used all the relevant patients on the database. Stata (version 14) was used for all analyses. We adhered to the TRIPOD statement for reporting. Since the original publication of QDiabetes-2009 there has been public stakeholder discussion about methods for assessment of diabetes risk as part of the development of the NICE guidance and NHS Health Checks. We therefore decided to focus on issues already identified in NICE guidance and the literature. We decided it would be more effective to discuss the addition of new variables once the paper was published and the relative importance of individual risk factors has been quantified. Given the widespread implementation of QDiabetes within the NHS and its inclusion in guidelines, this would allow for feedback from stakeholders (including patient groups and charities) as to which changes would be most beneficial and how improvements might be implemented. Overall, 1457 QResearch practices in England met our inclusion criteria (96.9% of all practices contributing to QResearch). Of these, three quarters (n=1094) were randomly assigned to the derivation dataset, with the remaining quarter (n=363) assigned to a validation cohort. We identified 8 640 363 patients in the derivation cohort aged 25-84 years of whom we sequentially excluded 26 602 (0.3%) who did not have a recorded Townsend score, 34 195 (0.4%) who had a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes at baseline, 342 858 (4.0%) who had a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes at baseline, 23 522 (0.3%) with a fasting blood glucose concentration of 7 mmol/L or more at baseline, and 26 481 (0.3%) with a HBA1c value of 48 mmol/mol or more at baseline. This left 8 186 705 for the derivation analysis. We identified 2 779 075 patients in the validation cohort aged 25-84 years of whom we sequentially excluded 7971 (0.3%) who did not have a recorded Townsend score, 11 076 (0.4%) who had a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes at baseline, 113 653 (4.1%) who had a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes at baseline, 7758 (0.3%) with a fasting blood glucose of 7 mmol/L or more, and 8677 (0.3%) with a HBA1c concentration of 48 mmol/mol or more at baseline. This left 2 629 940 for the validation analysis. Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of men and women in the derivation and validation cohorts. In the derivation cohort, the mean age was 44.9 (SD 15.3) years, and 4 062 142 (49.6%) were men. Self assigned ethnicity was recorded in 5 933 548 (72.5%), smoking status in 7 834 644 (95.7%), body mass index in 6 482 691 (79.2%), fasting blood glucose in 1 189 398 (14.5%), and HBA1c in 506 776 (6.2%). In total, 6 453 196 (78.8%) had complete information for smoking status and body mass index, and 1 367 483 (16.7%) had complete information for smoking, body mass index, and either fasting blood glucose or HBA1c. These values were similar to corresponding values in the validation cohort (table 1). Baseline characteristics of adults aged 25-84 without diabetes at study entry. Values are numbers (percentages) of patients unless stated otherwise Table 1 also shows medical characteristics at study entry. For the new variables of interest: 58 655 (0.7%) patients in the derivation cohort were prescribed atypical antipsychotics, 526 969 (6.4%) were prescribed statins, schizophrenia or bipolar affective disorder was recorded in 62 014 (0.8%), learning disability was recorded in 56 092 (0.7%), gestational diabetes in 17 214 (0.4% of women), and polycystic ovary syndrome in 81 164 (2.0% of women). Supplementary table 1a shows the distribution of risk factors by ethnic group in the derivation cohort. Testing for fasting blood glucose and HBA1c was higher among all non-white ethnic groups other than Chinese compared with the white or not recorded group. Compared with the other ethnic groups, people of South Asian and Caribbean origin tended to have marginally higher mean HBA1c values, and higher proportions had a family history of diabetes. Supplementary table 1b shows similar information for patients with fasting blood glucose or HBA1c recorded compared with those without a value for either test. Table 2 shows the numbers of patients with a new diagnosis of type 2 diabetes during follow-up in the derivation and validation cohorts. In the derivation cohort, we identified 178 314 incident cases of type 2 diabetes arising from 42.7 million person years of observation. Supplementary table 2 shows a breakdown by nine ethnic groups. For example, 6181 incident cases of type 2 diabetes for men and women of Indian ethnicity arose from 795 000 person years of observation. Incidence of type 2 diabetes per 1000 person years with 95% confidence intervals in derivation and validation cohorts The median follow-up in the derivation cohort was 3.90 years (interquartile range 1.54 to 8.50). Overall, 2 027 279 patients had 10 or more years of follow-up. The median follow-up in the validation cohort was 4.22 years (1.57 to 9.25). Overall, 602 661 patients had 10 or more years of follow-up. Table 3 shows the adjusted hazard ratios for models A, B, and C in women in the derivation cohort. Table 4 shows the corresponding values for men. Adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence interval) for type 2 diabetes in women in the derivation cohort for models A, B, and C Adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence interval) for type 2 diabetes in men in the derivation cohort for models A, B, and C Of the new risk factors, all met our model inclusion criteria. Model A includes the variables: age, ethnicity, deprivation, body mass index, smoking status, family history of diabetes in a first degree relative, cardiovascular disease, treated hypertension, corticosteroids, atypical antipsychotics, statins, schizophrenia or bipolar affective disorder, and learning disability. The model in women also included gestational diabetes and polycystic ovary syndrome. Model B is the same as model A except it includes fasting blood glucose. Model C is the same as model A except it includes HBA1c. Supplementary figure S1 shows graphs of the adjusted hazard ratios for models A and B for the fractional polynomial terms for age and body mass index as well as the interaction terms between age and relevant predictor variables as listed in the footnotes of tables 3 and 4. Supplementary figure S1 also shows graphs of the adjusted hazard ratios for fasting blood glucose in model B and HBA1c in model C and their interactions with age. For the new variables of interest in model A, atypical antipsychotics were associated with a 74% (95% confidence interval 60% to 89%) increased risk of type 2 diabetes in women and a 52% (40% to 65%) increased risk for men; statins were associated with a 93% (84% to 103%) increased risk in women and a 79% (74% to 86%) increased risk in men; schizophrenia or bipolar affective disorder was associated with a 30% (21% to 39%) increased risk in women and a 26% (18% to 34%) increased risk in men; learning disability was associated with a 32% (19% to 46%) increased risk in women and a 26% (16% to 38%) increased risk in men. Gestational diabetes was associated with a 359% (332% to 388%) increased risk in women and polycystic ovary syndrome was associated with a 41% (33% to 49%) increased risk. Where there were age interactions, these values relate to risks evaluated at the mean ages. The footnotes for tables 3 and 4 contain the full list of age interactions for each model. In both men and women, among the new variables there were statistically significant interactions between age and learning disability, age and atypical antipsychotics, age and statins, and age and fasting blood glucose (model B), and between age and HBA1c (model C). Hazard ratios for learning disability, atypical antipsychotics and statins, body mass index, and family history of diabetes were higher at younger ages compared with older ages (supplementary figure S1c-g). For example, for model B in men, statins were associated with a 141% increased risk at age 35, a 66% increased risk at age 45, a 30% increased risk at age 55, and a 15% increased risk at age 65 (supplementary figure S1d). Overall the hazard ratios for models B and C tended to be lower than those for model A. The hazard ratios for non-white ethnic groups tended to be lower for model C than for model B. For example, the hazard ratio for Bangladeshi women was 6.07 (5.77 to 6.38) for model A, 4.45 (4.20 to 4.73) for model B, and 3.30 (3.10 to 3.52) for model C. Supplementary tables 3 and 4 show the results of the complete case analysis for each of the three models. The adjusted hazard ratios for models A and B are broadly similar to the analysis based on imputed data. Table 5 shows the performance of each equation in the validation cohort for women and men for each of models A, B, and C compared with the current QDiabetes model. All models had good calibration and high levels of explained variation and discrimination. Model B had the best overall performance, followed by model C. Model A has a similar performance to the current QDiabetes models. Performance of all models was marginally better among women than among men. Performance of models A, B, and C compared with current QDiabetes-2017 model in validation cohort in men and women In women, model A explained 50.5% of the variation in time to diagnosis of type 2 diabetes (R), the D statistic was 2.07, and the Harrell’s C statistic was 0.834. The corresponding values for model A in men were 46.6%, 1.91, and 0.814. In women, model B explained 63.3% of the variation in time to diagnosis of type 2 diabetes (R), the D statistic was 2.69, and the Harrell’s C statistic was 0.889. The corresponding values for model B in men were 58.4%, 2.42, and 0.866. In women, model C explained 60.3% of the variation in time to diagnosis of type 2 diabetes (R), the D statistic was 2.52, and the Harrell’s C statistic was 0.878. The corresponding values for model C in men were 55.5%, 2.28, and 0.855. In addition, we calculated Harrell’s C statistics for model B on the subgroup of patients with complete data for fasting blood glucose and for model C on those with complete data for HBA1c. The results for model B were 0.836 for women and 0.812 for men. The corresponding results for model C were 0.772 and 0.738. Supplementary table 5 shows the D, R, and Harrell’s C statistics for models A and B for women in various subgroups, including three age groups, ethnic groups, and those with specific morbidities. Supplementary table 6 shows the corresponding values for men. The best performance by ethnic group was for model B among Chinese women (R=68.0%, D=2.99, Harrell’s C=0.912). The poorest performance by ethnic group was for model A among Bangladeshi women (R=35.6%, D=1.52, Harrell’s C=0.776). Performance values were highest in the youngest age group (<40 years) and lowest in the oldest age group (≥60 years) for both models. Supplementary figure S2a-d shows plots of Harrell’s C statistic for models A and B in men and women across the 363 practices in the validation cohort. The plots show Harrell’s C values for each general practice versus the number of patients with a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes in each practice. Practices with fewer patients with a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes had wider variation in C statistic than practices with more diagnoses. For example, supplementary figure 2a shows the summary (average) C statistic for model A in women was 0.834 from a random effects meta-analysis. The I value (ie, the percentage of total variation in C statistic due to heterogeneity between practices) was 90.1%. The approximate 95% prediction interval for the true C statistic in women in a new practice was 0.72 to 0.94. Supplementary figure 2c shows the corresponding results for model B in women (summary C statistic=0.891, I=77.5%, 95% prediction interval 0.83 to 0.96). In women, the mean 10 year predicted risk was 3.62% for model A and 3.42% for model B. The observed 10 year risk was 4.21% (95% confidence interval 4.16% to 4.26%). In men, the mean 10 year predicted risk was 4.97% for model A and 4.71% for model B. The observed 10 year risk was 5.56% (5.48% to 5.61%). Figure 1 shows the mean predicted risks and observed risks at 10 years by 10th of predicted risk, applying models A, B, and C to all men and women in the validation cohort. Supplementary table 7 shows values of the calibration slope overall and by subgroup for models A and B. For example, the calibration slope for model A was 0.997 (0.986 to 1.008) in women and 0.986 (0.976 to 0.996) in men. For model B, the corresponding values were 0.993 (0.978 to 1.007) and 0.985 (0.975 to 0.996). The close correspondence between the mean predicted risks and the observed risks within each model 10th for each model indicates that the equations were well calibrated overall and by age group. Calibration within subgroups was variable, although it tended to be better for model B than for model A (see supplementary table 7).  Predicted and observed 10 year risk of diabetes using models A, B, and C Figure 2 compares four strategies for identifying high risk patients based on current recommendations from the NHS Health Checks best practice guide (strategies 1 and 2) and risk assessment using models B and C in combination with model A (strategies 3 and 4). It shows that in the validation cohort for the patients identified as high risk using model A then strategy 3 (based on model B) was the most sensitive when equal sized groups are compared since it identified 28 953 (67.3%) of the 43 010 patients with a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes during 10 years follow-up who were classified as high risk at step 1 (and 49.8% of all 58 130 patients with a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes during 10 years follow-up in the whole validation cohort). Strategy 1 (based on a fasting blood glucose concentration of 5.5-6.9 mmol/L) identified 27 459 (63.8% of 43 010 and 47.2% of 58 130) and strategy 4 (based on model C) identified 27 061 (62.9% of 43 010 and 46.6% of 58 130) patients with a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes during 10 years follow-up. Strategy 2 (based on HBA1c values of 42-47 mmol/mol) identified a lower proportion of high risk patients (19.1%) and the least proportion of patients with a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes during 10 years follow-up, with only 20 037 (46.6% of 43 010 and 34.5% of 58 130) identified.  Comparison of four strategies for identifying patients at high risk of developing diabetes. FBG=fasting blood glucose Supplementary table 8 shows the total population, number of cases of type 2 diabetes identified during follow-up, and the sensitivity, specificity, and observed risk at different thresholds of risk for model A. For example, using a 10 year risk threshold of 11.1% would identify the top 10% of patients with the highest risk of diabetes using model A. At this threshold, the sensitivity was 45.9%, specificity 90.8%, and observed risk 19.3% (95% confidence interval 19.1% to 19.5%). Using a risk threshold of 6.6% (the top 20%) the corresponding values would be 68.1%, 81.1%, and 14.3%. The thresholds for models B and C will vary according to the strategy chosen for the initial identification of patients using model A so are not presented here. Figures 3 and 4 are screenshots of the updated web calculator with several clinical examples to show how QDiabetes-2018 could be used within a consultation. Example 1 (figure 3) shows that a white woman aged 40 years with a body mass index of 30 kg/m and a family history of diabetes has a 10 year estimated risk of type 2 diabetes of 3.6%. If she has polycystic ovary syndrome, her risk is 5.0%. If she also has had gestational diabetes, her risk is 21.1%. If she also has schizophrenia, her risk is 26.5%. If she has a fasting glucose value of 5.5 mmol/L, her 10 year risk is 13.7%. If her fasting glucose was 6.2 mmol/L, her risk would be 67.7%. Example 2 (figure 4) is for a Pakistani man aged 35 who has a body mass index of 30 kg/m. He also has schizophrenia and is prescribed atypical antipsychotics. His 10 year estimated risk of type 2 diabetes is 15.6%. If he is prescribed a statin his 10 year risk is 35.5%. If he has a HBA1c value of 35 mmol/mol, his 10 year risk is 16.8%.  Clinical example 1: Using QDiabetes to calculate absolute risk of diabetes in a female patient. TIA=transient ischaemic attack  Clinical example 2: Using QDiabetes to calculate absolute risk of diabetes in a male patient. TIA=transient ischaemic attack Figure 5 displays the net benefit curves for men and women. These show that the prediction equations for models A, B, and C had higher net benefit than strategies based on considering either no patients or all patients for intervention across a range of thresholds, and these are useful up to an absolute risk threshold of approximately 40%. Model B had slightly improved net benefit compared with model C and both were better than model A. We have developed and validated updated equations to predict the 10 year risk of type 2 diabetes (QDiabetes-2017) in men and women aged 25 to 84 years. The equations incorporate established predictor variables as well as new risk factors associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Three models were produced: model A includes existing risk factors (age, ethnicity, deprivation, body mass index, smoking, family history of diabetes in a first degree relative, cardiovascular disease, treated hypertension, and regular use of corticosteroids) and new risk factors (atypical antipsychotics, statins, schizophrenia or bipolar affective disorder, learning disability, gestational diabetes, and polycystic ovary syndrome). The inclusion of these new risk factors will help ensure more accurate estimation of the level of risk in the affected population to improve information for individual patients and for surveillance strategies. Although the new models are more complex than the existing models, this is unlikely to affect the uptake of the new models as they are all designed to be calculated automatically based on information recorded in the electronic patient record. Figures 3 and 4 included case studies where the impact of additional risk factors for an example patient would lead to different management. For individuals, the presence of these new risk factors could substantially increase their absolute risks of diabetes. These changes in absolute risk could push individuals over a risk threshold, which may then result in different clinical management. However, the actual numbers of people in these groups are comparatively small, so the discrimination statistics are too crude to be able to detect these effects in individuals. In addition, we have developed two further models, which include blood test results in addition to the risk factors from model A. Model B includes fasting blood glucose and model C includes glycated haemoglobin (HBA1c) as continuous values. This approach improves on current approaches using fixed thresholds for fasting blood glucose or HBA1c, as it takes other risk factors into account and allows a more precise estimation of risk to be communicated to patients. The new models can be used to support the two step approach to the identification of patients at high risk of diabetes, as recommended by NICE guidance and the NHS Health Checks. Model A could be used to identify those at high risk of diabetes who require a test for fasting blood glucose or HBA1c. After identifying those patients who meet the criteria for a diagnosis of diabetes, model B could be used to refine the risk estimation in the remaining patients once the result of the fasting blood glucose test is known, since this information provides a more accurate assessment of risk. Similarly, model C could be used when the HBA1c test result is known. Model B had better discrimination and explained more of the variation in time to diagnosis of diabetes than model C. Model B also had the highest sensitivity for identifying cases of diabetes (fig 2), identifying more than two thirds of cases in those determined as being high risk at step 1 compared with the current NHS strategy based on bands of HBA1c that had the lowest sensitivity. Model B also had the highest net benefit, as shown by the decision analysis curve in figure 5, although it was only a small improvement on model C. The strategy based on model B identified a high risk group of 6.7% of the validation cohort, which included nearly half (49.8%) of all patients with a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes over 10 years. Overall, use of model B in strategy 3 and model C in strategy 4 (fig 2) gives more accurate predictions of the future diabetes risk among those tested compared with either strategy 1 or 2 based on blood tests alone. The hazard ratios for the new risk variables included in our final models are similar in both magnitude and direction to those reported in other studies. Antipsychotics, mental health problems, and learning disabilities—Recent published NICE guidance on identification of people at risk of type 2 diabetes highlights the increased risk associated with learning disabilities and mental health problems. Learning disabilities affected approximately 1% of our derivation cohort and were associated with a 32% increased risk of diabetes in women and 26% increased risk in men at the mean age (model A). This is consistent with other studies and is likely to be related to adverse lifestyle factors, including lack of exercise. Schizophrenia or bipolar affective disorder also affected approximately 1% of patients and was associated with a 30% increased risk of diabetes in women and a 26% increased risk in men. Atypical antipsychotics were prescribed for approximately 1% of patients. They were associated with a 74% increased risk of diabetes in women and 52% increased risk in men. This is independent of the risk associated with schizophrenia or bipolar affective disorder, and hence if patients have both factors there will be a compound effect on risk of diabetes. The magnitude of this increased risk was consistent with other studies. Although the prevalence of each of these conditions is approximately 1%, the magnitude of the effect is substantial and likely to represent an important clinical problem for patients. Clinicians will now be able to use QDiabetes-2018 to provide better information to these patients about both the potential effects of atypical antipsychotics and the interventions to reduce the risk of diabetes. —The increased risk of type 2 diabetes associated with statin use is established. A meta-analysis of 13 statin trials reported a 9% (95% confidence interval 2% to 17%) increased risk. The risk associated with statin use was higher in our study than in the trials, which may reflect targeting of statins towards those who are already at higher risk of diabetes. Also, the participants in the meta-analysis trials were substantially older (mean age 65 years) than our study participants (mean age 45 years). When similar age groups are compared, the magnitude of the increased risk associated with statins in our study is broadly comparable with that reported in the meta-analysis of clinical trials, reflecting the interaction between age and statin use. While the magnitude of the diabetes risk associated with statins was of similar magnitude to the increased risk found for atypical antipsychotic drugs, the public health implications may be greater because statins are one of the most commonly prescribed medicines internationally and are targeted at those who already have adverse cardiovascular risk profiles. However, the increased diabetes risk with statins needs to be balanced against the potential reduction in coronary events, making the provision of accurate information on risks and benefits of statins even more important. Gestational diabetes and polycystic ovary syndrome—We studied two risk factors (gestational diabetes and polycystic ovary syndrome) that only occur in women. Polycystic ovary syndrome is known to be associated with an increased prevalence of diabetes. It has recently been identified as a risk factor for type 2 diabetes. We found that polycystic ovary syndrome affected 2% of women at baseline, and it was associated with a 41% increased risk in model A. We also found that gestational diabetes was associated with a 4.6-fold increased risk of diabetes, confirming that it is one of the strongest risk factors for the subsequent development of type 2 diabetes. Although recent NICE guidance on diabetes in pregnancy in 2008 and 2015 recommends annual blood glucose testing postnatally for women with a diagnosis of gestational diabetes, only 20% of such women receive regular screening in primary care. The inclusion of both polycystic ovary syndrome and gestational diabetes in QDiabetes-2018 will ensure the presence of an automated integrated tool available in general practice computer systems to alert clinicians to these patients’ increased risk of diabetes and facilitate proactive follow-up in primary care. Comparison with original version of QDiabetes-2009—Our first QDiabetes model, published in 2009, was based on a cohort followed up between 1993 and 2008. Since then improvements have been made to the QResearch database used to derive the equation, which may have resulted in changes to the model. For example, the number of practices contributing to the database has almost tripled, from 531 in 2009 to 1465 in this study. The size of the derivation cohort has increased threefold, with 178 314 diagnoses of type 2 diabetes arising from 42.7 million person years of observation compared with 78 081 diagnoses of type 2 diabetes arising from 16.4 million person years in 2009. The recorded prevalence of family history of diabetes has increased by 50%, rising from 9.9% to 14.9%. The baseline prevalence of treated hypertension and corticosteroids have each doubled. The recording of self assigned ethnicity has increased threefold, from 24% to 72.5% in the current study. As a result, we have many more events within the various subgroups. This is reflected in the more precise hazard ratios with tighter confidence intervals and improved performance statistics. Interestingly, the hazard ratios by ethnic group varied between the different models, with models B and C tending to have lower values for non-white ethnic groups compared with model A. The discrimination statistics were, however, broadly similar. Overall, the new models are well calibrated when applied to a separate validation cohort and have high levels of discrimination. Although model A had similar performance to the current QDiabetes model, the other two models showed considerable improvement, with the best overall performance for model B. The methods to derive and validate these models are broadly the same as for a range of other clinical risk prediction tools derived from the QResearch database. The strengths and limitations of the approach have already been discussed in detail. In summary, key strengths include size, duration of follow-up, representativeness, and lack of selection, recall, and respondent bias. UK general practices have good levels of accuracy and completeness in recording clinical diagnoses and prescribed drugs. Our study included approximately 20% of all general practices in England, and the characteristics of the population registered with QResearch are similar to the population registered with other large general practice databases using other clinical computer systems. It is therefore likely to be representative of the population overall, especially since approximately 98% of the UK population is registered with a general practice. Of all the patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes excluded at baseline, 9.1% were classified as having type 1 diabetes, which is consistent with other studies using different approaches.We think our study has good face validity as it has been conducted in the setting where most patients in the UK are assessed, treated, and followed up. Limitations of our study include the lack of formal adjudication of diagnoses, information bias, and potential for bias because of missing data. Fractional polynomial terms were identified using complete rather than imputed data. This may have resulted in some bias or less power to detect non-linear trends. Only 16% of patients had complete data for blood glucose measurements, smoking, and body mass index. However, the characteristics of patients and the magnitude of the hazard ratios on the complete case analysis were broadly similar for both magnitude and direction to the analysis based on imputed data (results shown in supplementary tables 3 and 4), which is reassuring. We used five imputations, which may be fewer than recommended because of practical considerations given the huge size of the dataset. However, given the high degree of missing data for models B and C, additional external validation of these models in datasets with more completely collected data would be valuable before the models are used in clinical practice. Some under-ascertainment of diagnoses of type 2 diabetes might be present leading to misclassification bias for the outcome. This is because not all patients will have consulted their general practitioner during the study period and been screened for diabetes. Similarly, there may be under-ascertainment of some of the predictor variables such as polycystic ovary syndrome and gestational diabetes, as the baseline prevalence is lower than in other studies. This may be because gestational diabetes had not been diagnosed or that the diagnosis had not been recorded on the general practice electronic health record. Another limitation is that we have not been able to use oral glucose tolerance testing as a predictor variable as the results of these tests are not stored routinely in the general practice record. We have not taken account of competing risks in this analysis because the results can be counterintuitive and difficult to use in clinical practice. However, not accounting for the competing risk of death in elderly patients is likely to result in risk estimates that are too high in this age group. We excluded patients without a valid deprivation score as this group may represent a more transient population where follow-up could be unreliable or unrepresentative. Their deprivation scores are unlikely to be missing at random so we did not think it would be appropriate to impute them. Some overfitting might have occurred, but this is unlikely given the large number of events. Generally, to avoid overfitting it is recommended that there are at least 10 events per predictor variable, including the interaction terms. Our most complex model (model C in women) had 45 predictor variables. Our derivation sample had 178 314 events, giving 3962 events per predictor variable, which is nearly 400 times the minimum recommended level. The present validation has been done on a randomly selected separate set of practices and individuals to those that were used to develop the score, although the practices all use the same general practice clinical computer system (EMIS, the computer system used by 58% of general practices in England). Some researchers argue that a split sample validation is not necessary when the sample is large enough, as in our study. Others argue that a split sample validation is still valuable. However, since randomly splitting a huge dataset is likely to result in similar populations, it is preferable to split by time or geographical location to obtain a a non-random selection of practices covering a broader range of settings. An independent external validation study would be a more stringent test and should be done, but when such studies have examined QDiabetesand other risk equations, they have shown comparable performance to the validation in the QResearch database. We have published the source code to enable accurate implementation of QDiabetes-2018 on the QDiabetes website () alongside earlier versions of the score from previous updates. The rationale for this is to ensure that those interested in reviewing or using the open source will then be able to find the latest available version as the score continues to be updated. We have developed updated risk equations (QDiabetes-2018) to quantify absolute risks of type 2 diabetes in people aged 25-84 years, which include established risk factors and new risk factors: atypical antipsychotics, statins, schizophrenia or bipolar affective disorder, learning disability, gestational diabetes, and polycystic ovary syndrome. The updated risk equations provide valid measures of absolute risk in the general population of patients, as shown by the performance in a separate validation cohort. The addition of fasting blood glucose to the updated model (model B) had the best discrimination and sensitivity and potentially improves on currently available risk assessment approaches to identify those at risk of diabetes. Methods to identify those at increased risk of type 2 diabetes are needed to identify patients for whom interventions or more frequent assessment may be required QDiabetes is currently widely used to estimate 10 year risk of type 2 diabetes in people aged 25-84 years both to communicate risk to patients and to identify patients at high risk for interventions and active surveillance QDiabetes does not include some well established risk factors and so will underestimate risk in these patients It also does not include fasting blood glucose or HBA1c values Updated algorithms (QDiabetes-2018) were developed to quantify absolute risks of type 2 diabetes in adults aged 25-84, which include established risk factors and new risk factors such as atypical antipsychotics, statins, schizophrenia or bipolar affective disorder, learning disability, gestational diabetes, and polycystic ovary syndrome, and also can incorporate fasting blood glucose and HBA1c values The updated risk algorithms provide valid measures of absolute risk in the general population of patients as shown by the performance in a separate validation cohort The model that includes fasting blood glucose had the best discrimination and the highest sensitivity compared with current recommended practice in the NHS based on bands of either fasting blood glucose or HBA1c A simple web calculator () can be used to implement the QDiabetes-2018 algorithm.

Risk factors considered included those already in QDiabetes (age, ethnicity, deprivation, body mass index, smoking, family history of diabetes in a first degree relative, cardiovascular disease, treated hypertension, and regular use of corticosteroids) and new risk factors: atypical antipsychotics, statins, schizophrenia or bipolar affective disorder, learning disability, gestational diabetes, and polycystic ovary syndrome. Additional models included fasting blood glucose and glycated haemoglobin (HBA1c). Measures of calibration and discrimination were determined in the validation cohort for men and women separately and for individual subgroups by age group, ethnicity, and baseline disease status.  Incident type 2 diabetes recorded on the general practice record.  In the derivation cohort, 178 314 incident cases of type 2 diabetes were identified during follow-up arising from 42.72 million person years of observation. In the validation cohort, 62 326 incident cases of type 2 diabetes were identified from 14.32 million person years of observation. All new risk factors considered met our model inclusion criteria. Model A included age, ethnicity, deprivation, body mass index, smoking, family history of diabetes in a first degree relative, cardiovascular disease, treated hypertension, and regular use of corticosteroids, and new risk factors: atypical antipsychotics, statins, schizophrenia or bipolar affective disorder, learning disability, and gestational diabetes and polycystic ovary syndrome in women. Model B included the same variables as model A plus fasting blood glucose. Model C included HBA1c instead of fasting blood glucose. All three models had good calibration and high levels of explained variation and discrimination. In women, model B explained 63.3% of the variation in time to diagnosis of type 2 diabetes (R), the D statistic was 2.69 and the Harrell’s C statistic value was 0.89. The corresponding values for men were 58.4%, 2.42, and 0.87. Model B also had the highest sensitivity compared with current recommended practice in the National Health Service based on bands of either fasting blood glucose or HBA1c. However, only 16% of patients had complete data for blood glucose measurements, smoking, and body mass index.  Three updated QDiabetes risk models to quantify the absolute risk of type 2 diabetes were developed and validated: model A does not require a blood test and can be used to identify patients for fasting blood glucose (model B) or HBA1c (model C) testing. Model B had the best performance for predicting 10 year risk of type 2 diabetes to identify those who need interventions and more intensive follow-up, improving on current approaches. Additional external validation of models B and C in datasets with more completely collected data on blood glucose would be valuable before the models are used in clinical practice. Diabetes risk assessment tools are used to identify people at increased risk of diabetes so they can have blood tests, and to target interventions to reduce risk. The first QDiabetes model to estimate 10 year risk of type 2 diabetes was published in 2009. Since then it has been updated regularly and recalibrated to the latest version of the QResearch database; the age range across which it applies has also been extended, from 25-79 to 25-84 years, smoking is assessed at five levels instead of two, and the Townsend score has been updated using most recent values from the 2011 census. This helps ensure that the algorithm reflects the changes in population characteristics (such as changes in prevalence of smoking, body mass index, and incidence of type 2 diabetes) and improvements in data quality such as improved recording of risk factors or ascertainment of diabetes. The QDiabetes algorithms have been validated by ourselves and others in independent groups of patients using UK primary care databases such as QResearch, Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), and The Health Improvement Network (THIN). The algorithms have been independently and externally validated in international populations and compared with other diabetes risk prediction models and been shown to have best performance. The use of QDiabetes has also been evaluated in observational studies and systematic reviews. QDiabetes is now integrated into leading UK general practice computer systems and used within the UK National Health Service. It is recommended in the NHS Health Checks and National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance on the prevention of type 2 diabetes in people at high risk. It is also used in occupational health settings and internationally through the publicly available QDiabetes website (). A recent update to the NICE guideline on diabetes prevention in 2017 has highlighted several conditions associated with increased diabetes risk that may not be fully captured by QDiabetes. These include polycystic ovary syndrome, gestational diabetes, learning disabilities, and mental health problems. Furthermore, there is now good evidence from both clinical trials and observational studies that atypical antipsychotics and statins are associated with an increased risk of diabetes. These factors are not specifically identified within QDiabetes, which may result in under-estimation of risk in the relevant patient groups. Once patients with an increased risk of developing diabetes have been identified using a diabetes risk assessment tool such as QDiabetes, then guidelines recommend they undergo a blood glucose test, either for glycated haemoglobin (HBA1c) or fasting blood glucose. This is to determine who already has diabetes; who is at high risk of progression to type 2 diabetes, and who is at moderate risk. International guidelines differ about which thresholds of fasting blood glucose and HBA1c to use to define the high risk group, mainly because of a lack of population based data on which to base the analyses. For example, American guidelines recommend a fasting blood glucose concentration of 5.6-6.9 mmol/L or HBA1c value of 39-46 mmol/mol (5.7-6.4%). UK guidelines recommend a fasting blood glucose concentration of 5.5-6.9 mmol/L or HBA1c value of 42-47 mmol/mol (6.0-6.4%). Widely used risk assessment tools do not incorporate the results of either blood test, making it difficult to provide patients with an accurate estimation of their absolute level of risk after a blood test. We therefore derived and validated a new version of the equation (QDiabetes-2018) to determine whether these factors should be incorporated into the equation and how they could be used to improve the estimation of diabetes risk and communication with patients as well as improve the design of population based diabetes risk assessment strategies. We undertook a cohort study in a large population of primary care patients in England who were registered with practices contributing to the QResearch database (version 42). EMIS Health is the leading commercial supplier of general practice computer systems in the UK and is used by approximately 4400 practices. This is around 58% of all 7613 general practices in England (NHS Information Centre, March 2016). Of these, 1503 (34.2%) contribute to the QResearch database. We included all English practices contributing to QResearch who had been using their EMIS Health computer system for at least a year. We randomly allocated three quarters of practices to the derivation dataset and the remaining quarter to a validation dataset. We identified an open cohort of patients aged 25-84 years registered with practices between 1 January 2005 and 31 December 2016. We excluded patients who did not have a postcode related Townsend score (these usually result from patients moving to newly built houses with new postcodes not yet linked to deprivation data, or from patients being homeless or not having a permanent residence) and those with pre-existing type 1 or type 2 diabetes. We also excluded those with a fasting blood glucose concentration of 7 mmol/L or more or HBA1c value of 48 mmol/mol or more as these patients might be in the process of having further tests to confirm a diagnosis of diabetes. For each patient we determined an entry date to the cohort, which was the latest of the following: 25th birthday, date of registration with the practice plus one year, date on which the practice computer system was installed plus one year, and the beginning of the study period (1 January 2005). Patients were censored at the earliest date of the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, death, deregistration with the practice, last upload of computerised data, or the study end date (31 December 2016). Our primary outcome measure was the first (incident) diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus as recorded on the general practice computer records. We identified patients with diabetes by searching the electronic health record for diagnostic Read codes for diabetes (C10%). As in other studies, we classified patients as having type 2 diabetes if they had a diagnosis of diabetes and had not been prescribed insulin aged less than 35 years. We examined the following predictor variables based on established risk factors already included in the current version of QDiabetes-2017 and new candidate variables highlighted in the literature or NICE guidelines. Where diagnoses are mentioned, these relate to diagnostic codes recorded in the patients’ electronic health record on or before the study entry date. Existing variables from QDiabetes (current 2017 version) • Deprivation (as measured by the Townsend score, where higher values indicate higher levels of material deprivation) • Smoking status: non-smoker, former smoker, light smoker (1-9/day), moderate smoker (10-19/day), heavy smoker (≥20/day) • Family history of diabetes in a first degree relative • Cardiovascular disease (ischaemic heart disease, stroke, or transient ischaemic attack) • Treated hypertension (diagnosis of hypertension and current treatment with at least one antihypertensive drug) • Corticosteroids ( chapter 6.3.2, including oral or injections of systemic prednisolone, betamethasone, cortisone, depo-medrone, dexamethasone, deflazacort, efcortesol, hydrocortisone, methylprednisolone, or triamcinolone) • Diagnosis of schizophrenia or bipolar affective disorder • Prescribed second generation “atypical” antipsychotics (including amisulpride, aripiprazole, clozapine, lurasidone, olanzapine, paliperidone, quetiapine, risperidone, sertindole, and zotepine) From the general practice record we extracted data on the demographic factors, clinical diagnoses, and clinical values. We selected the closest value to cohort entry for body mass index, smoking status, fasting blood glucose level, and HBA1c level, restricting to values recorded before baseline. Use of drugs at baseline was defined as at least two prescriptions in total, with the most recent one no more than 28 days before the date of entry to the cohort. All other predictor variables were based on the latest information recorded in the general practice record before entry to the cohort. We developed and validated the risk prediction equations using established methods. An initial analysis was performed based on patients with complete data. We used multiple imputation with chained equations to replace missing values for body mass index, HBA1c, fasting blood glucose, and smoking status and used these values in our main analyses. So that the imputed values would better match the distribution of observed values, we log transformed values for continuous variables that were not normally distributed for inclusion in the imputation model. In that model we included all predictor variables, along with the Nelson-Aalen estimator of the baseline cumulative hazard, and the outcome indicator. We carried out five imputations, as this has a relatively high efficiency and was a pragmatic approach accounting for the size of the datasets and capacity of the available servers and software. The same imputed dataset was used for all the derivation analyses. To estimate the coefficients for each risk factor in men and women separately we used Cox’s proportional hazards models. We used Rubin’s rules to combine the results across the imputed datasets. We used fractional polynomials to model non-linear risk relations with continuous variables. We selected second degree fractional polynomial terms derived using the data from patients with recorded values. Before running the Cox models we applied the fractional polynomial terms to the imputed data. Initially we fitted full models. For consistency, we included variables from existing QDiabetes models and then retained additional variables if they had an adjusted hazard ratio of less than 0.90 or more than 1.10 (for binary variables) and were statistically significant at the 0.01 level. We used these criteria in conjunction with clinical judgment to ensure that candidate variables were likely to be clinically important and to reduce the possibility of including weak or uninformative predictors that could lead to model over-fitting and optimism. We examined interactions between new predictor variables and age at study entry and included significant interactions in the final models along with interactions already included in the current version of QDiabetes. To compare fit and performance of different models in the derivation cohort we used Akaikes Information Criterion. We developed three main models. Model A included the variables in the existing QDiabetes models and the additional variables that met our inclusion criteria but did not include either fasting blood glucose or HBA1c. Model B is the same as model A except that it included fasting blood glucose but not HBA1c. Model C is the same as model A except that it included HBA1c but not fasting blood glucose. We used the regression coefficients for each variable from the final models as weights, which we combined with non-parametric estimates of the baseline survivor function, evaluated for each year up to 10 years to derive risk equations over 10 years of follow-up. This enabled us to derive risk estimates for each year of follow-up, with a specific focus on 10 year risk estimates. We estimated the baseline survivor function based on zero values of centred continuous variables, with all binary predictor values set to zero. In the validation cohort we used multiple imputation to replace missing values for body mass index, fasting blood glucose, HBA1c, and smoking status. We carried out five imputations. The risk equations for men and women obtained from the derivation cohort were then applied to the validation cohort and measures of discrimination calculated. As in previous studies, we calculated the D statistic (a measure of discrimination where higher values indicate better discrimination), R value (explained variation where higher values indicate a greater proportion of variation explained by the model in time to diagnosis of type 2 diabetes) based on Royston’s D statistic, and Harrell’s C statistic at 10 years and combined these across datasets using Rubin’s rules. Harrell’s C statistic is a measure of discrimination similar to the receiver operating characteristic statistic but takes account of the censored nature of the data. Calibration was assessed by comparing the mean predicted risks at 10 years with the observed risk by 10th of predicted risk. The observed risks were obtained using the Kaplan-Meier estimates evaluated at 10 years. We also evaluated performance by subgroups for each age band (<40, 40-59, ≥60 years), ethnic minority group, and comorbidity and treatment group. We calculated calibration slopes. Performance was also evaluated by calculating Harrell’s C statistics in individual general practices and combining the results using meta-analytical techniques. By applying each equation to the validation dataset we compared performance statistics for the new QDiabetes-2018 models with the latest version of QDiabetes (2017 version). For model A we calculated sensitivity, specificity, and observed risks at different risk thresholds in the validation cohort. We also compared performance of the models with current recommendations from the “two step” approach recommended in the NICE guidance “Preventing type 2 diabetes risk” and the NHS Health Checks best practice guideline. Step 1 currently involves using a risk assessment tool such as QDiabetes to identify “high risk” patients, where high risk is defined for QDiabetes as those who have a 10 year risk of type 2 diabetes of 5.6% or greater. This threshold appears to have been selected predominantly to optimise sensitivity (ie, to avoid missing cases of type 2 diabetes). Step 2 involves a blood test for those identified at high risk to assess whether they have undiagnosed type 2 diabetes, and in the remaining patients to more accurately stratify their risk of progression to diabetes. This blood test can be either for fasting blood glucose or for HBA1c in high risk patients to classify patients into one of three groups: fasting blood glucose ≥7 mmol/L or HBA1c ≥48 mmol/mol = diagnosis of diabetes (or further testing required for confirmation if patient has no symptoms); fasting blood glucose 5.5-6.9 mmol/L or HBA1c 42-47 mmol/mol = “high risk of diabetes” for intensive lifestyle advice or intervention programme; and fasting blood glucose <5.5 mmol/L or HBA1c <42 mmol/mol = “moderate risk of diabetes” for simple lifestyle advice. The updated QDiabetes models were designed to support such an approach, with model A intended to identify patients with an increased risk for whom a blood test could be done. The two further models (model B including fasting blood glucose and model C including HBA1c) could then be used to refine the risk assessment tool once the relevant blood test result was available. Risk assessment at this point could also allow communication of a more accurate risk estimate for patients to inform their decision making and management plans. To compare performance of the models with current recommendations, we calculated the sensitivity for four different strategies for classifying patients as high risk of progression for diabetes using the validation cohort. Patients were classified as at high risk if they had an initial 10 year QDiabetes risk score of 5.6% or more (using model A) and (i) they had a fasting blood glucose concentration between 5.5 and 6.9 mmol/L (strategy 1), (ii) an HBA1c value between 42 and 47 mmol/mol (strategy 2), (iii) a risk score in the top 28% of risk scores using model B (which includes fasting blood glucose values) to correspond to the number of high risk patients for strategy 1 (strategy 3), and (iv) a risk score in the top 28% of risk scores using model C (which includes HBA1c values) to correspond to the number of high risk patients for strategies 1 and 3 (strategy 4). To evaluate the net benefits of the updated risk equations we used decision curve analysis in the validation cohort. This approach assesses the benefits of correctly detecting people who will develop type 2 diabetes compared with the harms from a false positive classification (which could lead to unnecessary intervention). The net benefit of a risk equation at a given risk threshold is given by calculating the difference between the proportion of true positives and the proportion of false positives multiplied by the odds defined by the risk threshold value. We calculated the net benefits of models A, B, and C across a range of threshold probabilities and compared these with alternative strategies, such as assuming no patients will develop type 2 diabetes (no intervention) or assuming all patients will develop type 2 diabetes (intervention in all patients). In general, the strategy with the highest net benefit at any given risk threshold is considered to have the most clinical value. To maximise the power and generalisability of the results, we used all the relevant patients on the database. Stata (version 14) was used for all analyses. We adhered to the TRIPOD statement for reporting. Since the original publication of QDiabetes-2009 there has been public stakeholder discussion about methods for assessment of diabetes risk as part of the development of the NICE guidance and NHS Health Checks. We therefore decided to focus on issues already identified in NICE guidance and the literature. We decided it would be more effective to discuss the addition of new variables once the paper was published and the relative importance of individual risk factors has been quantified. Given the widespread implementation of QDiabetes within the NHS and its inclusion in guidelines, this would allow for feedback from stakeholders (including patient groups and charities) as to which changes would be most beneficial and how improvements might be implemented. Overall, 1457 QResearch practices in England met our inclusion criteria (96.9% of all practices contributing to QResearch). Of these, three quarters (n=1094) were randomly assigned to the derivation dataset, with the remaining quarter (n=363) assigned to a validation cohort. We identified 8 640 363 patients in the derivation cohort aged 25-84 years of whom we sequentially excluded 26 602 (0.3%) who did not have a recorded Townsend score, 34 195 (0.4%) who had a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes at baseline, 342 858 (4.0%) who had a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes at baseline, 23 522 (0.3%) with a fasting blood glucose concentration of 7 mmol/L or more at baseline, and 26 481 (0.3%) with a HBA1c value of 48 mmol/mol or more at baseline. This left 8 186 705 for the derivation analysis. We identified 2 779 075 patients in the validation cohort aged 25-84 years of whom we sequentially excluded 7971 (0.3%) who did not have a recorded Townsend score, 11 076 (0.4%) who had a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes at baseline, 113 653 (4.1%) who had a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes at baseline, 7758 (0.3%) with a fasting blood glucose of 7 mmol/L or more, and 8677 (0.3%) with a HBA1c concentration of 48 mmol/mol or more at baseline. This left 2 629 940 for the validation analysis. Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of men and women in the derivation and validation cohorts. In the derivation cohort, the mean age was 44.9 (SD 15.3) years, and 4 062 142 (49.6%) were men. Self assigned ethnicity was recorded in 5 933 548 (72.5%), smoking status in 7 834 644 (95.7%), body mass index in 6 482 691 (79.2%), fasting blood glucose in 1 189 398 (14.5%), and HBA1c in 506 776 (6.2%). In total, 6 453 196 (78.8%) had complete information for smoking status and body mass index, and 1 367 483 (16.7%) had complete information for smoking, body mass index, and either fasting blood glucose or HBA1c. These values were similar to corresponding values in the validation cohort (table 1). Baseline characteristics of adults aged 25-84 without diabetes at study entry.

For the new variables of interest: 58 655 (0.7%) patients in the derivation cohort were prescribed atypical antipsychotics, 526 969 (6.4%) were prescribed statins, schizophrenia or bipolar affective disorder was recorded in 62 014 (0.8%), learning disability was recorded in 56 092 (0.7%), gestational diabetes in 17 214 (0.4% of women), and polycystic ovary syndrome in 81 164 (2.0% of women). Supplementary table 1a shows the distribution of risk factors by ethnic group in the derivation cohort. Testing for fasting blood glucose and HBA1c was higher among all non-white ethnic groups other than Chinese compared with the white or not recorded group. Compared with the other ethnic groups, people of South Asian and Caribbean origin tended to have marginally higher mean HBA1c values, and higher proportions had a family history of diabetes. Supplementary table 1b shows similar information for patients with fasting blood glucose or HBA1c recorded compared with those without a value for either test. Table 2 shows the numbers of patients with a new diagnosis of type 2 diabetes during follow-up in the derivation and validation cohorts. In the derivation cohort, we identified 178 314 incident cases of type 2 diabetes arising from 42.7 million person years of observation. Supplementary table 2 shows a breakdown by nine ethnic groups. For example, 6181 incident cases of type 2 diabetes for men and women of Indian ethnicity arose from 795 000 person years of observation. Incidence of type 2 diabetes per 1000 person years with 95% confidence intervals in derivation and validation cohorts The median follow-up in the derivation cohort was 3.90 years (interquartile range 1.54 to 8.50). Overall, 2 027 279 patients had 10 or more years of follow-up. The median follow-up in the validation cohort was 4.22 years (1.57 to 9.25). Overall, 602 661 patients had 10 or more years of follow-up. Table 3 shows the adjusted hazard ratios for models A, B, and C in women in the derivation cohort. Table 4 shows the corresponding values for men. Adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence interval) for type 2 diabetes in women in the derivation cohort for models A, B, and C Adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence interval) for type 2 diabetes in men in the derivation cohort for models A, B, and C Of the new risk factors, all met our model inclusion criteria. Model A includes the variables: age, ethnicity, deprivation, body mass index, smoking status, family history of diabetes in a first degree relative, cardiovascular disease, treated hypertension, corticosteroids, atypical antipsychotics, statins, schizophrenia or bipolar affective disorder, and learning disability. The model in women also included gestational diabetes and polycystic ovary syndrome. Model B is the same as model A except it includes fasting blood glucose. Model C is the same as model A except it includes HBA1c. Supplementary figure S1 shows graphs of the adjusted hazard ratios for models A and B for the fractional polynomial terms for age and body mass index as well as the interaction terms between age and relevant predictor variables as listed in the footnotes of tables 3 and 4. Supplementary figure S1 also shows graphs of the adjusted hazard ratios for fasting blood glucose in model B and HBA1c in model C and their interactions with age. For the new variables of interest in model A, atypical antipsychotics were associated with a 74% (95% confidence interval 60% to 89%) increased risk of type 2 diabetes in women and a 52% (40% to 65%) increased risk for men; statins were associated with a 93% (84% to 103%) increased risk in women and a 79% (74% to 86%) increased risk in men; schizophrenia or bipolar affective disorder was associated with a 30% (21% to 39%) increased risk in women and a 26% (18% to 34%) increased risk in men; learning disability was associated with a 32% (19% to 46%) increased risk in women and a 26% (16% to 38%) increased risk in men. Gestational diabetes was associated with a 359% (332% to 388%) increased risk in women and polycystic ovary syndrome was associated with a 41% (33% to 49%) increased risk. Where there were age interactions, these values relate to risks evaluated at the mean ages. The footnotes for tables 3 and 4 contain the full list of age interactions for each model. In both men and women, among the new variables there were statistically significant interactions between age and learning disability, age and atypical antipsychotics, age and statins, and age and fasting blood glucose (model B), and between age and HBA1c (model C). Hazard ratios for learning disability, atypical antipsychotics and statins, body mass index, and family history of diabetes were higher at younger ages compared with older ages (supplementary figure S1c-g). For example, for model B in men, statins were associated with a 141% increased risk at age 35, a 66% increased risk at age 45, a 30% increased risk at age 55, and a 15% increased risk at age 65 (supplementary figure S1d). Overall the hazard ratios for models B and C tended to be lower than those for model A. The hazard ratios for non-white ethnic groups tended to be lower for model C than for model B. For example, the hazard ratio for Bangladeshi women was 6.07 (5.77 to 6.38) for model A, 4.45 (4.20 to 4.73) for model B, and 3.30 (3.10 to 3.52) for model C. Supplementary tables 3 and 4 show the results of the complete case analysis for each of the three models. The adjusted hazard ratios for models A and B are broadly similar to the analysis based on imputed data. Table 5 shows the performance of each equation in the validation cohort for women and men for each of models A, B, and C compared with the current QDiabetes model. All models had good calibration and high levels of explained variation and discrimination. Model B had the best overall performance, followed by model C. Model A has a similar performance to the current QDiabetes models. Performance of all models was marginally better among women than among men. Performance of models A, B, and C compared with current QDiabetes-2017 model in validation cohort in men and women In women, model A explained 50.5% of the variation in time to diagnosis of type 2 diabetes (R), the D statistic was 2.07, and the Harrell’s C statistic was 0.834. The corresponding values for model A in men were 46.6%, 1.91, and 0.814. In women, model B explained 63.3% of the variation in time to diagnosis of type 2 diabetes (R), the D statistic was 2.69, and the Harrell’s C statistic was 0.889. The corresponding values for model B in men were 58.4%, 2.42, and 0.866. In women, model C explained 60.3% of the variation in time to diagnosis of type 2 diabetes (R), the D statistic was 2.52, and the Harrell’s C statistic was 0.878. The corresponding values for model C in men were 55.5%, 2.28, and 0.855. In addition, we calculated Harrell’s C statistics for model B on the subgroup of patients with complete data for fasting blood glucose and for model C on those with complete data for HBA1c. The results for model B were 0.836 for women and 0.812 for men. The corresponding results for model C were 0.772 and 0.738. Supplementary table 5 shows the D, R, and Harrell’s C statistics for models A and B for women in various subgroups, including three age groups, ethnic groups, and those with specific morbidities. Supplementary table 6 shows the corresponding values for men. The best performance by ethnic group was for model B among Chinese women (R=68.0%, D=2.99, Harrell’s C=0.912). The poorest performance by ethnic group was for model A among Bangladeshi women (R=35.6%, D=1.52, Harrell’s C=0.776). Performance values were highest in the youngest age group (<40 years) and lowest in the oldest age group (≥60 years) for both models. Supplementary figure S2a-d shows plots of Harrell’s C statistic for models A and B in men and women across the 363 practices in the validation cohort. The plots show Harrell’s C values for each general practice versus the number of patients with a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes in each practice. Practices with fewer patients with a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes had wider variation in C statistic than practices with more diagnoses. For example, supplementary figure 2a shows the summary (average) C statistic for model A in women was 0.834 from a random effects meta-analysis. The I value (ie, the percentage of total variation in C statistic due to heterogeneity between practices) was 90.1%. The approximate 95% prediction interval for the true C statistic in women in a new practice was 0.72 to 0.94. Supplementary figure 2c shows the corresponding results for model B in women (summary C statistic=0.891, I=77.5%, 95% prediction interval 0.83 to 0.96). In women, the mean 10 year predicted risk was 3.62% for model A and 3.42% for model B. The observed 10 year risk was 4.21% (95% confidence interval 4.16% to 4.26%). In men, the mean 10 year predicted risk was 4.97% for model A and 4.71% for model B. The observed 10 year risk was 5.56% (5.48% to 5.61%). Figure 1 shows the mean predicted risks and observed risks at 10 years by 10th of predicted risk, applying models A, B, and C to all men and women in the validation cohort. Supplementary table 7 shows values of the calibration slope overall and by subgroup for models A and B. For example, the calibration slope for model A was 0.997 (0.986 to 1.008) in women and 0.986 (0.976 to 0.996) in men. For model B, the corresponding values were 0.993 (0.978 to 1.007) and 0.985 (0.975 to 0.996). The close correspondence between the mean predicted risks and the observed risks within each model 10th for each model indicates that the equations were well calibrated overall and by age group. Calibration within subgroups was variable, although it tended to be better for model B than for model A (see supplementary table 7).  Predicted and observed 10 year risk of diabetes using models A, B, and C Figure 2 compares four strategies for identifying high risk patients based on current recommendations from the NHS Health Checks best practice guide (strategies 1 and 2) and risk assessment using models B and C in combination with model A (strategies 3 and 4). It shows that in the validation cohort for the patients identified as high risk using model A then strategy 3 (based on model B) was the most sensitive when equal sized groups are compared since it identified 28 953 (67.3%) of the 43 010 patients with a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes during 10 years follow-up who were classified as high risk at step 1 (and 49.8% of all 58 130 patients with a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes during 10 years follow-up in the whole validation cohort). Strategy 1 (based on a fasting blood glucose concentration of 5.5-6.9 mmol/L) identified 27 459 (63.8% of 43 010 and 47.2% of 58 130) and strategy 4 (based on model C) identified 27 061 (62.9% of 43 010 and 46.6% of 58 130) patients with a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes during 10 years follow-up. Strategy 2 (based on HBA1c values of 42-47 mmol/mol) identified a lower proportion of high risk patients (19.1%) and the least proportion of patients with a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes during 10 years follow-up, with only 20 037 (46.6% of 43 010 and 34.5% of 58 130) identified.  Comparison of four strategies for identifying patients at high risk of developing diabetes. FBG=fasting blood glucose Supplementary table 8 shows the total population, number of cases of type 2 diabetes identified during follow-up, and the sensitivity, specificity, and observed risk at different thresholds of risk for model A. For example, using a 10 year risk threshold of 11.1% would identify the top 10% of patients with the highest risk of diabetes using model A. At this threshold, the sensitivity was 45.9%, specificity 90.8%, and observed risk 19.3% (95% confidence interval 19.1% to 19.5%). Using a risk threshold of 6.6% (the top 20%) the corresponding values would be 68.1%, 81.1%, and 14.3%. The thresholds for models B and C will vary according to the strategy chosen for the initial identification of patients using model A so are not presented here. Figures 3 and 4 are screenshots of the updated web calculator with several clinical examples to show how QDiabetes-2018 could be used within a consultation. Example 1 (figure 3) shows that a white woman aged 40 years with a body mass index of 30 kg/m and a family history of diabetes has a 10 year estimated risk of type 2 diabetes of 3.6%. If she has polycystic ovary syndrome, her risk is 5.0%. If she also has had gestational diabetes, her risk is 21.1%. If she also has schizophrenia, her risk is 26.5%. If she has a fasting glucose value of 5.5 mmol/L, her 10 year risk is 13.7%. If her fasting glucose was 6.2 mmol/L, her risk would be 67.7%. Example 2 (figure 4) is for a Pakistani man aged 35 who has a body mass index of 30 kg/m. He also has schizophrenia and is prescribed atypical antipsychotics. His 10 year estimated risk of type 2 diabetes is 15.6%. If he is prescribed a statin his 10 year risk is 35.5%. If he has a HBA1c value of 35 mmol/mol, his 10 year risk is 16.8%.  Clinical example 1: Using QDiabetes to calculate absolute risk of diabetes in a female patient. TIA=transient ischaemic attack  Clinical example 2: Using QDiabetes to calculate absolute risk of diabetes in a male patient. TIA=transient ischaemic attack Figure 5 displays the net benefit curves for men and women. These show that the prediction equations for models A, B, and C had higher net benefit than strategies based on considering either no patients or all patients for intervention across a range of thresholds, and these are useful up to an absolute risk threshold of approximately 40%. Model B had slightly improved net benefit compared with model C and both were better than model A. We have developed and validated updated equations to predict the 10 year risk of type 2 diabetes (QDiabetes-2017) in men and women aged 25 to 84 years. The equations incorporate established predictor variables as well as new risk factors associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Three models were produced: model A includes existing risk factors (age, ethnicity, deprivation, body mass index, smoking, family history of diabetes in a first degree relative, cardiovascular disease, treated hypertension, and regular use of corticosteroids) and new risk factors (atypical antipsychotics, statins, schizophrenia or bipolar affective disorder, learning disability, gestational diabetes, and polycystic ovary syndrome). The inclusion of these new risk factors will help ensure more accurate estimation of the level of risk in the affected population to improve information for individual patients and for surveillance strategies. Although the new models are more complex than the existing models, this is unlikely to affect the uptake of the new models as they are all designed to be calculated automatically based on information recorded in the electronic patient record. Figures 3 and 4 included case studies where the impact of additional risk factors for an example patient would lead to different management. For individuals, the presence of these new risk factors could substantially increase their absolute risks of diabetes. These changes in absolute risk could push individuals over a risk threshold, which may then result in different clinical management. However, the actual numbers of people in these groups are comparatively small, so the discrimination statistics are too crude to be able to detect these effects in individuals. In addition, we have developed two further models, which include blood test results in addition to the risk factors from model A. Model B includes fasting blood glucose and model C includes glycated haemoglobin (HBA1c) as continuous values. This approach improves on current approaches using fixed thresholds for fasting blood glucose or HBA1c, as it takes other risk factors into account and allows a more precise estimation of risk to be communicated to patients. The new models can be used to support the two step approach to the identification of patients at high risk of diabetes, as recommended by NICE guidance and the NHS Health Checks. Model A could be used to identify those at high risk of diabetes who require a test for fasting blood glucose or HBA1c. After identifying those patients who meet the criteria for a diagnosis of diabetes, model B could be used to refine the risk estimation in the remaining patients once the result of the fasting blood glucose test is known, since this information provides a more accurate assessment of risk. Similarly, model C could be used when the HBA1c test result is known. Model B had better discrimination and explained more of the variation in time to diagnosis of diabetes than model C. Model B also had the highest sensitivity for identifying cases of diabetes (fig 2), identifying more than two thirds of cases in those determined as being high risk at step 1 compared with the current NHS strategy based on bands of HBA1c that had the lowest sensitivity. Model B also had the highest net benefit, as shown by the decision analysis curve in figure 5, although it was only a small improvement on model C. The strategy based on model B identified a high risk group of 6.7% of the validation cohort, which included nearly half (49.8%) of all patients with a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes over 10 years. Overall, use of model B in strategy 3 and model C in strategy 4 (fig 2) gives more accurate predictions of the future diabetes risk among those tested compared with either strategy 1 or 2 based on blood tests alone. The hazard ratios for the new risk variables included in our final models are similar in both magnitude and direction to those reported in other studies. Antipsychotics, mental health problems, and learning disabilities—Recent published NICE guidance on identification of people at risk of type 2 diabetes highlights the increased risk associated with learning disabilities and mental health problems. Learning disabilities affected approximately 1% of our derivation cohort and were associated with a 32% increased risk of diabetes in women and 26% increased risk in men at the mean age (model A). This is consistent with other studies and is likely to be related to adverse lifestyle factors, including lack of exercise. Schizophrenia or bipolar affective disorder also affected approximately 1% of patients and was associated with a 30% increased risk of diabetes in women and a 26% increased risk in men. Atypical antipsychotics were prescribed for approximately 1% of patients. They were associated with a 74% increased risk of diabetes in women and 52% increased risk in men. This is independent of the risk associated with schizophrenia or bipolar affective disorder, and hence if patients have both factors there will be a compound effect on risk of diabetes. The magnitude of this increased risk was consistent with other studies. Although the prevalence of each of these conditions is approximately 1%, the magnitude of the effect is substantial and likely to represent an important clinical problem for patients. Clinicians will now be able to use QDiabetes-2018 to provide better information to these patients about both the potential effects of atypical antipsychotics and the interventions to reduce the risk of diabetes. —The increased risk of type 2 diabetes associated with statin use is established. A meta-analysis of 13 statin trials reported a 9% (95% confidence interval 2% to 17%) increased risk. The risk associated with statin use was higher in our study than in the trials, which may reflect targeting of statins towards those who are already at higher risk of diabetes. Also, the participants in the meta-analysis trials were substantially older (mean age 65 years) than our study participants (mean age 45 years). When similar age groups are compared, the magnitude of the increased risk associated with statins in our study is broadly comparable with that reported in the meta-analysis of clinical trials, reflecting the interaction between age and statin use. While the magnitude of the diabetes risk associated with statins was of similar magnitude to the increased risk found for atypical antipsychotic drugs, the public health implications may be greater because statins are one of the most commonly prescribed medicines internationally and are targeted at those who already have adverse cardiovascular risk profiles. However, the increased diabetes risk with statins needs to be balanced against the potential reduction in coronary events, making the provision of accurate information on risks and benefits of statins even more important. Gestational diabetes and polycystic ovary syndrome—We studied two risk factors (gestational diabetes and polycystic ovary syndrome) that only occur in women. Polycystic ovary syndrome is known to be associated with an increased prevalence of diabetes. It has recently been identified as a risk factor for type 2 diabetes. We found that polycystic ovary syndrome affected 2% of women at baseline, and it was associated with a 41% increased risk in model A. We also found that gestational diabetes was associated with a 4.6-fold increased risk of diabetes, confirming that it is one of the strongest risk factors for the subsequent development of type 2 diabetes. Although recent NICE guidance on diabetes in pregnancy in 2008 and 2015 recommends annual blood glucose testing postnatally for women with a diagnosis of gestational diabetes, only 20% of such women receive regular screening in primary care. The inclusion of both polycystic ovary syndrome and gestational diabetes in QDiabetes-2018 will ensure the presence of an automated integrated tool available in general practice computer systems to alert clinicians to these patients’ increased risk of diabetes and facilitate proactive follow-up in primary care. Comparison with original version of QDiabetes-2009—Our first QDiabetes model, published in 2009, was based on a cohort followed up between 1993 and 2008. Since then improvements have been made to the QResearch database used to derive the equation, which may have resulted in changes to the model. For example, the number of practices contributing to the database has almost tripled, from 531 in 2009 to 1465 in this study. The size of the derivation cohort has increased threefold, with 178 314 diagnoses of type 2 diabetes arising from 42.7 million person years of observation compared with 78 081 diagnoses of type 2 diabetes arising from 16.4 million person years in 2009. The recorded prevalence of family history of diabetes has increased by 50%, rising from 9.9% to 14.9%. The baseline prevalence of treated hypertension and corticosteroids have each doubled. The recording of self assigned ethnicity has increased threefold, from 24% to 72.5% in the current study. As a result, we have many more events within the various subgroups. This is reflected in the more precise hazard ratios with tighter confidence intervals and improved performance statistics. Interestingly, the hazard ratios by ethnic group varied between the different models, with models B and C tending to have lower values for non-white ethnic groups compared with model A. The discrimination statistics were, however, broadly similar. Overall, the new models are well calibrated when applied to a separate validation cohort and have high levels of discrimination. Although model A had similar performance to the current QDiabetes model, the other two models showed considerable improvement, with the best overall performance for model B. The methods to derive and validate these models are broadly the same as for a range of other clinical risk prediction tools derived from the QResearch database. The strengths and limitations of the approach have already been discussed in detail. In summary, key strengths include size, duration of follow-up, representativeness, and lack of selection, recall, and respondent bias. UK general practices have good levels of accuracy and completeness in recording clinical diagnoses and prescribed drugs. Our study included approximately 20% of all general practices in England, and the characteristics of the population registered with QResearch are similar to the population registered with other large general practice databases using other clinical computer systems. It is therefore likely to be representative of the population overall, especially since approximately 98% of the UK population is registered with a general practice. Of all the patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes excluded at baseline, 9.1% were classified as having type 1 diabetes, which is consistent with other studies using different approaches.We think our study has good face validity as it has been conducted in the setting where most patients in the UK are assessed, treated, and followed up. Limitations of our study include the lack of formal adjudication of diagnoses, information bias, and potential for bias because of missing data. Fractional polynomial terms were identified using complete rather than imputed data. This may have resulted in some bias or less power to detect non-linear trends. Only 16% of patients had complete data for blood glucose measurements, smoking, and body mass index. However, the characteristics of patients and the magnitude of the hazard ratios on the complete case analysis were broadly similar for both magnitude and direction to the analysis based on imputed data (results shown in supplementary tables 3 and 4), which is reassuring. We used five imputations, which may be fewer than recommended because of practical considerations given the huge size of the dataset. However, given the high degree of missing data for models B and C, additional external validation of these models in datasets with more completely collected data would be valuable before the models are used in clinical practice. Some under-ascertainment of diagnoses of type 2 diabetes might be present leading to misclassification bias for the outcome. This is because not all patients will have consulted their general practitioner during the study period and been screened for diabetes. Similarly, there may be under-ascertainment of some of the predictor variables such as polycystic ovary syndrome and gestational diabetes, as the baseline prevalence is lower than in other studies. This may be because gestational diabetes had not been diagnosed or that the diagnosis had not been recorded on the general practice electronic health record. Another limitation is that we have not been able to use oral glucose tolerance testing as a predictor variable as the results of these tests are not stored routinely in the general practice record. We have not taken account of competing risks in this analysis because the results can be counterintuitive and difficult to use in clinical practice. However, not accounting for the competing risk of death in elderly patients is likely to result in risk estimates that are too high in this age group. We excluded patients without a valid deprivation score as this group may represent a more transient population where follow-up could be unreliable or unrepresentative. Their deprivation scores are unlikely to be missing at random so we did not think it would be appropriate to impute them. Some overfitting might have occurred, but this is unlikely given the large number of events. Generally, to avoid overfitting it is recommended that there are at least 10 events per predictor variable, including the interaction terms. Our most complex model (model C in women) had 45 predictor variables. Our derivation sample had 178 314 events, giving 3962 events per predictor variable, which is nearly 400 times the minimum recommended level. The present validation has been done on a randomly selected separate set of practices and individuals to those that were used to develop the score, although the practices all use the same general practice clinical computer system (EMIS, the computer system used by 58% of general practices in England). Some researchers argue that a split sample validation is not necessary when the sample is large enough, as in our study. Others argue that a split sample validation is still valuable. However, since randomly splitting a huge dataset is likely to result in similar populations, it is preferable to split by time or geographical location to obtain a a non-random selection of practices covering a broader range of settings. An independent external validation study would be a more stringent test and should be done, but when such studies have examined QDiabetesand other risk equations, they have shown comparable performance to the validation in the QResearch database. We have published the source code to enable accurate implementation of QDiabetes-2018 on the QDiabetes website () alongside earlier versions of the score from previous updates. The rationale for this is to ensure that those interested in reviewing or using the open source will then be able to find the latest available version as the score continues to be updated. We have developed updated risk equations (QDiabetes-2018) to quantify absolute risks of type 2 diabetes in people aged 25-84 years, which include established risk factors and new risk factors: atypical antipsychotics, statins, schizophrenia or bipolar affective disorder, learning disability, gestational diabetes, and polycystic ovary syndrome. The updated risk equations provide valid measures of absolute risk in the general population of patients, as shown by the performance in a separate validation cohort. The addition of fasting blood glucose to the updated model (model B) had the best discrimination and sensitivity and potentially improves on currently available risk assessment approaches to identify those at risk of diabetes. Methods to identify those at increased risk of type 2 diabetes are needed to identify patients for whom interventions or more frequent assessment may be required QDiabetes is currently widely used to estimate 10 year risk of type 2 diabetes in people aged 25-84 years both to communicate risk to patients and to identify patients at high risk for interventions and active surveillance QDiabetes does not include some well established risk factors and so will underestimate risk in these patients It also does not include fasting blood glucose or HBA1c values Updated algorithms (QDiabetes-2018) were developed to quantify absolute risks of type 2 diabetes in adults aged 25-84, which include established risk factors and new risk factors such as atypical antipsychotics, statins, schizophrenia or bipolar affective disorder, learning disability, gestational diabetes, and polycystic ovary syndrome, and also can incorporate fasting blood glucose and HBA1c values The updated risk algorithms provide valid measures of absolute risk in the general population of patients as shown by the performance in a separate validation cohort The model that includes fasting blood glucose had the best discrimination and the highest sensitivity compared with current recommended practice in the NHS based on bands of either fasting blood glucose or HBA1c A simple web calculator () can be used to implement the QDiabetes-2018 algorithm.

b2cce79c-7636-405e-95ee-4bd7c03ff610,"Type 2 diabetes is the most common type of diabetes. It usually occurs in adults, but is increasingly seen in children and adolescents. In type 2 diabetes, there is a combination of inadequate production of insulin and an inability of the body to respond fully to insulin (insulin resistance). It is primarily influenced by lifestyle factors such as being overweight, poor diet, lack of physical activity, and excessive alcohol consumption. The association between coffee/caffeine consumption and diabetes is specific to type 2 diabetes only. For more information on the difference between type 1 and type 2 diabetes, please refer to the media facts and figures section. Europe has one of the highest prevalences of diabetes as about 60 million people have type 1 or type 2 diabetes, or about 10.3% of men and 9.6% of women aged 25 years and over. It is estimated that this figure will reach 71 million by 2040. In Europe, diabetes (types 1 and 2 collectively) caused 627,000 deaths in 2015: about one quarter (26.3%) of those deaths were in people under the age of 60.  Estimates indicate that diabetes was responsible for 9% of total health expenditure in Europe in 2015, equivalent to USD 156 billion. Age is an important risk factor for type 2 diabetes. In the Europe Region, 30.8% of the general population were aged between 50 and 79 in 2015 and this percentage is expected to increase to 35.6% by 2040. Once a disease of old age, diabetes is now increasingly affecting adolescents and children and the highest increase is in the 30-40 year-old age group. The twin epidemics of obesity and diabetes already represent the biggest public health challenge of the 21st century. It is estimated that at least half of all diabetes cases would be eliminated if weight gain in adults could be prevented. http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/noncommunicable-diseases/diabetes/data-and-statistics Several scientific studies show that moderate coffee consumption is associated with a reduced risk of developing type 2 diabetes. The association is documented in several different population groups and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes decreases as coffee consumption increases. Research suggests that drinking 3-4 cups of coffee per day is associated with an approximate 25% lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared to consuming none or less than 2 cups per day. Every additional cup of coffee, up to 6-8 cups per day, is associated with a 5-10% lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes. The effect is observed with both caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee. The mechanisms underlying the association between moderate coffee consumption and reduced risk of developing type 2 diabetes need further investigation. It is unlikely that caffeine is responsible for the effect since consumption of decaffeinated coffee is also linked to a reduced risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Recent research suggests that other coffee constituents, including as naturally-occurring antioxidants in coffee, may be involved. International Diabetes Federation, ‘Diabetes Atlas, 7th Edition’.

f4742e9f-71bb-4bc7-86ae-f2dbe4b99479,"Diabetes management for health professionals – Webinar Series Training for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Workers / Practitioners Women with are at a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes for more than 20 years after pregnancy. Whereas the risk for type 1 diabetes reduces after seven years. The prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and is increasing worldwide. A number of studies have shown that women with GDM are at high risk of developing diabetes later in life. In this latest study, out of Finland, researchers worked with 391 women who delivered a baby between 1984 and 1994. This included 363 women who were diagnosed with gestational diabetes through an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and 28 who were treated with insulin. The women were matched by age, parity and date of delivery with a control group. The women were asked to participate in a questionnaire in 1995 and 1996, between 1 and 11 years after their pregnancy. The questions included details about their GDM treatment, pre-pregnancy weight and height, progression to diabetes, time of diagnosis and medication. A follow-up questionnaire was conducted  in 2012 and 2013, when a total of 297 women with gestational diabetes and 297 matched controls participated. In the follow-up period, more than half of the women in the gestational diabetes group went on to develop either type 1 (5.7%) or type 2 (50.4%) diabetes. All the diagnoses occurred within 7 years of pregnancy, whereas type 2 diabetes diagnoses increased through the end of the study. A period of 20 years. Only 5.5% of women in the control group developed type 2 diabetes, and none developed type 1 diabetes. For the women who developed type 1 diabetes, the most predictive OGTT marker was a 2-hour glucose value at 11.9 mmol/L, which showed a sensitivity of 76.5% and specificity of 96%. For type 2 diabetes, the most predictive OGTT value was a fasting glucose at a level of 5.1 mmol/L, which showed a sensitivity of 63.5% and specificity of 68.2%. Researchers analyzed a subgroup of 48 women from the gestational diabetes cohort who had a fasting glucose of 7 mmol/L or higher or a 2-hour glucose of 11.1 mmol/L or higher during pregnancy Of these women, 46% developed type 2 diabetes and 27% developed type 1 diabetes. Participants who received therapy for their GDM diabetes had greater odds of receiving a diagnosis of type 1 or type 2 diabetes than those who did not receive insulin. For women  who were diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, only 1.2% did not have insulin therapy for their gestational diabetes. The sensitivity of insulin therapy to predict type 1 diabetes was 90.5% and for type 2 diabetes was 56.9%. The time to a diabetes diagnosis was also longer for women who were not treated with insulin. The researchers said that women with gestational diabetes, especially those on insulin treatment, should be carefully monitored for the first decade after the pregnancy, after which the risk for type 1 diabetes becomes negligible. However, the risk for type 2 diabetes remained and warranted an individualized, lifelong follow-up.

It is characterized by high levels of sugar in the blood. Type 2 diabetes is also called type 2 diabetes mellitus and adult-onset diabetes. However, more and more children and teens are developing this condition. Since type 2 diabetes is much more common than type 1 diabetes, it often is just called ""diabetes"". During digestion, food is broken down into basic components. Carbohydrates are broken down into simple sugars, primarily glucose. Glucose is a critically important source of energy for the body's cells. To provide energy to the cells, glucose needs to leave the blood and get inside the cells. Insulin traveling in the blood signals the cells to take up glucose. Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas. When levels of glucose in the blood rise (for example, after a meal), the pancreas produces more insulin. Type 2 diabetes occurs when your body's cells do not react efficiently to insulin. This condition is called insulin resistance. The cells do not accept as much glucose from the blood as they should. The cells resist the effects of insulin. As a result, glucose starts to build up in the blood. In people with insulin resistance, the pancreas ""sees"" the blood glucose level rising. The pancreas responds by making extra insulin to maintain a normal blood sugar. Over time, the body's insulin resistance gets worse. In response the pancreas makes more and more insulin. Finally, the pancreas gets ""exhausted"". It cannot keep up with the demand for more and more insulin. As a result, blood glucose levels stay high. Type 2 diabetes runs in families. It most often affects people who are older than 40. But type 2 diabetes is now being seen in more and more young people. Obesity greatly increases the risk of diabetes. The symptoms of diabetes are related to high blood glucose levels. They include: Increased susceptibility to infections, especially yeast or fungal infections Extremely high blood sugar levels also can lead to a dangerous complication called hyperosmolar syndrome. This is a life-threatening form of dehydration. In some cases, hyperosmolar syndrome is the first sign that a person has type 2 diabetes. It causes confused thinking, weakness, nausea and even seizure and coma. The treatment of type 2 diabetes also can produce symptoms, when it leads to the complication of low blood sugar (called hypoglycemia). People with type 2 diabetes take medications to reduce blood sugar. But these medications may cause sugar levels to drop below normal, particularly if someone has eaten less than usual. Symptoms of hypoglycemia include: Seizures and loss of consciousness (if hypoglycemia is not recognized and corrected) You can correct hypoglycemia by eating or drinking something that has carbohydrates. This raises your blood sugar level. Type 2 diabetes affects all parts of the body. It can cause serious, potentially life-threatening complications. These include: Atherosclerosis — Atherosclerosis is fat buildup in the artery walls. This can impair blood flow to the all the organs. The heart, brain and legs are most often affected. Retinopathy — Tiny blood vessels at the back of the eye become damaged by high blood sugar. Caught early, retinopathy damage can be minimized by tightly controlling blood sugar and using laser therapy. Untreated retinopathy can lead to blindness. Neuropathy — This is nerve damage. The most common type is peripheral neuropathy. The nerves to the legs are damaged first, causing pain and numbness in the feet. This can advance to cause symptoms in the legs and hands. Damage to the nerves that control digestion, sexual function and urination can also occur. Foot problems — Sores and blisters on the feet occur for two reasons: If peripheral neuropathy causes numbness, the person will not feel irritation in the foot. The skin can break down and form an ulcer. Blood circulation can be poor, leading to slow healing. Left untreated, a simple sore can become infected and very large. Nephropathy — Damage to the kidneys. This is more likely if blood sugars remain elevated and high blood pressure is not treated aggressively. Diabetes is diagnosed by testing the blood for sugar levels. Blood is tested in the morning after you have fasted overnight. Typically, the body keeps blood sugar levels between 70 and 100 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL), even after fasting. If a blood sugar level after fasting is greater than 125 mg/dL, diabetes is diagnosed. Your doctor will examine you to look for signs of diabetes complications. These include: Deposits of blood, or puffy yellow spots in the retina of your eyes Laboratory tests are also used routinely to evaluate diabetes. These include: Fasting glucose. A test of your blood sugar level after you have not eaten for several hours. Hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c). Indicates how close to average your blood glucose has been during the previous two months. Blood creatinine and urine microalbumin. Tests for evidence of kidney disease. Lipid profile. Measures levels of triglycerides and total, HDL, and LDL cholesterol. This evaluates the risk of atherosclerosis. Aging and episodic illness can cause the body's insulin resistance to increase. As a result, additional treatment typically is required over time. Maintaining your ideal body weight. This is especially true if you have a family history of diabetes. Exercising regularly—like a brisk walk of 1-2 miles in 30 minutes—at least five times a week, even if that does not result in you achieving an ideal weight. That's because regular exercise reduces insulin resistance. Taking medication. The medication metformin (Glucophage) offers some additional protection for people with pre-diabetes. Pre-diabetes is defined as blood glucose levels between 100 and 125 mg/dL. If you already have type 2 diabetes, you can still delay or prevent complications: Keep tight control of your blood sugar. This reduces the risk of most complications. Lower your risk of heart-related complications by:Taking a daily aspirin.Aggressively managing other risk factors for atherosclerosis, such as:High blood pressureHigh cholesterol and triglyceridesCigarette smokingObesity Visit an eye doctor and a foot specialist every year to reduce eye and foot complications. In most cases, type 2 diabetes treatment begins with weight reduction through diet and exercise. A healthy diet for a person with diabetes is: Nutritionally balanced with abundant amounts of:Whole-grain foodsMonounsaturated oilsFruits and vegetables A daily multivitamin is recommended for most people with diabetes. For some people, type 2 diabetes can be controlled just with diet and exercise. Even if medications are required, diet and exercise remain important for controlling diabetes. The medications used for type 2 diabetes include pills and injections. The pills work in many different ways. They include medications that: Reduce insulin resistance in the muscles and liver. Increase the amount of insulin made and released by the pancreas. Delay the absorption of sugars from the intestine. Decrease the conversion of fat to glucose. These medications are called thiazolidinediones. One medication in this group has recently been linked to heart disease. As a result, drugs from this group are not recommended as a first choice in treatment. Because type 2 diabetes develops when the pancreas cannot make enough insulin to overcome insulin resistance, about one of three people with this disease take some form of insulin injection. In advanced type 2 diabetes, or for people who want to tightly control glucose levels, insulin may be needed more than once per day and in higher doses. Treatment plans that include both very long-acting insulin and very short-acting insulin are frequently the most successful for controlling blood sugar. Very short-acting insulin is used with meals, to help control the spike in blood sugar levels that occur with a meal. If a person does not eat on a regular schedule, very short-acting insulin can be particularly helpful. Medications used to treat type 2 diabetes can have side effects. These vary by medication. Side effects may include: Life-threatening buildup of lactic acid in the blood (in people with kidney failure) Increased risk of heart attack (with one of the thiazolidinediones medicines) Fortunately, these side effects are uncommon, so the benefits of treatment far outweigh the risks. In addition to medicines that help control the level of blood sugar, people with type 2 diabetes often take other medicines that reduce the risk or to slow the onset of the complications of diabetes. These include medications that: Lower cholesterol. All diabetics should consider taking medication to lower their cholesterol. Lower blood pressure. Diabetics should use medication to control high blood pressure if it can't be improved by lifestyle changes. Protect against heart attacks. Most people with diabetes benefit from a daily aspirin. People with high blood sugar levels have a higher risk of dehydration. Contact your doctor immediately if you develop vomiting or diarrhea and are not able to drink enough fluids. Monitor your blood sugar as advised by your health care team. Report any significant deviations in blood sugar levels. Your treatment plan is likely to require adjustment over time. Insulin resistance increases with age. And the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas may wear out as the pancreas tries to keep up with the body's extra insulin needs. After the first few years, the majority of people with type 2 diabetes require more than one medicine to keep their blood sugar controlled. The prognosis in people with type 2 diabetes varies. It depends on how well an individual modifies his or her risk of complications. Heart attack, stroke and kidney disease can result in premature death. Disability due to blindness, amputation, heart disease, stroke and nerve damage may occur. Some people with type 2 diabetes become dependent on dialysis treatments because of kidney failure.

It is characterized by high levels of sugar in the blood. Type 2 diabetes is also called type 2 diabetes mellitus and adult-onset diabetes. However, more and more children and teens are developing this condition. Since type 2 diabetes is much more common than type 1 diabetes, it often is just called ""diabetes"". During digestion, food is broken down into basic components. Carbohydrates are broken down into simple sugars, primarily glucose. Glucose is a critically important source of energy for the body's cells. To provide energy to the cells, glucose needs to leave the blood and get inside the cells. Insulin traveling in the blood signals the cells to take up glucose. Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas. When levels of glucose in the blood rise (for example, after a meal), the pancreas produces more insulin. Type 2 diabetes occurs when your body's cells do not react efficiently to insulin. This condition is called insulin resistance. The cells do not accept as much glucose from the blood as they should. The cells resist the effects of insulin. As a result, glucose starts to build up in the blood. In people with insulin resistance, the pancreas ""sees"" the blood glucose level rising. The pancreas responds by making extra insulin to maintain a normal blood sugar. Over time, the body's insulin resistance gets worse. In response the pancreas makes more and more insulin. Finally, the pancreas gets ""exhausted"". It cannot keep up with the demand for more and more insulin. As a result, blood glucose levels stay high. Type 2 diabetes runs in families. It most often affects people who are older than 40. But type 2 diabetes is now being seen in more and more young people. Obesity greatly increases the risk of diabetes. The symptoms of diabetes are related to high blood glucose levels. They include: Increased susceptibility to infections, especially yeast or fungal infections Extremely high blood sugar levels also can lead to a dangerous complication called hyperosmolar syndrome. This is a life-threatening form of dehydration. In some cases, hyperosmolar syndrome is the first sign that a person has type 2 diabetes. It causes confused thinking, weakness, nausea and even seizure and coma. The treatment of type 2 diabetes also can produce symptoms, when it leads to the complication of low blood sugar (called hypoglycemia). People with type 2 diabetes take medications to reduce blood sugar. But these medications may cause sugar levels to drop below normal, particularly if someone has eaten less than usual. Symptoms of hypoglycemia include: Seizures and loss of consciousness (if hypoglycemia is not recognized and corrected) You can correct hypoglycemia by eating or drinking something that has carbohydrates. This raises your blood sugar level. Type 2 diabetes affects all parts of the body. It can cause serious, potentially life-threatening complications. These include: Atherosclerosis — Atherosclerosis is fat buildup in the artery walls. This can impair blood flow to the all the organs. The heart, brain and legs are most often affected. Retinopathy — Tiny blood vessels at the back of the eye become damaged by high blood sugar. Caught early, retinopathy damage can be minimized by tightly controlling blood sugar and using laser therapy. Untreated retinopathy can lead to blindness. Neuropathy — This is nerve damage. The most common type is peripheral neuropathy. The nerves to the legs are damaged first, causing pain and numbness in the feet. This can advance to cause symptoms in the legs and hands. Damage to the nerves that control digestion, sexual function and urination can also occur. Foot problems — Sores and blisters on the feet occur for two reasons: If peripheral neuropathy causes numbness, the person will not feel irritation in the foot. The skin can break down and form an ulcer. Blood circulation can be poor, leading to slow healing. Left untreated, a simple sore can become infected and very large. Nephropathy — Damage to the kidneys. This is more likely if blood sugars remain elevated and high blood pressure is not treated aggressively. Diabetes is diagnosed by testing the blood for sugar levels. Blood is tested in the morning after you have fasted overnight. Typically, the body keeps blood sugar levels between 70 and 100 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL), even after fasting. If a blood sugar level after fasting is greater than 125 mg/dL, diabetes is diagnosed. Your doctor will examine you to look for signs of diabetes complications. These include: Deposits of blood, or puffy yellow spots in the retina of your eyes Laboratory tests are also used routinely to evaluate diabetes. These include: Fasting glucose. A test of your blood sugar level after you have not eaten for several hours. Hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c). Indicates how close to average your blood glucose has been during the previous two months. Blood creatinine and urine microalbumin. Tests for evidence of kidney disease. Lipid profile. Measures levels of triglycerides and total, HDL, and LDL cholesterol. This evaluates the risk of atherosclerosis. Aging and episodic illness can cause the body's insulin resistance to increase. As a result, additional treatment typically is required over time. Maintaining your ideal body weight. This is especially true if you have a family history of diabetes. Exercising regularly—like a brisk walk of 1-2 miles in 30 minutes—at least five times a week, even if that does not result in you achieving an ideal weight. That's because regular exercise reduces insulin resistance. Taking medication. The medication metformin (Glucophage) offers some additional protection for people with pre-diabetes. Pre-diabetes is defined as blood glucose levels between 100 and 125 mg/dL. If you already have type 2 diabetes, you can still delay or prevent complications: Keep tight control of your blood sugar. This reduces the risk of most complications. Lower your risk of heart-related complications by:Taking a daily aspirin.Aggressively managing other risk factors for atherosclerosis, such as:High blood pressureHigh cholesterol and triglyceridesCigarette smokingObesity Visit an eye doctor and a foot specialist every year to reduce eye and foot complications. In most cases, type 2 diabetes treatment begins with weight reduction through diet and exercise. A healthy diet for a person with diabetes is: Nutritionally balanced with abundant amounts of:Whole-grain foodsMonounsaturated oilsFruits and vegetables A daily multivitamin is recommended for most people with diabetes. For some people, type 2 diabetes can be controlled just with diet and exercise. Even if medications are required, diet and exercise remain important for controlling diabetes. The medications used for type 2 diabetes include pills and injections. The pills work in many different ways. They include medications that: Reduce insulin resistance in the muscles and liver. Increase the amount of insulin made and released by the pancreas. Delay the absorption of sugars from the intestine. Decrease the conversion of fat to glucose. These medications are called thiazolidinediones. One medication in this group has recently been linked to heart disease. As a result, drugs from this group are not recommended as a first choice in treatment. Because type 2 diabetes develops when the pancreas cannot make enough insulin to overcome insulin resistance, about one of three people with this disease take some form of insulin injection. In advanced type 2 diabetes, or for people who want to tightly control glucose levels, insulin may be needed more than once per day and in higher doses. Treatment plans that include both very long-acting insulin and very short-acting insulin are frequently the most successful for controlling blood sugar. Very short-acting insulin is used with meals, to help control the spike in blood sugar levels that occur with a meal. If a person does not eat on a regular schedule, very short-acting insulin can be particularly helpful. Medications used to treat type 2 diabetes can have side effects. These vary by medication. Side effects may include: Life-threatening buildup of lactic acid in the blood (in people with kidney failure) Increased risk of heart attack (with one of the thiazolidinediones medicines) Fortunately, these side effects are uncommon, so the benefits of treatment far outweigh the risks. In addition to medicines that help control the level of blood sugar, people with type 2 diabetes often take other medicines that reduce the risk or to slow the onset of the complications of diabetes. These include medications that: Lower cholesterol. All diabetics should consider taking medication to lower their cholesterol. Lower blood pressure. Diabetics should use medication to control high blood pressure if it can't be improved by lifestyle changes. Protect against heart attacks. Most people with diabetes benefit from a daily aspirin. People with high blood sugar levels have a higher risk of dehydration. Contact your doctor immediately if you develop vomiting or diarrhea and are not able to drink enough fluids. Monitor your blood sugar as advised by your health care team. Report any significant deviations in blood sugar levels. Your treatment plan is likely to require adjustment over time. Insulin resistance increases with age. And the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas may wear out as the pancreas tries to keep up with the body's extra insulin needs. After the first few years, the majority of people with type 2 diabetes require more than one medicine to keep their blood sugar controlled. The prognosis in people with type 2 diabetes varies. It depends on how well an individual modifies his or her risk of complications. Heart attack, stroke and kidney disease can result in premature death. Disability due to blindness, amputation, heart disease, stroke and nerve damage may occur. Some people with type 2 diabetes become dependent on dialysis treatments because of kidney failure.

Diabetes Self-Management offers over 900 diabetes friendly recipes to choose from including desserts, low-carb pasta dishes, savory main meals, grilled options and more. By Laura Hieronymus, DNP, MSEd, RN, MLDE, BC-ADM, CDCES, FADCES, Diabetes is a growing epidemic in the United States and around the world. Over one-third of the American population has a blood glucose level above the normal range. Of the United States’ 323 million people, approximately 30 million have diabetes, while another 84 million have . Given that one in three Americans is affected, everyone needs to be aware of the risk factors for developing diabetes. It is essential to know how to be proactive to delay and prevent the onset of Type 2 diabetes and its associated . Prediabetes and diabetes can lead to both physical complications and financial burdens when not properly treated and controlled. If you have prediabetes, you are at a greater risk of developing Type 2 diabetes, , and stroke. Both the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have developed tests to evaluate your risk for developing prediabetes and diabetes. To take the risk test, visit the ADA’s website at or the CDC’s website at . Here we take a look at what diabetes is and specific risk factors for developing it, as well as diagnostic criteria for prediabetes/diabetes and ways to delay or prevent diabetes. We will further explore how you can help educate family, friends, co-workers, and others about their risk for developing diabetes and ways to reduce their risk. Prediabetes is an elevation in blood glucose levels that is higher than normal but not high enough to be diabetes. Diabetes is a disease in which the pancreas does not make enough insulin or the insulin made by the pancreas cannot be used correctly, also known as . Insulin is necessary to move our primary source of energy, carbohydrate, into our cells. Carbohydrate is a nutrient that turns into glucose. When people do not make enough insulin or their body cannot use the insulin produced, they start to develop high blood glucose levels, leading to prediabetes or diabetes. What are the risk factors for developing prediabetes and diabetes? Many factors can increase an individual’s risk for developing prediabetes or diabetes. These factors include being overweight/obese, having a family history of diabetes (especially a first-degree relative such as a parent or sibling), sedentary lifestyle, age, and race. Certain races and ethnicities have a higher risk of developing diabetes, including African American, Native American, Alaska Native, Hawaiian, Pacific Islander, Asian American, Hispanic, or Latino. When looking at risk factors for Type 2 diabetes, one should consider which are modifiable (in other words, what one can change) and which are non-modifiable risk factors (what one cannot change). Laboratory testing for prediabetes and Type 2 diabetes should be considered when risk factors are present. These tests can be ordered by a primary-care provider. Factors that increase the risk for prediabetes and/or Type 2 diabetes include a greater than or equal to 25 kg/m or Asian Americans with a BMI equal to 23 kg/m or greater. People over the age of 45, women with a history of , people with a history of heart disease or stroke, , low HDL cholesterol, or high triglycerides, and women with are at increased risk as well. Diagnosing prediabetes and diabetes is done by analyzing blood in a clinical laboratory, such as the one in your health-care provider’s office. These tests include a , an , and an test. An FBG is done after a person has not consumed any calories from food or drink for at least eight hours. An OGTT looks at your body’s ability to absorb glucose after two hours. The A1C can be taken at any time and estimates your blood glucose for the past three months. Prediabetes is diagnosed if a person’s FBG is 100 to 125 mg/dL, two-hour OGTT is 140 to 199 mg/dL or A1C falls between 5.7 and 6.4%. A diabetes diagnosis occurs if a person’s FBG is greater than or equal to 126 mg/dL, two-hour OGTT is greater than or equal to 200 mg/dL and A1C is greater than or equal to 6.5%. What can I do to delay or prevent prediabetes and diabetes? There are many steps you can take to delay or prevent prediabetes and diabetes. Specifically, strive to be physically active with and be as close to a as possible. Tips for include eating less and/or having smaller portions of your favorite foods. One way to decrease portion size is using a smaller plate, like a salad plate instead of a dinner plate. Using can also help with portion control because it requires half of your plate to contain non-starchy vegetables like green beans, tomatoes, carrots, and salad greens, a quarter of your plate to contain a protein such as chicken, eggs, turkey, or beef, and the remaining quarter of your plate to contain a carbohydrate such as a dinner roll, pasta, rice, corn, black beans, or potatoes. The plate method works by only encouraging one plate serving per meal (no seconds, please). Food preparation is also crucial for healthy eating. Try to eat more foods that are steamed, baked, or grilled, and leave off high-fat sauces, gravies, and condiments such as butter, regular salad dressing, and mayonnaise. Finally, think about your snacks and drinks throughout the day. Planning ahead can help you eliminate extra calories and stick to your healthy eating plan. Nutritious snacks include raw vegetables, low-fat cheese, or small pieces of fresh fruit. Drink plenty of water and sugar-free drinks, such as unsweetened tea or coffee, instead of regular soda and other sugar-sweetened beverages. Increased physical activity will also reduce your risk of developing prediabetes and Type 2 diabetes. Physical activity decreases insulin resistance, which will increase insulin sensitivity. Before engaging in any physical activity, always talk to your primary care provider about starting an activity plan. Most adults should participate in at least 150 minutes of moderate activity per week. Examples of moderate exercise include walking, jogging, swimming, hiking, aerobic dancing and heavy cleaning (i.e., mopping or vacuuming). Adults should additionally perform some resistance and flexibility exercises two to three times per week. Physical activity and exercise make you feel better by giving you more energy, toned muscles and assistance with needed weight loss. Try to be physically active more days than not, and do some type of activity (i.e., standing, stretching or walking) every 30 minutes to reduce prolonged periods of being sedentary. Weight management is another risk reducer. A normal BMI is defined between 18.5 to 24.9 kg/m2. Anyone considered overweight or obese can still reduce their personal risk of developing diabetes with a modest weight change of five to 10 percent of their current body weight. For example, a person weighing 200 pounds can reduce the risk of developing diabetes by losing 10 to 20 pounds. Weight-loss achievement occurs with decreased calorie consumption through healthy eating and increased physical activity. To learn more about BMI and to calculate yours, go to . Finally, you can reduce your risk for prediabetes and Type 2 diabetes by developing healthy . Everyone has both physical and emotional stress in their lives. Healthy coping includes daily well-being habits of nutritious eating, increased activity, and . Lack of sleep can affect the body’s ability to process glucose. Stress-relieving activities include doing things that are fun for you, perhaps spending time with friends and family, working on a hobby, watching television, listening to music, reading a book, and anything else that reduces stress in your life. How can I help others reduce their risk of developing prediabetes and diabetes? Start by talking with your family and friends about risk factors. Know your personal family history of diabetes. Tell other family members if you or someone else in the family has Type 2 diabetes because this increases their risk for the disease. Get screened for diabetes and encourage others to get tested—it could save their lives. Form support groups that promote healthy lifestyles through nutritious eating and increased physical activity. Start a walking or bicycle riding group. Get trained as a lay health coach to educate and help others. After training as a lay health coach, use your knowledge to inform others about risk factors for developing diabetes and resources available to prevent it. Other places to consider helping people learn more about prediabetes and Type 2 diabetes include places of worship, hair salons, barber shops, family reunions, and support groups. Resources to delay and prevent prediabetes and diabetes Many national organizations and local agencies have resources and classes to help reduce your risk. Take one of the prediabetes and Type 2 diabetes risk-assessment tests. Then schedule a visit with your primary-care provider to find out if you have prediabetes. Look for licensed and in your area to learn more about education programs. Find a CDC-recognized diabetes prevention program near you. Here are several resources to learn more about delaying and preventing diabetes: Find a list of DPPs in your area at .

This year between 9 – 15 July the focus will be on raising awareness about the early detection of diabetes. Each day 290 Australians are diagnosed with diabetes, but too many people are being diagnosed too late. Whether it’s type 1 or type 2, this delay in diagnosis is putting many people at risk of major health problems. Every year as many as 640 Australian’s end up in hospital with dangerously high blood glucose levels because the early symptoms of type 1 diabetes – severe fatigue, thirst and weight loss – are not recognised. Around half of these hospital admissions are children and teens and if not diagnosed in time type 1 diabetes can be fatal.  In addition, almost half million Australian’s are living with are living with type 2 diabetes but don’t know it. That’s because the condition is “silent” and can occur without obvious symptoms. When type 2 diabetes goes undiagnosed there is the danger of developing complications like damage to the eyes or kidneys, foot ulcers and even damage to the heart. Diabetes doesn’t discriminate. That’s why this National Diabetes Week we’ll be working to raise awareness of the signs of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Because with earlier detection we can reduce the risk of Australian’s developing life threatening health problems and in turn save lives.

27cc6e2b-1a37-4103-a5cf-05003c007413,"Diabetes is a disease that affects how the body uses , the main type of sugar in the blood. Our bodies break down the foods we eat into glucose and other nutrients we need, which are then absorbed into the bloodstream from the gastrointestinal tract. The in the blood rises after a meal and triggers the to make the hormone and release it into the bloodstream. But in people with diabetes, the body either can't make or can't respond to insulin properly. Insulin works like a key that opens the doors to cells and lets the glucose in. Without insulin, glucose can't get into the cells (the doors are ""locked"" and there is no key) and so it stays in the bloodstream. As a result, the level of sugar in the blood remains higher than normal. High blood sugar levels are a problem because they can cause a number of health problems. The two types of diabetes are and . Both make blood sugar levels higher than normal but they do so in different ways. happens when the immune system attacks and destroys the cells of the pancreas that produce insulin. Kids with type 1 diabetes need insulin to help keep their blood sugar levels in a normal range. Type 2 diabetes is different. A person with type 2 diabetes still produces insulin but the body doesn't respond to it normally. Glucose is less able to enter the cells and do its job of supplying energy (a problem called ). This raises the blood sugar level, so the pancreas works hard to make even more insulin. Eventually, this strain can make the pancreas unable to produce enough insulin to keep blood sugar levels normal. People with insulin resistance may or may not develop type 2 diabetes — it all depends on whether the pancreas can make enough insulin to keep blood sugar levels normal. High blood sugar levels that happen a lot are a sign that a person has developed diabetes. No one knows for sure what causes type 2 diabetes. But many kids who develop it have at least one parent with diabetes and a family history of the disease, so there seems to be a genetic risk. Most people with type 2 diabetes are . Excess fat makes it harder for the cells to respond to insulin, and not being physically active makes this even worse. Type 2 diabetes used to mostly affect adults, but now more and more U.S. kids and teens, especially those who are overweight, are developing the disease. Also, kids in are more likely to have it than younger kids, probably because of normal rises in hormone levels that can cause insulin resistance during this stage of fast growth and physical development. The symptoms of type 2 diabetes aren't always obvious and they can take a long time to develop. Sometimes, there are no symptoms. It's important to remember that not everyone with insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes develops these warning signs, and not everyone who has these symptoms necessarily has type 2 diabetes. But kids or teens who develop type 2 diabetes may: The respond to high levels of glucose in the blood by flushing out the extra glucose in urine (pee). Kids with high blood sugar levels need to pee more often and make more pee. Because they're peeing so often and losing so much fluid, they can become very thirsty and drink a lot in an attempt to keep the levels of body water normal. This is because the body can't use glucose for energy properly. Doctors can determine if a person has type 2 diabetes by testing blood samples for glucose. Even if a child or teen doesn't have any symptoms of type 2 diabetes, doctors might test blood sugar in kids who are more likely to get it — like those who are overweight. Sometimes doctors may do another blood test, called the glycosylated hemoglobin (hemoglobin A1c or HbA1c) test, to check for diabetes in children at higher risk for getting type 2 diabetes. This test shows how blood sugar levels have been running over the past few months. If diabetes is suspected or confirmed, the doctor may refer you to a , a doctor who specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases of the (such as diabetes and growth disorders) in kids. Kids and teens with type 2 diabetes use diet, exercise, and medicines that improve the body's response to insulin to control their blood sugar levels. Some may need to take or use an too. Sometimes, kids and teens with type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance, or obesity might develop thick, dark, velvet-like skin around the neck, armpits, groin, between fingers and toes, or on elbows and knees — a cosmetic skin condition called . This skin darkening can lighten over time with improvement in insulin resistance. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in girls is also often associated with insulin resistance. This hormone problem can make the ovaries become enlarged and develop cysts (fluid-filled sacs). Girls with PCOS might have irregular periods, might stop having periods, and may have excess facial and body hair growth. It also can cause fertility problems. People with insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes are also more likely to develop (high blood pressure) or abnormal levels of blood fats ( and triglycerides). When these problems cluster together, it's called . People with metabolic syndrome are at risk for heart disease, stroke, and other health problems. Diabetes also can cause heart disease and stroke, as well as other , including eye problems, kidney disease, nerve damage, and gum disease. While these problems don't usually show up in kids or teens who've had type 2 diabetes for only a few years, they can affect them in adulthood, particularly if their diabetes isn't well controlled. Doctors and researchers are developing new equipment and to help kids deal with the special problems of growing up with diabetes. Some kids and teens already use new devices that make blood glucose testing and insulin injections easier and more effective. One of these is the insulin pump, a mechanical device that can be programmed to deliver insulin more like the pancreas does. Researchers are also testing ways to stop diabetes before it starts. For example, scientists are studying whether diabetes can be prevented in those who may have inherited an increased risk for the disease. Diabetes is a chronic condition that needs close attention. You'll be your child's most important partner in learning to live with it. Eat a healthy diet, as determined by the care team. Get regular physical activity to achieve a healthy weight and allow insulin to work more effectively. Take insulin or other medicines that help the body respond to insulin more effectively. Work closely with their doctors and diabetes health care team to get the best possible diabetes control. Be watched for signs of complications and other diabetes-related health problems. Living with diabetes is a challenge for anyone, but kids and teens often have special issues to deal with. Young kids might not understand why they need  and . They might be scared, angry, and uncooperative. Teens may feel different from their peers and want a more carefree lifestyle than their diabetes allows. Even when they faithfully follow their treatment schedule, they might feel frustrated if the natural body changes of puberty make their diabetes somewhat harder to control.

4f277d5a-ef54-46da-aa2f-13ee3d42ed48,"Sleep Duration Tied to Type 2 Diabetes Risk in Women With rates of type 2 diabetes[1] on the rise around the world, including in the United States, it’s more important than ever before to understand the factors that contribute to people developing this condition — especially if some of those factors can be changed. So far, it’s well established that age, family history, physical activity, body weight, diet, and drug and chemical exposure are some of the factors that can play a role in developing type 2 diabetes. Lifestyle factors — including what and how much you eat, physical activity[2] and stress levels[3] — are an area where interventions to help prevent diabetes may be possible, which makes them a common topic of type 2 diabetes research. Another lifestyle factor that has gained attention in recent years is sleep[4], which was the focus of a recent study on diabetes risk in women. To get cutting-edge diabetes news, strategies for blood glucose management, nutrition tips, healthy recipes, and more delivered straight to your inbox, sign up for our free newsletter[5]! Published in the June 2020 issue of the journal the study[6] looked at sleep patterns in 60,068 women who took part in a larger study called the Nurses’ Health Study II[7]. None of the participants in the current analysis had diabetes, heart disease[8] or cancer at the beginning of the study period. The average age of participating women was 54.9 at the beginning, and each participants self-reported their sleep habits in surveys over a follow-up period that lasted, on average, 7.8 years. Based on survey responses about their sleep habits, the researchers grouped participants into one of six different sleep patterns. Four of these patterns were for participants who reported getting roughly the same amount of sleep each night throughout the follow-up period, based on whether they got closest to 5, 6, 7 or 8 hours of sleep. Two other patterns were for participants who reported getting less sleep, or more sleep, each night as time went on during the follow-up period — regardless of how much sleep they got or where they ended up. During the follow-up period, 1,797 participants were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. The researchers then compared sleep patterns in the women who developed diabetes, while also accounting for factors known to affect someone’s risk of developing diabetes like age, obesity, and metabolic risk factors (such as high cholesterol[9] or triglyceride[10] levels). They found that there were, in fact, major differences in the risk of developing diabetes based on the six different sleep patterns. The researchers used the 7-hour sleep pattern as the basis for comparison with all the other patterns. The 8-hour pattern was associated with a slightly lower risk of developing diabetes, at 0.96 times the risk of the 7-hour pattern. Participants with the 6-hour pattern were 1.17 times as likely to develop diabetes, while this risk rose to 1.43 for the 5-hour pattern. Getting more sleep over the follow-up period carried 1.33 times the risk of developing diabetes, while getting less sleep over time had nearly the same risk, 1.32 times that of the 7-hour sleep pattern. When researchers controlled for further factors in developing diabetes, including body-mass index[11] (BMI, a measure of body weight that takes height into account) and risk factors that changed over the follow-up period (rather than just looking at cholesterol, for example, at the beginning of the study), the differences in diabetes risk based on the different sleep patterns shrank, but a significant risk remained in participants who got less sleep over time — 1.24 times the risk of the 7-hour sleep pattern. The way the results changed once researchers took different factors into account shows just how complex the relationship is between sleep, diabetes risk factors, and actually developing diabetes. It’s possible that some people slept less because of health problems that might contribute to diabetes — or that some people developed certain health-related risk factors in part because they didn’t sleep enough. In other words, it’s impossible to know whether sleeping less is the cause or the effect of certain health issues. But if you feel like you aren’t getting enough sleep — due to time constraints, poor sleep or health problems that make it difficult to sleep — it’s worth talking to your doctor about ways to get more or better sleep. Improving poor sleep habits may or may not affect your risk of developing diabetes, but it’s almost certain to leave you feeling more energetic, less stressed and in a better mood.

e08272c8-a0e6-4718-a613-4e57065cd147,"Monday, 11 January 2021 German scientists have, for the first time, identified six different types of . Pre-diabetes is a condition that precedes the onset of type 2 diabetes. The research, tracking data from a 25 year-long study, suggests the new subtypes of pre-diabetes will help doctors more precisely identify people most a risk of developing type 2 diabetes. As blood glucose levels rise doctors can diagnose patients with pre-diabetes, when their levels are consistently higher than normal. But not high enough to be considered type 2 diabetes. Not everyone with pre-diabetes goes on to develop type 2 diabetes. For some these increased blood glucose levels can be relatively harmless, with no symptoms, but for others pre-diabetes can be an early sign of serious health issues. “Until now it has not been possible to predict whether someone with pre-diabetes would develop type 2 diabetes and be at risk of serious complications. Or whether they would only have slightly higher blood glucose levels but without significant risk,” explains Hans-Ulrich Häring, from the University of Tübingen. The new research, analyzed 25 years of data from 900 subjects taking part in a longitudinal family health study. Using cluster analysis the research homed in on six different pre-diabetes subtypes. Each distinguished by different metabolic markers. “The study showed that there are different disease types in the preliminary stage of diabetes. Each type differs in blood glucose levels, insulin action and insulin secretion, body fat distribution, liver fat and genetic risk,” notes Robert Wagner, author on the new study. Each of the six pre-diabetes subtypes found in the study is distinguished by specific metabolic parameters and result in different long-term outcomes. Three subtypes (clusters 1, 2 and 4) are the healthier types of pre-diabetes. These subjects present as generally healthy. Cluster 4, for example, encompasses overweight subjects with broadly healthy metabolic markers. Clusters 3, 5 and 6 were linked to the highest risk of developing type 2 diabetes and secondary diseases. Cluster 5 grouped those subjects with pronounced fatty liver, while cluster 3 grouped those who produced significantly lower levels of insulin. To further validate these six subtypes, the researchers examined data from another longitudinal study. Called Whitehall II, the UK study tracked the metabolic health of nearly 10,000 subjects for over 20 years. They found the six pre-diabetes subtypes accurately fit that large dataset, confirming pre-diabetes can be distinguished into separate disease stratifications. Researchers suggest more work is needed before the findings can be used by doctors. Martin Hrabě de Angelis, from the German Center for Diabetes Research, says this work is important in helping catch and treat diabetes before the condition progresses. “One of our goals is to develop precise prevention and therapy measures, for individuals at the right time.” “The combination of in-depth research with state-of-the-art bioinformatics has made this important result possible. The identification of subtypes is an important step towards precision medicine in the prevention of diabetes and its complications.” The study was published in the journal .

One type 2 diabetes risk factor is excess fat around the waist. What Is the Medical Definition of ? Type 2 is a chronic medical condition that results from an inability of the body to properly use insulin. What's the Difference Between Type 1 and Type 2 ? Type 2 is different from , in which the body is unable to produce sufficient levels of insulin. Symptoms of type 2 diabetes include Risk factors for getting type 2 diabetes include A fasting level of 126 mg/dl or greater on two different days establishes the diagnosis of diabetes. A number of both oral and injectable medications have been developed for treatment of type 2 diabetes. A () level of 6.5% or greater indicates diabetes. In some people, lifestyle changes such as combined with physical activity are sufficient to control levels or reverse prediabetes. Managing type 2 diabetes includes a healthy eating plan and , as well as medications in many cases. A healthy eating plan and regular physical activity are important components of a type 2 diabetes treatment plan. There is no one recommended ""diabetes "" for all people with type 2 diabetes. Regular physical activity and modest weight loss can help reduce or prevent type 2 diabetes. Common complications of diabetes include cardiovascular disease, , , and . Good control of blood levels can prevent complications of type 2 diabetes. Once you’ve been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, you and your doctor will develop a plan. The goals for treating type 2 diabetes include controlling your blood glucose levels, which may require medication in the short and/or long term as well as lifestyle changes. This will help prevent diabetes-related cardiovascular and neurological complications. The other components of the management plan include adhering to a strict diet and losing weight if you are or . Starting on a physical activity plan in the form of a regular regimen is the third aspect of treatment. Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of . In type 2 diabetes, there is an elevated level of (glucose) in the bloodstream due to the body's inability to properly respond to insulin (). Insulin is a hormone that allows the body to utilize glucose for energy. Insulin is produced by specialized cells in the pancreas. An elevated level of blood glucose is known as . The excessive levels of glucose in the blood spill over into the urine, leading to the presence of glucose in the urine (glucosuria). Type 2 diabetes is an enormous public health problem. It is estimated that about 30.3 million Americans (9.4% of all Americans) have type 2 diabetes. Increasing rates of obesity is thought to be responsible for the increasing incidence of diabetes. Almost 1 in 4 of people living with diabetes are thought to be unaware of their condition. Type 2 diabetes is a chronic condition that arises slowly over time and persists throughout an individual's lifetime. Over time, people with diabetes can develop complications of the disease that lead to damage to multiple organs. Complications of diabetes include Good control of the disease can minimize the risk of complications. Symptoms and signs of type 1 and type 2 diabetes can be similar. Symptoms and signs of poorly controlled diabetes (or undiagnosed diabetes) can include Other symptoms, while characteristic of the complications that arise from long-term untreated or poorly treated diabetes, may be the initial symptoms in some people who do not know they have diabetes. These symptoms include What Causes, and What Are the Risk Factors for, Type 2 Diabetes? Type 2 diabetes is the result of the body not being able to effectively use insulin, and is referred to as insulin resistance. Because patients with type 2 diabetes can still produce insulin even though the body does not respond properly, blood levels of insulin can become elevated in some people with the condition along with high blood sugar levels. In some, the pancreas may not be able to properly release insulin that is produced. is a strong risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes. Those who have relatives with the condition are at greater risk. is another major risk factor. There is a direct relationship between the severity of obesity and the likelihood of getting type 2 diabetes. This is also true for children and teens. Storing excess body fat around the waist is linked to a higher risk than storing fat in the hips and thighs. is a risk factor for type 2 diabetes. The incidence increases with advancing age. There is an increase in type 2 diabetes with each decade over the age of 40, independent of weight. : Certain racial and ethnic groups are more likely than others to develop type 2 diabetes. In particular, type 2 diabetes is most likely to occur in Native Americans (affecting 20%-50% of the population). It is also more common in African Americans, Hispanics/Latinos, and Asian Americans than in Caucasian Americans. Women who had diabetes during (gestational diabetes) are at increased risk for subsequently developing type 2 diabetes. Untreated , particularly , are associated with an increased risk for type 2 diabetes. Being physically active decreases the chance of getting type 2 diabetes. Women with this condition have an increased likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes. What Is the Difference Between Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes? Elevated blood sugar (hyperglycemia) is the hallmark of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. results from an autoimmune reaction of the body against the insulin-producing beta cells of the pancreas. The pancreas is then unable to produce sufficient insulin. In contrast, patients with type 2 diabetes are able to produce insulin, but the body is unable to respond properly to the insulin (known as insulin resistance). Type 1 diabetes more commonly affects young people (under 30), and it was formerly referred to as juvenile diabetes and insulin-dependent diabetes, because patients with this condition must be treated with insulin. Type 2 diabetes was formerly known as adult-onset diabetes or . About 10% of people with diabetes have type 1 diabetes while the remainder have type 2 diabetes. While type 1 diabetes typically begins in younger people, some adults experience a late onset of type 1 diabetes (latent autoimmune diabetes in adults, or LADA), and it is possible for children and adolescents to develop type 2 diabetes. Endocrinologists are the medical specialists who manage problems with hormones and glands. In many cases endocrinologists manage patients with diabetes. In other cases, primary care providers (including internists and family practice specialists), treat type 2 diabetes. A fasting blood glucose measurement (fasting blood sugar test) is the preferred way to diagnose diabetes. A sample of blood is analyzed after a period of at least 8 hours of fasting. Typically, these measurements are taken in the morning prior to breakfast. Normal values for fasting glucose are less than 100 mg/dl. Having fasting blood glucose levels of 126 mg/dl or greater on two or more tests on different days confirms the presence of diabetes. A random (non-fasting) blood glucose test can also be used to diagnose diabetes. A non-fasting blood glucose level of 200 mg/dl or higher indicates diabetes. The oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) involves a series of blood glucose measurements taken at intervals after consumption of a sugary solution. This test is no longer commonly used to diagnose type 2 diabetes, but it is often used to establish a diagnosis of gestational diabetes. The A1c (HbA1c, glycated hemoglobin) test is a blood test that measures hemoglobin that is bound to blood sugar. This test is indicative of the blood glucose levels over the past 3 months and is often measured in people with diabetes to determine the extent of disease control. An HbA1c level of 6.5% or higher is indicative of diabetes. ______________ is another term for type 2 diabetes. The goal (and essential parts) of a treatment plan for type 2 diabetes is to maintain blood glucose levels under control to prevent complications of the disease, In some people, weight loss combined with physical activity is sufficient to control blood sugar levels. Other people will require medications for optimum control of their diabetes. The next sections of this article will discuss medications available to treat type 2 diabetes and a well-balanced diabetes diet. A healthy eating plan is an essential part of any diabetes treatment plan, but there is no one recommended ""diabetic diet"" for everyone. An individual plan will depend on many things, including underlying health and level of physical activity, the types of medication(s) being taken, and personal preference. Most people with type 2 diabetes find that having a fairly regular schedule for meals and snacks is helpful. Eating a variety of foods and watching portion sizes is also recommended. Examples of meal planning tools that some people with type 2 diabetes like to use include The plate method for meal planning assumes that half of one's plate will be filled with like The remaining half of the plate is divided into three sections. 1. One of these three smaller sections should contain , such as 2. Another small section is devoted to like 3. A serving or can occupy the remaining small section. Carbohydrate Counting and the Glycemic Index Method for Type 2 Diabetes Carbohydrate counting is a meal planning technique based on an allowed maximum carbohydrate count for each meal, and choosing your foods to fit within this limit. The amount of carbohydrates a person can consume with each meal and have good control of blood sugar will vary among individuals, depending on the medications taken and activity level. The glycemic index (GI) method balances food intake according to the particular glycemic index of the carbohydrate foods you eat. The glycemic index of a food reflects the glycemic response, or conversion to glucose, in the body. Glycemic index uses a scale of 0 to 100, with higher values corresponding to foods that cause the most rapid rise in blood sugar. Pure glucose, for example, is the reference point and is given a glycemic index of 100. This method of meal planning involves choosing foods that have a low or medium glycemic index instead of foods with a high glycemic index. Carbohydrates with a high glycemic index that raise blood sugar levels quickly are Regular physical activity can help control type 2 diabetes and lower blood sugar levels. It also helps with weight control and weight loss. Exercise has other health benefits including You should talk with your diabetes care team to help you determine the appropriate level and extent of physical activity, particularly if you have not been leading an active lifestyle. There are many different types of medications for type 2 diabetes treatment. These drugs have different mechanisms of action, with the common goal of reducing and controlling blood sugar levels. In particular, diabetes medications may increase insulin output by the pancreas, increase sensitivity of cells to insulin, decrease the amount of glucose released from the , decrease the absorption of carbohydrates from the intestine, inhibit the absorption of glucose by the kidneys, or slow emptying of the stomach, thereby delaying absorption of nutrients in the small intestine. Medications to treat type 2 diabetes are often used in combination and are only one part of a diabetes management program. Healthy eating and regular exercise are other basic components of the ideal diabetes management plan. Each of these groups will be briefly described, along with some common examples of drugs in the particular class. All are taken orally except for certain injectable medications (insulin, amylin mimetics, GLP-1 analogs). Amylin mimetics, thiazolidinediones, biguanides, and DDP-4 inhibitors Amylin mimetics include the medication (). This drug is a synthetic analog of human amylin, a hormone synthesized by the pancreas that helps control glucose after meals. Like insulin, amylin is absent or deficient in people with diabetes. Pramlintide is given by injection prior to meals in people who are taking insulin for type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Thiazolidinediones work to lower blood sugar levels by increasing sensitivity of muscle and fat cells to insulin. Drugs of this class tend to improve patterns in people with type 2 diabetes. Examples of thiazolidinediones are An earlier generation of this drug class, troglitazone (Regulin), was discontinued due to its association with liver damage. Rosiglitazone (Avandia) has been associated with an increased risk of and , and the FDA has imposed restrictions on its use. These drugs should not be used in people with or . Biguanides are a class of drugs that have been used for many years. Metformin (Glucophage) belongs to this class of drugs and works by decreasing glucose production by the liver. Earlier biguanide drugs could have serious side effects, but metformin has been used safely since 1994 for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Metformin can benefit overweight people in that it often suppresses appetite. DPP-4 inhibitors are inhibitors of the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase 4, which breaks down GLP-1 (see below). This means that naturally occurring GLP-1 has a greater effect, leading to decreased stomach emptying and decreased production of glucose by the liver. Examples of DPP-4 inhibitors are GLP-1 analogs, meglitinides, and alpha-glucosidase inhibitors GLP-1 analogs are also known as -like peptide-1 agonists or incretin mimetics. They work by slowing stomach emptying and slowing the release of glucose from the liver. Examples are These are given by injection and are used with other diabetes medications like metformin and the sulfonylureas. GLP-1 analogs stimulate the release of insulin from the pancreas. These drugs may promote weight loss and are associated with a low risk of (). Meglitinides also act by stimulating insulin release by the pancreas. Unlike the sulfonylureas, meglitinides are very short-acting, having peak effects within an hour. They are often taken up to 3 times a day before meals. Examples of meglitinide are Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors act by slowing down the digestion of complex carbohydrates, reducing the impact of carbohydrate consumption on blood sugar. Examples of alpha-glucosidase inhibitor drugs are They are taken with the first bite of food at mealtimes. Sulfonylureas are a class of drugs designed to increase insulin output by the pancreas. Older sulfonylurea medications included () and , which were abandoned due to a higher risk of cardiovascular events in those taking the drugs. Examples of newer sulfonylurea drugs include One potential risk of these drugs is that they very rapidly lower blood sugar, potentially leading to abnormally low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). SGL2 inhibitors are a relatively new class of medications. These are a class of drugs known as sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. SGLT2 inhibitors work by blocking the kidneys' reabsorption of glucose. This causes more glucose to be excreted in the urine. Examples of SGL2 inhibitors include Insulin is the hallmark of therapy for type 1 diabetes, but it can also be used for patients with type 2 diabetes. Many different preparations of insulin are available (including rapid-acting and long-acting formulations), with differences in the time required to take effect and the duration of action. Insulin is often considered for treatment of type 2 diabetes when the condition cannot be controlled by diet, weight loss, exercise, and oral medications. While some risk factors for type 2 diabetes such as genetics and ethnicity cannot be controlled, other risk factors can be minimized with lifestyle modification. For example, it has been shown that in people with prediabetes or people at an increased risk for type 2 diabetes, even modest amounts of weight loss and physical activity can prevent or delay the onset of diabetes. Losing just 5%-7% of total body weight through 30 minutes of physical activity 5 days per week combined with healthier eating showed that it is possible to delay or prevent diabetes. Other studies have shown that reducing consumption of sugary can delay or prevent type 2 diabetes. Drinking 1-2 cans of sugary drinks per day increased the risk of diabetes by 26% compared with people who did not consume sugared . Eating plenty of fiber and whole grains can help maintain stable blood sugar levels and even reduce the risk of getting diabetes. For some people at very high risk for developing diabetes (who have prediabetes and other risk factors), medications are recommended to delay the development of type 2 diabetes. What Is the Prognosis for a Person With Type 2 Diabetes? Type 2 diabetes can be managed with lifestyle modifications and can require medications. Maintaining good control of blood sugar levels can help prevent or delay many of the known complications of diabetes. Cardiovascular disease, including heart attack, , leading to pain in the lower legs (claudication), poor circulation Nerve damage, that often results in pain, numbness, or burning in the extremities (known as ) Eye problems, including damage to the of the eye due to circulatory problems (), that can lead to loss of vision, , and in men, due to both nerve damage and circulatory problems In addition to optimal control of blood glucose levels and following a diabetes management plan, lowering can help prevent the development of and other complications. It's a myth that simply eating too much sugar causes diabetes. Type 1 diabetes is genetic, and it is unknown what triggers the disease, while type 2 diabetes is a combination of genetics and lifestyle. Where sugar enters the equation is that being overweight is a risk factor for developing type 2 diabetes, and a diet high in calories and sugar can contribute to weight gain.

2d31e6c9-5298-448c-ae98-ab254e1027fa,"Type 2 diabetes is a chronic condition that affects the way your body metabolizes sugar (glucose) — an important source of fuel for your body. With type 2 diabetes, your body either resists the effects of insulin — a hormone that regulates the movement of sugar into your cells — or doesn't produce enough insulin to maintain normal glucose levels. Type 2 diabetes used to be known as adult-onset diabetes, but today more children are being diagnosed with the disorder, probably due to the rise in childhood obesity. There's no cure for type 2 diabetes, but losing weight, eating well and exercising can help manage the disease. If diet and exercise aren't enough to manage your blood sugar well, you may also need diabetes medications or insulin therapy. Signs and symptoms of type 2 diabetes often develop slowly. In fact, you can have type 2 diabetes for years and not know it. Look for: Areas of darkened skin, usually in the armpits and neck See your doctor if you notice type 2 diabetes symptoms. Type 2 diabetes develops when the body becomes resistant to insulin or when the pancreas is unable to produce enough insulin. Exactly why this happens is unknown, although genetics and environmental factors, such as being overweight and inactive, seem to be contributing factors. Insulin is a hormone that comes from the gland situated behind and below the stomach (pancreas). The pancreas secretes insulin into the bloodstream. The insulin circulates, enabling sugar to enter your cells. Insulin lowers the amount of sugar in your bloodstream. As your blood sugar level drops, so does the secretion of insulin from your pancreas. Glucose — a sugar — is a main source of energy for the cells that make up muscles and other tissues. Glucose comes from two major sources: food and your liver. Sugar is absorbed into the bloodstream, where it enters cells with the help of insulin. When your glucose levels are low, such as when you haven't eaten in a while, the liver breaks down stored glycogen into glucose to keep your glucose level within a normal range. In type 2 diabetes, this process doesn't work well. Instead of moving into your cells, sugar builds up in your bloodstream. As blood sugar levels increase, the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas release more insulin, but eventually these cells become impaired and can't make enough insulin to meet the body's demands. In the much less common type 1 diabetes, the immune system mistakenly destroys the beta cells, leaving the body with little to no insulin. Factors that may increase your risk of type 2 diabetes include: Being overweight is a main risk factor for type 2 diabetes. However, you don't have to be overweight to develop type 2 diabetes. If you store fat mainly in the abdomen, you have a greater risk of type 2 diabetes than if you store fat elsewhere, such as in your hips and thighs. Your risk of type 2 diabetes rises if you're a man with a waist circumference above 40 inches (101.6 centimeters) or a woman with a waist that's greater than 35 inches (88.9 centimeters). The less active you are, the greater your risk of type 2 diabetes. Physical activity helps you control your weight, uses up glucose as energy and makes your cells more sensitive to insulin. The risk of type 2 diabetes increases if your parent or sibling has type 2 diabetes. Although it's unclear why, certain people — including Black, Hispanic, American Indian and Asian American people — are at higher risk. The risk of type 2 diabetes increases as you get older, especially after age 45. That's probably because people tend to exercise less, lose muscle mass and gain weight as they age. But type 2 diabetes is also increasing dramatically among children, adolescents and younger adults. Prediabetes is a condition in which your blood sugar level is higher than normal, but not high enough to be classified as diabetes. Left untreated, prediabetes often progresses to type 2 diabetes. If you developed gestational diabetes when you were pregnant, your risk of developing type 2 diabetes increases. If you gave birth to a baby weighing more than 9 pounds (4 kilograms), you're also at risk of type 2 diabetes. For women, having polycystic ovarian syndrome — a common condition characterized by irregular menstrual periods, excess hair growth and obesity — increases the risk of diabetes. Areas of darkened skin, usually in the armpits and neck. This condition often indicates insulin resistance. Type 2 diabetes can be easy to ignore, especially in the early stages when you're feeling fine. But diabetes affects many major organs, including your heart, blood vessels, nerves, eyes and kidneys. Controlling your blood sugar levels can help prevent these complications. Although long-term complications of diabetes develop gradually, they can eventually be disabling or even life-threatening. Some of the potential complications of diabetes include: Diabetes dramatically increases the risk of heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure and narrowing of blood vessels (atherosclerosis). Excess sugar can cause tingling, numbness, burning or pain that usually begins at the tips of the toes or fingers and gradually spreads upward. Eventually, you may lose all sense of feeling in the affected limbs. Damage to the nerves that control digestion can cause problems with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation. For men, erectile dysfunction may be an issue. Diabetes can sometimes lead to kidney failure or irreversible end-stage kidney disease, which may require dialysis or a kidney transplant. Diabetes increases the risk of serious eye diseases, such as cataracts and glaucoma, and may damage the blood vessels of the retina, potentially leading to blindness. Left untreated, cuts and blisters can become serious infections, which may heal poorly. Severe damage might require toe, foot or leg amputation. Hearing problems are more common in people with diabetes. Diabetes may leave you more susceptible to skin problems, including bacterial and fungal infections. Obstructive sleep apnea is common in people with type 2 diabetes. Obesity may be the main contributing factor to both conditions. Treating sleep apnea may lower your blood pressure and make you feel more rested, but it's not clear whether it helps improve blood sugar control. Type 2 diabetes seems to increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease, though it's not clear why. The worse your blood sugar control, the greater the risk appears to be. Healthy lifestyle choices can help prevent type 2 diabetes, and that's true even if you have diabetes in your family. If you've already received a diagnosis of diabetes, you can use healthy lifestyle choices to help prevent complications. If you have prediabetes, lifestyle changes can slow or stop the progression to diabetes. Choose foods lower in fat and calories and higher in fiber. Focus on fruits, vegetables and whole grains. Aim for a minimum of 30 to 60 minutes of moderate physical activity — or 15 to 30 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity — on most days. Take a brisk daily walk. Ride a bike. Swim laps. If you can't fit in a long workout, spread your activity throughout the day. If you're overweight, losing 5 to 10 percent of your body weight can reduce the risk of diabetes. To keep your weight in a healthy range, focus on permanent changes to your eating and exercise habits. Motivate yourself by remembering the benefits of losing weight, such as a healthier heart, more energy and improved self-esteem. Sitting still for long periods can increase your risk of type 2 diabetes. Try to get up every 30 minutes and move around for at least a few minutes. Sometimes medication is an option as well. Metformin (Glucophage, Glumetza, others), an oral diabetes medication, may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. But even if you take medication, healthy lifestyle choices remain essential for preventing or managing diabetes.

Diabetes Awareness: Delay or Prevent Type 2 Diabetes Diabetes Awareness: Delay or Prevent Type 2 Diabetes By Laura Hieronymus, DNP, MSEd, RN, MLDE, BC-ADM, CDCES, FADCES, Diabetes is a growing epidemic in the United States and around the world. Over one-third of the American population has a blood glucose level above the normal range. Of the United States’ 323 million people, approximately 30 million have diabetes, while another 84 million have . Given that one in three Americans is affected, everyone needs to be aware of the risk factors for developing diabetes. It is essential to know how to be proactive to delay and prevent the onset of and its associated . Prediabetes and diabetes can lead to both physical complications and financial burdens when not properly treated and controlled. If you have prediabetes, you are at a greater risk of developing Type 2 diabetes, and stroke. Both the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have developed tests to evaluate your risk for developing prediabetes and diabetes. To take the risk test, visit the or the . Here we take a look at what diabetes is and specific risk factors for developing it, as well as diagnostic criteria for prediabetes/diabetes and ways to delay or prevent diabetes. We will further explore how you can help educate family, friends, co-workers and others about their risk for developing diabetes and ways to reduce their risk. Prediabetes is an elevation in blood glucose levels that is higher than normal but not high enough to be diabetes. Diabetes is a disease in which the pancreas does not make enough insulin or the insulin made by the pancreas cannot be used correctly, also known as . Insulin is necessary to move our primary source of energy, carbohydrate, into our cells. Carbohydrate is a nutrient that turns into glucose. When people do not make enough insulin or their body cannot use the insulin produced, they start to develop high blood glucose levels, leading to prediabetes or diabetes. What are the risk factors for developing prediabetes and diabetes? Many factors can increase an individual’s risk for developing prediabetes or diabetes. These factors include being overweight/obese, having a family history of diabetes (especially a first-degree relative such as a parent or sibling), sedentary lifestyle, age and race. Certain races and ethnicities have a higher risk of developing diabetes, including African American, Native American, Alaska Native, Hawaiian, Pacific Islander, Asian American, Hispanic or Latino. When looking at risk factors for Type 2 diabetes, one should consider which are modifiable (i.e., what one can change) and which are non-modifiable risk factors (i.e., what one cannot change). Laboratory testing for prediabetes and Type 2 diabetes should be considered when risk factors are present. These tests can be ordered by a primary-care provider. Factors that increase the risk for prediabetes and/or Type 2 diabetes include a greater than or equal to 25 kg/m2 or Asian Americans with a BMI equal to 23 kg/m2 or greater. People over the age of 45, women with a history of , people with a history of heart disease or stroke, high blood pressure, low HDL cholesterol, or high triglycerides and women with are at increased risk as well. Diagnosing prediabetes and diabetes is done by analyzing blood in a clinical laboratory, such as the one in your health-care provider’s office. These tests include a , an and an . An FBG is done after a person has not consumed any calories from food or drink for at least eight hours. An OGTT looks at your body’s ability to absorb glucose after two hours. The A1C can be taken at any time and estimates your blood glucose for the past three months. Prediabetes is diagnosed if a person’s FBG is 100 to 125 mg/dL, two-hour OGTT is 140 to 199 mg/dL or A1C falls between 5.7 and 6.4 percent. A diabetes diagnosis occurs if a person’s FBG is greater than or equal to 126 mg/dL, two-hour OGTT is greater than or equal to 200 mg/dL and A1C is greater than or equal to 6.5 percent. What can I do to delay or prevent prediabetes and diabetes? There are many steps you can take to delay or prevent prediabetes and diabetes. Specifically, strive to be and be as close to a healthy weight as possible. Tips for better nutrition include eating less and/or having smaller portions of your favorite foods. One way to decrease portion size is using a smaller plate, like a salad plate instead of a dinner plate. Using the can also help with portion control because it requires half of your plate to contain non-starchy vegetables like green beans, tomatoes, carrots and salad greens, a quarter of your plate to contain a protein such as chicken, eggs, turkey or beef, and the remaining quarter of your plate to contain a carbohydrate such as a dinner roll, pasta, rice, corn, black beans or potatoes. The plate method works by only encouraging one plate serving per meal (no seconds, please). Food preparation is also crucial for healthy eating. Try to eat more foods that are steamed, baked or grilled, and leave off high-fat sauces, gravies and condiments like butter, regular salad dressing and mayonnaise. Finally, think about your snacks and drinks throughout the day. Planning ahead can help you eliminate extra calories and stick to your healthy eating plan. Nutritious snacks include raw vegetables, low-fat cheese or small pieces of fresh fruit. Drink plenty of water and sugar-free drinks, like unsweetened tea or coffee, instead of regular soda and other sugar-sweetened beverages. Increased physical activity will also reduce your risk of developing prediabetes and Type 2 diabetes. Physical activity decreases insulin resistance, which will increase insulin sensitivity. Before engaging in any physical activity, always talk to your primary-care provider about starting an activity plan. Most adults should participate in at least 150 minutes of moderate activity per week. Examples of moderate exercise include walking, jogging, swimming, hiking, aerobic dancing and heavy cleaning (i.e., mopping or vacuuming). Adults should additionally perform some resistance and flexibility exercises two to three times per week. Physical activity and exercise make you feel better by giving you more energy, toned muscles and assistance with needed weight loss. Try to be physically active more days than not, and do some type of activity (i.e., standing, stretching or walking) every 30 minutes to reduce prolonged periods of being sedentary. Weight management is another risk reducer. A normal BMI is defined between 18.5 to 24.9 kg/m2. Anyone considered overweight or obese can still reduce their personal risk of developing diabetes with a modest weight change of 5 to 10 percent of their current body weight. For example, a person weighing 200 pounds can reduce the risk of developing diabetes by losing 10 to 20 pounds. Weight loss achievement occurs with decreased calorie consumption through healthy eating and increased physical activity. To learn more about BMI and to calculate yours, go to . Finally, you can reduce your risk for prediabetes and Type 2 diabetes by developing . Everyone has both physical and emotional stress in their lives. Healthy coping includes daily well-being habits of nutritious eating, increased activity and . Lack of sleep can affect the body’s ability to process glucose. Stress-relieving activities include doing things that are fun for you, perhaps spending time with friends and family, working on a hobby, watching television, listening to music, reading a book and anything else that reduces stress in your life. How can I help others reduce their risk of developing prediabetes and diabetes? Start by talking with your family and friends about risk factors. Know your personal family history of diabetes. Tell other family members if you or someone else in the family has Type 2 diabetes because this increases their risk for the disease. Get screened for diabetes and encourage others to get tested — it could save their lives. Form support groups that promote healthy lifestyles through nutritious eating and increased physical activity. Start a walking or bicycle riding group. Get trained as a lay health coach to educate and help others. After training as a lay health coach, use your knowledge to inform others about risk factors for developing diabetes and resources available to prevent it. Other places to consider helping people learn more about prediabetes and Type 2 diabetes include places of worship, hair salons, barber shops, family reunions and support groups.

Mayo Clinic Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences Mayo Clinic School of Continuous Professional Development Prediabetes means you have a higher than normal blood sugar level. It's not high enough to be considered type 2 diabetes yet, but without lifestyle changes, adults and children with prediabetes are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes. If you have prediabetes, the long-term damage of diabetes — especially to your heart, blood vessels and kidneys — may already be starting. There's good news, however. Progression from prediabetes to type 2 diabetes isn't inevitable. Eating healthy foods, making physical activity part of your daily routine and staying at a healthy weight can help bring your blood sugar level back to normal. The same lifestyle changes that can help prevent type 2 diabetes in adults might also help bring children's blood sugar levels back to normal. Prediabetes doesn't usually have any signs or symptoms. One possible sign of prediabetes is darkened skin on certain parts of the body. Affected areas can include the neck, armpits, elbows, knees and knuckles. Classic signs and symptoms that suggest you've moved from prediabetes to type 2 diabetes include: See your doctor if you're concerned about diabetes or if you notice any type 2 diabetes signs or symptoms. Ask your doctor about blood sugar screening if you have any risk factors for diabetes. The exact cause of prediabetes is unknown. But family history and genetics appear to play an important role. A lack of regular physical activity and being overweight with excess fat around your abdomen also seem to be important factors. What is clear is that people with prediabetes don't process sugar (glucose) properly anymore. As a result, sugar builds up in the blood instead of doing its normal job of giving energy to the cells that make up muscles and other tissues. Most of the glucose in your body comes from the food you eat. When food is digested, sugar enters your bloodstream. Moving sugar from your bloodstream to your body's cells requires a hormone called insulin. Insulin comes from a gland located behind the stomach called the pancreas. Your pancreas sends insulin to your blood when you eat. As insulin circulates, it allows sugar to enter your cells — and lowers the amount of sugar in your blood. When your blood sugar level starts to drop, the pancreas slows down the secretion of insulin into the blood. When you have prediabetes, this process doesn't work as well. Your pancreas may not make enough insulin or cells become resistant to insulin and don't allow as much sugar in. So, instead of fueling your cells, sugar builds up in your bloodstream. The same factors that increase the odds of getting type 2 diabetes also increase the risk of prediabetes. These factors include: Being overweight is a primary risk factor for prediabetes. The more fatty tissue you have — especially inside and between the muscle and skin around your abdomen — the more resistant your cells become to insulin. A large waist size can indicate insulin resistance. The risk of insulin resistance goes up for men with waists larger than 40 inches and for women with waists larger than 35 inches. Eating red meat and processed meat, and drinking sugar-sweetened beverages, is associated with a higher risk of prediabetes. A diet high in fruits, vegetables, nuts, whole grains and olive oil is associated with a lower risk of prediabetes. The less active you are, the greater your risk of prediabetes. Physical activity helps you control your weight, uses up sugar for energy and makes the body use insulin more effectively. Although diabetes can develop at any age, the risk of prediabetes increases after age 45. Your risk of prediabetes increases if you have a parent or sibling with type 2 diabetes. Although it's unclear why, certain people — including Black, Hispanic, American Indian and Asian American people — are more likely to develop prediabetes. If you had diabetes while pregnant (gestational diabetes), you and your child are at higher risk of developing prediabetes. If you've had gestational diabetes, your doctor will likely check your blood sugar levels at least once every three years. Women with this common condition — characterized by irregular menstrual periods, excess hair growth and obesity — have a higher risk of prediabetes. People with obstructive sleep apnea — a condition that disrupts sleep repeatedly — have an increased risk of insulin resistance. Smoking may increase insulin resistance. Smokers also seem to carry more weight around the middle. Other conditions associated with prediabetes include: Low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, the ""good"" cholesterol High levels of triglycerides — a type of fat in your blood When these conditions occur with obesity, they are associated with insulin resistance. The combination of three or more of these conditions is often called metabolic syndrome. The most serious consequence of prediabetes is progression to type 2 diabetes. That's because type 2 diabetes can lead to: Prediabetes has been linked with unrecognized (silent) heart attacks and can damage your kidneys, even if you haven't progressed to type 2 diabetes.

Introduction Presently, the incidence of type 2 diabetes is increasing at an alarming rate within the United States (US) and also on a global scale [1, 2]. According to the International Diabetes Federation [3], the global population of adults with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes is projected to increase from 382 million in 2013 to 592 million by 2035, with type 2 diabetes specifically accounting for 90-95% of cases [4]. Immigrants worldwide are experiencing this increased risk for type 2 diabetes due to lifestyle changes [5]. According to the CDC [6], small cities in the US like Champaign, Illinois--which has a relatively large number of Congolese immigrants [7, 8]--had a proportion of diagnosed diabetes that has risen slightly from an estimated 7.1% in 2009 to 8% in 2013. While diabetes in Champaign is more prevalent among minorities [9], the prevalence of diabetes among immigrants from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) living in the Champaign area remains unstudied. Yet, the DRC reported a prevalence of 1.7 million cases of diabetes out of a total 14 million diabetics in Africa in 2015. That is, the prevalence of diabetic adults was estimated at 5.3% in DRC [10]. Despite relatively high diabetes proportion reported in the country of origin, Venters and Gany [11] discovered that the prevalence of diabetes among African immigrants is not widely reported in the country of resettlement. Additionally, the prevalence of overweight and obesity diagnoses--often a consequence of losing traditional dietary habits and adapting unhealthy behaviors-- is found to be a contributing factor to the epidemic. Commonly, immigrants tend to travel to developed countries where epidemiological transition, increased urbanization, and other environmental factors can often influence rapid changes in lifestyle, including dietary habits [12]. Choukem et al. [5] argued that swift changes in lifestyle, along with a genetic background, can increase the likelihood of developing chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes. Additionally, the development of type 2 diabetes in immigrants is tied to metabolic alterations resulting from changes in dietary habits--the habitual decisions of individuals or groups of people regarding what foods they eat [13]. With dietary habits changing drastically due to their emigration, immigrants such as the Congolese in the US are at great risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared to those who remained in their country of origin [5]. For African immigrants, an additional factor influencing the increased incidence of type 2 diabetes is culture. In some sub-Saharan African culture, being overweight or obese is sometimes considered a sign of wealth [14, 15]. The interaction between body weight and wealth is a concept that serves as an example of the existential cultural perceptions present in communities like the Congolese immigrant group. Due to this cultural belief, host countries could face challenges implementing diabetes prevention programs because of potential conflict with cultural perceptions regarding health and body weight among African immigrants [16]. The intersection of (a) post-resettlement changes in dietary habits and (b) engaging in a more sedentary lifestyle makes designing culturally appropriate interventions necessary and challenging [11]. The purpose of this study was to explore the perceptions of dietary habits and type 2 diabetes risk among Congolese immigrants living in the US. We believe that understanding how cultural perceptions affect dietary behaviors of Congolese would be foundational and a stepping stone for future exploration on topics in this population such as body image and exercise. We used the PEN-3 cultural model as a guide to examine the sociocultural factors associated with Congolese immigrants' perceptions of diet and type 2 diabetes risk. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Conceptual Framework. The PEN-3 model was the conceptual framework used to guide the analysis of the current investigation. This model has been successfully used in studies that underscored the importance of culture in health [17]. Thus, the model is primarily used as a framework for health promotion and disease prevention strategies that emphasize the role of culture. The PEN-3 model has three domains: cultural identity, relationships and expectations, and cultural empowerment. The PEN-3 domains have proven to be specifically effective in highlighting the role and importance of cultural factors within perceptions of diabetes risk factors [18]. According to Airhihenbuwa [17], the relationships and expectations domain categorizes insights as perceptions, enablers, and nurturers, while the cultural empowerment domain assesses beliefs by classifying them as positive, existential, and negative. The cultural identity domain serves primarily as the intervention points of entry for developed strategies and can occur at the level of persons, extended family members, or neighborhood [17]. For the purpose of this study, the relationships and expectations and cultural empowerment domains were relied on for the needs assessment. 2.2. Study Design. This qualitative study utilized photoelicitation supplemented with in-depth interviews to collect data from Congolese immigrants aged 35 years or older. The rationale behind these ages is justified by recommendations of the American Diabetes Association for people of African descent or other at-risk individuals for immediate type 2 diabetes screening [19]. Photo-elicitation is an interviewing technique that uses visual images (e.g., photos, videos, and paintings) to spark conversation among study participants and the interviewer [20]. Hatten et al. [21] proclaimed that pictures often capture experiences that shape the way people think. In this study, three researchers (the primary researcher and two independent researchers) selected pictures used for photo-elicitation and pilot-tested the images to ensure that the experiential focus of the investigation was captured. This study was approved by the University of Illinois Institutional Review Board. Upon completion of informed consents from each participant, first photo-elicitation was used to spark a conversation about perceptions of risk factors for type 2 diabetes and followed by in-depth interview using questions guided by the PEN-3 model. 2.3. Participants. Twenty (20) Congolese immigrants participated in this study and were divided equally by gender (10 males and 10 females). Recruitment took place by telephone or word of mouth in Champaign county, Illinois, where relatively high concentrations of Congolese immigrants live [7]. Participants were prescreened as nondiabetics; the study objective was to derive perceptions of dietary habit around type 2 diabetes prior to any diagnoses of type 2 diabetes. Demographic data was collected for participants, including marital status, employment status, and residence status. It has been shown that these factors can correlate with the risk factors of diabetes [22]. 2.4. In-Depth Interview Protocol. Photo-elicitation and in-depth interview sessions were conducted at times and locations convenient for participants. Each session lasted approximately 60 minutes. Two trained Congolese researchers conducted separate interviews and photoelicitation sessions in French for men and women, respectively. Interviews were conducted in French because French is the preferred language of communication for most Congolese. Before the commencement of interviews, demographic data was collected. Interviews were (a) audio-recorded with permission from participants, (b) transcribed verbatim in French, and (c) translated in English by third party individuals to avoid translation bias by the researchers. There were 3 questions for the photo-elicitation process and 13 open-ended questions (including probes) for in-depth interviews (Table 1) which sought to capture participants' perceptions about the interaction between their dietary behaviors and risk for type 2 diabetes. Saturation was reached with the 20 persons interviewed through photoelicitation and in-depth interview. 2.5. Data Analysis. Using NVivo 11 software for the qualitative analysis of data, three researchers triangulated the data by reading the English transcripts, coding them, highlighting conceptual labels, creating categories, and identifying emergent themes that evolved from the data. All independent researchers were in agreement with emergent themes to ensure inter-coder reliability. These themes were then situated within the conceptual framework in order to ground the findings in theory. Analyzed data were presented back to 10 participants (5 males and 5 females) for member checking, which is a crucial technique in establishing trustworthiness and validity in qualitative approach [23]. Participants reported that the interpretation of phenomenon and themes reflected in the analysis accurately resonated their perspectives. 3. Results Table 2 summarizes the basic demographic characteristics of study participants. Overall, we found that the mean age was 43.7 [+ or -] 6.63 and 44.7 [+ or -] 5.46 years among male and female participants, respectively. Only two domains (relationships and expectations and cultural empowerment) were used to analyze the qualitative data collected. The cultural identity domain--that refers to the intervention points of entry [18]--was not used. The emergent themes were categorized according to the PEN-3 domains (i.e., relationships and expectations and cultural empowerment). Each domain contains three subcategories. For instance, relationships and expectations has perceptions, enablers, and nurturers as subcategories, while cultural empowerment has positive, existential, and negative for subcategories. 3.1. Perceptions. According to Airhihenbuwa and Webster [24], perceptions refer to knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs toward dietary habits and type 2 diabetes risks. In this study, participants commonly perceived American fast foods as a factor that can influence poor health and risks for type 2 diabetes (Figure 1). With the consumption of westernized foods in restaurant settings--despite concerns of the effect added ingredients have on their health outcome--our findings suggest that participants believed ""westernized"" or American foods should only be consumed occasionally to limit the risk for type 2 diabetes. One participant shared the following: I think this (pizza) is good food but not good to consume every day because I always fear with all the added ingredients, which cannot be good for my health...that's why I gave a detail I say no! No! I do not like pork, do not put pork on my pizza because I think pork will give me more fat. (Male, 45 years) Another participant stated that I think that everything they sell in the fast food restaurants, they do not think about the effect it can bring to consumers and as we prepare at home then I think that I can eat it (happy meal)... occasionally, so once a month, that's fine.because it will increase the risk for diabetes. (Female, 46 years) In addition, participants suggested that eating traditional Congolese foods was protective towards type 2 diabetes risks. Participants linked their Congolese identity to healthy food choices and minimal dietary acculturation (the process by which immigrants adopt the dietary practices of the host country) [25]. For example, participants suggested I am proud to be Congolese because we eat well, fish, vegetables that decrease the chance of developing diabetes. We eat the right things and I, personally, continue to eat the same thing. For us, we are not used to eat too much meat. (Male, 42 years) I eat foods that I started eating since I was a child in DRC. I think it is good, it is better and if I continue to eat the same type of foods I wouldn't develop diabetes as there is not too much sugar in them. (Female, 40 years) Yeah so the quality of the food in my case for example I eat much more African [Congolese] foods where there is... where it's natural food, where there is no excess calories. So I think it's good! ...I wonder if it is not for this reason that I keep a bit the same size. (Male, 58 years) These comments stressed the belief around the relationship between type 2 diabetes and specific foods. For some participants, diabetes was described as the excessive consumption of sweetened food or food products. For instance, participants shared the following: I think diabetes is primarily the excess of sugar in the body. The word diabetes evokes sugar and where there is a high consumption of sugary foods. (Male, 38 years) Yeah, because if we do not eat properly... if we do not control diet and we have added sugar levels in the body and this is what causes diabetes. (Female, 45 years) I know diabetes is caused by excessive consumption of sweetened foods like cakes, candy, and soda. (Male, 58 years) For me, I try to stay away from things like cookies and sodas to avoid diabetes, I prefer to drink water. (Female, 42 years) 3.2. Enablers. Enablers are defined as resources and institutional forces in the community that encourage or discourage dietary habits that can influence risk for type 2 diabetes [24]. In our study, participants acknowledged that they lived close to grocery stores; however, the majority of these stores did not provide healthy food options that could minimize risks for type 2 diabetes. Participants believed grocery stores, establishments in various communities, are mostly comprised of unhealthy, sweetened, food products and lack indigenous ingredients used to prepare healthier traditional food. For example, some participants shared the following: Grocery stores are not too far from here.Not me personally, I find that stores do not help people to eat well, because at the entrance there are always sweet stuffs. (Female, 42 years) I don't have a problem accessing the grocery stores at all, but I have problem finding my Congolese foods in the stores, especially those big stores. (Male, 40 years) Another participant noted the following: Grocery stores are generally clean, but they have a lot of sweet stuff that [...] expose us to diabetes. (Male, 50 years) Furthermore, participants described misinformation as a factor between their dietary habits and risk for type 2 diabetes. Participants mentioned the reason they relied on health care professionals or doctors for information is because they have been trained to understand the factors that affect diet and create type 2 diabetes risk. Our findings highlight that participants discussed resources in the community they rely on for health information. Some participants noted that they relied on health care professionals for correct information concerning risk for type 2 diabetes. For instance, participants stated I prefer to talk to specialists, a specialist doctor. Yes, because he studied this matter [diet and diabetes risk] and has the expertise. Rather than to go talk to someone, who can misguide me and can give me any ideas that are not verifiable and can be dangerous. (Male, 58 years) I go to the hospital when I have questions about diabetes, I go to the doctor. Doctors can give us information about the disease. They can tell us here are the symptoms of the disease. (Female, 35 years) 3.3. Nurturers. Nurturers refer to the role family members or friends play with supporting and/or discouraging dietary habits likely to influence type 2 diabetes risks [24]. The majority of participants mentioned that their parents influenced perceptions and values they have regarding their dietary habits and type 2 diabetes risk. Additionally, their parents emphasized the importance of limiting the consumption of food high in sugar and eating more ""bitter"" vegetables as a way of preventing type 2 diabetes. Participants also acknowledged first learning about type 2 diabetes risk and dietary habits from their parents. These views were illustrated with the following quotes: Even our parents told us when we were growing up to avoid consuming lots of sugar. Well, when we were young, our parents were saying that we should eat well, even in Kinshasa, we were asked to eat Bilolo [a bitter vegetable] is good as it prevents diabetes. (Male, 42 years) [...] As always when we were children we were told by our parents if you take too much sugar you'll have diabetes. (Female, 45 years) My mom used to tell me not to put too much sugar in my tea, as this will give me diabetes. (Male, 35 years) When I was a child, my parents wanted me to eat bitter foods instead of consuming sweetened foods to avoid diabetes. (Female, 38 years) 3.4. Positive. The positive dimension refers to values and relationships that promote healthy dietary habits and reduce type 2 diabetes risks [24]. Findings suggest that participants perceived Congolese dietary habits as healthy because its organic ingredients could positively influence health (Figure 2). Participants noted that consuming naturally grown food promotes healthy dietary habits that reduce type 2 diabetes risk. Participants shared the following statements: It [Congolese food] is organic, we eat produces grown naturally, without fertilizers and that's really the strong point of the Congolese foods. We're used to eating ""domestic poultry"" but here I don't know even what to say about chickens that grow within one week. These are the things that in the long run, we don't even know if that can cause disease. (Female, 42 years) We eat produces that have been grown naturally with less fertilizers and chemicals. I think consuming organic produces protect us from developing diabetes. (Male, 35 years) Participants also mentioned the benefits of consuming specific vegetables in order to control blood sugar levels. For example, some tribes have traditional, indigenous vegetables that are believed to lower sugar levels. It was mentioned by some participants that the consumption of those vegetables serves as both controlling and protective factors for diabetic and nondiabetic individuals, respectively. One participant summarized this view by saying the following: Especially in Kinshasa there is Fumbwa [eru or Gnetum africanum, a local vegetable]. For example, I have the case of a brother-in-law who was in Italy he had diabetes. He came to Kinshasa and they advised him to consume Fumbwa; He took some, he found that it (Fumbwa) had reduced his sugar level... He went to Italy; he had his friend, who had two children who suffered of diabetes, when he came to Kinshasa and he bought a significant amount of Fumbwa to bring to Italy. (Male, 47 years) Another participant said this: In our tribe Yanzi [a tribe from the south-west part of the country], we have roots known as Mizinzi, a legume that helps lowering sugar level and not develop diabetes. (Female, 42 years) 3.5. Existential. The existential dimension describes ""values and beliefs that are present in the culture and are harmless to health"" [24]. The preparation of food is culturally assessed through the smell of the food--a notion that has neither negative nor positive influence in regard to diabetic risk. In this study, participants talked about the Congolese cooking methods that highlight a cultural practice to determine if foods are overcooked, undercooked, or done. Participants suggested the following: For me, I know that the food is ready from its smell. (Female, 56 years) Since in our culture, we don't use thermometer to say that food is ready when we are cooking, I rely on smell. (Female, 35 years) From its smell when I am cooking I can tell if foods are raw or done. (Female, 42 years) 3.6. Negative. The negative dimension pertains to values, behaviors, and relationships that pose a negative impact on dietary habits and type 2 diabetes risk and requires immediate change in order to reduce or prevent negative health outcomes [24]. Our findings indicate that health education on type 2 diabetes is perceived as a negative factor. The paucity in exposure to and sharing of type 2 diabetes prevention knowledge can negatively influence participants' motivation to further pursue knowledge about type 2 diabetes and its preventative education. This stems from comments participants made regarding a relative lack of interest in learning more about dietary habits and type 2 diabetes risk. Participants made comments such as the following: No, as there is no one in our family who has diabetes. I never got interested in knowing more about the relationship that exists between diet and diabetes onset. (Male, 47 years) We try to share with them (children) as I do not have someone who has diabetes, I do not really have more information on that [impact of food on diabetes risks]. (Female, 46 years) Table 3 below summarizes and highlights the interaction that exists between the two selected PEN-3 model tenets (i.e., relationships and expectations and cultural empowerment). 4. Discussion The results of this study revealed that Congolese immigrants have intrinsic, cultural ways of understanding and interpreting the interaction between dietary habits and risk for type 2 diabetes. For instance, they believed that type 2 diabetes is specifically related to the excessive consumption of sugary foods or drinks. While this is not the only practice that leads to type 2 diabetes, it is congruent with previous results [26] that report that sugar-sweetened beverages are associated with high risk for type 2 diabetes. However, this study's [26] findings were only associated with sugar-sweetened drinks and nothing else. In addition, the study revealed that Congolese immigrants obtained those beliefs regarding sweetened foods and type 2 diabetes from their parents and are in turn conveying those beliefs to their offspring. This is consistent with studies that demonstrate the impact of family members as primary sources of information on and assistance with health behaviors often associated with chronic diseases such as diabetes [27, 28]. This underlines the significant and influential roles that parents play in shaping the views and attitudes of their children. Findings also showed a perceived awareness of unhealthy food products in supermarkets within participants' local communities; however, that perception does not prevent shopping in those establishments. This is due to a general lack of alternatives that are too distant, too costly, or do not carry Congolese indigenous food products. This aligns with Rodriguez et al.'s [29] findings which reported that food prices and the cost of various traditional products influence food access among immigrants in supermarkets. This can potentially affect any change or maintenance of healthy food options for Congolese immigrants. Traditional diets are an integral aspect of the Congolese culture. The study findings illustrate how participants noted that the consumption of traditional Congolese meals was healthier when compared to the available dietary options in the US. Participants further suggested that traditional meals can even serve as protective from type 2 diabetes. Participants viewed their traditional diets as rich in organic products, prepared naturally without the use of synthetic products. On the other hand, American diet was perceived by participants to be high in calories and sugar, which they believed can cause type 2 diabetes. These findings are parallel to findings from a study on transnational African immigrants (from Nigeria and Ghana) who perceived their traditional diets to be healthier than the American diet because its preparation process permits them more control of what enters their body--therefore allowing more control of their health [30]. Additionally, participants reflected on their habits of consuming indigenous greens and vegetables to reduce blood sugar levels. While most study participants shared this belief, it does not have any scientific premises. This cultural belief led a group of scholars [31] to conduct an ongoing study on the antidiabetic properties of vegetables like Fumbwa (i.e., a vegetable cited by participants in the current study). Another study by Moise et al. [32] attempted to debunk the myth and found no association between a paucity in Fumbwa consumption and diabetic complications. This, however, was conducted only among diabetic people. This study found that the majority of participants did not report a direct connection between type 2 diabetes risks and carbohydrate foods such as rice or beans. Those able to identify a connection between carbohydrate foods and type 2 diabetes risks learnt this information through either a diabetic friend or relative. The same trend was observed by Foley and BeLue [33], reporting on dietary management among type 2 diabetic patients in Senegal. They found that relatives of diabetic individuals were more likely to perceive a connection between carbohydrates and type 2 diabetes risks. In addition, participants' low diabetes-related knowledge resonates with another study [34], reporting that half of diabetic Nigerians had low knowledge of diabetes. Thus, our findings indicate that low diabetes knowledge not only is related to diabetic individuals, but also affects nondiabetic individuals. Speculations on Congolese immigrants' tendency to show minimal concern about type 2 diabetes risks could be related to their societal and cultural backgrounds. Congolese immigrants come from a country where health screening is not part of the culture nor is it common practice due to poorly equipped medical infrastructures and the absence of effective health education programs [7]. This highlights the need to educate our population of interest on type 2 diabetes, as they exist within a group that is at high risk to develop the disease. Findings from this study provide the groundwork for interventionists to incorporate perceptions of diabetes risk factors among Congolese immigrants into a diabetes prevention program (Table 3). This particularly suggests the preference to preserve the consumption of Congolese traditional foods as opposed to ""American foods,"" which this population perceives as unhealthy. While the findings of the study could be applied to most instances, there were limitations that should be acknowledged. First, its purposive sampling limits the generalizability of findings generated from the collected data. Second, not all Congolese aged 35 years or older living in Champaign were included in the study. Third, social desirability bias serves as a limitation because participants could respond to questions to appear favorable in relation to societal standards. 5. Conclusion This study sheds light on perceptions of dietary habits among Congolese immigrants related to risks for type 2 diabetes. Using the PEN-3 cultural model as a guide, we identified positive, existential, and negative perceptions, along with the enablers, and nurturers associated with dietary habits and type 2 diabetes risks. Participants also acknowledged their own cultural approaches to understanding and interpreting the interaction between dietary habits and type 2 diabetes risks among Congolese immigrants that may influence their health-seeking practices. The findings underscore the importance of how cultural and sociocultural factors can influence the designing of culturally appropriate interventions aimed at addressing the risks for type 2 diabetes among Congolese immigrants in the US. https://doi.org/10.1155/2017/4736176 Conflicts of Interest The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest regarding the publication of this article.

a4276ec6-e7fd-47a9-9150-bc38a912bdfa,"Diabetes is a chronic hormonal disease, which causes high levels of sugar in the blood. It is a result of either the lack of insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas, or your body’s inability to respond to this hormone. High blood sugar levels caused by lack of this hormone is called . It is a genetic condition caused by faulty genes that make this chemical and affects mostly young adults and teenagers. When your blood sugar levels escalate due to the failure of response to this hormone,  it is known as . It is a more common type of diabetes and is also known as ‘adult onset diabetes’. This condition is triggered  mainly by lifestyle factors like an unhealthy diet, and Today, type 2 diabetes is one of the most common ‘’ among people across the world. This is unfortunate because it can also increase your risk of conditions like and . Some of the common symptoms of diabetes are excessive hunger, frequent urination and increased thirst. While type 1 diabetes is difficult to manage, type 2 can be controlled by making simple changes in your daily routine. Diabetes has today assumed epidemic proportions globally and India has emerged as the diabetes capital of the world. There are mainly 3 types of diabetes:  This is a genetic condition that is also known as juvenile-onset diabetes. It is caused by lack of insulin in the body.  This is the most common type of diabetes and is also known as adult onset diabetes. It is mainly triggered by lifestyle factors like unhealthy eating, sedentary lifestyle, stress, etc.  This develops during pregnancy. When a woman is pregnant, she may experience a temporary increase in her blood sugar levels. If left untreated it can lead to type 2 diabetes. Diabetes has emerged as a major threat over the past few decades and is still spreading alarmingly all over the world. A number of factors are responsible for such a heavy burden of this disease.  Here are the top four risk factors of this condition: As a person ages, several physiological functions are impaired, one of them being your body's capacity to use insulin effectively. can be responsible for causing type 1 diabetes. Having certain combination of genes may increase or decrease the risk of this form of diabetes. If your parents were diabetic, you should be extra careful about your lifestyle habits.  A British health report has warned that adults with a big are five times more likely to develop type 2 diabetes. According to the report, women with a waist circumference of over 88 cm (34.6 inches) are three times more likely to develop type 2 diabetes. : A study at the Stanford University Medical Center says that exposure to certain pesticides or chemicals and even one form of vitamin E may increase your risk of diabetes. Some of these so-called environmental cues with diabetes ‘surpasses that of the best genetic markers scientists have identified for the disease’, say researchers. : Scientists say that people of certain ethnicities are more prone to type 2 diabetes. There is a higher prevalence of this condition among African Americans, Asian Americans and Hispanic Americans. Even native Americans and Pacific Islanders are more prone to this disease. While our dietary habits exert great influence on the development of diabetes, lifestyle factors do have an influence too, most notably . One of the most dreaded complications that comes along with high blood sugar levels is cardiac ailment. The nicotine in cigarettes narrows down the blood vessels and makes them hard, increasing your risk of heart diseases. So, quitting smoking is an essential for everyone, and more so for people living with diabetes. Our digestive system breaks down the food we eat into glucose. This glucose is absorbed by our blood with the help of a hormone called insulin produced by beta cells in the pancreas. Diabetes occurs when the body is not able to produce this hormone or is not able to use it effectively. Here are some of the reasons why this happens. Sometimes, our own immune system may recognise insulin-producing beta cells as antigens, and create antibodies to destroy them. Often, diabetes is diagnosed after most of the cells are destroyed. In that case, the patient then needs a daily dose of insulin to survive. Lack of exercise and obesity can be major causes of type 2 diabetes. Just 30 minutes of physical activity reduces the chances of you having diabetes by 30 per cent, suggest some studies. So, make sure you include activities like walking and cycling in your daily timetable. Here are some  for diabetics that might help. Certain medicines like nicotinic acid, psychiatric drugs, , etc. can destroy the beta cells that produce insulin or disrupt its absorption. Since the beta cells are present in the pancreas – any injury or disease, like , , etc. can stop beta cells from functioning and ultimately lead to diabetes. In diabetes, the body is unable to absorb glucose which leads to a host of problems. Here are some of the that could indicate diabetes: Diabetes hinders the entry of glucose into your cells from the bloodstream, making you hungry and tired too. This happens due the insufficient production of insulin or ineffective usage of this hormone. When blood sugar levels go up, your body makes more urine. This makes you pee more often. Another outcome: You feel thirsty. Overproduction of urine depletes your body of moisture. That is why you feel dehydrated. Poor caused by high sugar levels can lead to nerve damage. This, in turn, makes it difficult for your body to repair any sort of damage. Glucose helps yeast to thrive. So, people with long-term diabetes are likely to get this fungal infection. This is typically one of the symptoms of type 1 diabetes. Lack of insulin doesn’t allow food to be broken down into glucose. So your body can’t rely on foods for energy. Instead, it uses your fat and muscles for energy. That’s how you end up losing weight without even trying. : This happens because of inadequate glucose supply and nutrition to the brain. You may suddenly feel irritated for no reason. Depression is also another symptom of diabetes. Diabetes is diagnosed with blood tests. The most important blood examinations used for detecting this condition are: This test is used for diagnosing Type 2 diabetes. It measures a person’s average blood glucose levels over the past three months. An  below 5.7%falls in the normal range. If it is between 5.7 to 6.4%, it indicates which may lead to diabetes if appropriate measures are not taken on time. A person is diagnosed with diabetes if he/she has an A1C level of 6.5% or above. The Fasting Plasma Glucose test is the most common test used for diagnosing diabetes. It is performed by measuring a person’s blood sugar level, after he/she has fasted for at least 8 hours. If a person has a fasting glucose level of 126 mg/dL or above, he or she has diabetes. It is advised to repeat the test on another day for confirmation. This test can be performed at home with a . This blood test is performed to check how tolerant your body is to glucose. For this test you have to take 75g of glucose orally. Blood sample is drawn two hours after taking glucose. If the reading reveals 200 mg/dl or above, then you are diagnosed with diabetes. A reading between 140 mg/dl and 200 mg/dl indicates impaired glucose tolerance. This blood test determines your body’s ability to metabolise sugar or carbohydrate. It helps to diagnose prediabetes, gestational diabetes and insulin resistance. One has to fast for 8-12 hours before the test. The first blood sample is taken on an empty stomach. The next blood sample is drawn 2 hours after you take a glucose drink. A person is diabetic if the fasting value of the test is over 7.0 mmol/L and the reading at 2 hours is 11.0 mmol/L. The four pillars of diabetes management include constant monitoring at home, oral medicines, shots/pumps, well-planned diet and exercise. Checking blood sugar levels at home is crucial to figure out your changing need of insulin or medicines. You need to monitor it several times a day at home. A device known as is used to do so. There are also more sophisticated devices like continuous glucose monitoring systems (CGMS) to help you keep a track of your blood sugar levels. This system can attached to your body to take blood sugar readings every few minutes. People with type 1 diabetes need to take insulin shots. In some cases, type 2 diabetes patients may also need it. The dosage is decided by your doctor based on your condition. There are five types of injectable insulin: Rapid-acting (starts working within a few minutes and lasting 2-4 hours) Regular or short-acting (starts working within 30 minutes and lasting 3-6 hours) Intermediate-acting (starts working in 1-2 hours and lasting up to 18 hours) Long-acting (starts working in 1-2 hours and lasting beyond 24 hours) Ultra-long-acting (starts working 1-2 hours and lasting 42 hours) Apart from injectable insulin, there’s a computerised device known as insulin pump. Your doctor will help you set it, according to your requirement. People with type 2 diabetes may need oral drugs. These medicines function in a number of ways to bring down levels. While some increase insulin production by the pancreas, others bring down sugar absorption by the intestine. There are also drugs that improve your body’s insulin efficiency, reduce sugar production by the liver, so on and so forth. Your doctor may prescribe yet another type of drug--the ones that prevent your kidneys from reabsorption of glucose and help you excrete more of it through urine. Sticking to a well-planned balanced diet is the cornerstone of diabetes management. Work closely with your doctor and nutritionists to plan a . Your diet should be well-balanced between carbohydrates, proteins and fats. The quantity needs to be decided by your nutritionist on the basis on your blood sugar levels, body weight and personal preferences. If you are overweight, you may be advised a low-carb, low-fat, and low-calorie meal. Also, you need to avoid trans fats and high-sugar foods. The other food rules include high intake of fruits and vegetables, moderate consumption of alcohol, so on and so forth.  Also, following proper mealtimes is essential for diabetics. Regular workouts improve your body’s ability to use insulin. Exercising at least 30 minutes a day for 5 days a week is good for people living with diabetes. Regular workouts become all the more important if you are overweight. They improve blood circulation and reduce the risk of associated complications like heart diseases, nerve damage, etc. Diabetes, if uncontrolled can lead to detrimental health complications.  Associated with type 1 diabetes this condition occurs when your blood sugar is abnormally high and leads to the build-up of acidic substances called ketones. High levels of ketone can be fatal, if not managed on time. The symptoms of DKA include frequent urination, extreme thirst, high blood sugar levels, nausea or vomiting, , confusion, etc. : This is an eye problem associated with diabetes.The early symptoms include blurred vision and double vision. It can also cause permanent loss of vision. Diabetes increases the risk of developing and glaucoma too. If you are a diabetic, you need to follow certain  measures. High blood sugar levels affect your kidneys making them unable to perform their essential functions. This leads to toxin and fluid build-up in the body. If you notice swelling in your feet and legs or around your eyes, it could signal diabetic nephropathy. If you have  (or high BP), your chances of developing this is even higher. : High blood sugar levels lead to nerve damage, especially in your feet. In severe cases, this condition may need amputation. Uncontrolled diabetes can also affect nerves that control your heartbeat, blood pressure, digestion, blood flow to organs etc leading to diarrhoea, erectile dysfunction, loss of bladder control, vision changes, and dizziness.  H If you are a diabetic who smokes, have , and are overweight, you have a greater risk of developing , strokes.  According to some estimate, up to 60-70% of men having diabetes will experience problems with in their lifetime. This is because high blood sugar levels affects blood to various parts of the body including your sex organs. Diabetes negatively affects the body’s circulatory system, leading to poor blood circulation to the scalp too among other organs. Reduced blood flow to the scalp leads to the death of hair follicles triggering hair loss. Poor blood circulation may also prevent further Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disorder associated with your genes. There is no way one can prevent it. The risk of type 2 diabetes, on the other hand, can be brought down by lifestyle modifications like healthy eating and regular workouts. You need to be extra cautious if you have a family history of this condition. Stress management is an important factor behind diabetes risk reduction. Practising yoga regularly can help you maintain emotional equilibrium. ‘Enhanced immunity, no serious adverse events’: Lancet releases Covaxin’s Phase 1 trial data South African coronavirus variant may 'escape antibodies, cause reinfection' Beware!

ad3ee7a8-18e1-4136-9fef-35c70d42fa07,"Monday, 18 November 2019 A recent European study has found that women living with type 2 diabetes are at greater risk of cardiovascular complications with the trend set to increase in the coming decades. Cardiovascular disease is more likely to occur earlier in patients with diabetes. It can be up 15 years earlier and it is the main cause of morbidity and mortality. In women, the links between diabetes and cardiovascular disease are particularly potent. Globally, there are more deaths due to diabetes in women than in men (2.1 versus 1.8 million annually) – this excess risk is mainly due to the higher risk of cardiovascular death in women. Coronary heart disease is the most frequently reported form of cardiovascular disease and the most lethal one. Women with diabetes are at a 1.81-fold risk of death from coronary heart disease compared to women without diabetes. Men with diabetes have a 1.48-fold risk of death from coronary heart disease compared to men without diabetes. Peripheral artery disease – which can ultimately lead to foot amputation – is the most common initial manifestation of cardiovascular disease in patients with type 2 diabetes. Its prevalence is 1.8-fold higher in women compared to men. Heart failure is the second most common initial manifestation of cardiovascular disease in type 2 diabetes. Women with diabetes are five times more likely to get heart failure than women without diabetes. Men with diabetes are two times more likely to get heart failure than men without diabetes. Research is ongoing to explain these differences between women and men. One possible reason for the higher heart failure risk could be that a specific form is more common in women generally and is the type most likely to affect patients with diabetes. This form is called heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, where the heart maintains its pump function but has increased stiffness causing impaired relaxation after contraction. In both women and men, a healthy lifestyle is the cornerstone to preventing diabetes; once people have diabetes, it is fundamental to stopping the cardiovascular complications. Senior author Professor Joline Beulens, of Amsterdam University Medical Centre, the Netherlands said: “With the increased levels of obesity in our society we have seen an enormous rise in the prevalence of diabetes. We know that type 2 diabetes can be prevented or managed with better lifestyle behaviours.” “Lifestyle management is the first line of treatment for patients with diabetes. If lifestyle doesn’t sufficiently control glucose levels and the risk of complications, then glucose-lowering treatment should be initiated as the second line of therapy.” Professor Beulens said: “Patients with diabetes remain at significantly higher cardiovascular risk compared to people without diabetes. There is an urgent need to better identify, monitor, and control diabetes to prevent the devastating cardiovascular complications.” New research finds ways to identify people with pre-diabetes most at risk of developing type 2 diabetes All types of diabetes have been found to increase the risk of falls Adapted cancer therapy could treat type 1 diabetes  Researchers have adapted a cancer therapy which has the potential to treat type 1 diabetes Join our community of over 45,000 people living with diabetes Copyright ©2021 Diabetes NSW & ACT.

Consistently high blood glucose levels can lead to serious diseases affecting the and , , , and . In addition, people with diabetes also have a higher risk of developing infections. In almost all high-income countries, diabetes is a leading cause of , , , and . Maintaining blood glucose levels, blood pressure, and cholesterol at or close to normal can help delay or prevent diabetes complications. Therefore people with diabetes need regular monitoring. : affects the heart and blood vessels and may cause fatal complications such as coronary artery disease (leading to heart attack) and stroke. Cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of death in people with diabetes. High blood pressure, high cholesterol, high blood glucose and other risk factors contribute to increasing the risk of cardiovascular complications. . : caused by damage to small blood vessels in the kidneys leading to the kidneys becoming less efficient or to fail altogether. Kidney disease is much more common in people with diabetes than in those without diabetes. Maintaining near normal levels of blood glucose and blood pressure can greatly reduce the risk of kidney disease. . : diabetes can cause damage to the nerves throughout the body when blood glucose and blood pressure are too high. This can lead to problems with digestion, erectile dysfunction, and many other functions. Among the most commonly affected areas are the extremities, in particular the feet. Nerve damage in these areas is called peripheral neuropathy, and can lead to pain, tingling, and loss of feeling. Loss of feeling is particularly important because it can allow injuries to go unnoticed, leading to serious infections and possible amputations. People with diabetes carry a risk of amputation that may be more than 25 times greater than that of people without diabetes. However, with comprehensive management, a large proportion of amputations related to diabetes can be prevented. Even when amputation takes place, the remaining leg and the person’s life can be saved by good follow-up care from a multidisciplinary foot team. People with diabetes should regularly examine their feet. . : most people with diabetes will develop some form of eye disease (retinopathy) causing reduced vision or blindness. Consistently high levels of blood glucose, together with high blood pressure and high cholesterol, are the main causes of retinopathy. It can be managed through regular eye checks and keeping glucose and lipid levels at or close to normal. . : Women with any type of diabetes during pregnancy risk a number of complications if they do not carefully monitor and manage their condition. To prevent possible organ damage to the fetus, women with type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes should achieve target glucose levels before conception. All women with diabetes during pregnancy, type 1, type 2 or gestational should strive for target blood glucose levels throughout to minimize complications. High blood glucose during pregnancy can lead to the foetus putting on excess weight. This can lead to problems in delivery, trauma to the child and mother, and a sudden drop in blood glucose for the child after birth. Children who are exposed for a long time to high blood glucose in the womb are at higher risk of developing diabetes in the future. . : People with diabetes have an increased risk of inflammation of the gums (periodontitis) if blood glucose is not properly managed. Periodontitis is a major cause of tooth loss and is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Regular oral check-ups should be established to ensure early diagnosis, particularly among people with previously undiagnosed diabetes and prompt management of any oral complications in people with diabetes. Annual visits are recommended for symptoms of gum disease such as bleeding when brushing teeth or swollen gums. The International Diabetes Federation (IDF) is an umbrella organization of over 230 national diabetes associations in 170 countries and territories. It represents the interests of the growing number of people with diabetes and those at risk. The Federation has been leading the global diabetes community since 1950.

Diabetes is a metabolic disease marked by high blood glucose, also known as blood sugar. There are three types of diabetes: type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes. In all three cases, the pancreas either does not produce enough insulin, a hormone that regulates blood sugar, or the body's cells fail to respond to insulin's signals. Symptoms include frequent thirst and urination, fatigue and blurry vision and numbness in the hands and feet. About 29 million people in the United States, or 9.3 percent of the population, have diabetes, according to a from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Another 86 million adults — more than one in three U.S. adults — , which means their blood sugar levels are higher than normal but not high enough to be considered as type 2 diabetes, according to the CDC. Up to 30 percent of people with prediabetes will develop type 2 diabetes within five years if they don't lose weight or engage in more exercising to manage their blood sugar levels, the CDC says. A quarter of people with diabetes are unaware of their condition, according to the CDC. The reason is that symptoms of diabetes can be so mild that they go unnoticed. Most common symptoms of diabetes, according to the , include urinating often, feeling very thirsty or very hungry, extreme fatigue, blurry vision, unexplained weight loss (in type 1 diabetes), tingling or numbness in the hands or feet (in type 2 diabetes). The first, , was once known as ""juvenile diabetes"" or ""insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus."" Type 1 diabetes is thought to be an autoimmune disorder. The body's immune system attacks the islet cells of the pancreas, which produce the blood-sugar-regulating hormone insulin. As a result, the pancreas stops producing insulin, or does not produce enough for the body's needs. About 5 percent of diabetes cases are Type 1 diabetes, which is usually diagnosed in childhood. [] The second,  is the most common type of diabetes. In type 2 diabetes, the pancreas produces insulin without a problem, but the body's cells fail to respond to the hormone. This failure to respond is called insulin resistance. [] Researchers have yet to pinpoint why some people develop insulin resistance and others don't. Obesity and inactivity are contributing factors. Moreover, a gene passed to from the extinct human Neanderthals might confer  risk, according to research released in 2014. The third type of diabetes is . Like type 2 diabetes, this form of the disease occurs when the body's cells fail to respond to insulin. Gestational diabetes starts during pregnancy. Sometimes it vanishes after pregnancy; other times, the condition becomes chronic. [] Having diabetes can result in damage to the body tissues, including the heart and blood vessels. Two-thirds of people with diabetes will die of heart disease or stroke, according to (ADA). Diabetes can cause eye problems and may lead to blindness. People with diabetes are advised to undergo regular eye checkups, to prevent major eye problems. Diabetes also carries a risk of other health problems ranging from skin problems to more serious problems such as damage to the arteries (peripheral arterial disease), which reduces blood flow to the feet. Another complication of diabetes is nerve damage, or diabetic neuropathy, which makes it hard for people with diabetes to notice injuries, blisters or ulcers, on their feet, that may lead to amputation. Thus, people with diabetes must take proper care of their feet and pay close attention to potential problems. There are several tests for diabetes. One is that A1C blood test, which measures average blood glucose over the past three months. The test measures glucose attached to hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying protein in blood. The red blood cells that carry this protein live about three months, so measuring them at a single time point gives a history of the amount of glucose in the blood. An A1C result of less than 5.7 percent is normal. An A1C between 5.7 percent and 6.4 percent means you are prediabetes. A result of 6.5 percent or greater indicates diabetes, . A second test, the fasting plasma glucose test, requires the patient to fast for eight hours before having a blood glucose test. This test reveals how effectively the body metabolizes glucose. More than 126 milligrams of glucose per deciliter (mg/dl) of blood signals diabetes. Another test, the oral glucose tolerance test, is often used for gestational diabetes screening. This test requires the patient to drink an extra-sugary drink. Two hours later, the person undergoes a blood test. More than 200 mg/dl of glucose in the blood is a red flag for diabetes. People with diabetes need to regularly monitor their blood sugar levels. The treatment for type 1 diabetes is regular insulin injections, sometimes delivered with an insulin pump, a catheter device that automatically dispenses the hormone. The first treatment for type 2 diabetes focuses on increasing physical activity and changing the diet to a healthy one that includes more fruits, vegetables and whole grains, and less refined carbohydrates and sweets, according to the . Some people can lower their blood sugar levels with diet and exercise alone, but others will also need insulin injections or diabetes . Risk factors for type 2 diabetes include both biological factors and lifestyle factors that can be modified. Factors such as age, obesity of being overweight, having a family member who has diabetes, or being African American, American Indian, Asian American, Pacific Islander, or Hispanic American, increase the risk of developing diabetes, according to the CDC. Women who have developed gestational diabetes during pregnancy are also more likely to develop diabetes later in life. Having high blood pressure or abnormal cholesterol and triglyceride levels are other risk factor for diabetes. can lower a person's risk for diabetes, and is especially important for people who have pre-diabetes, according to the CDC. Studies have shown that even moderate weight loss and exercise can prevent or delay type 2 diabetes among people at high risk of developing the condition.

Type 2 diabetes symptoms include excessive thirst and urination, and dehydration. Type 2 diabetes causes and risk factors include older age, obesity, lack of exercise, family history, and excess fat around waistline. Treatments for type 2 diabetes are weight loss, a healthy diet, exercise, and medications if necessary. Anal itching is a common problem experienced by both men and women. Examples of causes of anal itching include irritants such as perfumes, chemicals, or dyes in toilet paper, food irritants, infections, and hemorrhoids. There are risk factors for anal itching such as diseases, profuse sweating, fecal soilage, and more. Anal itching in general can be treated at home with OTC medications if necessary. Obesity means an excess amount of body fat. No general agreement exists on the definition of obesity in children as it does adults. Some define pediatric obesity as body weight at least 20% higher than the healthy weight range for a child or adolescent of that height, or as a body fat percentage above 25% in boys or above 32% in girls. What causes diabetes, what tests diagnose it, and what is a good diabetic diet? Learn the signs of being diabetic, the treatments, and the differences between type 1 vs. type 2 diabetes. Type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent) can be caused by heredity, environmental factors, or ethnicity. Type 2 diabetes (non-insulin dependent) can be caused by high blood pressure, high lipid levels, high-fat diet, high alcohol intake, sedentary lifestyle, obesity, ethnicity, or age. People with diabetes rely on their insulin injections, insulin pumps, and other diabetes equipment and medications to keep them healthy. Transportation Security Agents should be notified of these items during travel. Also, food should be kept available to avoid hypoglycemia, and diabetic people should always stay hydrated. Be prepared to manage your diabetes, and control blood sugar and symptoms when you're sick, when you're at work or school, when traveling, during pregnancy, or during an emergency or natural disaster. Diabetes is one of the leading causes of blindness in the US and worldwide. Diabetic eye disease is a complication from diabetes. Types of diabetic eye disease include blindness, background diabetic retinopathy, nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy, diabetic macular edema, proliferative diabetic retinopathy, cataracts, and glaucoma. Symptoms of diabetic retinopathy includes blurry or hazy vision, difficulty focusing, and night glare from oncoming lights. Causes of diabetic eye disease occur over time due to hypoglycemia (high blood sugar) and other abnormalities in metabolism found in people with diabetes. Treatment for diabetes eye problems depends on the type of eye problem. Medication and surgery for diabetes eye problems may be necessary in addition to lifestyle changes such as eating a healthy diet, exercise, quitting smoking. Read about diabetic foot care. Causes of foot problems in people with diabetes include footwear, nerve damage, poor circulation, trauma, infections, and smoking. Symptoms of foot problems in persons with diabetes include persistent pain, redness of the skin, leg or feet swelling, claudication, hard shiny skin on the legs, localized warmth around the wound, drainage or pus from the would, difficulty walking, fever, red streaking away from the wound, new or lasting numbness in the legs or feet. Any break in the skin can result in serious infection. Treatment depends upon the location and severity of the wound or problem. Amputation of the leg or foot is sometimes necessary. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) occurs when a person with diabetes becomes dehydrated. Causes of diabetic ketoacidosis include infection, missed insulin, or newly diagnosed diabetes. Some signs and symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis include excessive thirst, vomiting, confusion, dry skin or mouth, shortness of breath, and abdominal pain. Diabetic ketoacidosis is a medical emergency and if you think you or someone you know may be suffering from diabetic ketoacidosis call 911 or go to the nearest urgent care facility or emergency department. There are two types of diabetes, type 1 and type 2. There are two types of diabetic reactions; low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) and high blood sugar (hyperglycemia). Symptoms of hypoglycemia include: dizziness; headache; rapid onset of cool, pale, moist, and clammy skin; rapid pulse; and shallow breathing. Treatment is to have the person with diabetes suffering the reaction eat or drink something with sugar such as juice, candy, or another sweet substance. Hyperglycemia is less common and the symptoms can occur over several days. Medical treatment is generally needed. Nutrition and diet is needed for health. Read dietary guidelines, dietary reference intakes, food guide pyramid, calories, carbohydrates, protein, fats, vitamins, minerals, and phytochemicals. A healthy variety of food provides nutrients for health and weight management and weight loss. Hemoglobin A1c (hemoglobin A1c) is a test used at times to monitor blood glucose in people with diabetes. HbA1c is a long-term indicator of blood glucose control. This test also monitors the effects of diet, exercise, and drug therapy on the patient's blood glucose. The normal range for hemoglobin A1c is less than 6%. HbA1c cannot be used to monitor day-to-day blood glucose levels. High blood sugar (hyperglycemia) is when the body's blood sugar rises. Blood sugar levels can be measured using a blood glucose meter. Diabetes mellitus is a common cause of high blood sugar. Symptoms include dry mouth, thirst, frequent urination, and fatigue. Treatment includes diet, exercise, and medications Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) is caused by overmedication, use of certain medications, use of alcohol, missed meals, kidney or liver infection, and more. Common symptoms of hypoglycemia include: trembling, clammy skin, palpitations, anxiety, sweating, hunger, and irritability. Treatment of hypoglycemia in a person with diabetes is glucose (sugar). If the cause is another disease or condition, treatment will depend on the cause of the hypoglycemia. An insulin reaction occurs when an individual with diabetes experiences hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) and becomes confused or unconscious. Causes of insulin reaction include improper medication dosing, exercise, or skipping meals. Common symptoms of a mild insulin reaction include dizziness, irritability, hunger, shakiness, rapid heart beat, and sweating. Treatment is generally sugar drinks, tablets, or wafers and monitoring insulin levels. Insulin resistance is a condition associated with several other conditions as well as a genetic component. Some of the conditions associated with insulin resistance include: the metabolic syndrome, stress, obesity, steroid use, or infection. Treatment of insulin resistance include lifestyle modifications (diet and exercise) and if necessary, medications. Metabolic syndrome refers to combination of metabolic disorders and cardiovascular disease that occur together, including: insulin resistance, high blood pressure, abnormal cholesterol levels, and increased risk of blood clots. Causes include obesity, genetic factors, and smoking. Symptoms depend on factors present, but usually include large waistline. Treatment includes diet and exercise and medication. Neuropathy is a term that refers to malfunctions or diseases of the nerves. Types of neuropathy include diabetic neuropathy, autonomic neuropathy, ulnar neuropathy, optic neuropathy, peripheral neuropathy, alcoholic neuropathy, proximal neuropathy, cranial neuropathy, auditory neuropathy, and focal neuropathy. Causes of neuropathy can be disease, injury, infections, or vitamin deficiencies. Symptoms of neuropathy depend on the nerves involved. Treatment is generally medication and lifestyle changes to prevent further nerve damage. More than two-thirds of Americans are overweight, including at least one in five children. Nearly one-third are obese. Obesity is on the rise in our society because food is abundant and physical activity is optional. The safest way to lose weight is to eat less and exercise more. Treatment may also include medications, surgery, and behavior modification. Peripheral vascular disease (PVD or peripheral artery disease) refers to any disease or disorder of the circulatory system outside of the brain and heart. Common causes of peripheral vascular disease include blood clots, diabetes, inflammation of the arteries, infection, structural defects, and injury. Symptoms of peripheral artery disease include buttock pain, numbness, tingling, or weakness in the legs, burning or aching pain in the feet or toes while resting, a sore on a leg or a foot that will not heal, one or both legs or feet feel cold or change color (pale, bluish, dark reddish), loss of hair on the legs, and impotence. Tests are used to diagnose peripheral vascular disease. Treatment guidelines include medication, lifestyle changes, and if necessary, surgical intervention. SIBO (small intestinal bacterial overgrowth) refers to a condition in which abnormally large numbers of bacteria (at least 100,000 bacteria per ml of fluid) are present in the small intestine, but they are more like the bacteria that are found in the colon. There are many conditions associated with SIBO, including:  Diabetes Scleroderma Crohn's disease Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) It has been theorized that SIBO may be responsible for the symptoms of at least some patients with irritable bowel syndrome. Symptoms of SIBO include: Excess gas Abdominal bloating Abdominal pain Treatment for SIBO can include: Antibiotics Probiotics Low FODMAP Diet Obesity is simply the accumulation of excess body fat. It is much more than that, however. Obesity is a chronic (long-term) disease that is very difficult to treat. It takes 3,500 extra calories to gain 1 pound. To lose weight, you must eat 3,500 calories less than you need, say 500 calories per day for one week, to lose 1 pound. What causes diabetes, what tests diagnose it, and what is a good diabetic diet? Learn the signs of being diabetic, the treatments, and the differences between type 1 vs. type 2 diabetes. Type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent) can be caused by heredity, environmental factors, or ethnicity. Type 2 diabetes (non-insulin dependent) can be caused by high blood pressure, high lipid levels, high-fat diet, high alcohol intake, sedentary lifestyle, obesity, ethnicity, or age.

Mayo Clinic Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences Mayo Clinic School of Continuous Professional Development Type 2 diabetes is a chronic condition that affects the way your body metabolizes sugar (glucose) — an important source of fuel for your body. With type 2 diabetes, your body either resists the effects of insulin — a hormone that regulates the movement of sugar into your cells — or doesn't produce enough insulin to maintain normal glucose levels. Type 2 diabetes used to be known as adult-onset diabetes, but today more children are being diagnosed with the disorder, probably due to the rise in childhood obesity. There's no cure for type 2 diabetes, but losing weight, eating well and exercising can help manage the disease. If diet and exercise aren't enough to manage your blood sugar well, you may also need diabetes medications or insulin therapy. Signs and symptoms of type 2 diabetes often develop slowly. In fact, you can have type 2 diabetes for years and not know it. Look for: Areas of darkened skin, usually in the armpits and neck See your doctor if you notice type 2 diabetes symptoms. Type 2 diabetes develops when the body becomes resistant to insulin or when the pancreas is unable to produce enough insulin. Exactly why this happens is unknown, although genetics and environmental factors, such as being overweight and inactive, seem to be contributing factors. Insulin is a hormone that comes from the gland situated behind and below the stomach (pancreas). The pancreas secretes insulin into the bloodstream. The insulin circulates, enabling sugar to enter your cells. Insulin lowers the amount of sugar in your bloodstream. As your blood sugar level drops, so does the secretion of insulin from your pancreas. Glucose — a sugar — is a main source of energy for the cells that make up muscles and other tissues. Glucose comes from two major sources: food and your liver. Sugar is absorbed into the bloodstream, where it enters cells with the help of insulin. When your glucose levels are low, such as when you haven't eaten in a while, the liver breaks down stored glycogen into glucose to keep your glucose level within a normal range. In type 2 diabetes, this process doesn't work well. Instead of moving into your cells, sugar builds up in your bloodstream. As blood sugar levels increase, the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas release more insulin, but eventually these cells become impaired and can't make enough insulin to meet the body's demands. In the much less common type 1 diabetes, the immune system mistakenly destroys the beta cells, leaving the body with little to no insulin. Factors that may increase your risk of type 2 diabetes include: Being overweight is a main risk factor for type 2 diabetes. However, you don't have to be overweight to develop type 2 diabetes. If you store fat mainly in the abdomen, you have a greater risk of type 2 diabetes than if you store fat elsewhere, such as in your hips and thighs. Your risk of type 2 diabetes rises if you're a man with a waist circumference above 40 inches (101.6 centimeters) or a woman with a waist that's greater than 35 inches (88.9 centimeters). The less active you are, the greater your risk of type 2 diabetes. Physical activity helps you control your weight, uses up glucose as energy and makes your cells more sensitive to insulin. The risk of type 2 diabetes increases if your parent or sibling has type 2 diabetes. Although it's unclear why, certain people — including Black, Hispanic, American Indian and Asian American people — are at higher risk. The risk of type 2 diabetes increases as you get older, especially after age 45. That's probably because people tend to exercise less, lose muscle mass and gain weight as they age. But type 2 diabetes is also increasing dramatically among children, adolescents and younger adults. Prediabetes is a condition in which your blood sugar level is higher than normal, but not high enough to be classified as diabetes. Left untreated, prediabetes often progresses to type 2 diabetes. If you developed gestational diabetes when you were pregnant, your risk of developing type 2 diabetes increases. If you gave birth to a baby weighing more than 9 pounds (4 kilograms), you're also at risk of type 2 diabetes. For women, having polycystic ovarian syndrome — a common condition characterized by irregular menstrual periods, excess hair growth and obesity — increases the risk of diabetes. Areas of darkened skin, usually in the armpits and neck. This condition often indicates insulin resistance. Type 2 diabetes can be easy to ignore, especially in the early stages when you're feeling fine. But diabetes affects many major organs, including your heart, blood vessels, nerves, eyes and kidneys. Controlling your blood sugar levels can help prevent these complications. Although long-term complications of diabetes develop gradually, they can eventually be disabling or even life-threatening. Some of the potential complications of diabetes include: Diabetes dramatically increases the risk of heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure and narrowing of blood vessels (atherosclerosis). Excess sugar can cause tingling, numbness, burning or pain that usually begins at the tips of the toes or fingers and gradually spreads upward. Eventually, you may lose all sense of feeling in the affected limbs. Damage to the nerves that control digestion can cause problems with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation. For men, erectile dysfunction may be an issue. Diabetes can sometimes lead to kidney failure or irreversible end-stage kidney disease, which may require dialysis or a kidney transplant. Diabetes increases the risk of serious eye diseases, such as cataracts and glaucoma, and may damage the blood vessels of the retina, potentially leading to blindness. Left untreated, cuts and blisters can become serious infections, which may heal poorly. Severe damage might require toe, foot or leg amputation. Hearing problems are more common in people with diabetes. Diabetes may leave you more susceptible to skin problems, including bacterial and fungal infections. Obstructive sleep apnea is common in people with type 2 diabetes. Obesity may be the main contributing factor to both conditions. Treating sleep apnea may lower your blood pressure and make you feel more rested, but it's not clear whether it helps improve blood sugar control. Type 2 diabetes seems to increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease, though it's not clear why. The worse your blood sugar control, the greater the risk appears to be. Healthy lifestyle choices can help prevent type 2 diabetes, and that's true even if you have diabetes in your family. If you've already received a diagnosis of diabetes, you can use healthy lifestyle choices to help prevent complications. If you have prediabetes, lifestyle changes can slow or stop the progression to diabetes. Choose foods lower in fat and calories and higher in fiber. Focus on fruits, vegetables and whole grains. Aim for a minimum of 30 to 60 minutes of moderate physical activity — or 15 to 30 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity — on most days. Take a brisk daily walk. Ride a bike. Swim laps. If you can't fit in a long workout, spread your activity throughout the day. If you're overweight, losing 5 to 10 percent of your body weight can reduce the risk of diabetes. To keep your weight in a healthy range, focus on permanent changes to your eating and exercise habits. Motivate yourself by remembering the benefits of losing weight, such as a healthier heart, more energy and improved self-esteem. Sitting still for long periods can increase your risk of type 2 diabetes. Try to get up every 30 minutes and move around for at least a few minutes. Sometimes medication is an option as well. Metformin (Glucophage, Glumetza, others), an oral diabetes medication, may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes.

Mayo Clinic Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences Mayo Clinic School of Continuous Professional Development Type 2 diabetes in children is a chronic disease that affects the way your child's body processes sugar (glucose). Without treatment, the disorder causes sugar to build up in the blood, which can lead to serious long-term consequences. Type 2 diabetes occurs more commonly in adults. In fact, it used to be called adult-onset diabetes. But type 2 diabetes in children is on the rise, fueled by the obesity epidemic. There's plenty you can do to help manage or prevent type 2 diabetes in children. Encourage your child to eat healthy foods, get plenty of physical activity and maintain a healthy weight. If diet and exercise aren't enough to control type 2 diabetes in children, oral medication or insulin treatment may be needed. Book: Mayo Clinic Guide to Raising a Healthy Child Type 2 diabetes in children may develop so gradually that there are no noticeable symptoms. Sometimes, the disorder is diagnosed during a routine check-up. Excess sugar building up in your child's bloodstream pulls fluid from tissues. As a result your child might be thirsty — and drink and urinate more than usual. Lack of sugar in your child's cells might make him or her exhausted. If your child's blood sugar is too high, fluid may be pulled from the lenses of your child's eyes. Your child might be unable to focus clearly. Before type 2 diabetes develops, certain areas of the skin begin to darken. These areas are often found around the neck or in the armpits. Without the energy that sugar supplies, muscle tissues and fat stores simply shrink. However, weight loss is less common in children with type 2 diabetes than in children with type 1 diabetes. See your child's doctor if you notice any of the signs or symptoms of type 2 diabetes. Undiagnosed, the disease can cause serious damage. Diabetes screening is recommended for children who are overweight or obese who have started puberty or are at least 10 years old and have at least one other risk factor for type 2 diabetes. Other risk factors include having a family history of diabetes, being a nonwhite race or having signs of insulin resistance, such as darkened skin patches on the neck or armpits. The exact cause of type 2 diabetes is unknown. But family history and genetics appear to play an important role. Inactivity and excess fat — especially fat around the belly — also seem to be important factors. What is clear is that people with type 2 diabetes can't process glucose properly. As a result, sugar builds up in the bloodstream instead of doing its normal job of fueling the cells that make up muscles and other tissues. Most of the sugar in people's bodies comes from the food they eat. When food is digested, sugar enters the bloodstream. Moving sugar from the bloodstream to the body's cells requires the hormone insulin. Insulin comes from a gland located behind the stomach called the pancreas. The pancreas releases insulin into the blood after a person eats. As insulin circulates, it allows sugar to enter the cells — lowering the amount of sugar in the bloodstream. As the blood sugar level drops, so does the secretion of insulin from the pancreas. Type 2 diabetes develops when the body becomes resistant to insulin or when the pancreas stops making enough insulin. The resulting buildup of sugar in the bloodstream can cause symptoms of high blood sugar. Researchers don't fully understand why some children develop type 2 diabetes and others don't, even if they have similar risk factors. However, it's clear that certain factors increase the risk, including: Being overweight is a strong risk factor for type 2 diabetes in children. The more fatty tissue children have — especially around the abdomen — the more resistant their bodies' cells become to insulin. The less active your child is, the greater his or her risk of type 2 diabetes. Physical activity helps your child control his or her weight, uses glucose as energy, and makes your child's cells more responsive to insulin. Children's risk of type 2 diabetes increases if they have a parent or sibling with the disease. Although it's unclear why, certain people — including Black, Hispanic, American Indian and Asian American people — are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes. Many children develop type 2 diabetes in their early teens. Adolescent girls are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes than are adolescent boys. Low birth weight and being born to a mother who had gestational diabetes during the pregnancy are both associated with a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Babies born prematurely — before 39 to 42 weeks' gestation —have a greater risk of type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes can affect nearly every major organ in your child's body, including the blood vessels, nerves, eyes and kidneys. The long-term complications of type 2 diabetes develop gradually over many years. Eventually, diabetes complications may be disabling or even life-threatening. Keeping your child's blood sugar level close to normal most of the time can dramatically reduce the risk of these complications. Healthy lifestyle choices can help prevent type 2 diabetes in children. If your child already has type 2 diabetes, lifestyle changes can reduce the need for medications and the risk of complications. Encourage your child to: Offer your child foods low in fat and calories. Focus on fruits, vegetables and whole grains. Strive for variety to prevent boredom. Encourage your child to become active. Sign your child up for a sports team or dance lessons, or look for active things to do together. Better yet, make it a family affair. The same lifestyle choices that can help prevent type 2 diabetes in children can do the same for adults. The best diet for a child with diabetes is also the best diet for the whole family.

As a result, sugar builds up in the bloodstream instead of doing its normal job of fueling the cells that make up muscles and other tissues. Most of the sugar in people's bodies comes from the food they eat. When food is digested, sugar enters the bloodstream. Moving sugar from the bloodstream to the body's cells requires the hormone insulin. Insulin comes from a gland located behind the stomach called the pancreas. The pancreas releases insulin into the blood after a person eats. As insulin circulates, it allows sugar to enter the cells — lowering the amount of sugar in the bloodstream. As the blood sugar level drops, so does the secretion of insulin from the pancreas. Type 2 diabetes develops when the body becomes resistant to insulin or when the pancreas stops making enough insulin. The resulting buildup of sugar in the bloodstream can cause symptoms of high blood sugar. Researchers don't fully understand why some children develop type 2 diabetes and others don't, even if they have similar risk factors. However, it's clear that certain factors increase the risk, including: Being overweight is a strong risk factor for type 2 diabetes in children. The more fatty tissue children have — especially around the abdomen — the more resistant their bodies' cells become to insulin. The less active your child is, the greater his or her risk of type 2 diabetes. Physical activity helps your child control his or her weight, uses glucose as energy, and makes your child's cells more responsive to insulin. Children's risk of type 2 diabetes increases if they have a parent or sibling with the disease. Although it's unclear why, certain people — including Black, Hispanic, American Indian and Asian American people — are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes. Many children develop type 2 diabetes in their early teens. Adolescent girls are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes than are adolescent boys. Low birth weight and being born to a mother who had gestational diabetes during the pregnancy are both associated with a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Babies born prematurely — before 39 to 42 weeks' gestation —have a greater risk of type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes can affect nearly every major organ in your child's body, including the blood vessels, nerves, eyes and kidneys. The long-term complications of type 2 diabetes develop gradually over many years. Eventually, diabetes complications may be disabling or even life-threatening. Keeping your child's blood sugar level close to normal most of the time can dramatically reduce the risk of these complications. Healthy lifestyle choices can help prevent type 2 diabetes in children. If your child already has type 2 diabetes, lifestyle changes can reduce the need for medications and the risk of complications. Encourage your child to: Offer your child foods low in fat and calories. Focus on fruits, vegetables and whole grains. Strive for variety to prevent boredom. Encourage your child to become active. Sign your child up for a sports team or dance lessons, or look for active things to do together. Better yet, make it a family affair. The same lifestyle choices that can help prevent type 2 diabetes in children can do the same for adults. The best diet for a child with diabetes is also the best diet for the whole family.

You can go back to this later in your Diabetes UK has so far invested £4.7 million funding specialist research into how the condition affects Asian, Black and minority ethnic peoples according to new data released by the charity. Research is vital as the condition develops and progresses in different ways for people of different ethnicities. For example, people from South Asian communities are two to four times more likely to develop Type 2 diabetes than White Europeans. The funding has so far supported 41 projects across the UK, with over £3.6 million spent in the last decade alone. Diabetes UK Director of Research, Dr Elizabeth Robertson, said: “Some of us are at increased risk of developing Type 2 diabetes, so our research aims to find out why that is and what we can do about it. We’re building on the results of remarkable research that has already been supported by Diabetes UK.” Current research includes a project at King’s College London, looking at how the biology underlying the development of Type 2 diabetes can differ in people from different ethnic groups. In the future, this information could help to tailor therapies that can prevent or treat Type 2 diabetes to those who will benefit most. Dr Louise Goff, the lead investigator on the project at Kings College London, said: “Type 2 diabetes is less closely linked to levels of fat around the waist and high blood cholesterol for Black African people than for White European people. Finding out more about what causes Type 2 diabetes is essential, so we can use the right strategies to prevent the condition from developing.” In 2012, Diabetes UK funded researchers at the University of Leicester to develop a Type 2 diabetes screening questionnaire that could be used in non-English speaking communities that were at a high risk of developing the condition. Naina Patel, the lead researcher on the project, said: “We know that there can be higher rates of undiagnosed Type 2 diabetes and diabetes-related complications among South Asian people. It’s therefore important that the tools used to screen people for Type 2 diabetes are easy to use and understand, to make them more effective at identifying those at risk.” Diabetes UK also provided the initial support for the Southall and Brent Revisited (SABRE) study, which monitored the health of 4,200 Londoners and discovered that half of all British South Asians, Africans and African Caribbean’s will have Type 2 diabetes by the age of eighty, compared to one in five people of European descent. The SABRE study is ongoing, and has helped push the need for Black and South Asian people to be screened for Type 2 diabetes earlier than the general population. Recently Diabetes UK asked people with Type 2 diabetes and healthcare professionals to submit their questions and concerns about Type 2 diabetes research, which will guide the charity’s top ten priorities for funding in the future. Nearly 1 in 4 of the responses are from people of BAME (Black, Asian and minority ethnic background, to ensure future research work reflects the needs of everyone with Type 2 diabetes. Diabetes UK Engaging Communities Manager, Krishna Sarda, said: “While research helps to find solutions for the future, there are steps all of us can take now to reduce the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes, or to manage the condition more effectively if you already have it. Our Community Champions go out to engage with people who have the highest risk of developing Type 2 diabetes, explaining what it is, who is at risk, signs and symptoms, myths and misconceptions, complications and NHS services.” For more information on the research Diabetes UK funds, visit.

When any of these things happens, the body is unable to get sugar from the blood into the cells. That leads to high blood sugar levels. Glucose, the form of sugar found in your blood, is one of your main energy sources. A lack of insulin or resistance to insulin causes sugar to build up in your blood. This can lead to many health problems. is believed to be an autoimmune condition. This means your immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys the beta cells in your that produce insulin. The damage is permanent. What prompts the attacks isn’t clear. There may be both genetic and environmental reasons. Lifestyle factors aren’t thought to play a role. starts as insulin resistance. This means your body can’t use insulin efficiently. That stimulates your pancreas to produce more insulin until it can no longer keep up with demand. Insulin production decreases, which leads to high blood sugar. The exact cause of type 2 diabetes is unknown. Contributing factors may include: There may also be other health factors and environmental reasons. is due to insulin-blocking hormones produced during pregnancy. This type of diabetes only occurs during pregnancy. Type 2 diabetes can cause dark patches in the folds of skin in your armpits and neck. Since type 2 diabetes often takes longer to diagnose, you may feel symptoms at the time of diagnosis, like pain or numbness in your feet. Type 1 diabetes often develops more quickly and can cause symptoms like weight loss or a condition called . Diabetic ketoacidosis can occur when you have very high blood sugars, but little or no insulin in your body. Symptoms of both types of diabetes can appear at any age, but generally type 1 occurs in children and young adults. Type 2 occurs in people over the age of 45. But younger people are increasingly being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes due to sedentary lifestyles and an increase in weight. About people in the United States have diabetes. About percent have type 1 diabetes, while 90 to 95 percent have type 2 diabetes. The latest figures show that were newly diagnosed in 2015. Another 84.1 million are thought to have prediabetes. But most people with don’t know they have the condition. Prediabetes occurs when your blood glucose is higher than it should be, but not high enough to be diabetes. You’re more likely to develop diabetes if you have a family history of the disease. Complications of diabetes generally develop over time. Having poorly controlled blood sugar levels increases the risk of serious complications that can become life-threatening. Chronic complications include: Type 2 diabetes may increase the risk of developing , especially if your blood sugar is not well controlled. High blood sugar levels during pregnancy can harm mother and child, increasing the risk of: No matter what type of diabetes you have, you’ll need to work closely with your doctor to keep it under control. The main goal is to keep blood glucose levels within your target range. Your doctor will let you know what your target range should be. Targets vary with the type of diabetes, age, and presence of complications. If you have gestational diabetes, your blood sugar targets will be lower than people with other types of diabetes. Physical activity is an important part of diabetes management. Ask your doctor how many minutes per week you should devote to aerobic exercise. Diet is also crucial to good control. You’ll also need to monitor your blood pressure and cholesterol. All people with type 1 diabetes must take insulin to live because damage to the pancreas is permanent. There are different types of insulin available with different times of onset, peak, and duration. Insulin is injected just under the skin. Your doctor will show you how to properly inject and rotate injection sites. You can also use an insulin pump, which is a device worn outside your body that can be programmed to release a specific dose. There are now continuous blood glucose monitors as well that check your sugar 24 hours a day. You’ll need to monitor your blood sugar levels throughout the day. If necessary, you may also need to take medication to control cholesterol, high blood pressure, or other complications. Type 2 diabetes is managed with diet and exercise, and can also be treated with a variety of medications to help control blood sugar. The first-line medication is usually metformin (Glumetza, Glucophage, Fortamet, Riomet). This drug helps your body use insulin more effectively. If metformin doesn’t work, your doctor can add other medications or try something different. You’ll need to monitor your blood sugar levels. You may also need medications to help control blood pressure and cholesterol. You can lower your risk of type 2 diabetes if you: avoid smoking, high triglycerides, and low levels If you had gestational diabetes or have prediabetes, these habits can delay or prevent the onset of type 2 diabetes. There’s no cure for type 1 diabetes. It requires lifelong disease management. But with consistent monitoring and adherence to treatment, you may be able to avoid more serious complications of the disease. If you work closely with your doctor and make good lifestyle choices, type 2 diabetes can often be successfully managed. If you have gestational diabetes, chances are it will resolve after your baby is born (though you do have a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes later in life). — — Stress: How It Affects Diabetes and How to Decrease It Medically reviewed by Your stress levels can affect your diabetes.

When glucose builds up in the blood instead of going into cells, it can cause two problems: •     Right away, your cells may be starved for energy. •     Over time, high blood glucose levels may hurt your eyes, kidneys, nerves or heart. Type 2 Diabetes is where your body and pancreas doesn’t properly make or use the insulin. In the beginning your pancreas makes a big amount of insulin, then cant keep up the to the amount of insulin being made, and eventually cant make enough to where your glucose levels are at a proper amount. Type 1 diabetes in inherited from your own ancestry and is unpreventable. Type 2 diabetes is caused by eating unhealthy, and becoming obese. Type 2 diabetes is very preventable by eating a healthy diet and exercising regularly. Diabetes Diabetes, Diabetes Mellitus, is a chronic illness this means that it has no cure and the symptoms persist over a long period of time. This illness is a result of an imbalance of hormones, insulin, produced in the pancreas. Insulin plays an important role in how the body uses food. Insulin enables the cells in the bloodstream to absorb and use glucose for fuel. If the pancreas produces too little or no insulin or if the insulin doesn’t work properly the person may become diabetic. Type Two Diabetes: The Most Common Form of Diabetes Type Two Diabetes is the most common form of Diabetes. Originally it was called Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes (This is because people with Type Two Diabetes can make their own insulin.) Out of the 26 million Americans with diabetes, Type Two Diabetes affects 90% to 95%. Even though people with Type Two Diabetes can produce their own insulin, their pancreas either does not make enough of it or their body cannot use the insulin well enough (insulin resistance). Glycogen or fat gets stored, when insulin stimulates cells in the liver and muscles to remove sugar from the blood. Because the pancreas supplies little or no insulin in this disease, daily injections of the hormone and a controlled diet are necessary to regulate blood sugar levels. Insulin is generally effective in preventing glucose buildup, but it is a treatment and not a cure for diabetes. The onset of Insulin-Dependent Diabetes begins with frequent urination, extreme thirst, constant hunger, and unexplained weight loss. Because people with Type I Diabetes lack sufficient insulin, glucose accumulates in the blood to levels too high for the kidneys to excrete. In an effort to remove the excess sugar, the kidneys excrete Some type 2 diabetics must inject insulin, but most people can control the disease with exercise, weight loss, and oral diabetes medications. People at risk for type 2 diabetes are overweight, do not exercise, and they are over thirty. Type 2 also runs in families. The symptoms of diabetes are frequent urination, extreme thirst, fatigue, weight loss, hunger, and infections t... ... middle of paper ... ... insulin. This makes the body more sensitive to the insulin that already exists. This hormone is responsible for maintaining an optimal glucose level in the blood. It allows the body cells to use glucose as a main energy source. Due to abnormal insulin metabolism, in a diabetic person, the body cells and tissues cannot make use of glucose from the blood, resulting in elevated blood glucose level or hyperglycemia. Over time, elevated blood glucose level in the bloodstream can lead to severe complications, such as disorders of the eyes, cardiovascular diseases, kidney damage and nerve destruction. In Type 1 diabetes, the pancreas is not able to produce sufficient amount of insulin as required for the body. Even then, one’s death is often attributed to other things such as heart disease, stroke, or kidney failure. Type 2 diabetes is a serious disease that causes the body to become insulin resistant, hindering the body’s ability to process sugar, and it can be largely attributed to lifestyle choices and genetic factors. Diabetes is the sixth leading cause of death, but this statistic is skewed in that the primary cause of death in individuals with diabetes is not from diabetes itself but rather from the complications of the disease. Type 2 diabetes differs from type 1 diabetes in that one’s body continues to produce insulin, but one’s body either uses insulin ineffectively or one’s cells do not respond correctly to insulin. This insulin resistance prevents glucose from entering the body’s cells, and this causes glucose to build up in the blood stream. Improper production and resistance to insulin will lead to the cause of Type 1 diabetes, Type 2 diabetes, or Gestational diabetes. Type 1 diabetes is also known as insulin-dependent diabetes. This means that the body does not produce any insulin because the beta cells that produce insulin are destroyed. Patients with Type 1 diabetes will need insulin injection in order for the body to break down food and store energy. Insulin can be only be use as an injection because if it is taken as a pill, it will get digested instead of aiding the breakdown of the glucose. What is diabetes? Diabetes is a condition where people are unable to control the level of glucose- a type of sugar in their blood because their pancreas does not work properly. Diabetes result from a combination of heredity and environmental factors, such as what and how much a person eats and how much exercise they do. Some people are more at risk of developing diabetes than others these are some of the factors that might affect a person’s likelihood of developing diabetes; family history, age, ethnicity, weight, waist measurement, blood pressure and previous medical conditions. Some people may have only one of these factors, others may have many. Type Two Diabetes: The Most Common Form of Diabetes Copyright © 2000-2020. 123Helpme.com.

Type 2 diabetes happens when your body can't use insulin the right way. Over time, the can't make enough insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps the body's cells use sugar (glucose) for energy. It also helps the body store extra sugar in muscle, fat, and liver cells. Without insulin, this sugar can't get into your cells to do its work. It stays in your blood instead. Your blood sugar level then gets too high. High blood sugar can harm , such as the eyes, heart, blood vessels, nerves, and kidneys. It can also increase your risk for other health problems (complications). Type 2 diabetes is different from type 1 diabetes. In type 1 diabetes, the body's immune system destroys the cells that release insulin, so that over time the body can't produce insulin at all. In type 2 diabetes, the body still makes some insulin, but it can't use it the right way. Your body doesn't respond as it should to insulin. This makes it hard for your cells to get sugar from the blood for energy. This is called . If you are overweight, get little or no exercise, or have type 2 diabetes in your family, you are more likely to have problems with the way insulin works in your body. Type 2 diabetes can be prevented or delayed with a healthy lifestyle, including staying at a healthy weight, making healthy food choices, and getting regular exercise. Some people don't have symptoms, especially when diabetes is diagnosed early. This is because the blood sugar level may rise so slowly that a person may not know that anything is wrong.

If you're taking diabetes medicine, you can also have problems with . These symptoms include: If your doctor thinks that you have type 2 diabetes, he or she will ask you questions about your medical history, do a physical exam, and order a blood test that measures the amount of sugar in your blood. The key to treating type 2 diabetes is to keep blood sugar levels controlled and in your target range. Making healthy food choices. Try to manage the amount of carbohydrates you eat by spreading them out over the day. See your doctor. Regular checkups are important to monitor your health. Test your blood sugar levels. You have a better chance of keeping your blood sugar in your target range if you know what your levels are from day to day. Keep high blood pressure and high cholesterol under control.

53be14f2-4ee7-4b1c-abe7-bd5ea43db261,"— New research suggests that the treatment for type 2 diabetes could be tailored to specific subgroups — but the findings may not be usable in the real world. Today there are four common types of diabetes: type 1 and type 2, latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA), and gestational. And these classifications are plagued by an enormous amount of confusion, misconceptions, and even misdiagnosis between the types. To complicate things further, a published in The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology is suggesting people with type 2 diabetes should be categorized into an additional four subgroups. “This is the first step towards personalized treatment of diabetes,” said Leif Groop, a doctor and professor in the diabetes and endocrinology department at Lund University of Sweden. The new classification system for diabetes consists of five total subgroups. The first group is solely dedicated to autoimmune types of diabetes: type 1 and LADA. The remaining four groups, however, pertain to all type 2 patients and categorizes them based on the severity of their insulin resistance, average blood sugar levels (A1c), whether they’re obese — and if so, their relative age, and whether their diabetes is due to old age. Group 1, severe autoimmune diabetes (SAID): type 1 diabetes and LADA, about 10 percent of those diagnosed Group 2, severe insulin-deficient diabetes (SIDD): higher A1c results, moderate insulin resistance, impaired insulin secretion, and the highest risk of retinopathy (eye disease) Group 3, severe insulin-resistant diabetes (SIRD): obese adults with severe insulin resistance, varying A1c levels, and the highest incidence of kidney disease Group 4, mild obesity-related diabetes (MOD): obese children and teens with varying HbA1c levels Group 5, mild age-related diabetes (MARD): the elderly, approximately 40 percent of those diagnosed By looking beyond blood sugar levels, it’s suggested that this new approach could help those with diabetes receive the right treatment plan sooner. Many are forced to work through a variety of options until an effective treatment is found. For instance, some may be first prescribed oral diabetes medications like metformin (the in the United States in 2014), when their degree of insulin resistance can only be aided by insulin injections. The delay in finding the right treatment plan can be months to years depending on the relationship and communication between doctor and patient, and how quickly the lack of efficacy is noted in their current treatment plan. These delays place patients at an increased risk of complications from elevated blood sugar, including damage to eyesight, kidney function, blood vessels, peripheral nerves, as well as fingers and toes. “Current diagnostics and classification of diabetes are insufficient and unable to predict future complications or choice of treatment,” explained Groop. Using approximately 13,000 newly diagnosed diabetes patients in their study, the researchers grouped participants based on the various factors. They found that the most insulin-resistant participants in Group 3 would benefit the most from this pinpointed and focused diagnostic system. These patients, said Groop, are most often incorrectly treated. The study was repeated three more times in Finland and Sweden, with consistent results in accurately grouping and pinpointing the most effective treatment options, as well as predicting which groups were at the highest risk for different complications. The researchers intend to continue the same study in China and India. One remaining question is how doctors can easily assess which group a patient ought to be in. While some of the categories appear to be self-evident (the elderly, teens, and type 1 or LADA patients), determining whether a patient is severely or moderately insulin resistant isn’t something a doctor can easily do until various treatment protocols have failed. And consequently, the doctor needs just as much time to find the right treatment plan for their patient after all. Gretchen Becker — a medical journalist, author of “,” and someone who’s lived with type 2 diabetes for over 20 years — told Healthline that the actual diagnostic process for this suggested protocol is far from usable for doctors. “Only a statistician could [use this],” explained Becker after reviewing the actual study data herself. “SPSS is a statistical software. And it’s not clear if patients fell into distinct groups or if there were arbitrary cutoffs.” For these new subgroups to be useful for the general healthcare system, this diagnostic tool still needs to become readily available and easy to use across the globe. At the very least, Dr. Steve Parker, author of the book “” and blog , told Healthline, “it will remind physicians that not all type 1s and type 2s are alike. For instance, some need more attention to insulin resistance, others need insulin therapy started sooner than others.” “The proposed classification system depends on measurement of insulin resistance and pancreas beta cell function,” added Dr. Parker. “A large majority of people with diabetes in the U.S. are not even being tested for these now. The reason is that while the tests are reasonably accurate for testing large groups of people, they are less accurate when testing an individual patient.” The reports that today’s global diabetes population is 425 million people — and rising — which means the burden on healthcare systems to better care for its diabetes population is also increasing dramatically. The IDF estimates that number will increase by another 200 million in the next 20 years. Ginger Vieira is an expert patient living with type 1 diabetes, celiac disease, and fibromyalgia.

Medline, PreMedline, Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched. Included studies were citation tracked in Google Scholar to identify follow-on studies of usability or impact. Data were extracted on statistical properties of models, details of internal or external validation, and use of risk scores beyond the studies that developed them. Quantitative data were tabulated to compare model components and statistical properties. Qualitative data were analysed thematically to identify mechanisms by which use of the risk model or score might improve patient outcomes. 8864 titles were scanned, 115 full text papers considered, and 43 papers included in the final sample. These described the prospective development or validation, or both, of 145 risk prediction models and scores, 94 of which were studied in detail here. They had been tested on 6.88 million participants followed for up to 28 years. Heterogeneity of primary studies precluded meta-analysis. Some but not all risk models or scores had robust statistical properties (for example, good discrimination and calibration) and had been externally validated on a different population. Genetic markers added nothing to models over clinical and sociodemographic factors. Most authors described their score as “simple” or “easily implemented,” although few were specific about the intended users and under what circumstances. Ten mechanisms were identified by which measuring diabetes risk might improve outcomes. Follow-on studies that applied a risk score as part of an intervention aimed at reducing actual risk in people were sparse. Much work has been done to develop diabetes risk models and scores, but most are rarely used because they require tests not routinely available or they were developed without a specific user or clear use in mind. Encouragingly, recent research has begun to tackle usability and the impact of diabetes risk scores. Two promising areas for further research are interventions that prompt lay people to check their own diabetes risk and use of risk scores on population datasets to identify high risk “hotspots” for targeted public health interventions. The prevalence of diabetes is rising rapidly throughout the world. By 2010 its prevalence in the adult populations of the United Kingdom, the United States, mainland China, and the United Arab Emirates had exceeded 7%, 11%, 15%, and 17%, respectively. Americans born in 2000 or later have a lifetime risk of more than one in three of developing diabetes. Type 2 diabetes (which accounts for over 95% of diabetes worldwide) results from a complex gene-environment interaction for which several risk factors, such as age, sex, ethnicity, family history, obesity, and hypertension, are well documented. The precise interaction of these and other risk factors with one another is, however, a complex process that varies both within and across populations. Epidemiologists and statisticians are striving to produce weighted models that can be presented as scores to reflect this complexity but which at the same time are perceived as sufficiently simple, plausible, affordable, and widely implementable in clinical practice. Cohort studies have shown that early detection of established diabetes improves outcome, although the evidence base for screening the entire population is weak. The proportion of cases of incident type 2 diabetes in people with impaired glucose tolerance or impaired fasting glucose levels was reduced in landmark trials from China, Finland, and the United States by up to 33%, 50%, and 58%, respectively, through lifestyle changes (increased exercise, weight loss) or pharmacotherapy, or both, although changes may be more modest in a non-trial population. Some have argued that because combining known risk factors predicts incident diabetes at least as effectively as impaired glucose metabolism, a diabetes risk score may be a better and more practical means of identifying people for preventive interventions than either a glucose tolerance test or a fasting blood glucose level. Others favour targeting the assessment of diabetes risk in those with established impaired glucose metabolism on the basis that interventions in this group are particularly effective. Risk models and scores first emerged for cardiovascular disease, and these are widely used in clinical and public health practice. In the United Kingdom, for example, all electronic patient record systems in general practice offer the facility to calculate the Framingham score, a patient’s risk of a cardiovascular event within 10 years. This risk score features in many guidelines and decision pathways (such as the cut-off for statin therapy), and general practitioners receive financial rewards for calculating it. In contrast, although numerous models and scores have been developed for diabetes risk, we found limited evidence for use of these as part of a formal health policy, guideline, or incentive scheme for practitioners in any country (one Australian scheme incentivises general practitioners’ measurement of the risk of diabetes in adults aged 40-49). This is perhaps surprising, given that morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease has been decreasing in many countries since the 1970s, whereas those from diabetes continue to increase. A diabetes risk score is an example of a prognostic model. Such scores should ideally be developed by taking a large, age defined population cohort of people without diabetes, measuring baseline risk factors, and following the cohort for a sufficiently long time to see who develops diabetes. Although prospective longitudinal designs in specially assembled cohorts are expensive, difficult, and time consuming to execute, cross sectional designs in which risk factors are measured in a population including people both with and without diabetes are methodologically inferior. They use prevalence as a proxy for incidence and conflate characteristics of people with diabetes with risk factors in those without diabetes, and thus are incapable of showing that a putative risk factor predated the development of diabetes. In practice, researchers tend to take one of two approaches: they either study a cohort of people without diabetes, which was assembled some years previously with relevant baseline metrics for some other purpose (for example, the British Regional Heart Study), or they analyse routinely available data, such as electronic patient records. Both approaches are potentially susceptible to bias. Some diabetes risk scores are intended to be self administered using questions such as “have you ever been told you have high blood pressure?” Scores that rely entirely on such questions may be hosted on the internet (see for example ). Some researchers have used self completion postal questionnaires as the first part of a stepwise detection programme. To the extent that these instruments are valid, they can identify two types of people: those who already have diabetes whether or not they know it (hence the questionnaire may serve as a self administered screening tool for undiagnosed diabetes) and those at high risk of developing diabetes—that is, it may also serve as a prediction tool for future diabetes. Prevalence rates for diabetes derived from self assessment studies thus cannot be compared directly with the rate of incident diabetes in a prospective longitudinal sample from which those testing positive for diabetes at baseline have been excluded. A good risk score is usually defined as one that accurately estimates individuals’ risk—that is, predictions based on the score closely match what is observed (calibration); the score distinguishes reliably between high risk people, who are likely to go on to develop the condition, and low risk people, who are less likely to develop the condition (discrimination); and it performs well in new populations (generalisability). Validating a risk model or score means testing its calibration and discrimination either internally (by splitting the original sample, developing the score on one part and testing it on another), temporally (re-running the score on the same or a similar sample after a time period), or, preferably, externally (running the score on a new population with similar but not identical characteristics from the one on which it was developed). Caution is needed when extrapolating a risk model or score developed in one population or setting to a different one—for example, secondary to primary care, adults to children, or one ethnic group to another. Risk scores and other prognostic models should be subject to “impact studies”—that is, studies of the extent to which the score is actually used and leads to improved outcomes. Although most authors emphasise quantitative evaluation of impact such as through cluster randomised controlled trials, much might also be learnt from qualitative studies of the process of using the score, either alone or as an adjunct to experimental trials. One such methodology is realist evaluation, which considers the interplay between context, mechanism (how the intervention is perceived and taken up by practitioners), and outcome. In practice, however, neither quantitative nor qualitative studies of impact are common in the assessment of risk scores. We sought to identify, classify, and evaluate risk models and scores for diabetes and inform their selection and implementation in practice. We wanted to determine the key statistical properties of published scores for predicting type 2 diabetes in adults and how they perform in practice. Hence we were particularly interested in highlighting those characteristics of a risk score that would make it fit for purpose in different situations and settings. To that end we reviewed the literature on development, validation, and use of such scores, using both quantitative data on demographics of populations and statistical properties of models and qualitative data on how risk scores were perceived and used by practitioners, policy makers, and others in a range of contexts and systems. We followed standard methodology for systematic reviews, summarised in guidance from a previous study and the York Centre for Reviews and Dissemination. The process was later extended by drawing on the principles of realist review, an established form of systematic literature review that uses mainly qualitative methods to produce insights into the interaction between context, mechanism, and outcome, hence explaining instances of both success and failure. Our team is leading an international collaborative study, the Realist and Meta-narrative Evidence Synthesis: Evolving Standards (RAMESES) to develop methodological guidance and publication standards for realist review. We identified all peer reviewed cohort studies in adults over age 18 that had derived or validated, or both, a statistically weighted risk model for type 2 diabetes in a population not preselected for known risk factors or disease, and which could be applied to another population. Studies were included that had developed a new risk model based on risk factors and that used regression techniques to weight risk factors appropriately, or validated an existing model on a new population, or did both. Exclusion criteria were cross sectional designs, studies that had not finished recruiting, studies on populations preselected for risk factors or disease, studies that did not link multiple risk factors to form a scoring system or weighted model, screening or early detection studies, genetic studies, case series, studies on under 18s, animal studies, and studies that applied a known risk model or score to a population but did not evaluate its statistical potential. In January 2011 we undertook a scoping search, beginning with sources known to the research team and those recommended by colleagues. We used the 29 papers from this search to develop the definitive protocol, including search terms and inclusion and exclusion criteria. In February 2011 a specialist librarian designed a search strategy (see web extra) with assistance from the research team. Key words were predict, screen, risk, score, [type two] diabetes, model, regression, risk assessment, risk factor, calculator, analysis, sensitivity and specificity, ROC and odds ratio. Both MESH terms and text words were used. Titles and abstracts were searched in Medline, PreMedline, Embase, and relevant databases in the Cochrane Library from inception to February 2011, with no language restrictions. Search results from the different databases were combined in an endnote file and duplicates removed electronically and manually. In February and March 2011 two researchers independently scanned titles and abstracts and flagged potentially relevant papers for full text analysis. Two researchers independently read the interim dataset of full text papers and reduced this to a final dataset of studies, resolving disagreements by discussion. Bilingual academic colleagues translated non-English papers and extracted data in collaboration with one of the research team. To identify recently published papers two researchers independently citation tracked the final dataset of studies in Google Scholar. Reference lists of the final dataset and other key references were also scanned. Properties of included studies were tabulated on an Excel spreadsheet. A second researcher independently double checked the extraction of primary data from every study. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion. Where studies trialled multiple models with minimal difference in the number of risk factors, a judgment was made to extract data from the authors’ preferred models or (if no preferences were stated in the paper) the ones judged by two researchers to be the most complete in presentation of data or statistical robustness. Data extraction covered characteristics of the population (age, sex, ethnicity, etc), size and duration of study, completeness of follow-up, method of diagnosing diabetes, details of internal or external validation, or both, and the components and metrics used by authors of these studies to express the properties of the score, especially their calibration and discrimination—for example, observed to predicted ratios, sensitivity and specificity, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. We aimed to use statistical meta-analysis where appropriate and presented heterogeneous data in disaggregated form. For the realist component of the review we extracted data and entered these on a spreadsheet under seven headings (box 1). Authors’ assumptions (if any) about who would use the risk score, on which subgroups or populations Authors’ assumptions (if any) on what would be offered to people who score above the designated cut-off for high risk Authors’ hypothesised (or implied) mechanism by which use of the score might improve outcomes for patients Authors’ adjectives to describe their risk model or score Authors’ claims for how and in what circumstances their model or score outperforms previous ones Authors’ stated concerns about their model or score Actual data in this paper or papers citing it on use of the score in the real world One researcher extracted these data from our final sample of papers and another checked a one third sample of these. Our research team discussed context-mechanism-outcome interactions hypothesised or implied by authors and reread the full sample of papers with all emerging mechanisms in mind to explore these further. We assessed the impact of each risk score in our final sample using three criteria: any description in the paper of use of the score beyond the population for whom it was developed and validated; number of citations of the paper in Google Scholar and number of these that described use of the score in an impact study; and critical appraisal of any impact studies identified on this citation track. In this phase we were guided by the question: what is the evidence that this risk score has been used in an intervention which improved (or sought to improve) outcomes for individuals at high risk of diabetes? Given the large number of papers, statistical models, and risk scores in our final sample, we decided for clarity to highlight a small number of scores that might be useful to practising clinicians, public health specialists, or lay people. Adapting previous quality criteria for risk scores, we favoured those that had external validation by a separate research team on a different population (generalisability), statistically significant calibration, a discrimination greater than 0.70, and 10 or fewer components (usability). Figure 1 shows the flow of studies through the review. One hundred and fifteen papers were analysed in detail to produce a final sample of 43. Of these 43 papers, 18 described the development of one or more risk models or scores, 17 described external validation of one or more models or scores on new populations, and eight did both. In all, the 43 papers described 145 risk models and scores, of which 94 were selected for extraction of full data (the other 51 were minimally different, were not the authors’ preferred model, or lacked detail or statistical robustness). Of the final sample of 94 risk models, 55 were derivations of risk models on a base population and 39 were external validations (of 14 different models) on new populations. Studies were published between 1993 and 2011, but most appeared in 2008-11 (fig 2). Indeed, even given that weaker cross sectional designs had been excluded, the findings suggest that new risk models and scores for diabetes are currently being published at a rate of about one every three weeks.  Publication of diabetes risk models and scores 1990-2010. Eleven new risk models and scores had been published in the first five months of 2011 Table 1 gives full details of the studies in the sample, including the origin of the study, setting, population, methodological approach, duration, and how diabetes was diagnosed. The studies were highly heterogeneous. Models were developed and validated in 17 countries representing six continents (30 in Europe, 25 in North America, 21 in Asia, 8 in Australasia, 8 in the Middle East, 1 in South America, and 1 in Africa).  Summary of 43 papers from which 94 diabetes risk models or scores were identified for systematic review Comparisons across studies were problematic owing to heterogeneity of data and highly variable methodology, presentation techniques, and missing data. Cohorts ranged in size from 399 to 2.54 million. The same data and participants were often included in several different models in the same paper. Ten research populations were used more than once in different papers. In total, risk models were tested on 6.88 million participants, although this figure includes duplicate tests on the same dataset. Participants aged 18 to 98 were studied for periods ranging from 3.15 to 28 years. Completeness of follow-up ranged from 54% to 99% and incidence of diabetes across the time periods studied ranged from 1.3% to 20.9%. None of the models in the sample was developed on a cohort recruited prospectively for the express purpose of devising it. Rather, all authors used the more pragmatic approach of retrospectively studying a research dataset that had been assembled some years previously for a different purpose. Forty two studies excluded known diabetes in the inception cohort. Diagnosis of diabetes in a cohort at inception and completion of the study was done in different ways, including self report, patient questionnaires, clinician diagnosis, electronic code, codes from the , disease or drug registers, diabetes drugs, dietary treatment, fasting plasma glucose levels, oral glucose tolerance test, and measurement of haemoglobin A. In some studies the method was not stated. Half the studies used different diagnostic tests at inception and completion of the study. One third of the papers focused almost exclusively on the statistical properties of the models. Many of the remainder had a clinician (diabetologist or general practitioner) as coauthor and included an (often short and speculative) discussion on how the findings might be applied in clinical practice. Three described their score as a “clinical prediction rule.” Table 2 gives details of the components of the 94 risk models included in the final sample and their statistical properties—including (where reported) their discrimination, calibration, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Many papers offered additional sophisticated statistical analysis, although there was no consistency in the approach used or statistical tests. Heterogeneity of data (especially demographic and ethnic diversity of validation cohorts and different score components) in the primary studies precluded formal meta-analysis.  Key characteristics of 94 diabetes risk models or scores included in systematic review All 94 models presented a combination of risk factors as significant in the final model, and different models weighted different components differently. The number of components in a single risk score varied from 3 to 14 (n=84, mean 7.8, SD 2.6). The seven risk scores that were classified as having high potential for use in practice offered broadly similar components and had similar discriminatory properties (area under receiver operating characteristic curve 0.74-0.85, table 4). Overall, the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve ranged from 0.60 to 0.91. Certain components used in some models (for example, biomarkers) are rarely available in some pathology laboratories and potentially too expensive for routine use. Some models that exhibited good calibration and discrimination on the internal validation cohort performed much less well when tested on an external cohort, suggesting that the initial model may have been over-fitted by inclusion of too many variables that had only minor contributions to the total risk. Although this study did not seek out genetic components, those studies that had included genetic markers alongside sociodemographic and clinical data all found that the genetic markers added little or nothing to the overall model. Reporting of statistical data in some studies was incomplete—for example, only 40 of the 94 models quantified any form of calibration statistic. Forty three presented sensitivity and specificity, 27 justified the rationale for cut-off points, 22 presented a positive predictive value, 19 presented a negative predictive value, and 26 made some attempt to indicate the percentage of the population that would need clinical follow-up or testing if they scored as “high risk.” Some models performed poorly—for example, there was a substantial gap between expected and observed numbers of participants who developed diabetes over the follow-up period. The false positive and false negative rates in many risk scores raised questions about their utility in clinical practice (for example, positive predictive values ranged from 5% to 42%, negative predictive values from 88% to 99%). However, some scores were designed as non-invasive preliminary instruments, with a recommended second phase involving a blood test. Risk models and scores tended to “morph” when they were externally validated because research teams dropped components from the original (for example, if data on these were not available), added additional components (for example, to compensate for missing categories), or modified what counted in a particular category (for example, changing how ethnicity was classified); in some cases these modifications were not clarified. A key dimension of implementation is appropriate adaptation to a new context. It was considered that this did not negate the external validation. Table 3 provides the qualitative findings from the risk scores. Of the 43 papers in the full sample, three did not recommend use of the model tested because the authors believed it had no advantage over existing ones. Authors of the other 40 papers considered that at least one of their scores should be adopted and used, and to justify this made various claims. The commonest adjective used by authors to describe their score was “simple” (26 of 43); others mentioned “low cost,” “easily implemented,” “feasible,” and “convenient.”  Summary of authors’ assumptions and claims about their diabetes risk models or scores Sixteen of the 43 studies that recommended use of a particular risk model or score did not designate an intended user for it. Some authors assigned agency to a risk score—that is, they stated, perhaps inadvertently, that the score itself had the potential to prevent diabetes, change behaviour, or reduce health inequalities. Although most authors did state an intended target group, this was usually given in vague terms, such as “the general population” or “individuals who are likely to develop diabetes.” Eleven of the 43 papers gave a clear statement of what intervention might be offered, by whom, to people who scored above the cut-off for high risk; the other papers made no comment on this or used vague terms such as “preventive measures,” without specifying by whom these would be delivered. In all, authors of the papers in the full sample either explicitly identified or appeared to presume 10 mechanisms (box 2) by which, singly or in combination, use of the diabetes risk score might lead to improved patient outcomes (see table 3). Box 2: 10 suggested mechanisms by which diabetes risk scores could help improve patient outcomes —clinicians will pick up high risk patients during consultations and offer advice that leads to change in patients’ behaviour and lifestyle —routine use of the score increases clinicians’ awareness of risk for diabetes and motivation to manage it —people are alerted by assessing their own risk (for example, using an online tool), directly leading to change in lifestyle —people, having assessed their own risk, are prompted to consult a clinician to seek further tests or advice on prevention —a risk model programmed into the electronic patient record generates a point of care prompt in the clinical encounter —a risk model programmed into the electronic patient record generates aggregated data on risk groups, which will inform a public health intervention Planners and commissioners use patterns of risk to direct resources into preventive healthcare for certain subgroups An administrator or healthcare assistant collects data on risk and enters these onto the patients’ records, which subsequently triggers the technological, clinical, or public health mechanisms Use of the risk score leads to improved understanding of risk for diabetes or its management by academics, leading indirectly to changes in clinical practice and hence to benefits for patients Use of the risk score identifies focused subpopulations for further research (with the possibility of benefit to patients in later years) Risk models and scores had been developed in a range of health systems. Differences in components could be explained partly in terms of their intended context of use. For example, the QDScore, intended for use by general practitioners, was developed using a database of electronic records of a nationally representative sample of the UK general practice population comprising 2.5 million people. The QDScore is composed entirely of data items that are routinely recorded on general practice electronic records (including self assigned ethnicity, a deprivation score derived from the patient’s postcode, and clinical and laboratory values). Another score, also intended to be derived from electronic records but in a US health maintenance organisation (covering people of working age who are in work), has similar components to the QDScore except that ethnicity and socioeconomic deprivation are not included. In contrast, the FINDRISC score was developed as a population screening tool intended for use directly by lay people; it consists of questions on sociodemographic factors and personal history along with waist circumference but does not include clinical or laboratory data; high scorers are prompted to seek further advice from a clinician. Such a score makes sense in many parts of Finland and also in the Netherlands where health and information literacy rates are high, but would be less fit for purpose in a setting where these were low. Table 4 summarises the properties of seven validated diabetes risk scores which we judged to be the most promising for use in clinical or public health practice. The judgments on which this selection was based were pragmatic; other scores not listed in table 4 (also see tables 1 and 2) will prove more fit for purpose in certain situations and settings. One score that has not yet been externally validated was included in table 4 because it is the only score already being incentivised in a national diabetes prevention policy.  Components of seven diabetes risk models or scores with potential for adaptation for use in routine clinical practice Studies of impact of risk scores on patient outcomes None of the 43 papers that validated one or more risk scores described the actual use of that score in an intervention phase. Furthermore, although these papers had been cited by a total of 1883 (range 0-343, median 12) subsequent papers, only nine of those 1883 papers (table 5) described application and use of the risk score as part of an impact study aimed at changing patient outcomes. These covered seven studies, of which (to date) three have reported definitive results. All three reported positive changes in individual risk factors, but surprisingly none recalculated participants’ risk scores after the intervention period to see if they had changed. While one report on the ongoing FIN-D2D study suggests that incident diabetes has been reduced in “real world” (non-trial) participants who were picked up using a diabetes risk score and offered a package of preventive care, this is a preliminary and indirect finding based on drug reimbursement claims, and no actual data are given in the paper. With that exception, no published impact study on a diabetes risk score has yet shown a reduction in incident diabetes.  Results of impact citation search (studies using diabetes risk models or scores as part of an intervention to improve outcomes) Numerous diabetes risk scores now exist based on readily available data and provide a good but not perfect estimate of the chance of an adult developing diabetes in the medium term future. A few research teams have undertaken exemplary development and validation of a robust model, reported its statistical properties thoroughly, and followed through with studies of impact in the real world. We excluded less robust designs (especially cross sectional studies). Nevertheless, included studies were not entirely free from bias and confounding. This is because the “pragmatic” use of a previously assembled database or cohort brings an inherent selection bias (for example, the British Regional Heart Study cohort was selected to meet the inclusion criteria for age and comorbidity defined by its original research team and oriented to research questions around cardiovascular disease; the population for the QDScore is drawn from general practice records and hence excludes those not registered with a general practitioner). Most papers in our sample had one or more additional limitations. They reported models or scores that required collection of data not routinely available in the relevant health system; omitted key statistical properties such as calibration and positive and negative predictive values that would allow a clinician or public health commissioner to judge the practical value of the score; or omitted to consider who would use the score, on whom, and in what circumstances. We identified a mismatch between the common assumption of authors who develop a risk model (that their “simple” model can now be taken up and used) and the actual uptake and use of such models (which seems to happen very rarely). However, there has recently been an encouraging—if limited—shift in emphasis from the exclusive pursuit of statistical elegance (for example, maximising area under the receiver operating curve) to undertaking applied research on the practicalities and outcomes of using diabetes risk scores in real world prevention programmes. The strengths of this review are our use of mixed methodology, orientation to patient relevant outcomes, extraction and double checking of data by five researchers, and inclusion of a citation track to identify recently published studies and studies of impact. We applied both standard systematic review methods (to undertake a systematic and comprehensive search, translate all non-English texts, and extract and analyse quantitative data) and realist methods (to consider the relation between the components of the risk score, the context in which it was intended to be used, and the mechanism by which it might improve outcomes for patients). The main limitation of this review is that data techniques and presentation in the primary studies varied so much that it was problematic to determine reasonable numerators and denominators for many of the calculations. This required us to make pragmatic decisions to collate and present data as fairly and robustly as possible while also seeking to make sense of the vast array of available risk scores to the general medical reader. We recognise that the final judgment on which risk scores are, in reality, easy to use will lie with the end user in any particular setting. Secondly, authors of some of the primary studies included in this review were developing a local tool for local use and made few or no claims that their score should be generalised elsewhere. Yet, the pioneers of early well known risk scores have occasionally found their score being applied to other populations (perhaps ethnically and demographically different from the original validation cohort), their selection of risk factors being altered to fit the available categories in other datasets, and their models being recalibrated to provide better goodness of fit. All this revision and recalibration to produce “new” scores makes the systematic review of such scores at best an inexact science. We have deliberately not selected a single, preferred diabetes risk score. There is no universal ideal risk score, as the utility of any score depends not merely on its statistical properties but also on its context of use, which will also determine which types of data are available to be included. Even when a risk model has excellent discrimination (and especially when it does not) the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity plays out differently depending on context. Box 3 provides some questions to ask when selecting a diabetes risk score. Box 3: Questions to ask when selecting a diabetes risk score, and examples of intended use In clinical consultations, score should be based on data on the medical record For self assessment by lay people, score should be based on things a layperson would know or be able to measure In prevention planning, score should be based on public health data If intended for use in high ethnic and social diversity, a score that includes these variables may be more discriminatory If for opportunistic use in clinical encounters, the score must align with the structure and timeframe of such encounters and competencies of the clinician, and (ideally) be linked to an appropriate point of care prompt. Work expected from the intended user of the score may need to be incentivised or remunerated, or both If to be completed by laypeople, the score must reflect the functional health literacy of the target population What are the consequences of false positive and false negative classifications? In self completion scores, low sensitivity may falsely reassure large numbers of people at risk and deter them from seeking further advice What is the completeness and accuracy of the data from which the score will be derived? A score based on automated analysis of electronic patient records may include multiple components but must be composed entirely of data that are routinely and reliably entered on the record in coded form, and readily searchable (thus, such scores are only likely to be useful in areas where data quality in general practice records is high) If the budget for implementing the score and analysing data is fixed, the cost of use must fall within this budget Given the above, what would be the ideal statistical and other properties of the score in this context of use? What trade-offs should be made (sensitivity specificity, brevity comprehensiveness, one stage two stage process)? Our finding that diabetes risk scores seem to be used rarely can be considered in the light of the theoretical literature on diffusion of innovation. As well as being a statistical model, a risk score can be thought of as a complex, technology based innovation, the incorporation of which into business as usual (or not) is influenced by multiple contextual factors including the attributes of the risk score in the eyes of potential adopters (relative advantage, simplicity, and ease of use); adopters’ concerns (including implications for personal workload and how to manage a positive score); their skills (ability to use and interpret the technology); communication and influence (for example, whether key opinion leaders endorse it); system antecedents (including a healthcare organisation’s capacity to embrace new technologies, workflows, and ways of working); and external influences (including policy drivers, incentive structures, and competing priorities). While the developers of most diabetes risk scores are in little doubt about their score’s positive attributes, this confidence seems not to be shared by practitioners, who may doubt the accuracy of the score or the efficacy of risk modification strategies, or both. Measuring diabetes risk competes for practitioners’ attention with a host of other tasks, some of which bring financial and other rewards. At the time of writing, few opinion leaders in diabetes seem to be promoting particular scores or the estimation of diabetes risk generally—perhaps because, cognisant of the limited impacts shown to date (summarised in table 5), they are waiting for further evidence of whether and how use of the risk score improves outcomes. Indeed, the utility of measuring diabetes risk in addition to cardiovascular risk is contested within the diabetes research community. In the United Kingdom, the imminent inclusion of an application for calculating QDScore on EMIS, the country’s most widely used general practice computer system, may encourage its use in the clinical encounter. But unless the assessment of diabetes risk becomes part of the UK Quality and Outcomes Framework, this task may continue to be perceived as low priority by most general practitioners. Given current evidence, perhaps this judgment is correct. Furthermore, the low positive predictive values may spell trouble for commissioners. Identifying someone as “[possibly] high risk” will inevitably entail a significant cost in clinical review, blood tests, and (possibly) intervention and follow-up. Pending the results of ongoing impact studies, this may not be the best use of scarce resources. Delivering diabetes prevention in people without any disease requires skills that traditionally trained clinicians may not possess. We know almost nothing about the reach, uptake, practical challenges, acceptability, and cost of preventive interventions in high risk groups in different settings. The relative benefit of detecting and targeting high risk people rather than implementing population-wide diabetes prevention strategies is unknown. Effective prevention and early detection of diabetes are likely to require strengthening of health systems and development of new partnerships among the clinicians, community based lifestyle programmes, and healthcare funders. Although most authors of papers describing diabetes risk scores have hypothesised (or seem to have assumed) a clinical mechanism of action (that the score would be used by the individual’s clinician to target individual assessment and advice), the limited data available on impact studies (see table 5) suggest that a particularly promising area for further research is interventions that prompt self assessment—that is, laypeople measuring their own risk of diabetes. The preliminary findings from the impact studies covered in this review also suggest that not everyone at high risk is interested in coming forward for individual preventive input, nor will they necessarily stay the course of such input. It follows that in areas where aggregated data from electronic patient records are available, the diabetes risk scores may be used as a population prediction tool—for example, to produce small area statistics (perhaps as pictorial maps) of diabetes risk across a population, thereby allowing targeted design and implementation of community level public health interventions. Small area mapping of diabetes risk may be a way of operationalising the recently published guidance on diabetes prevention from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, which recommends the use of “local and national tools . . . to identify local communities at high risk of developing diabetes to assess their specific needs.” Towards an impact oriented research agenda for risk scores We recommend that funding bodies and journal editors help take this agenda forward by viewing the risk score in use as a complex intervention and encouraging more applied research studies in which real people identified as at “high risk” using a particular risk score are offered real interventions; success in risk score development is measured in terms of patient relevant intermediate outcomes (for example, change in risk score) and final outcomes (incident diabetes and related morbidity) rather than in terms of the statistical properties of the tool; a qualitative component (for example, process evaluation, organisational case study, patient’s experience of lifestyle modification) explores both facilitators and barriers of using the score in a real world setting; and an economic component evaluates cost and cost effectiveness. Millions of participants across the world have already participated in epidemiological studies aimed at developing a diabetes risk score. An extensive menu of possible scores are now available to those who seek to use them clinically or to validate them in new populations, none of which is perfect but all of which have strengths. Nevertheless, despite the growing public health importance of type 2 diabetes and the enticing possibility of prevention for those at high risk of developing it, questions remain about how best to undertake risk prediction and what to do with the results. Appropriately, the balance of research effort is now shifting from devising new risk scores to exploring how best to use those we already have. The many known risk factors for type 2 diabetes can be combined in statistical models to produce risk scores Dozens of risk models and scores for diabetes have been developed and validated in different settings Sociodemographic and clinical data were much better predictors of diabetes risk than genetic markers Research on this topic is beginning to shift from developing new statistical risk models to considering the use and impact of risk scores in the real world We thank Helen Elwell, librarian at the British Medical Association Library, for help with the literature search; Samuel Rigby for manually removing duplicates; and Sietse Wieringa, Kaveh Memarzadeh, and Nicholas Swetenham for help with translation of non-English papers. reviewers Wendy Hu and John Furler provided helpful comments on an earlier draft.

146c21b5-b6e0-4b97-93bf-1a682566c9ce,"Medically reviewed by — — Diabetes mellitus is a term for a group of disorders that cause elevated blood sugar (glucose) levels in the body. Glucose is a critical source of energy for your brain, muscles, and tissues. When you eat, your body breaks down carbohydrates into glucose. This triggers the pancreas to release a hormone called . Insulin acts as a “key” that allows glucose to enter the cells from the blood. If your body doesn’t produce enough insulin to effectively manage glucose, it can’t function or perform properly. This produces the symptoms of diabetes. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious complications by damaging blood vessels and organs. It can increase the risk of: Nutrition and exercise can help manage diabetes, but it’s also important to track blood glucose levels. Treatment may include taking insulin or other medications. Here’s a breakdown of the different types of diabetes: Blood glucose levels are higher than what’s considered normal, but not high enough to qualify as diabetes. The pancreas produces no insulin. The pancreas doesn’t make enough insulin or your body can’t use it effectively. Expectant mothers are unable to make and use all of the insulin they need during pregnancy. According to the , people who develop type 2 diabetes nearly always have . This means blood glucose levels are elevated, but not yet high enough to be considered diabetes. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates adult Americans have prediabetes, and 90 percent go undiagnosed. With , the pancreas can’t produce insulin. According to the ADA, Americans have this disorder. This is about 5 percent of all diagnosed cases. The ADA estimates that receive a type 1 diagnosis each year in the United States. is the most common form of diabetes. With this disorder, the pancreas can initially produce insulin, but your body’s cells can’t respond to it effectively. This is known as insulin resistance. The notes that 90 to 95 percent of diagnosed cases are type 2 diabetes. This form of diabetes develops . The CDC estimates between of pregnancies in the United States are affected by gestational diabetes every year. According to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), women with gestational diabetes will have a greater chance of developing type 2 diabetes within 10 years. According to the , more than 100 million adults in the United States are living with diabetes or prediabetes. They note that in 2015, , or close to 10 percent of the population, had diabetes. Of that amount, the ADA estimates didn’t know they had it. The CDC’s shows that diabetes diagnoses for Americans age 18 and older are increasing, with new diagnoses occurring at about per year. Those numbers were equal for men and women. Previously known as juvenile diabetes, type 1 diabetes is usually diagnosed in childhood. Only about of people with diabetes have type 1, estimates the ADA. While factors such as genetics and certain viruses may contribute to this disease, its exact cause is unknown. There’s no current cure or any known prevention, but there are treatments to help manage symptoms. The risk of developing type 2 diabetes increases as you get older. You’re also more likely to develop it if you’ve had gestational diabetes or prediabetes. Other risk factors include being overweight or having a family history of diabetes. While you can’t completely eliminate the risk of type 2 diabetes, a healthy diet, weight control, and regular exercise may help prevent it. Certain ethnicities are at higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes, too. These : Blindness is a common diabetes complication. Diabetic retinopathy, in particular, is the most common cause of blindness among people with diabetes. It’s a among working-age adults, according to the National Eye Institute. Diabetes is also a leading cause of kidney failure. Nervous system damage, or neuropathy, affects a of people with diabetes. Many people with diabetes have impaired sensation in the hands and feet, or . Diabetes can also cause digestive problems and . The conditions also increases the risk of , , and . Diabetes can also lead to of the lower limb. According to the ADA, diabetes is the in the United States. For more information, check out our wellness guides for and diabetes.

45a99bb9-ef82-4c7d-a8bf-c558b3f4c843,"Wednesday, 30 September 2020 Regular use of acid reflux drugs, known as proton pump inhibitors, or PPIs for short, is linked to an increased risk of developing Research published in the journal suggests the longer these drugs are taken, the greater the risk. As a result the researchers advise people taking reflux drugs for more than two years to have regular check-ups to screen for diabetes. PPIs are used to treat acid reflux, peptic ulcers, and indigestion. They are among the top 10 most commonly used drugs worldwide. Long-term use has been linked to an increased risk of bone fractures, chronic kidney disease, gut infections and stomach cancer. With the global prevalence of increasing the researchers wanted to find out if the widespread use of PPIs and the high prevalence of diabetes might be linked. They drew on information supplied by 204 689 participants (176,050 women and 28,639 men)  aged 25 to 75 in the US Nurses’ Health Study, which started in 1976 (NHS), the NHS II, which started in 1989, and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS), which started in 1986. At enrolment and every 2 years after that, participants updated information on their health behaviours, medical history, and newly diagnosed conditions. Starting in 2000 for the NHS, 2001 for NHS II, and 2004 for the HPFS, participants were also asked whether they had used PPIs regularly in the preceding 2 years: regular use was defined as 2 or more times a week. During the average tracking period of around 9 to 12 years across all three groups, 10,105 participants were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. The annual absolute risk of a diagnosis among regular PPI users was 7.44/1000 compared with 4.32/1000 among those who didn’t take these drugs. After taking account other influential factors, like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, physical inactivity and use of other medication, those who regularly used PPIs were 24% more likely to develop type 2 diabetes than those who didn’t. And the longer these drugs were taken, the greater was the risk of developing diabetes: use for up to 2 years was associated with a 5% increased risk; use for more than 2 years was associated with a 26% increased risk. The risk fell the more time had elapsed since stopping. Further analysis showed that diabetes risk among PPI users wasn’t affected by sex, age, family history of diabetes, smoking, alcohol intake, diet, physical activity, high cholesterol or regular use of anti-inflammatory drugs. But it was higher among participants who weren’t overweight or who had normal blood pressure. For comparison, the researchers also looked at the potential impact of H2 blockers, another type of drug used to curb excess stomach acid production. Regular use of these drugs was associated with a 14% increased risk. Similarly, longer term use was associated with a higher risk while longer time since stopping was associated with a lower risk. This is an observational study, and as such, can’t establish cause, but it involves many people whose health was tracked over a relatively long period, say the researchers. A mounting body of evidence suggests that changes in the type and volume of bacteria in the gut (the microbiome) may help explain the associations found between PPI use and an increased risk of developing diabetes, they add. “Owing to wide usage, the overall number of diabetes cases associated with PPI use could be considerable,” they warn. Given the range of side effects and the heightened risk of diabetes, doctors should carefully weigh up the pros and cons of prescribing these drugs, they caution. “For patients who have to receive long term PPI treatment, screening for abnormal blood glucose and type 2 diabetes is recommended,” they suggest.

963144e6-5243-4fbb-bc63-76142c6a53c7,"People are often taught that there are three types of diabetes: Type 1[1], Type 2[2], and gestational[3]. In reality, there are actually many more types, but the simplified explanation is that if you have diabetes, you likely have one of these three. The American Diabetes Association defines gestational diabetes as “diabetes diagnosed during pregnancy that is not clearly overt diabetes.” Like pregnancy, gestational diabetes (GDM) is temporary. GDM will resolve in about 90% of women after they’ve given birth. It’s important, though, to distinguish GDM from women with preexisting diabetes (Type 1 or Type 2) who are pregnant. Obviously, only women can get GDM. It’s estimated that up to 18% of pregnancies are affected by GDM. Of course, not all pregnant women get GDM, but there are certain factors that can put a woman at risk, including: • Being a member of certain ethnic groups: Hispanic, African-American, Asian, Native American • Having impaired glucose tolerance or impaired fasting glucose You might have noticed that many of the risk factors for GDM are the same as for Type 2 diabetes. Some women with GDM will have had none of the above risk factors, by the way. Why some women without any of the above risk factors develop GDM is unknown. What we do know is that the incidence of GDM in the US has increased over the years, most likely due to the increasing prevalence of overweight and obesity in this country. GDM is a common complication of pregnancy. It’s also important to realize that if you have GDM, you’re at a considerable risk for getting Type 2 diabetes later in life. Experts in diabetes and pregnancy have debated for many years over when and how to diagnose GDM. In the past, only women who had risk factors, like a family history of diabetes, were checked for GDM. But in 2001, guidelines changed and generally now all pregnant women at 24 to 28 weeks gestation (second trimester) are screened. Higher risk women are screened much earlier, usually at their first prenatal visit. There are two screening methods, one that involves a two-step process of drinking 50 grams of glucose then having your blood glucose checked an hour later. If the blood glucose reading is above 140 mg/dl, you’re deemed being at high risk and will have another glucose tolerance test. This test involves drinking a larger amount of a glucose drink, followed by a blood glucose checks each hour for three hours. If two out of those three glucose checks are higher than “normal,” you’ll be diagnosed with GDM. There is also a one-step method involving drinking a solution with 75 grams of glucose and having a glucose checks at two hours. The ADA endorses this screening test, but it’s more expensive to do and can also increase the incidence of GDM. If you are pregnant or planning a pregnancy, be sure to talk with your obstetrician about when and how you should be screened for GDM. Having any type of diabetes is very serious due to possible complications that can occur. It’s important to note that women who have GDM can and do have successful, healthy pregnancies. But GDM must be carefully managed to ensure a healthy baby, and a healthy mother, too. A lot happens in the body when a woman is pregnant. The hormones estrogen and progesterone rise, leading to increased insulin secretion and decreased production of glucose by the liver. The fetus uses a lot of the mother’s glucose, which can lead to low blood glucose levels in the mother. As pregnancy progresses, other hormones kick in, including human placental lactogen, cortisol, and prolactin. These hormones, combined with higher levels of estrogen and progesterone, can cause insulin resistance. The pancreas, therefore, kicks into high gear and secretes more insulin. In healthy, low risk women, this isn’t a problem. But in women who are already at risk for diabetes, this isn’t good news; the pancreas can’t keep up with the demand for insulin. As a result, insulin resistance continues and GDM can set in. Again, it’s important to realize that GDM can (and should) be effectively managed. But if it’s not managed properly, some of the complications that can occur include: • A very large baby (as a result of high blood glucose levels in the mother that cross the placenta). This is called macrosomia. A large baby may mean having to have a C-section and can cause problems with delivery, as well as with the baby. • Early labor and delivery, leading to respiratory distress syndrome in the infant. This can happen because the baby’s lungs haven’t fully developed yet. Babies born with this may need help breathing until their lungs are fully formed. • Low blood glucose in the infant due to high levels of insulin. • Jaundice due to a liver that isn’t fully formed yet. • Higher risk of obesity and Type 2 diabetes (in the baby) later in life. As I previously mentioned, women who have GDM are at higher risk for having GDM again during pregnancy, as well as a higher risk of Type 2 diabetes later on. In addition, women with GDM may have a higher risk of high blood pressure[4] and high blood lipid (fat)[5] levels, thereby raising the risk of heart disease.

Doctors can't even tell who will get it and who won't. No one knows for sure what causes type 1 diabetes, but scientists think it has something to do with . But just getting the genes for diabetes isn't usually enough. In most cases, a child has to be exposed to something else — like a virus — to get type 1 diabetes. Type 1 diabetes isn't contagious, so kids and teens can't catch it from another person or pass it along to friends or family members. And eating too much sugar doesn't cause type 1 diabetes, either. There's no reliable way to predict who will get type 1 diabetes, but blood tests can find early signs of it. These tests aren't done routinely, however, because doctors don't have any way to stop a child from developing the disease, even if the tests are positive. Unlike type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes can sometimes be prevented. Excessive weight gain, , and a sedentary lifestyle are all things that put a person at risk for type 2 diabetes. In the past, type 2 diabetes usually happened only in adults. But now, more kids and teens are being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, due to the rapidly increasing number of overweight kids. Although kids and teens might be able to prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes by managing their weight and increasing physical activity, other risk factors for type 2 diabetes can't be changed. Kids with one or more family members with type 2 diabetes have an increased risk for the disease, and some ethnic and racial groups are more likely to developing it. How Can I Protect My Kids From Developing Type 2 Diabetes? These steps can help reduce your kids' risk for developing type 2 diabetes and the it can cause: Encouraging your kids to eat — like whole-grain cereals and breads, fruits, vegetables, dairy products, and lean proteins — can help prevent excessive weight gain, a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes. Consuming lots of sugar-filled foods and beverages — like sodas, juices, and iced teas — can lead to excessive weight gain. and limiting the time spent in sedentary activities — like watching TV, being online, or playing video or computer games — can help reduce the risk of weight gain and help prevent the onset of type 2 diabetes. Being active can be as simple as walking the dog or mowing the lawn. Try to do something that gets you and your kids moving every day. If you think your child may be overweight and at risk for type 2 diabetes, talk to your doctor or a registered dietitian. They can help you learn what your child's weight goals should be and how to reach them. Note: All information is for educational purposes only.

The incidence of different types of is on the rise in the United States and worldwide. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported a 217% increase in the prevalence of diabetes in those 0–44 years of age and a 150% increase in those 65–74 years of age from 1990 to 2009. While the rise in cases of Type 2 diabetes is perhaps most striking, it appears that the incidence of Type 1 diabetes is increasing as well. But Types 1 and 2 aren’t the only types of diabetes out there: There’s also , maturity-onset diabetes of the young, and the so-called , not to mention , which raises a person’s risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. All types of diabetes are characterized by high blood glucose levels, and all can lead to , but the causes of different types of diabetes may be different, and the treatments can be different, too. Here is a run-down of the characteristics of various types of diabetes. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disorder in which the immune system attacks and destroys the -producing in the pancreas. As a result, the pancreas produces little or no insulin. Type 1 diabetes is also characterized by the presence of certain autoantibodies against insulin or other components of the insulin-producing system such as glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), tyrosine phosphatase, and/or islet cells. When the body does not have enough insulin to use the glucose that is in the bloodstream for fuel, it begins breaking down fat reserves for energy. However, the breakdown of fat creates acidic by-products called , which accumulate in the blood. If enough ketones accumulate in the blood, they can cause a potentially life-threatening chemical imbalance known as Type 1 diabetes often develops in children, although it can occur at any age. Symptoms include unusual thirst, a need to urinate frequently, unexplained weight loss, blurry vision, and a feeling of being tired constantly. Such symptoms tend to be acute. Diabetes is diagnosed in one of three ways — a , an , or a random plasma glucose test — all of which involve drawing blood to measure the amount of glucose in it. Type 1 diabetes requires insulin treatment for survival. Treatment may also include taking other drugs to prevent or to treat diabetes-related conditions such as . In Type 2 diabetes, there are two main underlying reasons for high blood glucose: , a condition in which the body does not use insulin efficiently, and insufficient insulin secretion by the pancreas. People with Type 2 diabetes usually do not show signs of autoimmune disease. Type 2 diabetes usually develops in adults, but it is now occurring with alarming frequency in children. The growing epidemic of obesity in children is believed to be a major contributor to the increase of Type 2 diabetes in children. Symptoms of Type 2 diabetes are generally the same as those for Type 1 diabetes, but they may be much milder. In fact, many people with Type 2 diabetes are unaware that they have it. Other symptoms may include wounds that heal slowly, frequent infections, and, in adults, , including impotence. Treatment for Type 2 diabetes may include taking to decrease insulin resistance and/or increase insulin secretion and taking other drugs to treat any diabetes-related conditions; it may also include taking insulin. Attention to and regular are important treatment components. can also help to reverse insulin resistance and lower blood glucose if a person is overweight. When a person has characteristics of both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, he is sometimes said to have “double diabetes,” or Type 1.5. Among the people who do not require insulin at diagnosis (most of whom are assumed to have Type 2 diabetes), some show autoantibodies, especially against islet cells and GAD. Initially, the term “latent autoimmune diabetes in adults” (LADA) was applied to this subset of people with diabetes. It has also been dubbed “slow-progressing Type 1 diabetes.” In the late 1990s, some researchers coined the term “Type 1.5 diabetes,” because it had features of both the major types. Further study of people who at least initially do not require insulin yet have autoantibodies has revealed some distinct variations, leading some researchers to subdivide those placed under the umbrella term LADA into three groups: Type 1–LADA, Type 1.5 or “double” diabetes, and Type 2 diabetes with autoantibodies. Under this scheme, people with Type 1–LADA are thought to have a more slowly progressing form of Type 1 diabetes. Like people with Type 1 diabetes, people with Type 1—LADA have autoantibodies and are usually not obese. Although they may initially be able to get by with diet therapy and oral diabetes medicines, they usually need to use insulin within about five years of diagnosis because of the destruction of their beta cells. People with Type 1.5 diabetes are said to have “double” diabetes because they show both the autoimmune destruction of beta cells of Type 1 diabetes and the insulin resistance characteristic of Type 2 diabetes. People with Type 1.5 have autoantibodies and gradually lose their insulin-producing capability, requiring insulin within 5–10 years of diagnosis. As their insulin resistance suggests, many people with Type 1.5 diabetes are obese or overweight. People in the third group are obese or overweight with insulin resistance like most people with Type 2 diabetes, and they also have autoantibodies. However, they still manage to produce insulin for more than five years after diagnosis and can continue to manage their diabetes with diet, exercise, and oral medicines. It is suspected that the autoimmunity in these people is very mild. Some researchers suggest screening anyone newly diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes for GAD antibodies. In the landmark United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS), most study subjects with Type 2 diabetes between 35 and 45 years old who tested positive for antibodies against both GAD and islet cells progressed rapidly to insulin dependency. Some researchers have also suggested that anyone who tests positive for GAD antibodies be screened for autoantibodies to and adrenal cells, because like people with Type 1 diabetes, people with Type 1.5 diabetes seem to be at higher risk of having other autoimmune diseases. The jury is still out on the best way to treat Type 1.5 diabetes. Maintaining tight blood glucose control may help to slow the destruction of the beta cells (and delay insulin dependency) as well as reduce the risk of long-term diabetic complications. Gestational diabetes is diabetes diagnosed during pregnancy. It may disappear after childbirth, but it is likely to develop again during subsequent pregnancies. Gestational diabetes affects about 4% of all pregnancies, resulting in roughly 135,000 cases in the United States each year. Women with gestational diabetes are also at a higher risk of developing Type 2 diabetes later in life. Gestational diabetes usually develops during the second or third trimester of pregnancy. Certain hormones released at that time work against the action of insulin and cause insulin resistance. If the pancreas is unable to produce enough insulin to meet the increased need, gestational diabetes develops. Women with gestational diabetes are at increased risk of giving birth to babies with respiratory problems or high birth weights. Gestational diabetes is most likely to affect women who are over 25, are overweight, have a close family member with diabetes, or belong to an ethnic group at high risk for diabetes (African-Americans, Asian-Americans/Pacific Islanders, Hispanic Americans/Latinos, and Native Americans fit into this category). These women should be screened for gestational diabetes between the 24th and 28th week of pregnancy. Screening consists of a oral glucose tolerance test, or OGTT, which is designed to determine how well a person’s body handles glucose. The woman drinks 50 grams of pure glucose dissolved in water. One hour later, her blood glucose level is checked. A blood glucose level of 140 mg/dl or higher indicates that the woman may have diabetes, and another test is done. In this test, the woman fasts, then ingests 100 grams of glucose. Her blood glucose level is checked up to four times: once before ingesting the glucose and at one hour, two hours, and three hours afterward. If any two of these values is equal to or above a certain level (95 mg/dl while fasting, 180 at one hour, 155 at two hours, or 140 at three hours), then the diagnosis of diabetes is confirmed. Women diagnosed with gestational diabetes must strive to keep their blood glucose levels under control for their own health and that of their baby. Diet, exercise, and insulin are the most common treatments. Doctors do not typically prescribe oral drugs as a treatment for gestational diabetes. Gestational diabetes usually disappears when the stress of pregnancy is over. However, women who have had gestational diabetes should continue to eat a healthy diet, avoid gaining weight, and exercise regularly after giving birth due to their higher risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. Usually called MODY, maturity-onset diabetes of the young is a type of diabetes associated with single genetic defects that lead to impaired functioning of the insulin-producing beta cells of the pancreas. It generally causes mild, chronic high blood glucose at an early age — usually before age 25. MODY is distinctly different from either Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes. In MODY, the primary problem is a defect in insulin secretion. When the pancreas does not produce enough insulin, abnormalities in glucose transport and metabolism result. This in turn leads to high blood glucose, which can contribute to insulin resistance. The impaired secretion of insulin seen in MODY is similar to the deficiency found in Type 1 diabetes, but unlike Type 1 diabetes, MODY develops slowly and does not completely destroy the ability of the pancreas to secrete insulin. However, it impairs insulin secretion enough so that the body cannot adequately control blood glucose levels from one moment to the next. So far, 14 types of maturity-onset diabetes of the young have been identified; they are labeled MODY1 through MODY14. Each type of MODY represents a specific, usually inherited, genetic defect affecting insulin secretion. MODY is treated very much like Type 2 diabetes — with diet and exercise, often in combination with blood-glucose-lowering pills, insulin, or both. Researchers can now test the children of adults with MODY and detect genetic predispositions for MODY before the children develop high blood glucose, allowing early intervention and possibly delay of the onset of diabetes. The goal in any diabetes treatment is to keep blood glucose and blood pressure levels as close to normal as possible. Chronically high blood glucose levels can damage many parts of the body, including the , kidneys, nerves, and . In women who are pregnant, high blood glucose can cause or a baby that is larger than normal. High blood pressure can also do widespread damage to the body’s organs. However, studies have shown that and blood pressure control lowers the risk of complications significantly. Blood glucose level can be monitored at home with a blood glucose meter. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends that most people with diabetes aim for the following treatment goals: The target blood sugar goal before a meal is 80 mg/dl–130 mg/dl. When using a meter that gives plasma glucose levels, the target goal before a meal is between 90 mg/dl and 130 mg/dl. (Whether a meter gives whole blood glucose values or plasma glucose values should be indicated in the literature that comes with the meter.) People who use insulin are generally advised to check their blood glucose level more frequently than those who don’t. Another blood test that helps to evaluate blood glucose control is the glycosylated hemoglobin () test. This blood test is usually done in a doctor’s office or medical laboratory, although there are some home tests on the market. The ADA recommends that people with diabetes in general aim for an HbA1c reading below 7%, while individuals and their doctors consider aiming for readings even lower than the general goal of below 7%. Measuring HbA1c every 3—6 months is recommended. Blood pressure is usually measured at the doctor’s office, although some people monitor their blood pressure at home. The ADA treatment goal for blood pressure is below 140/90 mm Hg. Acute complications of diabetes include (low blood glucose), (a life-threatening condition characterized by high blood glucose, ketones in the blood and urine, and dehydration), and state (a life-threatening condition characterized by very high blood glucose and dehydration). Long-term complications include (hardening and narrowing of the arteries), (nerve damage), (eye disease), and (kidney disease). Prediabetes is a condition in which blood glucose levels are elevated, but not yet within the range classified as diabetes. It is also known as impaired fasting glucose (IFG) or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). The new term was inaugurated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the ADA in March 2002 to promote public understanding of this increasingly widespread problem. According to the American Association of Endocrinologists (AACE), roughly 86 million Americans had prediabetes in 2016. Studies have shown that most people with blood glucose levels in the prediabetes range go on to develop Type 2 diabetes within 10 years; the condition also raises the risk of having a heart attack or stroke by 50%. Prediabetes can be controlled, and in many cases even reversed, through lifestyle changes. Prediabetes can be detected by either of the two standard tests currently used to diagnose diabetes. In the fasting plasma glucose test (FPG), a person fasts overnight and then has blood drawn for testing first thing in the morning, before he eats. People with a fasting blood glucose level of 100 to 125 mg/dl are considered to have prediabetes. A fasting blood glucose level over 125 mg/dl indicates diabetes. (A second test must be done on a subsequent day to confirm a diagnosis of diabetes.) In the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), a person’s blood glucose is tested once after an overnight fast and again two hours after he has consumed a special, glucose-rich drink. A normal blood glucose level two hours after the drink is below 140 mg/dl; an elevated blood glucose level in the range of 140 to 199 mg/dl indicates impaired glucose tolerance, or prediabetes. A blood glucose level 200 mg/dl or higher two hours after the drink indicates diabetes. (Again, a second test must be done on a subsequent day to confirm diabetes.) People who are overweight (defined as having a body-mass index of 25 or higher) and are age 45 and up are considered at risk for prediabetes and should be screened. People under the age of 45 who are overweight should also be screened if they have one or more of the following risk factors for diabetes: high blood pressure, a family history of diabetes, low high-density lipoprotein (HDL, or “good”) and high , a history of gestational diabetes or giving birth to a baby over 9 pounds, or belonging to one of the racial or ethnic groups that is at increased risk for Type 2 diabetes (African-Americans, Native Americans, Asian Americans/Pacific Islanders, and Hispanic Americans/Latinos). If a person is tested for prediabetes and his results are within the normal range, the ADA recommends that he be retested every three years. If a person is diagnosed with prediabetes, he should be screened for Type 2 diabetes every one to two years. Prediabetes can also affect children and adolescents. A study published in in March 2002 found that 25% of obese children and 21% of obese adolescents tested had blood glucose levels within the prediabetes range. Currently, not much is known about how to prevent or delay the onset of Type 2 diabetes in children. The widespread screening of younger people for prediabetes, therefore, is not currently called for by major health organizations. However, in 2000, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended diabetes testing for obese children who also have two or more of the additional risk factors for diabetes mentioned earlier. Not all cases of diabetes can be prevented, but many can, and ongoing research may point the way toward preventing even more. In adults who have been diagnosed with prediabetes, lifestyle changes can delay or prevent the development of full-blown Type 2 diabetes. Results from the Diabetes Prevention Program, a study conducted by HHS and involving more than 3,000 participants, showed that a 5% to 7% weight loss lowered the incidence of Type 2 diabetes by 58%. The weight loss was achieved through dieting (cutting fat and calories) as well as exercising moderately (most participants chose walking) for at least 150 minutes a week. Use of the oral diabetes drug (brand name Glucophage and others) also helped to delay the onset of diabetes in some study participants; however, it was not as effective as diet and exercise. A more recent study, called the DREAM study, showed that use of the drug also reduced the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes in people at risk. However, drug use as a treatment for prediabetes is not recommended at this time. Efforts to prevent Type 1 diabetes in humans have so far been largely unsuccessful, but numerous studies, many of them part of a group of studies called Type 1 Diabetes TrialNet, continue to work toward that end.

e2c8a4eb-778a-423f-92fd-ff901077473f,"Posted by Diabetes is becoming more and more prevalent in the U.S. and affects about 9.4% of the population Rates of Type 2 diabetes (adult-onset diabetes) have almost quadrupled worldwide since 1980 Conventional diabetes treatment includes managing blood sugar with glucose-lowering drugs which have side effects and can even lead to a heart attack Type 2 diabetes symptoms are often less pronounced and the condition may go undetected or untreated for long periods of time, leading to complications. Type 2 diabetes can be managed and even reversed naturally through dietary & nutritional changes that address insulin resistance. Diabetes is becoming more and more prevalent in the U.S. with 9.4% percent of the population having the condition. Even more alarming is the fact that 95% of the 30.3 million people with diabetes have Type 2 diabetes which in most cases is preventable or reversible. Additionally, type 2 diabetes is increasing in children. The prevalence of diabetes is also rising globally almost quadrupling between 1980 and 2014 from 108 million to 422 million. The World Health Organization recently published a global report on diabetes which stated that the rise is mainly due to a population that is becoming more and more overweight and obese. The report encouraged people to eat healthier, exercise regularly and prevent weight gain. Diabetes can lead to stroke, heart attack, blindness, amputation of limbs, kidney problems, and more. Let’s explore the types of diabetes, symptoms, causes, and what can be done naturally to address diabetes. Type 1 diabetes affects about 5% of the population and usually occurs in children and adolescents. However, Type 1 diabetes can also develop in adulthood. It is a chronic condition in which the pancreas is not able to produce insulin or produces very little or not enough to manage blood sugar. Type 1 diabetes has no cure and must be treated with insulin, although dietary changes that reduce or prevent blood sugar spikes and lifestyle changes can improve the condition and prevent complications. Type 2 diabetes, also called adult-onset diabetes, affects about 95% of people who have diabetes. It is a condition of insulin resistance and can lead to low insulin production over time. In Type 2 diabetes, insulin does not have the same effect on blood sugar as a healthy person and sugar is not removed from the blood effectively. In addition, the pancreas may become overworked from needing to produce so much insulin that it becomes unable to produce enough over time. 2015 statistics reveal that 33.9% of adults age 18 and older had prediabetes in 2015.1 This is an alarming statistic with over ⅓ of the adult population heading toward diabetes. In prediabetes, fasting blood glucose levels are between 100 and 125 mg/dL. This is higher than normal, but not high enough to be diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Type 1 diabetes symptoms are similar to type 2 except that they are usually less pronounced so that type 2 diabetes may go undiagnosed and untreated for much longer. Diabetes symptoms typically include: Increased thirst, even with drinking plenty of water The cause of Type 1 diabetes is still a mystery however some possible causes may be: An response happens in the body in which the immune system mistakenly attacks the pancreas and destroys the islets of Langerhans that produce insulin. Prediabetes and type 2 diabetes is almost always caused by diet and lifestyle choices. The main cause of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes is a poor diet, particularly a diet high in sugar and refined carbohydrates. These foods raise blood sugar quickly and cause the body to release insulin to pull excess sugar from the blood. The American diet began to change in the 1970s with recommendations from the government to reduce fat. The concerns were with saturated fats, however, Americans were told to reduce all fats.4 Since that time changes to the American diet include: Saturated fats were replaced with hydrogenated oils which are now known to cause damage to the cardiovascular system. Saturated fats were also substituted with vegetable oils, which increased the Omega-6 fatty acid ratio in the diet to an unhealthy ratio. Processed foods became more and more popular for their convenience. The shelf life of packaged foods was increased with hydrogenated oils and high fructose corn syrup. In 1992, the U.S. government published new guidelines that recommended 6 to 11 servings a day of bread, cereal, rice, and pasta – all high glycemic foods and relatively low quality. Meals became larger and super-sizing became a craze, especially in fast food restaurants. Soda and juices became standard drinks with meals. It’s no wonder the statistics for diabetes are so alarming. The nation has not recovered from these food changes, despite dietary recommendations to combat it, and the diabetes statistics show the devastating effects of these changes. Today, the average American consumes an astounding 2-3 lbs. of sugar each week in the form of sucrose (table sugar), dextrose (corn sugar), and high-fructose corn syrup. Foods such as bread, breakfast cereal, mayonnaise, peanut butter, ketchup, spaghetti sauce, and microwave meals all contain very high levels of ‘hidden’ sugars. One of sugar’s major drawbacks is that it raises the insulin level in the blood, which inhibits the release of growth hormones, which in turn depresses the immune system. In addition, an influx of sugar into the bloodstream upsets the body’s blood-sugar balance, triggering the release of insulin, which the body uses to keep blood-sugar at a constant and safe level. Sugar, in the form of glucose, is the main source of fuel for body cells. Insulin allows glucose in the blood to enter cells. In type 2 diabetes, either the body doesn’t produce enough insulin or cells are resistant to the effects of insulin because they are already overloaded with sugar. As a result, glucose builds up in the blood instead of entering cells, which causes cells to be deprived of energy. If high glucose levels in the blood persist, it may damage the eyes, heart, kidneys, or nerves. Sugar also causes in the body which causes increased auto-immune responses. Other causes of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes include: Diabetes is the 7th leading cause of death in the United States. Diabetes has a host of complications including but not limited to: These and other complications can arise from diabetes. If you are an American diabetic, you may have been told that you can consume sugary and sugar-producing foods multiple times daily as long as you take enough insulin to cover yourself. Sadly, when treating diabetes there has been little recognition of the fact that high levels of insulin are just as dangerous over time as sugar is. Prolonged exposure to high levels of insulin can be very detrimental. Glucose-lowering drugs usually succeed in lowering blood sugar levels but may increase the death rate from heart attacks. These drugs also are associated with weight gain, elevated cholesterol and triglyceride levels, nausea, diarrhea, , stomach pain, drowsiness, and .

The fall risk for people with diabetes is higher because their fluctuates, they can have health complications, and often use more medication than the general population without diabetes. The study was presented at the annual meeting of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes. The study aimed to estimate the risk of falls and the risk factors linked to increased falls in people with diabetes compared with the general population. The second aim was to estimate fall-related injuries including fractures and where in the body they occurred compared. The data was taken from the Nationwide Danish National Patient Register. The team identified 12,975 people with type 1 diabetes and 407,099 people with type 2 diabetes and matched a control group from the general population. They found type 1 diabetes was linked to a 33% increased risk of a first fall, and type 2 diabetes a 19% increased risk. Other risk factors for those with type 1 and type 2 diabetes included: use of selective serotonin receptor inhibitors (SSRIs) generally used to treat depression a history of alcohol abuse. This near doubling of risk). People with type 2 diabetes also suffered an increased incidence of fractures when compared with the general population. There was an increased risk of fractures of the hip and femur, bones in the arm (humerus and radius) and skull/face. People with type 1 diabetes also had an increased risk of fractures, but only at the hip and femoral region. The team says older people with diabetes need to pay more attention to the risk factors for falls. Improving strength and balance can help manage these risks.

After two years, the incidence of type 2 diabetes in the intervention group was less than half that observed within the control group. The was conducted in 3234 US adults with IGT. Unlike most previous studies, the cohort was diverse and included a large proportion of women (68%) and ethnic minorities (45%), and compared lifestyle intervention versus drug intervention (metformin) and a placebo control group over 2.8 years. The DPP reported that both lifestyle intervention and metformin had positive effects on the prevention of type 2 diabetes and restoring normal glucose tolerance. The lifestyle intervention was more effective in preventing type 2 diabetes, particularly in older adults. The was a prospective community-based study, that examined whether the progression to type 2 diabetes could be influenced by interventions in native Asian Indians with IGT who were younger, leaner and more insulin resistant than in multiethnic American, Finnish and Chinese populations Results showed that progression of IGT to type 2 diabetes is high in native Asian Indians. Both lifestyle modification and metformin significantly reduced the incidence of type 2 diabetes in Asian Indians with IGT. IDF recommendations for a healthy diet for the general population Choosing water, coffee or tea instead of fruit juice, soda, or other sugar sweetened beverages. Eating at least three servings of vegetable every day, including green leafy vegetables. Eating up to three servings of fresh fruit every day. Choosing nuts, a piece of fresh fruit, or unsweetened yoghurt for a snack. Limiting alcohol intake to a maximum of two standard drinks per day. Choosing lean cuts of white meat, poultry or seafood instead of red or processed meat. Choosing peanut butter instead of chocolate spread or jam. Choosing whole-grain bread, rice, or pasta instead of white bread, rice, or pasta. Choosing unsaturated fats (olive oil, canola oil, corn oil, or sunflower oil) instead of saturated fats (butter, ghee, animal fat, coconut oil or palm oil. A particular threat in terms of the associated risk of developing type 2 diabetes is the consumption of high sugar foods, particularly sugar-sweetened beverages, In 2014, the World Health Organization (WHO) issued new recommendations to limit sugar intake.

Diabetes Self-Management offers over 900 diabetes friendly recipes to choose from including desserts, low-carb pasta dishes, savory main meals, grilled options and more. Diabetes — both and — is a disorder of how the body uses , the main form of sugar used as fuel. While many people without diabetes don’t know a lot about the disease processes involved, they probably know it has something to do with sugar. But the relationship between blood glucose and dietary sugar intake is anything but direct, both when it comes to developing diabetes and among people who already have it. Some people consume high levels of sugar and never develop diabetes, while others follow a low-sugar diet and still develop it. This doesn’t mean, though, that there’s no relationship between dietary sugar and diabetes or blood glucose. In fact, sugar consumption seems to be associated with a number of different health outcomes, including whether or not someone develops diabetes. If you’re confused about what this means for your health, you’re not alone. The research on dietary sugar and diabetes includes many different study designs, and some studies are considered more important or reliable than others by groups that make dietary recommendations for both the general population and people with diabetes. Here’s what some studies and leading organizations say about sugar and diabetes. Any source of excess calories (including sugar) can contribute to Type 2 diabetes Being overweight or obese is a major risk factor for Type 2 diabetes, although it’s only one factor. Many people with Type 2 diabetes are thin, and many people with excess body weight never develop diabetes. According to the , other major risk factors for Type 2 diabetes include physical activity, family history, ethnicity, and age. The group emphasizes that sugar is a source of excess calories in many people, so it’s good to look at your sugar intake when evaluating your diet and potential causes of weight gain. Sugar isn’t the only form of carbs that can raise your blood glucose Once you have diabetes of any type, it’s important to keep track of nutrients in your diet that can affect your blood glucose levels. This includes different forms of carbohydrate, like sugars, starches, and fiber. Starches and sugars may raise blood glucose in people with diabetes to varying degrees, while fiber may slow the rise in blood glucose that comes with consumption of other carbohydrates. It’s important to figure out how your body responds to various nutrients and foods. The American Diabetes Association emphasizes that the total amount of carbohydrate in your diet should be based on many factors, and that your health-care provider can help figure this out. Particularly when it comes to starches — from foods like bread, cereal, rice, pasta, potatoes, peas, and corn — it’s important to control portion sizes. Sweets and desserts, the group notes, can be part of a healthy meal plan but should be reserved for special occasions and eaten in very small portions. Overall sugar consumption is linked to diabetes in populations It’s difficult to design a study that tests whether consuming more sugar increases a person’s risk of developing diabetes. That’s because sugar — both natural and added — is present in many different foods, and most people’s diets can’t be meaningfully tracked over the amount of time it takes to see differences in how many people develop diabetes. It’s a lot easier to compare different populations of people, since per-person consumption of sugar (or anything else) within a country can be calculated based on the total amount that’s present in all foods sold. This amount can then be compared with the number of people who develop diabetes over a set period of time. One study, published in February 2013 in the journal , found that across 175 different countries, every 150 calories per day of sugar consumption — about as much as a can of soda contains — was associated with an additional 1.1 percent in the rate of Type 2 diabetes. This was true after controlling for total calories, overweight and obesity, age, income, and urban versus rural living, among other factors. Out of all dietary components the study looked at, sugar was the only one linked to diabetes rates. The other components were fiber, meat, fruits, oils, and grains. Another study, published in February 2014 the journal , looked at 165 countries and also found an overall link between sugar consumption and diabetes of all types. This connection was strongest in Asia, and it wasn’t present at all in some countries. When other potential factors in developing diabetes were controlled for, the connection to sugar remained significant only in Asia and South America. Drinking sugar-sweetened beverages is clearly associated with developing Type 2 diabetes As noted in an article published in April 2014 in the journal , per-person consumption of soft drinks in the United States has increased by a factor of five since 1950. Furthermore, an overview of the studies on the subjects suggests that drinking sugar-sweetened beverages is associated with an increased risk of Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The American Diabetes Association considers this evidence strong enough to state that drinking sugar-sweetened beverages is a risk factor for Type 2 diabetes, and the recommends limiting added sugars in your diet to about 100 calories for women and 150 calories for men each day. ”Added sugars” means all types of concentrated sugar-based sweeteners, including cane sugar (white or brown), high-fructose corn syrup, honey, molasses, fruit juice concentrates, maple syrup, and other syrups (such as agave, corn, rice, or sorghum). Artificially sweetened beverages might not be a much better choice Many people, with or without diabetes, turn to soft drinks made with zero-calorie sweeteners as an alternative to sugar-sweetened beverages. While these beverages tend to be essentially calorie-free, they may still raise your risk of developing diabetes. In an article published in June 2014 in the , researchers found that based on the combined results of multiple studies, every 330 milliliters (about 11 fluid ounces, or almost a can of soda) of sugar-sweetened soft drinks participants drank each day was associated with a 20 percent higher risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. For the same quantity of artificially sweetened soft drinks, the risk increase was 13 percent. Fructose might be worse for you in the long run than glucose In an article published in March 2015 in the journal , the authors examined the research on consuming added fructose — either in high-fructose sweeteners or in sweeteners containing a mix of fructose and glucose (which includes most forms of sugar). They write that fructose, rather than glucose, in sweeteners may pose the greatest risk for developing Type 2 diabetes and related metabolic and cardiovascular problems. Fructose that occurs naturally in whole fruits, on the other hand, doesn’t seem to cause any increase in these risks. The authors conclude that there’s no need for added fructose or other sweeteners in your diet, and that limiting your intake of added sugars to 5 percent of your total calories — as recommended conditionally by the — could improve glucose tolerance and reduce the overall rate and burden of diabetes. Sugar consumption may increase some people’s Type 1 diabetes risk Addressing the relationship between sugar intake and diabetes risk, the American Diabetes Association states that Type 1 diabetes is “caused by genetics and unknown factors that trigger the onset of the disease.” While the research isn’t definitive, there’s evidence to suggest that one of these factors may be sugar consumption. In a study published in September 2015 in the journal , researchers looked at data from a study called Diabetes Autoimmunity Study in the Young (DAISY), which has tracked children at increased genetic risk for Type 1 diabetes to see if they actually develop it as they grow older. Some participants in the study have developed what’s known as islet autoimmunity, which means their blood contains antibodies (proteins involved in your immune system’s response) to insulin or other substances released in the pancreatic islets. People with islet autoimmunity often progress to Type 1 diabetes. Participants in the study submitted food questionnaires that tracked their intake of fructose, sucrose, total sugars, sugar-sweetened beverages, beverages containing zero-calorie sweeteners, and fruit juices. Among children in the study who had developed islet autoimmunity (142 out of 1,893 participants), intake of total sugars was significantly associated with progression to Type 1 diabetes. Consuming sugar-sweetened beverages was also associated with this progression in children with a certain genetic risk factor (known as HLA genotype). But no sugar-related factors were found to increase the risk of developing islet autoimmunity in the first place. This means that according to the study, any Type 1 diabetes risk associated with sugar intake applies only to a small high-risk subset of children who are already genetically predisposed to developing the condition.

Reduce the disease burden of diabetes mellitus (DM) and improve the quality of life for all persons who have, or are at risk for, DM. DM occurs when the body cannot produce enough insulin or cannot respond appropriately to insulin. Insulin is a hormone that the body needs to absorb and use glucose (sugar) as fuel for the body’s cells. Without a properly functioning insulin signaling system, blood glucose levels become elevated and other metabolic abnormalities occur, leading to the development of serious, disabling complications. Many forms of diabetes exist. The 3 common types of DM are: Type 2 diabetes, which results from a combination of resistance to the action of insulin and insufficient insulin production Type 1 diabetes, which results when the body loses its ability to produce insulin Gestational diabetes, a common complication of pregnancy. Gestational diabetes can lead to perinatal complications in mother and child and substantially increases the likelihood of cesarean section. Gestational diabetes is also a risk factor for the mother and, later in life, the child's subsequent development of type 2 diabetes after the affected pregnancy. Effective therapy can prevent or delay diabetic complications. However, about 28 percent of Americans with DM are undiagnosed, and another 86 million American adults have blood glucose levels that greatly increase their risk of developing type 2 DM in the next several years. Diabetes complications tend to be more common and more severe among people whose diabetes is poorly controlled, which makes DM an immense and complex public health challenge. Preventive care practices are essential to better health outcomes for people with diabetes. DM affects an estimated 29.1 million people in the United States and is the 7th leading cause of death. Diagnosed DM: Increases the all-cause mortality rate 1.8 times compared to persons without diagnosed diabetes Is the leading cause of kidney failure, lower limb amputations, and adult-onset blindness In addition to these human costs, the estimated total financial cost of DM in the United States in 2012 was $245 billion, which includes the costs of medical care, disability, and premature death. The number of DM cases continues to increase both in the United States and throughout the world. Due to the steady rise in the number of persons with DM, and possibly earlier onset of type 2 DM, there is growing concern about: The possibility of substantial increases in prevalence of diabetes-related complications in part due to the rise in rates of obesity The possibility that the increase in the number of persons with DM and the complexity of their care might overwhelm existing health care systems The need to take advantage of recent discoveries on the individual and societal benefits of improved diabetes management and prevention by bringing life-saving discoveries into wider practice The clear need to complement improved diabetes management strategies with efforts in primary prevention among those at risk for developing type 2 DM Four “transition points” in the natural history of diabetes health care provide opportunities to reduce the health and economic burden of DM: Primary prevention: Movement from no diabetes to diabetes Testing and early diagnosis: Movement from unrecognized to recognized diabetes Access to care for all persons with diabetes: Movement from no diabetes care to access to appropriate diabetes care Improved quality of care: Movement from inadequate to adequate care People from minority populations are more likely to be affected by type 2 diabetes. Minority groups constitute 25 percent of all adult patients with diabetes in the United States and represent the majority of children and adolescents with type 2 diabetes. African Americans, Hispanic/Latino Americans, American Indians, and some Asian Americans and Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders are at particularly high risk for the development of type 2 diabetes. Diabetes prevalence rates among American Indians are 2 to 5 times those of whites. On average, African American adults are 1.7 times as likely and Mexican Americans and Puerto Ricans are twice as likely to have the disease as non-Hispanic whites of similar age. Systems problems (challenges due to the design of health care systems) The troubling increase in the number of people with diabetes, which may result in a decrease in the attention and resources available per person to treat DM Evidence is emerging that diabetes is associated with additional comorbidities including: CDC Diabetes Public Health Resource - Data and Trends National Diabetes Education Program (NIDDK/NIH; DDT/CDC) National Diabetes Information Clearinghouse (NDIC) National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) The importance of both diabetes and these comorbidities will continue to increase as the population ages. Therapies that have proven to reduce microvascular and macrovascular complications will need to be assessed in light of the newly identified comorbidities. Lifestyle change has been proven effective in preventing or delaying the onset of type 2 diabetes in high-risk individuals. Based on this, new public health approaches are emerging that may deserve monitoring at the national level. For example, the Diabetes Prevention Program research trial demonstrated that lifestyle intervention had its greatest impact in older adults and was effective in all racial and ethnic groups. Translational studies of this work have also shown that delivery of the lifestyle intervention in group settings at the community level are also effective at reducing type 2 diabetes risk. The National Diabetes Prevention Program has now been established to implement the lifestyle intervention nationwide. Another emerging issue is the effect on public health of new laboratory based criteria, such as introducing the use of A1c for diagnosis of type 2 diabetes or for recognizing high risk for type 2 diabetes. These changes may impact the number of individuals with undiagnosed diabetes and facilitate the introduction of type 2 diabetes prevention at a public health level. Several studies have suggested that process indicators such as foot exams, eye exams, and measurement of A1c may not be sensitive enough to capture all aspects of quality of care that ultimately result in reduced morbidity. New diabetes quality-of-care indicators are currently under development and may help determine whether appropriate, timely, evidence-based care is linked to risk factor reduction. In addition, the scientific evidence that type 2 diabetes can be prevented or delayed has stimulated new research into the best markers and approaches for identifying and referring high-risk individuals to prevention programs in community settings. Finally, it may be possible to achieve additional reduction in the risk of type 2 diabetes or its complications by influencing various behavioral risk factors, such as specific dietary choices, which have not been tested in large randomized controlled trials.

If you have diabetes, there’s a good chance you’ve heard about . In fact, if you have , you may have been told at some point in the past that you had prediabetes. Or perhaps you were told that you had impaired glucose tolerance or – and if you’ve struggled to understand what these terms mean, you’re not alone. Prediabetes is a condition in which blood glucose levels are higher than normal but not high enough to be diagnosed as diabetes. Some 35% of Americans over age 20, and more than 50% of those over age 65, currently have prediabetes. Prediabetes may also be called or depending on the type of blood test that was used to check a person’s blood glucose level. Some health-care providers may refer to prediabetes as borderline diabetes, but the American Diabetes Association prefers the term “prediabetes.” Studies show that people with prediabetes have an elevated risk of developing Type 2 diabetes within 10 years, especially if they make no changes to their diet or level of physical activity. ( to learn more about how prediabetes and Type 2 diabetes are diagnosed.) However, if they do make healthful dietary changes, increase their level of daily physical activity, and lose some excess weight, many people with prediabetes do not develop full-blown diabetes. These same lifestyle changes can also help people who have Type 2 diabetes significantly lower their blood glucose levels and prevent long-term . No one knows for sure why improved diet, increased exercise, and weight loss lower blood glucose levels and help prevent the progression of prediabetes to diabetes. But many scientists suspect that these lifestyle changes reduce insulin resistance, a condition that occurs when the cells in a person’s body (especially liver and muscle cells) lose some of their sensitivity to the action of insulin. With insulin resistance, more insulin is needed to keep blood glucose levels within normal limits. Over time, however, the pancreas may lose its ability to keep producing extra insulin, and blood glucose levels will rise. Obesity, certain dietary habits, and lack of physical activity, along with genetic factors, increase a person’s risk of developing insulin resistance, prediabetes, and Type 2 diabetes. Individuals with can also develop insulin resistance with weight gain and inactivity, resulting in a need for more injected or infused insulin. While you cannot change your genetic inheritance, you can reduce your level of insulin resistance through an active lifestyle, moderate weight loss if you’re overweight, and following a healthy diet. Insulin is a hormone made in specialized cells of the pancreas called beta cells. Insulin is required to move glucose from your bloodstream into your body’s cells. Once glucose is in your cells, it is either used immediately for energy or put into storage for later use. In Type 1 diabetes, the beta cells of the pancreas stop producing insulin, so insulin must be injected (or infused with a ) to provide energy to cells and keep blood glucose levels within a desired range. Type 1 diabetes can develop very rapidly, often over a few months or even less time, and the condition cannot be reversed. In prediabetes and Type 2 diabetes, on the other hand, the pancreas still produces insulin. However, two problems may be present. First, a person may experience insulin resistance, in which insulin becomes less effective at moving glucose from the blood into cells. And second, the pancreas may no longer make enough insulin to meet the body’s needs. When a person’s cells become resistant to the normal effects of insulin, the pancreas has to work harder to produce extra insulin in an effort to keep blood glucose levels in the normal range. Eventually, the pancreas can no longer keep up with the extra demand for insulin and blood glucose levels begin to rise. Prediabetes and Type 2 diabetes usually develop over many years, with no, or only subtle, symptoms. Once diagnosed, however, prediabetes and Type 2 diabetes can often be controlled, if not completely reversed, through diet, , , and . According to Gerald Reaven, an endocrinologist and professor at the Stanford University School of Medicine (and the author of several books, including ), the overwhelming majority of people with Type 2 diabetes and prediabetes are insulin resistant. In addition, many children of people with Type 2 diabetes or prediabetes are insulin resistant themselves and therefore have an elevated risk of developing diabetes later in life. Although scientists don’t know the exact causes of insulin resistance, they are aware of several factors that promote it. These factors include obesity, an inactive or sedentary lifestyle, poor dietary habits, and family history (genes). Obesity is a major cause of insulin resistance, but not all obese people are insulin resistant. Lean people can be insulin resistant, too, so it is clear that factors other than body weight matter. According to Dr. Philip Wood, a professor at Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute and author of if you are overweight and have an apple shape (meaning your excess fat is stored in the abdominal region), you are more likely to develop insulin resistance than someone who is overweight and has a pear shape (with excess fat stored on the hips and thighs). Dr. Wood points out that regardless of body shape, weight loss can significantly lower insulin resistance and improve blood glucose levels in people with prediabetes or Type 2 diabetes. Loss of muscle mass as a result of aging or inactivity may also lead to insulin resistance. According to Dr. Wood, loss of muscle is often associated with insulin resistance and elevated blood glucose levels in elderly people. In younger people, studies have shown that physical inactivity is as large a risk factor for developing insulin resistance as is being overweight or obese. Insulin resistance in sedentary people may be related to loss of muscle mass from inactivity, or it could result from something else entirely. Some studies suggest that inactive people with insulin resistance may not burn fat as well as those who have insulin resistance but are physically active and fit. Dr. Wood suggests that this reduced ability to burn fat for energy may contribute to the development of insulin resistance. The amount and type of fat you eat may also play a role in insulin resistance. In a study of people from five countries, researchers found that people with diets high in saturated fat showed more insulin resistance than people who ate more monounsaturated fat. However, regardless of the type of fat, if the total amount of fat in the diet was high (more than 37% of total calories), so was the risk of developing insulin resistance. Researchers have also found a connection between insulin resistance and fat, which is found in foods that contain partially hydrogenated vegetable oils. Your genetic inheritance, however, probably plays the biggest role in determining whether or not you develop insulin resistance. In fact, Dr. Reaven estimates that genes account for about half of your risk. But he also adds that while you may not be able to completely avoid or reverse insulin resistance if you have the genetic tendency for it, having a healthy lifestyle that includes regular exercise and nutritious food choices will definitely keep you healthier. According to a joint statement on Type 2 diabetes and exercise by the American Diabetes Association and the American College of Sports Medicine, moderate activity can increase the movement of glucose from the blood to the muscle cells both during and up to several hours after exercise. In fact, evidence suggests that a single bout of moderate exercise (such as a brisk 30-minute walk) can lower blood glucose levels and reduce insulin resistance for up to 72 hours in some people. Regular exercise can also help your body burn fat for energy. The joint statement recommends exercising for a minimum of 150 minutes per week for people with Type 2 diabetes or prediabetes. Practicing your favorite form of movement (brisk walking, Zumba, hiking, biking, or other moderate to vigorous activity) in bouts of 10 minutes or more, and with no more than two days between exercise sessions, will produce the best results. In addition, resistance exercise (such as weight lifting, Pilates, yoga, or other forms of exercise that strengthen, tone, and build muscle) should be practiced at least twice a week (but ideally three times) on nonconsecutive days. Weight loss often has dramatic effects on blood glucose levels. In fact, both Reaven and Wood state that losing 10–15 pounds is the best thing most overweight people can do to reduce insulin resistance. Weight loss requires burning more calories than you take in, and combining dietary changes with exercise is the most effective way to lose weight and keep it off. Avoid fad diets, which often result in quick, but not lasting, weight loss. Instead, consider ways to reduce your calorie intake by 350–500 calories a day while adding about 30 minutes of brisk exercise. Slow, steady weight loss (about one to two pounds per week) resulting from gradual, sustainable changes in your diet and physical activity level is the healthiest way to reduce insulin resistance and get blood glucose levels under control. Evidence strongly suggests that saturated fat and trans fat increase insulin resistance and adversely affect health in other ways – for example, by raising LDL (low-density lipoprotein, or “bad”) levels and the risk of cardiovascular disease. Therefore, it is wise to reduce your intake of foods containing these types of fat. Check out the ingredients lists on food products when you shop for groceries. If partially hydrogenated oil is an ingredient, the product contains trans fat and should be avoided. Foods that contain large amounts of saturated fat include cheese, butter, lard, sour cream, and meat. Cut back on these foods, and reduce your portion sizes when you do eat them. The guide from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) is a great tool to help you plan healthy meals. This guide recommends that you fill most (more than 3/4) of your plate with nutrient-rich, low-fat plant foods, including vegetables, fruits, and whole grains. By filling up on these foods, while taking care not to add a lot of high-fat condiments such as butter, cheese, or sour cream, you can reduce your intake of calories and saturated fat. A smaller space on the plate is reserved for high-protein foods such as meat, chicken, fish, or eggs. Visit for more information. Whether you have prediabetes or Type 2 diabetes, dietary changes, increased physical activity, and weight loss – along with oral medicines or insulin, if needed – can lead to positive health changes. Dr. Wood advises that “whatever diet you are on, just eat less of it, become more active, and fine-tune your diet (with better fats, more fiber, etc.) along the way.” Especially if these changes result in weight loss (but even if they don’t), you can significantly lower your blood glucose levels, reduce your risk of heart disease, and enjoy the energy and confidence that comes with better overall health.

People with type 1 diabetes are usually advised to measure their blood glucose level at least four times a day.  Healthy nutrition — knowing what and when to eat — is an important part of diabetes management as different foods affect your blood glucose levels differently. A healthy diet for all people with diabetes includes reducing the amount of calories if you are overweight, replacing (eg. cream, cheese, butter) with (eg. avocado, nuts, olive and vegetable oils), (eg. fruit, vegetables, whole grains), and , and . Regular physical activity is essential to help keep blood glucose levels under control. It is most effective when it includes a combination of both (eg. jogging, swimming, cycling) and , as well as reducing the amount of time spent being inactive. No effective and safe intervention currently exists to prevent type 1 diabetes despite a large number of clinical trials aimed at halting the on-going autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells. However, there is some evidence that are weak risk factors, indicating that a that avoids both over-eating and a sedentary lifestyle is recommended for high-risk groups such as the siblings of children with type 1 diabetes. However, this is just one of a number of factors that have also been implicated. These include not being breast-fed, being the first-born, being born by caesarean section and having an older or obese mother. Although a ‘cure’ for type 1 diabetes is being actively sought, preventing or delaying it in those known to be at risk or, in those already diagnosed, slowing down the auto-immune destruction of beta cells and protecting those cells that are still active are likely to be more achievable goals in the foreseeable future. Neither has been convincingly achieved as yet. However, several studies are underway using interventions such as oral insulin in people known to have markers of islet autoimmunity, trialling drugs already used, for example in psoriasis, to prolong beta cell life and the use of peptide immunotherapies to ‘retrain’ killer T cells, the lymphocytes that are closely involved in the underlying mechanism of type 1 diabetes. The International Diabetes Federation (IDF) is an umbrella organization of over 230 national diabetes associations in 170 countries and territories. It represents the interests of the growing number of people with diabetes and those at risk. The Federation has been leading the global diabetes community since 1950.

Diabetes mellitus refers to a group of diseases that affect how your body uses blood sugar (glucose). Glucose is vital to your health because it's an important source of energy for the cells that make up your muscles and tissues. It's also your brain's main source of fuel. The underlying cause of diabetes varies by type. But, no matter what type of diabetes you have, it can lead to excess sugar in your blood. Too much sugar in your blood can lead to serious health problems. Chronic diabetes conditions include type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. Potentially reversible diabetes conditions include prediabetes and gestational diabetes. Prediabetes occurs when your blood sugar levels are higher than normal, but not high enough to be classified as diabetes. And prediabetes is often the precursor of diabetes unless appropriate measures are taken to prevent progression. Gestational diabetes occurs during pregnancy but may resolve after the baby is delivered. Diabetes symptoms vary depending on how much your blood sugar is elevated. Some people, especially those with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes, may sometimes not experience symptoms. In type 1 diabetes, symptoms tend to come on quickly and be more severe. Some of the signs and symptoms of type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes are: Presence of ketones in the urine (ketones are a byproduct of the breakdown of muscle and fat that happens when there's not enough available insulin) Frequent infections, such as gums or skin infections and vaginal infections Type 1 diabetes can develop at any age, though it often appears during childhood or adolescence. Type 2 diabetes, the more common type, can develop at any age, though it's more common in people older than 40. If you suspect you or your child may have diabetes. If you notice any possible diabetes symptoms, contact your doctor. The earlier the condition is diagnosed, the sooner treatment can begin. After you receive your diagnosis, you'll need close medical follow-up until your blood sugar levels stabilize. To understand diabetes, first you must understand how glucose is normally processed in the body. Insulin is a hormone that comes from a gland situated behind and below the stomach (pancreas). The pancreas secretes insulin into the bloodstream. The insulin circulates, enabling sugar to enter your cells. Insulin lowers the amount of sugar in your bloodstream. As your blood sugar level drops, so does the secretion of insulin from your pancreas. Glucose — a sugar — is a source of energy for the cells that make up muscles and other tissues. Glucose comes from two major sources: food and your liver. Sugar is absorbed into the bloodstream, where it enters cells with the help of insulin. When your glucose levels are low, such as when you haven't eaten in a while, the liver breaks down stored glycogen into glucose to keep your glucose level within a normal range. The exact cause of type 1 diabetes is unknown. What is known is that your immune system — which normally fights harmful bacteria or viruses — attacks and destroys your insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. This leaves you with little or no insulin. Instead of being transported into your cells, sugar builds up in your bloodstream. Type 1 is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic susceptibility and environmental factors, though exactly what those factors are is still unclear. Weight is not believed to be a factor in type 1 diabetes. In prediabetes — which can lead to type 2 diabetes — and in type 2 diabetes, your cells become resistant to the action of insulin, and your pancreas is unable to make enough insulin to overcome this resistance. Instead of moving into your cells where it's needed for energy, sugar builds up in your bloodstream. Exactly why this happens is uncertain, although it's believed that genetic and environmental factors play a role in the development of type 2 diabetes too. Being overweight is strongly linked to the development of type 2 diabetes, but not everyone with type 2 is overweight. During pregnancy, the placenta produces hormones to sustain your pregnancy. These hormones make your cells more resistant to insulin. Normally, your pancreas responds by producing enough extra insulin to overcome this resistance. But sometimes your pancreas can't keep up. When this happens, too little glucose gets into your cells and too much stays in your blood, resulting in gestational diabetes. Diabetes and depression: Coping with the two conditions Risk factors for diabetes depend on the type of diabetes. Although the exact cause of type 1 diabetes is unknown, factors that may signal an increased risk include: Your risk increases if a parent or sibling has type 1 diabetes. Circumstances such as exposure to a viral illness likely play some role in type 1 diabetes. The presence of damaging immune system cells (autoantibodies). Sometimes family members of people with type 1 diabetes are tested for the presence of diabetes autoantibodies. If you have these autoantibodies, you have an increased risk of developing type 1 diabetes. But not everyone who has these autoantibodies develops diabetes. Certain countries, such as Finland and Sweden, have higher rates of type 1 diabetes. Researchers don't fully understand why some people develop prediabetes and type 2 diabetes and others don't. It's clear that certain factors increase the risk, however, including: The more fatty tissue you have, the more resistant your cells become to insulin. The less active you are, the greater your risk. Physical activity helps you control your weight, uses up glucose as energy and makes your cells more sensitive to insulin. Your risk increases if a parent or sibling has type 2 diabetes. Although it's unclear why, certain people — including Black, Hispanic, American Indian and Asian American people — are at higher risk. Your risk increases as you get older. This may be because you tend to exercise less, lose muscle mass and gain weight as you age. But type 2 diabetes is also increasing among children, adolescents and younger adults. If you developed gestational diabetes when you were pregnant, your risk of developing prediabetes and type 2 diabetes increases. If you gave birth to a baby weighing more than 9 pounds (4 kilograms), you're also at risk of type 2 diabetes. For women, having polycystic ovary syndrome — a common condition characterized by irregular menstrual periods, excess hair growth and obesity — increases the risk of diabetes. Having blood pressure over 140/90 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) is linked to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. If you have low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), or ""good,"" cholesterol, your risk of type 2 diabetes is higher. Triglycerides are another type of fat carried in the blood. People with high levels of triglycerides have an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Your doctor can let you know what your cholesterol and triglyceride levels are. Pregnant women can develop gestational diabetes. Some women are at greater risk than are others. Risk factors for gestational diabetes include: Women older than age 25 are at increased risk. Your risk increases if you have prediabetes — a precursor to type 2 diabetes — or if a close family member, such as a parent or sibling, has type 2 diabetes. You're also at greater risk if you had gestational diabetes during a previous pregnancy, if you delivered a very large baby or if you had an unexplained stillbirth. Being overweight before pregnancy increases your risk. For reasons that aren't clear, women who are Black, Hispanic, American Indian or Asian American are more likely to develop gestational diabetes. Long-term complications of diabetes develop gradually. The longer you have diabetes — and the less controlled your blood sugar — the higher the risk of complications. Eventually, diabetes complications may be disabling or even life-threatening. Possible complications include: Diabetes dramatically increases the risk of various cardiovascular problems, including coronary artery disease with chest pain (angina), heart attack, stroke and narrowing of arteries (atherosclerosis). If you have diabetes, you're more likely to have heart disease or stroke. Excess sugar can injure the walls of the tiny blood vessels (capillaries) that nourish your nerves, especially in your legs. This can cause tingling, numbness, burning or pain that usually begins at the tips of the toes or fingers and gradually spreads upward. Left untreated, you could lose all sense of feeling in the affected limbs. Damage to the nerves related to digestion can cause problems with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation. For men, it may lead to erectile dysfunction. The kidneys contain millions of tiny blood vessel clusters (glomeruli) that filter waste from your blood. Diabetes can damage this delicate filtering system. Severe damage can lead to kidney failure or irreversible end-stage kidney disease, which may require dialysis or a kidney transplant. Diabetes can damage the blood vessels of the retina (diabetic retinopathy), potentially leading to blindness. Diabetes also increases the risk of other serious vision conditions, such as cataracts and glaucoma. Nerve damage in the feet or poor blood flow to the feet increases the risk of various foot complications. Left untreated, cuts and blisters can develop serious infections, which often heal poorly. These infections may ultimately require toe, foot or leg amputation. Diabetes may leave you more susceptible to skin problems, including bacterial and fungal infections. Hearing problems are more common in people with diabetes. Type 2 diabetes may increase the risk of dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease. The poorer your blood sugar control, the greater the risk appears to be. Although there are theories as to how these disorders might be connected, none has yet been proved. Depression symptoms are common in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Depression can affect diabetes management. Most women who have gestational diabetes deliver healthy babies. However, untreated or uncontrolled blood sugar levels can cause problems for you and your baby. can occur as a result of gestational diabetes, including: Extra glucose can cross the placenta, which triggers your baby's pancreas to make extra insulin. This can cause your baby to grow too large (macrosomia). Very large babies are more likely to require a C-section birth. Sometimes babies of mothers with gestational diabetes develop low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) shortly after birth because their own insulin production is high. Prompt feedings and sometimes an intravenous glucose solution can return the baby's blood sugar level to normal. Babies of mothers who have gestational diabetes have a higher risk of developing obesity and type 2 diabetes later in life. Untreated gestational diabetes can result in a baby's death either before or shortly after birth. also can occur as a result of gestational diabetes, including: This condition is characterized by high blood pressure, excess protein in the urine, and swelling in the legs and feet. Preeclampsia can lead to serious or even life-threatening complications for both mother and baby. Once you've had gestational diabetes in one pregnancy, you're more likely to have it again with the next pregnancy. You're also more likely to develop diabetes — typically type 2 diabetes — as you get older. Type 1 diabetes can't be prevented. However, the same healthy lifestyle choices that help treat prediabetes, type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes can also help prevent them: Choose foods lower in fat and calories and higher in fiber. Focus on fruits, vegetables and whole grains. Strive for variety to prevent boredom. Aim for about 30 minutes of moderate aerobic activity on most days of the week, or at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity a week. If you're overweight, losing even 7% of your body weight — for example, 14 pounds (6.4 kilograms) if you weigh 200 pounds (90.7 kilograms) — can reduce the risk of diabetes. Don't try to lose weight during pregnancy, however. Talk to your doctor about how much weight is healthy for you to gain during pregnancy. To keep your weight in a healthy range, focus on permanent changes to your eating and exercise habits. Motivate yourself by remembering the benefits of losing weight, such as a healthier heart, more energy and improved self-esteem. Sometimes medication is an option as well. Oral diabetes drugs such as metformin (Glumetza, Fortamet, others) may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes — but healthy lifestyle choices remain essential. Have your blood sugar checked at least once a year to check that you haven't developed type 2 diabetes. Ferri FF. Diabetes mellitus. In: Ferri's Clinical Advisor 2018.

Diabetes refers to a group of diseases that can cause high levels of glucose (a type of sugar) in the blood. Diabetes develops when your pancreas can’t produce enough of the hormone insulin or your body becomes resistant to it. Symptoms of diabetes include feeling tired, hungry or excessively thirsty, and passing more urine than usual. Common diabetic conditions include type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, gestational diabetes and pre-diabetes. You can manage diabetes by taking medicines to manage your blood glucose levels, adopting a healthy diet and being physically active. Diabetes is a health condition in which your body has difficulty converting glucose (a type of sugar) into energy. This leads to high levels of sugar in the blood (). Your blood glucose levels are normally controlled by a called insulin, which converts glucose into energy. Diabetes occurs when your can’t produce insulin or when your body can’t make use of the insulin because it’s grown resistant to it. , occurs when a person’s own breaks down the cells in the pancreas that produce insulin. occurs when the body’s cells do not respond effectively to insulin or lose the ability to produce enough insulin in the pancreas. This causes glucose to stay in the blood, leading to a higher-than-normal level of glucose in the body. occurs when a woman experiences high blood glucose levels during . It usually goes away after the baby is born. Women who experience gestational diabetes have a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes in the future. is where blood glucose levels are higher than usual, but not high enough for a diagnosis of diabetes. unexplained weight loss (for type 1), or gradual weight gain (for type 2) Type 1 diabetes is usually spotted quickly, since symptoms can appear suddenly. Most people with type 1 diabetes are diagnosed before the age of 19. Many people with type 2 diabetes, however, don’t have symptoms at all or have signs that go unnoticed for a long time. — Use the diabetes and find out if you need to seek medical help.

There are different possible causes of diabetes according to type. Type 1 diabetes is an : your body’s immune system attacks the cells in your pancreas that produce insulin. The exact cause of this reaction is still unknown, but diet and lifestyle are not factors that determine who gets type 1 diabetes. Research suggests that both genetics and the environment may play a part. While having a increases your risk, most people with type 1 diabetes have no family history of the condition. Type 2 diabetes develops gradually over years as your body’s insulin becomes less effective at managing your blood glucose levels. As a result, your pancreas produces more and more insulin, and eventually the insulin producing cells wear out and become ineffective. Type 2 diabetes is a combination of low insulin and ineffective insulin. The risk of getting type 2 diabetes increases with certain lifestyle factors: being or overweight, especially — Use the to find out if your weight and waist size are in a healthy range. During pregnancy, certain hormones that provide nutrition for a growing baby reduce the effectiveness of the mother's own insulin. If the pancreas is unable to produce enough insulin in response, blood glucose levels rise and gestational diabetes develops. If your doctor suspects you have diabetes, you will be asked to have a to check your glucose levels. — testing your glucose levels after fasting for 8 hours. — this involves drinking a sugary drink (after fasting), then testing your glucose levels 1 to 2 hours later to assess the effect. — a blood test taken without fasting. — this test doesn’t require fasting as it doesn’t test glucose levels directly, but looks for a by-product in your that shows how your body manages glucose over time.

About Diabetes Diabetes is the epidemic of the 21st century and the biggest challenge confronting Australia’s health system Diabetes mellitus is a condition where blood sugars become elevated because the body is either unable to produce sufficient insulin or the body tissues becomes resistant to the effects of insulin. It is estimated that 280 Australians develop diabetes every day. Around 4,400 amputations are performed regularly at Australian hospitals each year and researchers believe that 85% of diabetes-related amputations are avoidable if correct care and prevention are observed. In the last trimester of pregnancy, approximately 7% of women have such high levels of glucose in their blood their body can't produce enough insulin to absorb it all. Known as gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), it can be dangerous for both mother and baby if not managed appropriately (NHS 2018).

Diabetes affects around 3.5 million people in the UK. It’s likely there are another 549,000 people who have the condition, but aren’t aware of it. Drinking alcohol can contribute to the conditions that cause diabetes. Diabetes types Symptoms of diabetes How alcohol can cause diabetes Diabetes facts Diabetes is a common, life-long condition that occurs when the pancreas doesn’t produce enough insulin, or the insulin it does produce doesn’t work properly. Insulin is a hormone that transfers glucose from the bloodstream into the cells to be used for energy. If you have diabetes, your body cannot make proper use of this glucose so it builds up in the blood instead of moving into your cells. The chances of developing diabetes may depend on a mix of your genes and your lifestyle. Drinking to excess, for example, can contribute to the conditions that cause diabetes. Diabetes is a manageable condition. But when it’s not well managed, it is associated with serious health complications including heart disease, stroke, blindness, kidney disease, nerve damage and amputations. Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes: what's the difference? There are two main types of diabetesType 1 diabetes develops if the body can’t produce enough insulin, because insulin-producing cells in the pancreas have been destroyed. It can happen: When a virus or infection triggers an autoimmune response (where the body starts attacking itself). People who have this type of diabetes are usually diagnosed before they’re 40 and there’s currently no way to prevent it. It’s the least common type of diabetes – only 10% of all cases are type 1. Type 2 diabetes. Develops when the body can still make some insulin, but not enough, or when the body becomes resistant to insulin. It can happen: When people are overweight and inactive. People who are an ‘apple-shape’ (with lots of fat around the abdomen) have a greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes People who have this type of diabetes are usually diagnosed when they’re over 40, and it’s more common in men. However, more overweight children and young people in the UK are being diagnosed with the condition. It is also particularly common among people of African-Caribbean, Asian and Hispanic origin. 90% of all adults with diabetes have type 2 diabetes. Being extremely tired, blurred vision and feeling more thirsty than usual are all symptoms associated with diabetes. Some additional signs of undiagnosed diabetes can include: Going to the toilet to urinate more often than usual, especially at night With type 1 diabetes, signs and symptoms are usually obvious and develop very quickly over a few weeks. Once the diabetes is treated and under control, symptoms will go away quickly. In type 2 diabetes, signs and symptoms may not be so obvious. The condition develops slowly over several years, and it might only be picked up in a routine medical check-up. As with type 1 diabetes, symptoms are quickly relieved once diabetes is treated and under control. Drinking alcohol can contribute to the conditions that cause diabetes There are three main ways drinking alcohol to excess can be a factor in causing diabetes: Heavy drinking can reduce the body’s sensitivity to insulin, which can trigger type 2 diabetes. Diabetes is a common side effect of chronic pancreatitis, which is overwhelmingly caused by heavy drinking. Alcoholic drinks often contain a lot of calories – For instance, one pint of lager can be equivalent to a slice of pizza. So drinking can also increase your chance of becoming overweight which raises your risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Teetotallers and heavy drinkers have an equal risks of developing diabetes According to a review of 15 previous studies (in 2005) into the link between Type 2 diabetes and alcohol, drinking 3 units/day reduces the risk of Type 2 diabetes by 40% for women and 13% for men. People who drink 6 units/day (for women), or 8 units/day (for men), are at greater risk of Type 2 diabetes than teetotallers. See if you're drinking too much with our self-assessment tool When someone has diabetes, more of the glucose in their body stays in their blood – it isn’t being used as fuel for energy. The body tries to reduce blood glucose levels by flushing the excess glucose out of the body into their urine. Patients on insulin treatment for diabetes can develop abnormally low blood sugar levels. This is known as hypoglycaemia. Symptoms of hypoglycaemia include: Hypoglycaemia's symptoms can be particularly dangerous when you’re drinking because people can mistakenly think that you’re drunk and may not realise you need urgent medical help. Drinking heavily can also increase the chances of developing hypoglycaemia because it prevents the liver from making glucose when you drink on an empty stomach. For example, the risk of hypoglycaemia would increase the morning after you’ve slept following heavy drinking. If you have nerve damage as a result of diabetes, drinking alcohol can make it worse and increase the pain, tingling, numbness and other symptoms. I have diabetes, is it still safe to drink alcohol? Doctors advise everyone, including diabetics, that they if they chose to drink, to keep health risks to a low level it’s important to stay within the UK Chief Medical Officers' (CMO)  and not regularly drink more than 14 units a week. After all, it's not just diabetes that you need to consider, the more you drink the greater your risk of developing a number of other short and long-term health issues such as , mental health, heart and liver problems.  It's also important, if you want to avoid developing diabetes, or already have it and want to manage it well, that you look after your general health by eating a healthy diet and taking regular exercise, to help control blood sugar levels.  You cannot catch diabetes. But you can control some of the risk factors that lead to the development of type 2 diabetes. Eating sweets and sugar does not cause diabetes. But eating a lot of sugary and fatty foods can lead to being overweight which in turn can result in the necessary conditions for becoming diabetic. Stress does not cause diabetes. Although it may make the symptoms worse in people who already have the condition. An accident or an illness will not cause diabetes. But it may reveal diabetes if it is already there. How can I reduce the risks to my health from alcohol? following the UK CMOs' advice and not regularly drinking more than 14 units a week is the best way to keep health risks from alcohol to a low level. If you do choose to drink it's important not to save up those units to drink all in one go and spread your drinking evenly over at least three days. A great way to cut down the overall amount you drink is to take more  throughout the week.   Use our free and simple  to track not only your units but the calories you're drinking, and how much you're spending on alcohol. Alcoholic drinks labels will have the abbreviation “ABV” which stands for Alcohol By Volume, or sometimes just the word “vol”. It shows the percentage of your drink that’s pure alcohol. This can vary a lot. For example, some ales are 3.5%, some stronger lagers can be as much as 6% ABV. This means that just one pint of strong lager can be more than three units of alcohol, so you need to .

Long-term, diabetes leads to severe health complications, including limb amputation, blindness, kidney and heart failure, cognitive dysfunction, and death. Caused by a lack of the hormone insulin necessary to convert sugars and starches into energy, diabetes is thought to have its roots in a combination of factors, including genetic predisposition, a sedentary lifestyle and obesity, certain medications like statins, and other medical conditions such as hypothyroidism or certain cancers. Type 1 diabetes, generally found in children and young adults, is a genetic disorder where the insulin producing cells of the pancreas have ceased functioning. In Type 2 diabetes, the body becomes insulin resistant or produces inadequate insulin. Found primarily in adults, 90% of patients have Type 2 diabetes. Gestational diabetes is found in 18% of pregnancies and is thought to be a result of insulin resistance produced by placental hormones blocking the action of the body’s insulin, leading to hyperglycemia. Type 1 diabetes is found in only 5% of total diabetes patients, and gestational diabetes accounts for another 5% of patients. Type 2 Diabetes: The Colluding Factors of Diet and Exercise The communications and travel technologies that enable people to work and communicate across vast distances have led directly to a sedentary lifestyle. Modern technology has spurred the evolution of medical science, leading to medications, treatments, and cures that have alleviated many catastrophic diseases. However, this technological advancement has come at a cost; people have decreased the amount of routine physical activity they engage in, and the foods they consume are highly processed and heavy in fats and sugars. For most people leisure is characterized by activities that involve visual consumption (TV) in conjunction with oral consumption (sodas, popcorn, pizza, and other high fat high sugar “snacks”). These diet and exercise patterns are leading to chronic health problems that are serious and costly, including an increasing incidence of Type 2 diabetes. The consumption of highly refined or processed sugar and high fructose corn syrup in particular, when coupled with a sedentary lifestyle, lead directly to obesity in both children and adults. Obesity is the single most significant . Prime culprits in the rising rate of obesity are the sugar-sweetened beverages of which Americans and others around the world are so fond of. It is well known that over-consumption of sodas, energy drinks, fruit drinks (excluding 100% fruit juice), and other sugar sweetened beverages (SSBs) leads to weight gain and tooth decay, but little attention has been paid among the lay population to their role in both causing and worsening Type 2 diabetes. You can click, to buy this Type 2 Diabetes medicine online at Canadian Pharmacy. Several recent studies have focused on the interrelationship between SSBs and Type 2 diabetes, finding that as the consumption of SSBs rises, the risk of Type 2 diabetes does as well. “Findings … show a clear link between SSB consumption and risk of … type 2 diabetes…. Participants in the highest category of SSB intake had a 26% greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes than participants in the lowest category of intake….Because SSBs have been shown to raise blood glucose and insulin concentrations rapidly and dramatically … and are often consumed in large amounts, they contribute to a high dietary glycemic load. High glycemic load diets are known to induce glucose intolerance and insulin resistance particularly among overweight individuals.” This number is greatly concerning, particularly as the consumption of SSBs has risen globally in the past 40 years: “in the United States, intake of these beverages, which includes the full range of soft drinks, fruit drinks, energy drinks, and vitamin water drinks, increased from 3.9% of calories in the late 1970s to 9.2% in 2001, representing a 3-fold increase in intake…. All age groups in Mexico consume ˜10% of their total energy intake from SSBs.” These statistics are alarming. When coupled with the numbers on childhood obesity, communities from doctors to parents are clearly facing a health crisis of daunting proportions. Obese children grow into obese adults, who often become diabetic adults, potentially overwhelming the health and social service provision systems. Without good education about the interrelationship between SSBs and other high sugar low nutrient foods and Type 2 diabetes, we could be witnessing the beginning of a global pandemic of staggering proportions. http://www.diabetes.org/diabetes-basics/gestational/what-is-gestational-diabetes.html, retrieved 2/19/2014. , retrieved 2/19/2014. care.diabetesjournals.org/content/33/11/2477.full, retrieved 2/19/2014. circ.ahajournals.org/content/121/11/1356.full, retrieved 2/19/2014.

Diabetes Symptoms to Be Aware Of + 6 Natural Ways to Control In the U.S., diabetes — or diabetes mellitus (DM) — is full-blown epidemic, and that’s not hyperbole. An estimated 29 million Americans have some form of diabetes, nearly 10 percent of the population, and even more alarming, the average American has a one in three chance of developing diabetes symptoms at some point in his or her lifetime. () The statistics are alarming, and they get even worse. Another 86 million people have , with up to 30 percent of them developing type 2 diabetes within five years. And perhaps the most concerning, about a third of people who have diabetes — approximately 8 million adults — are believed to be undiagnosed and unaware. That’s why it’s so vital to understand and recognize diabetes symptoms. And there’s actually good news. While there’s technically no known “cure” for diabetes — whether it’s type 1, type 2 or gestational diabetes — there’s plenty that can be done to help , control diabetes symptoms and prevent diabetes complications. Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder that results from problems controlling the hormone insulin. Diabetes symptoms are a result of higher-than-normal levels of (sugar) in your blood. With type 1 diabetes, symptoms usually develop sooner and at a younger age than with type 2 diabetes. Type 1 diabetes also normally causes more severe symptoms. In fact, because type 2 diabetes signs and symptoms can be minimal in some cases, it sometimes can go diagnosed for a long period of time, causing the problem to worsen and long-term damage to develop. While it’s still not entirely known how this happens, prolonged exposure to high blood sugar can damage nerve fibers that affect the blood vessels, heart, eyes, limbs and organs. In fact, hyperglycemia or is a telltale sign of diabetes (both type 1 and type 2) as well as prediabetes. When left untreated, diabetes can cause complications like an increased chance of , trouble getting pregnant or a risky pregnancy, vision loss, digestive issues, and more. While at least certain diabetes mellitus symptoms usually become obvious after some time, some people with type 2 diabetes have symptoms so mild that they go totally unnoticed. This is especially true among women with , the type that develops during pregnancy and usually only lasts for a short period of time. Women with gestational diabetes often have no noticeable symptoms at all, which is why it’s important for at-risk women to be tested and monitored in order to prevent complications and ensure a . () Common symptoms and signs of include: () changes in your appetite, usually feeling very hungry, sometimes even if you’ve recently eaten (this can also occur with weakness and trouble concentrating) fatigue, feeling  despite sleeping and mood swings slow healing of skin wounds, frequent infections, dryness, cuts and bruises unexplained weight changes, especially losing weight despite eating the same amount (this happens due to the body using alternative fuels stored in muscle and fat while releasing glucose in the urine) nerve damage that causes tingling sensations or pain and numbness in the limbs, feet and hands (more common among people with type 2 diabetes) Common diabetes symptoms associated with include: () Type 2 diabetes can cause all of the same symptoms described above, except they normally start later in life and are less severe. Many people develop type 2 diabetes symptoms in midlife or in older age and gradually develop symptoms in stages, especially if the condition goes untreated and worsens. Besides the symptoms mentioned above, other type 2 diabetes symptoms or signs can include: patches of dark, velvety skin in the folds and creases of the body (usually in the armpits and neck). This is called . frequent infections (urinary, vaginal, yeast and of the groin) pain, swelling, numbness or tingling of the hands and feet sexual dysfunction, including loss of libido, reproductive problems, and erectile dysfunction While diabetes itself often causes the symptoms described above, it’s also possible to experience many complications from diabetes that cause other, usually more drastic and harmful symptoms. This is why early detection and treatment of diabetes is so important — it can greatly decrease the risk of developing complications like nerve damage, cardiovascular problems, skin infections, further weight gain/inflammation and more. A 2018 Swedish study published in The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology highlighted that there are five different groups of patients with significantly different disease progression characteristics and risk of diabetic complications. The data-driven cluster analysis, which studied newly diagnosed diabetes patients, revealed that the group most resistant to insulin had a remarkably higher risk of diabetic kidney disease. Those who were grouped as “insulin deficient” had the highest risks of retinotherapy (diabetic eye disease). The groups classified in this study were compared to the characteristics and risk of diabetic complications in traditional type 2 diabetes patients. This revelation represents the first step in creating tailored medicine for diabetes patients. () How likely are you to experience complications? Several factors influence whether you will develop worsened symptoms or complications due to diabetes, including: how well you control blood  levels, including potentially becoming hyperglycemic (having abnormally high blood sugar) your lifestyle, including your diet, exercise routine, stress levels and sleep The Diabetes Prevention Program conducted a randomized clinical trial over three years and found that diabetes incidence in high-risk adults was reduced by 58 percent after they followed intensive lifestyle intervention compared to 31 percent after taking medication (). Both were significantly more impactful at preventing complications compared with taking a placebo or not making lifestyle changes. And the positive changes lasted at least 10 years after the study was done! () A full half of all people with diabetes will develop some form of nerve damage, especially if it goes uncontrolled for many years and blood glucose levels remain abnormal. There are several different types of nerve damage caused by diabetes that can cause various symptoms: (which affects the feet and hands), (which affects organs like the bladder, intestinal tract and genitals), and several other forms that cause damage to the spine, joints, , eyes and blood vessels. () Signs of nerve damage caused by diabetes can include: tingling in the feet, described as “pins and needles” burning, stabbing or shooting pains in my feet and hands erectile dysfunction, vaginal dryness and loss of orgasms caused by nerve damage around the genitals changes in the senses, including hearing, sight, taste and smell trouble with normal digestion, including frequent , constipation, diarrhea, heartburn, nausea, vomiting One of the areas affected most and quickest by diabetes is the skin. Diabetes symptoms on the skin can be some of the most easy to recognize and earliest to show up. Some of the ways that diabetes affects the skin is by causing poor circulation, slow wound healing, lowered immune function, and itching or dryness. () This makes yeast infections, bacterial infections and other skin rashes more easy to develop and harder to get rid of. rashes/infections that are sometimes itchy, hot, swollen, red and painful bacterial infections (including  and  bacteria, also called staph) fungal infections (including that affect the digestive tract and fungus in skin folds, such as around the nails, under the breasts, between fingers or toes, in the mouth, and around the genitals) Having diabetes is one of the biggest risk factors for developing eye problems and even vision loss/blindness. People with diabetes have a higher risk of blindness than people without diabetes, but most only develop minor problems that can be treated before they worsen. Diabetes affects the outer, tough membrane part of the eyes; the front part, which is clear and curved; the cornea/retina, which focus light; and the macula. According to the National Diabetes Association, almost everyone with  eventually has nonproliferative retinopathy, and most people with  also get it. () Symptoms of diabetes related to vision/eye health can include: (a term for all disorders of the retina caused by diabetes, including nonproliferative and proliferative retinopathy) One of the areas of the eyes most impacted by diabetes is the macula, which is specialized for seeing fine details and allowing us to see with sharp vision. Problems with blood flow making its way from the retina to the macula leads to glaucoma, which is 40 percent more likely to occur in people with diabetes than in healthy people. Risk for glaucoma goes up the longer someone has had diabetes and also the older a person becomes. Similarly, adults with diabetes are also two to five times more likely than those without diabetes to develop cataracts. Cataracts forms when the eye’s clear lens becomes cloudy, which blocks normal light from entering. Due to poor blood flow and nerve damage, diabetics are also more likely to develop cataracts at a younger age and have them progress faster. With the different types of retinopathy, small blood vessels () in the back of the eye balloon and form pouches, which blocks normal blood flow. This can develop in stages and worsen until vision loss is possible when the capillary walls lose their ability to control the passage of substances between the blood and the retina. Fluid and blood can leak into parts of the eyes, block vision, cause scar tissue to form, and distort or pull the retina out of its normal alignment, which impairs vision. Meanwhile,  a serious complication of diabetes called  occurs when your body produces high levels of ketones (or blood acids). This condition occurs when your body can’t produce enough insulin. Diabetes is a serious condition that comes with many risks and symptoms, but the good news is it can be managed with correct treatment and lifestyle changes. A high percentage of people with type 2 diabetes are able to reverse and manage their diabetes symptoms completely naturally by improving their diets, levels of physical activity, sleep and stress levels. And although type 1 diabetes is harder to treat and manage, complications can also be reduced by taking the same steps. One of the best things to do to prevent diabetes symptoms from worsening is to educate yourself about how diabetes forms and worsens, plus about that can help you find relief. With diabetes care, studies have found that interventions, such as nurse-led talks, having a home aid, diabetes education, pharmacy-led interventions, and education on dosing and frequency of medications, can help improve quality of life in people with diabetes. So while most people with diabetes on medicine as part of diabetes care, here are some invaluable natural ways to treat diabetes. Many people with complications of diabetes won’t have noticeable symptoms (for example, nonproliferative retinopathy, which can cause vision loss or gestational diabetes during pregnancy). This makes it really important that you get checked out by your doctor regularly to monitor your blood sugar levels, progression, eyes, skin, blood pressure levels, weight and heart. To make sure you don’t put yourself at a higher risk for heart problems, work with your doctor to make sure you maintain near normal blood pressure, and triglyceride (lipid) levels. Ideally, your blood pressure shouldn’t go over 130/80. You should also try to maintain a healthy weight and reduce inflammation in general. The best way to do this is to eat an unprocessed, healthy diet as well as exercise and sleep well. As part of a healthy , you can help keep your blood sugar in the normal range by eating unprocessed, whole foods and avoiding things like added sugars, , processed grains and starches, and conventional dairy products. Physical inactivity and obesity are strongly associated with the development of type 2 diabetes, which is why exercise is important to control symptoms and lower the risk for complications, such as heart disease. The National Institute of Health states that people can sharply lower their risk for diabetes by losing weight through regular physical activity and a diet low in sugar, refined fats and excess calories from . () The keto diet, for example, fits the bill for these requirements and will result in less insulin secretion. The best way to help prevent or delay nerve damage is to closely regulate your blood sugar levels. If you suffer from digestive issues due to nerve damage affects your digestive organs, you can benefit from taking , and supplements like magnesium that can help relax muscles, improve gut health and control symptoms. Other problems like , sexual dysfunctions and trouble sleeping also will be greatly reduced when you improve your diet, nutrient intake, stress levels and condition overall. People with diabetes tend to have more bacterial, fungal and yeast infections than healthy people do. If you have diabetes, you can help prevent skin problems by managing your blood sugar levels, practicing good hygiene and treating skin naturally with things like . Doctors also recommend you limit how often you bathe when your skin is dry, use natural and mild products to clean your skin (instead of many harsh, chemical products sold in most stores), moisturize daily with something mild like , and avoid burning your skin in the sun. People who keep their blood sugar levels closer to normal are less likely to have vision-related problems or at least more likely to experience milder symptoms. Early detection and appropriate follow-up care can save your vision. To help lower the risk for eye-related problems like mild cataracts or glaucoma, you should have your eyes checked at least one to two times yearly. Staying physically active and maintaining a healthy diet can prevent or delay vision loss by controlling blood sugar, plus you should also wear sunglasses when in the sun. If your eyes become more damaged over time, your doctor might also recommend you receive a lens transplant to preserve vision. In mice, researchers have been able to reverse some symptoms of diabetes and restore pancreas functions by putting them on a version of the . () This is a diet that involves severe caloric restriction for five days out of the month. It follows the same principle as fasting by temporarily depriving the body of food to take advantage of health benefits like increased fat burning and reduced inflammation. However, because the study only involved mice as well as human cells in lab conditions, the researchers do not recommend trying this at home to treat diabetes. In a human study published in , simply skipping breakfast (and not eating til noon each day) did show a long-term influence of breakfast on glucose regulation that persists throughout the day. Ultimately, breakfast consumption was seen to be be a successful strategy for the reduction of postprandial hyperglycemia (blood sugar levels after eating) in type 2 diabetes. () A 2018 report concluded medically-supervised fasting may eliminate the need for insulin in some patients with type 2 diabetes. () Participants fasted for 24 hours three days a week for several months. On fasting days, they ate dinner. On non-fasting days, they ate lunch and dinner. Low-carb meals were advised throughout. The study was small, with just three participants, but it found all three participants were able to discontinue insulin within five to 18 days. Two ended up stopping all diabetes medications. While these results are promising, any changes in nutrition should be medically-supervised — and not attempted alone. It’s estimated by the American Diabetes Association that 30.3 million Americans have one of three forms of diabetes (type 1, type 2 or gestational). This equals about 9.4 percent of the population or about one in every 11 people. () Within his or her lifetime, an American has a one in three chance of developing diabetes at some point. Another 86 million people have prediabetes (when blood glucose levels or A1C levels — from the a1c test — are higher than normal but not high enough to be diagnosed as diabetes). Without intervention, up to 30 percent of people with prediabetes develop type 2 diabetes within five years. Almost one third of people with diabetes (around 7.2 million, according to the American Diabetes Association) are believed to be undiagnosed and unaware. Type 2 diabetes is the leading cause of diabetes-related complications, such as blindness, non-traumatic amputations and chronic kidney failure. In fact, diabetes is the leading cause of kidney disease, and it’s called diabetic kidney disease. It also raises the risk for heart disease, stroke and reproductive/fertility problems. Gestational diabetes (the type triggered by pregnancy and hormonal changes) affects about 4 percent of all pregnant women, especially Hispanic, African-American, Native American and Asian women, along with those who are over 25 years old, above their normal body weight before pregnancy and who have a family history of diabetes. () People with diabetes have a 50 percent higher risk for death than people without diabetes within a given time frame. Medical costs for people with diabetes is on average twice as much as for those without. People develop diabetes when they stop releasing or responding to normal amounts of insulin in response to consuming foods with carbohydrates, sugar and fats. In healthy people, the pancreas releases insulin to help with the use and storage of sugar (glucose) and fats, but people with diabetes either produce too little insulin or fail to respond appropriately to normal amounts of insulin — ultimately causing high blood sugar. is a crucial hormone because it allows macronutrients to be properly broken down and transported to cells to be used for “fuel” (or energy). We need insulin to carry glucose through the bloodstream to cells in order to provide enough energy for muscle growth and development, brain activity, and so on. Insulin lowers the amount of sugar in your bloodstream, so as blood sugar levels drop, normally so does secretion of insulin from the pancreas. Type 1 diabetes (also called “juvenile”/young diabetes) is different than type 2 diabetes because it occurs when insulin-producing cells of the pancreas get destroyed by the immune system, therefore no insulin is produced and blood sugar levels go unmanaged. Type 1 diabetes tends to develop at a younger age, usually before someone turns 20 years old. () In fact, something called latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) is a disorder where the progression of autoimmune β-cell failure is slow. LADA patients usually do not require insulin, at least during the first 6 months after a diabetes diagnosis. () With type 2 diabetes, insulin is produced but it’s either not enough or the person doesn’t respond to it appropriately (called ““). Type 2 diabetes usually occurs in people over age 40 (although it’s becoming more prevalent in children), especially those who are overweight. Insulin is what regulates glucose levels in the blood, and it’s normally tightly controlled by the pancreas, which responds to how much glucose is detected in the blood at any one time. This system fails when someone has diabetes, causing various symptoms to emerge that can affect nearly every system in the body. With diabetes, signs of blood sugar fluctuations often include changes in your appetite, weight, energy, sleep, digestion and more. The underlying causes of diabetes are multifaceted. The disease can develop due to a combination of factors, including a poor diet, high levels of , being overweight, a sedentary lifestyle, genetic susceptibility, high amounts of stress, and exposure to toxins, viruses and harmful chemicals. One’s genetics contribute to the risk of developing type 1 diabetes, apparently specifically increased by certain variants of the HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQB1 and HLA-DRB1 genes. () The risk for type 2 diabetes goes up substantially when someone has the following characteristics: () family history of diabetes (especially parent or sibling) family background that is African-American, Alaska Native, American Indian, Asian-American, Hispanic/Latino or Pacific Islander American history of heart disease, high blood pressure (140/90 or above), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol below 35 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) or triglyceride level above 250 mg/dL hormonal imbalances, including With type 1 diabetes, symptoms usually develop sooner and at a younger age than with type 2 diabetes. Type 1 diabetes also normally causes more severe symptoms. In fact, because type 2 diabetes signs and symptoms can be minimal in some cases, it sometimes can go diagnosed for a long period of time, causing the problem to worsen and long-term damage to develop. While diabetes itself often causes the symptoms described above, it’s also possible to experience many complications from diabetes that cause other, usually more drastic and harmful symptoms. This is why early detection and treatment of diabetes is so important — it can greatly decrease the risk of developing complications like nerve damage, cardiovascular problems, skin infections, further weight gain/inflammation and more. One of the areas affected most and quickest by diabetes is the skin. Diabetes symptoms on the skin can be some of the most easy to recognize and earliest to show up.

ea4a0440-113d-498a-8f86-5b56088f4a08,"Medically reviewed by — — When you hear the word “diabetes,” your first thought is likely about high blood sugar. Blood sugar is an often-underestimated component of your health. When it’s out of whack over a long period of time, it could develop into diabetes. Diabetes affects your body’s ability to produce or use , a hormone that allows your body to turn glucose (sugar) into energy. Here’s what symptoms may occur to your body when diabetes takes effect. Diabetes can be effectively managed when caught early. However, when left untreated, it can lead to potential complications that include , , , and . Normally after you eat or drink, your body will break down sugars from your food and use them for energy in your cells. To accomplish this, your pancreas needs to produce a hormone called insulin. Insulin is what facilitates the process of pulling sugar from the blood and putting it in the cells for use, or energy. If you have diabetes, your pancreas either produces too little insulin or none at all. The insulin can’t be used effectively. This allows blood glucose levels to rise while the rest of your cells are deprived of much-needed energy. This can lead to a wide variety of problems affecting nearly every major body system. The effects of diabetes on your body also depends on the type you have. There are two main types of diabetes: and . , also called juvenile diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes, is an immune system disorder. Your own immune system attacks the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas, destroying your body’s ability to make insulin. With type 1 diabetes, you must take insulin to live. Most people are diagnosed as a child or young adult. is related to . It used to occur in older populations, but now more and more younger populations are being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. This is a result of poor lifestyle, dietary, and exercise habits. With type 2 diabetes, your pancreas stops using insulin effectively. This causes issues with being able to pull sugar from the blood and put it into the cells for energy. Eventually, this can lead to the need for insulin medication. Earlier phases like may be effectively managed with diet, exercise, and careful monitoring of blood sugars. This can also prevent the full development of type 2 diabetes. Diabetes can be controlled. In some cases it can even go into remission if proper lifestyle changes are made. is high blood sugar that develops during pregnancy. Most of the time, you can control gestational diabetes through diet and exercise. It also typically resolves after the baby is delivered. Gestational diabetes can increase your risk for complications during pregnancy. It can also increase risk of type 2 diabetes development later in life for both mother and child. If your pancreas produces little or no insulin — or if your body can’t use it — alternate hormones are used to turn fat into energy. This can create high levels of toxic chemicals, including acids and ketone bodies, which may lead to a condition called . This is a serious complication of the disease. Symptoms include , excessive urination, and . Your breath may have a sweet scent that’s caused by the elevated levels of ketone bodies in the blood. High blood sugar levels and excess ketones in your urine can confirm diabetic ketoacidosis. If untreated, this condition can lead to loss of consciousness or even death. (HHS) occurs in type 2 diabetes. It involves very high blood glucose levels but no ketones. You might become dehydrated with this condition. You may even lose consciousness. HHS is most common in people whose diabetes is undiagnosed or who haven’t been able to control their diabetes. It can also be caused by a heart attack, stroke, or infection. High blood glucose levels may cause — when it’s hard for your stomach to completely empty. This delay can cause blood glucose levels to rise. As a result, you may also experience , , bloating, and . Diabetes can also damage your kidneys and affect their ability to filter waste products from your blood. If your doctor detects , or elevated amounts of protein in your urine, it could be a sign that your kidneys aren’t functioning properly. Kidney disease related to diabetes is called . This condition doesn’t show symptoms until its later stages. If you have diabetes, your doctor will evaluate you for nephropathy to help prevent irreversible kidney damage or . Diabetes raises your risk of developing , which puts further strain on your heart. When you have high blood glucose levels, this can contribute to the formation of fatty deposits in blood vessel walls. Over time, it can restrict blood flow and increase the risk of , or hardening of the blood vessels. According to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, diabetes doubles your risk of heart disease and stroke. In addition to monitoring and controlling your blood glucose, good eating habits and regular exercise can help lower the risk of high blood pressure and . You should also consider quitting smoking if you’re at risk for diabetes. Diabetes and smoking are a very bad mix. It increases your risk for cardiovascular problems and restricted blood flow. Lack of blood flow can eventually affect your hands and feet and cause pain while you’re walking. This is called . The narrowed blood vessels in your legs and feet may also cause problems in those areas. For example, your feet may feel cold or you may be unable to feel heat due to lack of sensation. This condition is known as , which is a type of diabetic neuropathy that causes decreased sensation in the extremities. It’s particularly dangerous because it may prevent you from noticing an injury or infection. Diabetes also increases your risk of developing infections or ulcers of the . Poor blood flow and nerve damage increases the likelihood of having a foot or leg amputated. If you have diabetes, it’s critical that you take good care of your feet and inspect them often. , the largest organ of your body. Along with dehydration, your body’s lack of moisture due to high blood sugar can cause the skin on your feet to dry and crack. It’s important to completely dry your feet after bathing or swimming. You can use petroleum jelly or gentle creams, but avoid letting these areas become too moist. Moist, warm folds in the skin are susceptible to fungal, bacterial, or yeast infections.

An Expert Debunks the Myth Once and for All There are a lot of factors at play with Type 2 diabetes diagnoses. If you've ever been anywhere near a dessert table, you've probably heard a joke about . Whether it's someone avoiding an overly frosted cake or trying to assuage their guilt for eating a piece of candy, there's a pervasive idea that if you eat too many sweets, you'll develop Type 2 diabetes. But in reality, there are many factors that contribute to the disease—and you're not going to develop it just because you decided to eat a cupcake or a scoop of ice cream. In addition to the fact that added is only one piece of the puzzle, the idea that sugar alone is responsible for diabetes diagnoses can contribute to fatphobia and biased thinking. Telling people with diabetes that they ""did this to themselves"" isn't helpful, and it oversimplifies the many factors that are associated with the condition. To get to the bottom of what really causes diabetes, we asked Billie Karel, MPH, RD, LDN, CDE with in Raleigh, NC, to shed some light on some around diabetes. ""Type 2 diabetes is a complex disease that looks a little different for each person who has it,"" says Karel. ""It arises from a somewhat different combination of factors for each individual, it can behave a little differently, and it will take somewhat different combinations of medications and lifestyle modifications to manage."" According to the , some of the factors that can contribute to your risk of developing diabetes include: ""Genetics contribute a huge amount to someone's risk for Type 2 diabetes, but the exact amount probably varies between individuals,"" Karel says. Other factors Karel lists as being associated with a higher risk for Type 2 diabetes include: Insulin resistance can lead to elevated blood sugar levels, which could, in turn, lead to a Type 2 diagnosis. It's not just added sugars that are to blame, though—the type of carbs you eat can affect blood sugar, too. ""People may think that added sugar (or any sugar) causes Type 2 diabetes, and therefore that people who have Type 2 diabetes must have caused the condition themselves by eating too much sugar. It's just not that simple,"" says Karel. ""While a diet high in added sugars may increase the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes, many people who consume added sugars regularly never do, and others who eat comparatively little sugar do still develop Type 2 diabetes."" ""Insulin resistance is the key mechanism that leads to blood sugar elevation and development of Type 2 diabetes. It means that the body's muscles and other working tissues get less sensitive (or more resistant) to the insulin that the pancreas makes,"" Karel says. ""For a while, the pancreas keeps up by making extra insulin, so the blood sugar remains normal (though other things can start to change—for many, increasing insulin can cause elevated blood lipids and weight gain even before it affects blood sugar). When someone's pancreas isn't able to keep up anymore, their blood sugar will begin to rise, and that's what triggers a diagnosis with Type 2 diabetes."" And in terms of blood sugar, the added sugars found in candy or desserts aren't the only thing to worry about. As the , , such as white bread, can affect blood sugar levels, too. If you've been diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes or prediabetes, make sure your diet is rich in foods with a , like whole grains, rather than white bread. No-sugar-added recipes you'll actually look forward to eating. Blaming someone with Type 2 diabetes for their dietary habits isn't helpful for treating the condition, and it's also not the whole story. ""Added sugar is only one relatively small piece of the puzzle of what makes up a 'high-quality diet,' and poor dietary quality is only one of many risk factors for Type 2 diabetes,"" says Karel. She lists factors like and stress as examples of reasons people might undereat (and later overeat), which can affect blood sugar levels, too. Karel also says that socioeconomic factors play a part in diabetes risk factors, and health more generally. ""Even while having enough food, people may not be able to get a wide enough variety to support balanced nutrition if they don't have transportation to the nearest grocery store selling perishable foods like fruit, vegetables, meats, and dairy products, or if that grocery store doesn't sell many of those foods at prices they can afford,"" she says. ""This is especially challenging for folks in rural areas or those who don't have reliable transportation to get themselves to the store and then get their groceries back home."" There's no one factor that determines someone's risk for Type 2 diabetes, and it's definitely not as simple as ""eating too much sugar."" Of course, eating a balanced diet is an essential part of managing diabetes and other health conditions, but when it comes to , there are plenty of other factors at play.

This condition typically doesn’t trigger any noticeable symptoms. So, it’s important your doctor regularly checks your .

Some people with insulin resistance may also develop a skin condition known as . It appears as often on the backs of the neck, groin, and armpits. Some experts believe a may cause acanthosis nigricans. There’s no cure for this condition. But if another condition causes it, treatment may help natural skin color to return. If you have prediabetes, it’s important to work with you doctor. They will routinely monitor your blood sugar or HgbA1c so they can recognize whether you’ve developed diabetes. If you don’t have obvious symptoms, you doctor can usually detect insulin resistance, prediabetes, or diabetes with a blood draw. One way to diagnose prediabetes or diabetes is with an . This test measures your average blood sugar over the previous two to three months. An A1C between 5.7 and 6.4 percent is diagnostic for prediabetes. An A1C equal to or above 6.5 percent is diagnostic for diabetes. Your doctor may want to reconfirm the test results later. However, depending on the lab where you have your blood drawn, these numbers could vary by 0.1 to 0.2 percent. A fasting will show your fasting blood sugar level. You’d have this test done after not eating or drinking for at least eight hours. A high level may require a second test a few days later to confirm the reading. If both tests show elevated levels of blood glucose, your doctor may diagnose you with prediabetes or diabetes. Fasting blood sugar levels under 100 milligrams/deciliter (mg/dL) are considered normal. Levels between 100 and 125 mg/dL indicate prediabetes. Levels equal to or greater than 126 mg/dL are diagnostic for diabetes. Depending on the lab, these numbers could vary up to 3 mg/dL points in the cutoff numbers. According to the ADA, a two-hour may be another way to diagnose prediabetes or diabetes. Your blood glucose level will be determined before this test begins. You’ll then receive a premeasured sugary drink and your blood glucose level is checked again in two hours. A blood sugar level after two hours of less than 140 mg/dL is considered normal. A result between 140 mg/dL and 199 mg/dL is considered prediabetes. A blood sugar level of 200mg/dL or higher is considered diabetes. Random blood sugar tests are useful if you’re experiencing significant diabetes symptoms. However, the ADA random blood glucose tests for routine diabetes screening or for identifying prediabetes. Testing for diabetes should begin at about age 40, along with the usual tests for and other markers of health. Ideally, your doctor will test you at your annual physical exam or preventive screening. Your doctor may recommend testing at a younger age if you: have a low good cholesterol (HDL) level or high triglyceride levels are American Indian, African-American, Latino, Asian-American, or Pacific Islander were diagnosed with (a temporary condition that causes diabetes only while pregnant) Children and teens ages 10 to 18 may also benefit from diabetes screening if they are overweight and have two or more of the above risk factors for diabetes.

99c3ee8f-d88d-4f87-8649-90d07b3f1a39,"Failure of early detection costs $700 million per year Failure of early detection costs $700 million per year Friday, 14 September 2018 Diabetes Australia has warned that failure to implement a comprehensive national type 2 diabetes early detection program could be costing the Australian health system more than $700 million each year. Diabetes Australia is calling for emergency departments and GP clinics across Australia to conduct more routine screening in a bid to diagnose up to 500,000 Australians who may currently have silent, undiagnosed type 2 diabetes. People can have type 2 diabetes for up to seven years before it is diagnosed and in that time many people will begin to develop debilitating complications including heart attacks and strokes, eye damage and blindness, foot ulcers and limb amputation, and kidney damage. In many cases, complications can be prevented with early detection and optimal treatment. New figures were released today at Blacktown Hospital, one of Australia’s diabetes hotspots, where an innovative diabetes screening program has found that about half of people being screened in the emergency department and other settings are found to have either prediabetes or type 2 diabetes – much worse than experts previously believed. Today marks the start of National Diabetes Week (8 July – 14 July) and the launch of a new Diabetes Australia’s ‘It’s About Time’ campaign. Diabetes Australia CEO Professor Greg Johnson urged Governments to take action now to ensure the earlier detection of type 2 diabetes – before people develop complications. “International evidence has found that early detection and optimal treatment could save as much as $1,415 per person per year,” Diabetes Australia CEO Professor Greg Johnson said. “With an estimated 500,000 Australians having silent, undiagnosed type 2 diabetes that could translate to savings of more than $700 million for the Australian health system each year. “Early detection and early treatment is likely to provide lasting health benefits to people with type 2 diabetes. “Systematic early detection of type 2 diabetes is inexpensive and can be rolled out easily. It’s about time we did so. “We are calling for the HbA1c test to be incorporated with other blood tests in emergency departments and other times when doctors are ordering a range of blood tests. An HbA1c blood test measures long-term blood glucose levels and is used for the detection and subsequent monitoring of diabetes.” The innovative approach at Blacktown Hospital where Dr Glen Maberly has led the way in early detection of previously undiagnosed, silent type 2 diabetes is a great example of what is possible, at low cost. “We knew the diabetes problem in Western Sydney was serious, but our proactive detection has revealed it is much worse than we first thought,” Dr Maberly said. Dr Maberly’s team initially coordinated the detection of patients presenting to Emergency Departments (EDs) at Blacktown and Mt Druitt hospitals. Under the program, patients presenting for other conditions and who needed blood tests, were also checked for type 2 diabetes using the HbA1c blood test. Of the 48,000 patients checked in EDs, 30 per cent were likely to have pre-diabetes, while 17 per cent were likely to have type 2 diabetes. In the second phase, supported by Western Sydney Primary Health Network (PHN), 11 GPs across western Sydney did diabetes tests on patients who were having blood tests for other problems. “The results from the GP checks for type 2 diabetes were alarming. Of the nearly 6,000 people tested, 26 per cent were found to have pre-diabetes, while 17 per cent were likely to have type 2 diabetes,” Professor Maberly said. Diabetes NSW & ACT CEO Sturt Eastwood said early diagnosis is critical to reducing the likelihood and impact of diabetes-related complications. “People can live with type 2 diabetes for up to seven years before being diagnosed and in that time life-threatening health problems can develop,” Mr Eastwood said. “The earlier people are diagnosed, the earlier they can get the right treatment, which will reduce their risk of developing diabetes-related complications including limb amputation, blindness, kidney failure and heart disease. “It’s about reducing the time people have undiagnosed, silent type 2 diabetes.” For more information, including campaign videos and other sources please visit New research finds ways to identify people with pre-diabetes most at risk of developing type 2 diabetes All types of diabetes have been found to increase the risk of falls A test which measures glucose levels in earwax could be used to detect type 2 diabetes Join our community of over 45,000 people living with diabetes Copyright ©2021 Diabetes NSW & ACT.

ff81e84f-4459-4284-bdd5-b5d3d4a8b4bf,"Tuesday, 14 November 2017 Health experts today warned of the alarming increase in gestational diabetes which in the past 12 months has affected 38,000 Australian women during pregnancy. “In the last ten years, more than 200,000 women have developed gestational diabetes. Latest projections show that over the next decade more than 500,000 women could develop gestational diabetes during pregnancy,” said Professor Greg Johnson, CEO of Diabetes Australia. Today (14 November) is World Diabetes Day and Diabetes Australia has warned that gestational diabetes is now the fastest growing type of diabetes in Australia. “Importantly, gestational diabetes poses a dual threat – firstly without appropriate management and care, it can be a serious risk to mother and baby during the pregnancy, and secondly it poses a serious future risk for both mother and baby developing type 2 diabetes and other health issues,” he said. “After gestational diabetes, women are at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes and children born to mothers who have gestational diabetes are also at an increased risk of being overweight or obese, or developing type 2 diabetes later in life.” “The alarming increase in number of women developing gestational diabetes presents an intergenerational diabetes issue and threatens to make the type 2 diabetes epidemic even bigger in future.” “Our latest projections suggest that gestational diabetes could trigger over 250,000 women to develop type 2 diabetes or prediabetes in the coming decade.” “Developing gestational diabetes is one of the biggest risk factors for type 2 diabetes and we need to ensure Australian mums and families get the support they need after gestational diabetes to reduce their risk of type 2 diabetes. We need to break this intergenerational cycle of diabetes.” A/Professor Alison Nankervis, an Endocrinologist at the Royal Melbourne and Royal Women’s Hospital said the short term complications for mother and baby can be serious, but the risk of complications can be reduced with good treatment and care. “Gestational diabetes is a form of diabetes that occurs during pregnancy and usually goes away after the baby is born. The abnormal blood glucose levels can affect both the mother and baby,” A/Professor Nankervis said. “The condition makes pregnancy higher risk for both. Babies born to mothers with gestational diabetes are more likely to be born prematurely or via C-section, be larger babies, have shoulder dystocia and a range of other complications.” “Women with gestational diabetes may need intensive glucose management to avoid serious problems. But with the best possible management and care, the risks can be reduced and women can avoid complications.” A/ Prof Nankervis said growth in gestational diabetes was already putting pressure on health services with the number of women with the condition doubling at the Royal Women’s Hospital since 2014. “There are a number of factors contributing to the growing rates of gestational diabetes including the age women are falling pregnant, the changing ethnic makeup of Australia’s society, and the weight of women when they fall pregnant. The growth of gestational diabetes has been exacerbated by recent lowering of the diagnostic threshold,” she said. Professor Johnson said diabetes in pregnancy was a major priority in the Australian National Diabetes Strategy 2016-20 but there was still no clarity on the implementation plans from the Australian Government and the State and Territory Governments. “New approaches are needed for pre-pregnancy, during pregnancy, and after pregnancy,” said Professor Johnson. “There needs to be help for women to be a healthy weight before pregnancy. We need to improve access to diabetes education and support for women with gestational diabetes during pregnancy as well as ensuring they are getting the care and support they need after the birth.” “This includes seeing their GP for follow up testing to detect type 2 diabetes or prediabetes, and access to type 2 diabetes prevention programs and health professionals including diabetes educators, dietitians and exercise physiologists who can help with lifestyle management to reduce their risk of type 2 diabetes.” “Sitting back and doing nothing is not an option. This is an avalanche that will bury the health system if we don’t act,” he said.

Eminent experts in diabetes gathered at a satellite symposium hosted by The Institute for Scientific Information on Coffee (ISIC) at the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) 2018 Annual Meeting in Berlin, Germany, to discuss the latest research on coffee consumption and type 2 diabetes. During the symposium, Associate Professor Mattias Carlström reviewed the latest scientific research on the association between coffee consumption and type 2 diabetes risk; including his own meta-analysis of the data entitled ‘Coffee consumption and reduced risk of developing type 2 diabetes’ which looked at 30 prospective studies, with a total of 1,185,210 participants. Professor Kjeld Hermansen explored the potential mechanistic perspectives behind the inverse association between coffee consumption and T2D, presenting a summary of the research that has been undertaken in this area. The research suggests that a number of factors may be involved including an antioxidant effect, an anti-inflammatory effect, thermogenic effects or the modulation of microbiome diversity. Professor Hermansen’s presentation also drew on his own research into coffee compounds such as caffeic acid and cafestol. Key research findings highlighted in the roundtable report include: Meta-analyses have suggested that drinking 3-4 cups of coffee per day is associated with an approximate 25% lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes The inverse association between coffee consumption and type 2 diabetes was shown in both men and women Meta-analyses has suggested that both caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee are associated with a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes A number of potentially clinically relevant compounds are present in coffee, including: caffeine, hydroxycinnamic acids notably chlorogenic acid, trigonelline, diterpenes eg cafestol and kahweol, and caffeic acid To read the report titled, ‘Coffee and type 2 diabetes: A review of the latest research’, click .

You can go back to this later in your Our research shows new genetic test better at spotting risk of Type 1 diabetes in newborns Our scientists have discovered a new way to find children at high risk of Type 1 diabetes that’s more effective than current methods. Our research fellow, Dr Richard Oram, at the University of Exeter and scientists at Seattle University have developed a new ‘risk calculator’. The calculator uses information from genes linked to diabetes to help find those at highest risk of developing the condition.   In a study published today in Diabetes Care, the team used computer simulations to show that their new risk score (called the T1DGRS2) was nearly twice as effective as current methods at finding babies at high risk of Type 1 diabetes.  Spotting children at high risk could help healthcare professionals to catch any signs of Type 1 diabetes as early as possible, reducing their risk of potentially life-threatening during diagnosis.  It also means children at high risk can be offered opportunities to take part in cutting-edge , hoping to find ways to delay or prevent Type 1 diabetes in the future.  To develop the test, the team looked at genetic information across the entire genome (a person’s complete set of DNA) in nearly 6,500 people with Type 1 diabetes and around 9,000 people without diabetes. They combined information about genetic differences strongly linked to Type 1 diabetes into a score.  To test how well their new risk score worked, they wanted to see if it could spot people who already had Type 1 diabetes. So they tested it in a subset of people in the UK Biobank: a database of nearly half a million people, many of whom have Type 1 or diabetes.  The team found that the new risk score was 50% better than current genetic scores at finding adults with Type 1 diabetes. Although these tests aren’t used currently, the findings show that as well as helping to spot children at high risk, the tests could be used to make sure people receive the right diabetes diagnosis in the future - and therefore the right treatments - as soon as possible. Exeter scientists recently discovered that around half of all cases of Type 1 diabetes happen in adulthood. But it can sometimes be difficult for doctors to distinguish between Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes.  Anna Morris, Assistant Director of Research Strategy and Partnership at Diabetes UK, said:  ""It's exciting to see the power of genetics being harnessed to help predict who might develop Type 1 diabetes in the future, particularly from a young age. If successful, this approach could help to reduce someone's risk of being misdiagnosed or developing complications during diagnosis.  “In the future, this research could also open up new insights into what could be done to stop Type 1 diabetes from progressing."" “Predicting which diseases we might get in the future is an important area of research, and Type 1 diabetes has a strong genetic element that we are now able to measure very well.  “The Type 1 diabetes genetic risk score could help to predict who will develop the condition from early life, which in turn could inform the development of early life interventions, as well as helping to classify diabetes correctly at diagnosis.”    Seth Sharp, PhD student working on the project with Dr Richard Oram, said: ""It has been fantastic working on my first research study with colleagues at Exeter and in Seattle with the support of Diabetes UK. help massively cut the costs involved in identifying babies whocould be key to identifying what triggers Type 1 diabetes.

Metabolic syndrome is a group of health problems that include too much , elevated blood pressure, , elevated blood sugar, and low cholesterol. Together, this group of health problems increases your risk of heart attack, stroke, and diabetes. Metabolic syndrome is caused by an unhealthy lifestyle that includes eating too many calories, being inactive, and gaining weight, particularly . This lifestyle can lead to , a condition in which the body is unable to respond normally to insulin. If you have insulin resistance, your body cannot use insulin properly, and your blood sugar will begin to rise. Over time, this can lead to . This syndrome raises your risk for (CAD), even beyond that caused by high LDL cholesterol alone. It also increases your risk for diabetes. What increases your chance of developing metabolic syndrome? The things that make you more likely to develop metabolic syndrome include: Insulin resistance. This means that your body cannot use insulin properly. Abdominal obesity. This means having too much fat around your waist. Age. Your chances of developing metabolic syndrome increase as you get older. Lack of exercise. If you do not exercise, you are more likely to be obese and develop metabolic syndrome. Hormone imbalance. A hormone disorder such as (PCOS), a condition in which the female body produces too much of certain hormones, is associated with metabolic syndrome. Family history of type 2 diabetes. Having parents or close relatives with diabetes is associated with metabolic syndrome. A history of diabetes during pregnancy (). Race and ethnicity. African Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, Asian Americans, and Pacific Islanders are at higher risk than whites for type 2 diabetes. Your doctor can diagnose metabolic syndrome with a physical exam, your medical history, and some simple blood tests. You may be diagnosed with metabolic syndrome if you have three or more of the risk factors listed in the table below. These criteria were developed by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. Other organizations may have different criteria for diagnosis. 150 mg/dL or higher, or taking medicine for high triglycerides 130/85 mm Hg or higher, or taking medicine for high blood pressure 100 mg/dL or higher, or taking medicine for high blood sugar The main goal of treatment is to reduce your risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) and diabetes. The first approaches in treating metabolic syndrome are: Weight control. Being overweight is a major risk factor for CAD. Weight loss lowers LDL cholesterol and reduces all of the risk factors for metabolic syndrome. Physical activity. Lack of exercise is a major risk factor for CAD. Regular exercise can help improve cholesterol levels. It can also lower blood pressure, reduce insulin resistance, lower blood sugar levels, and improve heart function. Assessing risk category for CAD and diabetes. Then you and your doctor may discuss other treatments to lower LDL, high blood pressure, or high blood sugar. Grundy SM, et al. (2005).

But despite the number of people living with , it’s a complex disease that’s not fully understood by all. A clear understanding of this disease, however, can help clear up a lot of the stigma surrounding it. Some people who don’t know much about or might question whether it’s transferrable from person-to-person through sexual contact, saliva, or blood. Science has confirmed that diabetes is a non-communicable disease, so it’s not contagious — nor is a diagnosis your fault. is a hormone that helps the body regulate blood sugar or glucose. With type 1 diabetes, the body doesn’t produce insulin. In type 2 diabetes, the body doesn’t produce enough insulin or use insulin properly. It’s unknown why some people get diabetes and others don’t. In type 1 diabetes, an overactive immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys cells in the that produce insulin. This causes the pancreas to stop producing insulin. It’s also unknown why the pancreas doesn’t produce sufficient insulin in those who have type 2 diabetes, though certain may contribute to insulin production. Myth #2: Diabetes is caused by eating too much sugar Maybe you’ve heard that eating too many sugary treats can one day cause diabetes. This is a common myth that confuses many people, mainly because diabetes involves . Sugar, however, , so the disease isn’t a punishment for having a sweet tooth. Insulin supplies your body’s cells with to be used for energy. But sometimes, too much sugar stays in your blood. This isn’t due to , but rather your body‘s inability to use insulin properly, which in turn causes a blood sugar spike. But while eating sugar doesn’t directly cause diabetes, it can increase your risk. Overconsumption of sugar can lead to weight gain, and more weight is a risk factor for developing diabetes. Myth #3: Once you’re diagnosed, you can’t eat sugar After a diagnosis, some people assume that all sugar is off-limits, and they deprive themselves in order to better manage their blood sugar. Other times, family members who are trying to be helpful may monitor the sugar intake of loved ones with diabetes, which can cause stress and resentment. Fact #3: People with diabetes can eat sugar in moderation Managing diabetes is all about . This includes a healthy balance of protein, fruits, vegetables — and yes, even sugar. So while someone with diabetes might have to adjust how much sugar they consume, they don’t have to adopt a strict sugar-free diet. They can sometimes have carbohydrates like: Just like in people without diabetes, the key is to eat these types of foods in moderation, and try to eat more whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. Myth #4: Diabetes is only a concern for people diagnosed overweight Sometimes, people diagnosed overweight may overconsume calories or live a less active lifestyle, which are both risk factors for diabetes. Fact #4: Diabetes can develop in people of all sizes Diabetes isn’t a disease that only affects certain body sizes. You can get diabetes regardless of your weight. About with type 2 diabetes are diagnosed with obesity or overweight, which means 15 percent aren’t. Myth #5: Diabetes doesn’t run in my family, so I don’t have to worry While is one risk factor for diabetes, it’s not the only one. If a close family member has the disease, yes, you’re at risk too. But there are several other risk factors for diabetes that have nothing to do with family history. Fact #5: Family history isn’t the only risk factor for diabetes Although family history does come into play, it’s not the only factor. And the truth is, you can get diabetes if no one in your family has the disease, particularly type 2 diabetes. a larger waist circumference of above 35 inches for women and above 40 inches for men a history of (when your blood sugar level is higher than normal) Because people living with type 1 diabetes don’t produce insulin, they must take insulin injections or use an insulin pump to control their blood sugar. Some people with type 2 diabetes also produce so little insulin that they need to take insulin. But not all people with type 2 diabetes require insulin. Fact #6: Some people can manage their blood sugar with medications and lifestyle changes Many people living with type 2 diabetes are able to manage their condition and avoid blood sugar spikes by maintaining a . This includes getting . Exercise can have a positive effect on blood sugar because it increases , allowing your muscle cells to better use insulin. Some people also manage type 2 diabetes with and the use of . If these measures don’t work to promote a healthy blood sugar level, insulin injections may become necessary. Because diabetes is a common condition, some people shrug it off or downplay the potential seriousness of this disease. Fact #7: Diabetes can cause life threatening complications It’s important to follow your doctor’s recommendations to manage your blood sugar, such as by taking your insulin or medications, and making lifestyle changes. can cause many complications, including some that are life-threatening. These include: It left untreated, diabetes can also cause pregnancy complications like , , and . If you know someone with diabetes, they need your support. There’s no cure for diabetes, and a person’s condition can change or progress over time. So even if someone doesn’t need medication for diabetes today, they might need it in the future, which can be an emotional transition. Your support can help someone cope with this disease, whether they’re newly diagnosed or have been living with diabetes for years. , but don’t nag or irritate. Go for daily walks or enjoy other activities such as swimming or biking. with them, and take notes. and learn how to recognize signs of low blood sugar, such as: and allow them to vent when needed. Diabetes can be an often misunderstood condition. But with education and knowledge, it’s easier to understand the complexity of this disease and empathize with a loved one. Diabetes is a serious condition without a cure, and it can develop slowly. If you or someone you love develops symptoms like increased thirst, frequent urination, or slow wound healing, see a doctor for a blood sugar check. — There are a lot more factors at play in diabetes — more complicated than “I had a cupcake at lunch.” It's a myth that only overweight or obese people can develop diabetes.

Diabetes Self-Management offers over 900 diabetes friendly recipes to choose from including desserts, low-carb pasta dishes, savory main meals, grilled options and more. By Laura Hieronymus, DNP, MSEd, RN, MLDE, BC-ADM, CDCES, FADCES, Diabetes is a disorder characterized by high blood glucose levels, and the reasons for these high levels can vary. In , the beta cells of the pancreas are attacked in an autoimmune process and cease to produce insulin, the hormone that lowers blood glucose levels. In , the combination of and inadequate insulin production by the pancreas results in high blood glucose. (In insulin resistance, the cells do not respond normally to insulin, so glucose remains in the bloodstream rather than entering the cells where it can be used for energy or stored for later use.) Regardless of the cause of high blood glucose, treatment for diabetes involves taking steps to lower it. That’s because chronic high blood glucose can lead to complications including impaired vision or even blindness, , and kidney failure. Healthy eating and physical activity are always components of a diabetes treatment plan. For people with Type 1 diabetes, insulin is always a necessary part of treatment, and it is often used by people with Type 2 diabetes as well. However, people with Type 2 diabetes usually start medication therapy with oral medicines. Because diabetes is characterized by high blood glucose, and because high blood glucose can cause a number of serious health problems, lowering blood glucose levels is often — understandably — the focus of diabetes treatment. But it shouldn’t be the only one. Both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes increase the risk of developing a number of cardiovascular problems, including , atherosclerosis (stiffening and “clogging” of the arteries), heart attack, and stroke. Therefore, it is not uncommon for physicians to prescribe medicines to lower blood cholesterol and blood pressure, along with drugs to lower blood glucose, for their patients with diabetes. When a person is first diagnosed with diabetes, his physician chooses which medicines to prescribe based on many factors, including the type of diabetes the person has, his blood glucose level at the time of diagnosis, as well as any other health conditions he may have. When someone is newly diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes, he is commonly prescribed . Metformin lowers the amount of glucose produced by the liver and improves the cells’ sensitivity to insulin, so that more glucose is moved from the bloodstream to fat, muscle, and other cells. When the combination of metformin and lifestyle changes is not enough to adequately lower blood glucose levels, other oral or injectable medicines can be added to a person’s Type 2 diabetes medication regimen. Generally, these other medicines lower blood glucose in different ways, and the hope is that together, they will be enough to keep blood glucose levels in the near-normal range. People with Type 1 diabetes are always prescribed insulin therapy upon diagnosis, although the particulars vary from one person to the next. For example, a person’s initial total daily dose of insulin is based on his body weight, then tailored as necessary to account for lifestyle and level of insulin sensitivity (or resistance). Some people learn to take insulin injections using syringes that they fill themselves from vials of insulin. Others are prescribed insulin pens. And some people start immediately on an , which is a small electronic device that infuses the insulin into the body over the course of the day. The insulin pump can be programmed to meet individual needs for insulin. (Any of these insulin delivery methods may also be used by people with Type 2 diabetes.) There are also several types of insulin, including rapid-acting insulin analogs, long-acting insulin analogs, intermediate-acting insulin, and short-acting insulin. Which insulin or combination of insulins a person is prescribed depends on what kind of device he uses to administer his insulin (syringe, pen, or pump) and may also depend on what kind of insurance coverage he has for insulin. The newer insulin analogs are typically more expensive than older types of insulin. You are the most important member of your diabetes care team, and your input is necessary to getting your treatment plan right. When your physician prescribes a drug for you, make sure you understand what condition the drug is intended to treat, and what you can expect when you take it. Be sure to also let your physician know about any concerns you have regarding your drug therapy, such as the cost of it, any side effects, your ability to remember to take multiple medicines, or your ability to take or administer the drugs you’ve been prescribed. • How will I know the drug is working for me? (How long does it take to start working?) • What sort of monitoring do I need to do when I start this drug? • What are the potential risks and side effects associated with this drug? • Will it interfere with any other medicines I’m taking? • Is there a generic drug that works just as well? When you’re starting a drug that must be injected, it is helpful to work with a trained (who could be a physician, nurse, dietitian, pharmacist, or other health-care professional) to learn the proper technique. People with impaired vision or trouble with fine-motor control often benefit from working with an educator or occupational therapist who specializes in those issues. A pharmacist can be a useful resource for many questions related to drugs and their use. Consider asking your pharmacist if you have questions about the following: • Whether or not a drug can or should be taken with food • Whether it’s safe to drink alcohol with the drugs you take • What to do if you miss a dose of a drug (or drugs) • Whether the drug might interact with other drugs or with certain foods • Tools and techniques for organizing your medicines and remembering to take them • The availability of special packaging, such as easy-open bottle tops, if you have trouble handling your medicine bottles • Alternative dosage forms if you have trouble swallowing If possible, use only one pharmacy so that all of your prescriptions are filled in one place and the pharmacist knows all the drugs you are taking. Having family support for your diabetes care routine in general, and your medication regimen in particular, can make a positive difference. Each person is different in the amount and type of help he wants or needs. Obviously, children with diabetes need their parents and other caregivers to manage and often administer their insulin or other diabetes drugs. As children mature, they can take over more responsibility for their diabetes care, but they continue to need adult supervision even into their teen years to make sure they are carrying out their self-management tasks as well as learning the skills that will allow them to manage their diabetes independently as adults. Adults with diabetes may be perfectly capable of managing their medicines alone, but they still may benefit from help and support from their spouse or partner or other family members, either on a routine basis or only occasionally. Here are some of things you might ask a family member to do to help you manage your diabetes medication regimen: • Learn about your diabetes medicines, how they work, and what’s involved in taking them. • Accompany you to medical appointments to learn more, ask questions, and take notes. • Provide reminders to take pills or injections, refill prescriptions, etc. • Be willing to pick up items from the drugstore or make phone calls on your behalf to sort out, for example, problems with insurance claims or mail-order pharmacy deliveries. • Learn how to inject insulin “just in case.” • Help you compile an accurate list of all of the medicines you use, the reasons you use them, and the doses you take. Elderly people with diabetes may need more help with their medication regimen (and other parts of their diabetes self care) than younger adults, especially if they become forgetful or have cognitive and/or emotional changes. An elderly person who recognizes that he needs help or is forgetting things can speak to his physician or pharmacist about the difficulties he’s having and ask for suggestions. He might also reach out to relatives who live nearby to help. When an elderly person doesn’t recognize that he is not caring for himself properly, a family member may need to speak to his health-care providers on his behalf to determine what sort of help is necessary and how it can be provided. It may be that with the provision of written instructions, frequent reminders from a family member, and simple tools such as pillboxes, an elderly person can continue to live independently and provide most of his own diabetes care. Or it may be that more assistance is needed. Two resources that may be of help to family members who wish to help an elderly relative are Eldercare Locator (, [800] 677-1116), and the National Alliance for Caregiving (). Family and other household members of a person with diabetes should be aware of the risk of (low blood glucose) and how to treat it. Hypoglycemia is more likely to occur in people who take insulin or a drug such as glipizide, glyburide, or glimepiride. The risk is also somewhat higher in those who take . The risk of hypoglycemia associated with other oral drugs for Type 2 diabetes is lower, but not zero, and when other oral or injectable drugs are taken in combination with insulin or sulfonylureas, the risk of hypoglycemia is increased. The risk of insulin-induced hypoglycemia is high in people who also inject pramlintide (Symlin). include weakness, shakiness, sweatiness or clamminess, rapid heart rate, and possibly confusion. Treating hypoglycemia in a person who is conscious involves giving that person a food or drink that contains carbohydrate. It is generally recommended that a person start treatment with an amount of food or drink that provides 15 grams of carbohydrate, then wait 15 minutes before checking his blood glucose level with his meter to see if it’s back in the normal range. Each of the following provides about 15 grams of carbohydrate: 3–4 glucose tablets, 1/2 cup orange juice, 1/2 cup regular soda, 1 tablespoon honey or syrup, 8 ounces of skim milk. Anyone who is at risk for severe hypoglycemia should have on hand for treatment. Glucagon is an injectable treatment that raises blood glucose level. It is sold by prescription only. An adult family member should be trained in advance on how and when to administer glucagon should it become necessary. Your diabetes medicines are prescribed to help you keep your blood glucose in an optimal range for you. Work with your physician and other members of your diabetes care team to develop a drug therapy regimen that works for you. Involve your family and friends in your care by keeping them informed about your diabetes treatment plan and explaining what they can do to help and support you. And keep in mind that most people’s diabetes medication regimens change over time, so it’s likely yours will too. Use these changes as opportunities to discuss your needs with both your health-care team and your home-support team. Want to learn more about the role of medicines in treating diabetes?

b33c05c0-8a3c-4076-aff8-af5bbb417631,"Wednesday, 6 May 2020 A new study shows that good helps people living with deal with COVID-19. A study conducted in China and reported in the journal adds to the evidence that people with type 2 diabetes are at greater risk of a poor outcome should they become infected with the virus that causes COVID-19. But encouragingly the study also showed that whose is well controlled fare much better than those with poor blood glucose control. Dr Hongliang Li from Renmin Hospital and study author said, “We were surprised to see such favourable outcomes among patients with COVID-19 and pre-existing type 2 diabetes.” “Considering the higher risk of serious and even death and the lack of specific drugs for COVID-19, our findings indicate that controlling blood glucose well may act to improve the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 and diabetes.” More than 500 million people around the world have type 2 diabetes. In Australia almost 1.2 million live with the condition. While it was clear that the health of people with type 2 diabetes would be impacted by COVID-19, Dr Li and colleagues wondered what role a person’s blood glucose control might have on those outcomes. To find out, they conducted a retrospective longitudinal multi-cantered study including 7,337 confirmed COVID-19 cases enrolled among 19 hospitals in Hubei Province, China. Of those, 952 people had type 2 diabetes and the other 6,385 did not. Among those with diabetes, 282 had well-controlled blood glucose; the other 528 did not. The data showed that people admitted to the hospital with COVID-19 and type 2 diabetes required more medical interventions. Despite those interventions, they also had significantly higher mortality (7.8% vs. 2.7%) as well as a greater incidence of multiple organ injury. However, those with well-controlled blood glucose and COVID-19 were less likely to die than those whose blood glucose was poorly controlled. Meanwhile, those with well-managed type 2 diabetes also received less of other medical interventions including supplemental oxygen and/or ventilation, and had fewer health complications. The researchers say the new findings offer three main messages for people with type 2 diabetes: People with type 2 diabetes are at greater risk of developing complications or may die if they contract COVID-19. Therefore, they should take extra precautions to avoid becoming infected. This includes and social distancing. Taking extra care to keep their blood glucose under good control is important to their health. Once infected, patients should have their blood glucose level controlled to maintain it in the right range, in addition to any other needed treatments. The researchers say they will continue to study the relationship between type 2 diabetes and COVID-19 outcomes. The hope is to learn more about the underlying biology that is leading to poorer outcomes for people with type 2 and high blood glucose.

d09cb9ec-a5fc-4006-816b-0028caf35677,"Wednesday, 2 December 2020 A new study has found that frequent exercise breaks during prolonged sitting may be better for blood vessel health in people with diabetes than less-frequent activity interruptions. The research was conducted by Australian Catholic University. People living with type 2 diabetes have a higher risk of heart disease and reduced vascular or blood vessel function than those without diabetes. Measuring vascular function is used to identify the risk of heart disease. Moving more and sitting less helps reduce the risk of heart disease. This is true for everyone, not just people with diabetes. However, rapidly advancing technologies in the workplace and at home are leading to fewer opportunities for incidental activity. This is creating lifestyles that are conducive to prolonged periods of sitting. In the study, the team explored the effects of shorter, more frequent and longer, less-frequent breaks on blood flow and blood vessel dilation in adults with obesity and type 2 diabetes. Each volunteer participated in three separate trial conditions on different days. In one, the volunteers sat for eight hours, where they could read or use a phone, but they did not take activity breaks. In the second, volunteers did three minutes of exercises that included squats, leg lifts, and calf raises every 30 minutes. A finally in the third they took six-minute exercise breaks every hour. The researchers found that compared with just sitting, blood vessel function improved in both instances where volunteers exercised. But the results were much better when the participants exercised every 30 minutes. This suggests that the frequency of the activity break may be more important than the length of time. As there is a progressive impairment in vascular function as type 2 diabetes develops, frequently interrupting sitting is needed to preserve leg blood flow. The new findings suggest that more-frequent and shorter breaks may be more beneficial than longer, less-frequent breaks for improving vascular function in those with type 2 diabetes. The study is published in the American Journal of Physiology-Heart and Circulatory Physiology. Switch the type of walking in your routine to stay motivated and active.

4d920b5b-d179-4c98-81a9-07d5657e0285,"Coffee & Caffeine Good or Bad for Diabetes? Blood Sugar + Insulin Effects Diabetes is one of the top ten causes of death for Americans ()​. Approximately 1.4 million people in the U.S. are diagnosed with the condition every year. Almost 10 percent of the American population has type 2 diabetes. Some researchers predict that 65 percent of people across the globe will have the condition by 2025 (). If you’re a coffee drinker, you might be in luck. Coffee has been associated with a decrease in type 2 diabetes risk (, ). ​Drinking Coffee Reduces Your Risk of Developing Type 2 Diabetes ​Drinking Coffee May Increase Blood Sugar Temporarily ​Does Decaffeinated Coffee Reduce My Risk of Diabetes? ​What Compounds in Coffee Are Responsible For Lowering Your Diabetes Risk? The information that’s out there about coffee can be confusing. A quick internet search will result in a variety of information regarding and detriments to your . Some health gurus tell you to if you care about your wellbeing (). In the short term, however, drinking coffee can increase your blood sugar and hinder your body’s ability to metabolize glucose (, , ). If you’re worried about developing diabetes, should you drink coffee, or should you avoid it? We have explored the facts behind and spelled them out for you below. : Some people claim that coffee is good for your health, while others warn against drinking it. Fasting glucose levels, glucose regulation and glucose tolerance are associated with type 2 diabetes. In other words, the way that your body uses sugar for energy can increase or decrease your risk of developing type 2 diabetes (). Fasting glucose levels refer to the amount of glucose in your blood after you have avoided food or beverages for 8 to 12 hours. Glucose regulation and glucose tolerance indicate how well your body processes sugar in order to use it as an appropriate source of energy. Glucose tolerance indicates how well your body processes large amounts of sugar (). Insulin resistance is another phrase for glucose tolerance. Insulin is a hormone that the pancreas makes to help cells throughout the body use glucose for energy (). Normally, as insulin is released into the bloodstream, it helps cells absorb that sugar. This reduces the amount of glucose in the bloodstream. If you’re insulin resistant, the cells don’t respond to that insulin production. That means that they don’t absorb the glucose as readily. That leaves more sugar in the bloodstream and puts you at a greater risk of diabetes and other health conditions. : High blood glucose levels and insulin resistance are associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. ​Drinking Coffee Reduces Your Risk of Developing Type 2 Diabetes has been found to benefit blood glucose levels and insulin sensitivity ()​. Many studies have shown that drinking coffee reduces the risk of type 2 diabetes. Is this a function of the caffeine? Some experts say no (, ). One study found that coffee and black tea drinkers had a lower risk of developing diabetes than people who didn’t drink these beverages ()​. This study also found that drinkers of don’t get the same benefits when it comes to type 2 diabetes. Although it’s not clear from the study, this could indicate that the caffeine does play a part in the health benefits. One meta-analysis determined that both caffeinated and lowers diabetes risk. However, caffeinated coffee is more effective (). The more coffee you drink, the more you reduce your risk of type 2 diabetes. People who consume four to six cups of coffee on a daily basis are less likely to develop type 2 diabetes than people who only consume two cups per day (). : People who drink more coffee have a lower overall risk of developing type 2 diabetes. ​Drinking Coffee May Increase Blood Sugar Temporarily Although coffee can lower your risk of diabetes, it can increase your blood sugar in the short term. It means that your body is reacting appropriately to the amount of insulin that’s naturally secreted into your bloodstream. One study found that drinking what equates to a moderate amount of caffeine lowered reduced insulin sensitivity. This effect may be a result of the increased catecholamine levels caused by caffeine consumption. This study found that many people adapt to caffeine’s effects on insulin sensitivity. Although they may become insulin resistant initially, many will develop a tolerance to caffeine. However, the tolerance could be dependent on the amount of time that it takes for the caffeine to be eliminated from the system. Many studies look at the results after administering unnaturally large doses of caffeine to subjects at one time. That led researchers to look at the effects of a single, average serving of coffee on blood sugar. This study involved giving participants the equivalent of one serving of . The researchers found that even this typical dose negatively affected blood glucose levels in overweight men who were otherwise healthy (). Other studies have found that caffeinated coffee can cause spikes in blood sugar levels in people with and without type 2 diabetes (, )​. However, many studies that link caffeine with temporary blood sugar surges are using isolated caffeine, not coffee. When you look at the effects of coffee on blood sugar, it is not as significant as the effects of caffeine alone (). This could be due in part to the other beneficial compounds found in coffee () Glucose spikes are not often found when people consume decaffeinated coffee. This further supports the idea that it’s the caffeine that is responsible for the undesirable glucose response (, , )​.  In these studies, although glucose levels increased, insulin resistance was not detected. : Caffeine can increase your blood glucose levels temporarily. However, regular coffee drinkers develop a tolerance to this effect. Other ingredients in coffee can balance out unwanted effects on glucose levels. Some experts have found that habitual coffee drinkers don’t get spikes in glucose and insulin levels (, )​.  In addition, as we mentioned before, several studies link coffee consumption with a decreased risk of type 2 diabetes. How is this possible if drinking coffee can boost your blood sugar levels? Coffee is full of antioxidants. In one study, two of the antioxidants found in coffee, chlorogenic acid and caffeic acid, were isolated (). Tests were done to determine whether these could prevent cell damage from lipid peroxidation, cell damage caused by free radicals. Although the antioxidants alone didn’t seem to have an effect on lipid peroxidation, coffee did have antioxidant effects on blood plasma and liver cells. People who drink coffee regularly may benefit from these antioxidant properties. One study set out to look at the effects of long-term coffee drinking on the risk of developing type 2 diabetes ()​. During the study, subjects either drank five cups of caffeinated coffee, five cups of decaffeinated coffee or no coffee every day for about four months. Their blood glucose was measured before beginning the study, at eight weeks and at 16 weeks. Blood glucose was measured after fasting as well as during a glucose tolerance test. During the glucose tolerance test, participants were given a sugary beverage, and their blood glucose levels were measured in regular increments following the ingestion of the drink. The people who drank caffeinated coffee showed no change in blood sugar levels after eight weeks. However, they showed a drop in glucose levels during the glucose tolerance test after 16 weeks. If you’re a regular coffee drinker, you are more likely to be protected by coffee’s health benefits. If you’ve just recently started drinking coffee, you might see an increase in your glucose levels before they decrease. : Regular coffee drinkers don’t usually experience a surge in glucose levels. Their blood glucose levels may actually fall after several months of habitual coffee consumption. ​Does Decaffeinated Coffee Reduce My Risk of Diabetes? Researchers have demonstrated that both caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee have been linked with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes​ (, , , )​. In addition, decaffeinated coffee doesn’t temporarily increase blood glucose levels (, )​.  Drinking caffeinated coffee along with a meal can impair your insulin sensitivity and make it harder to manage blood sugar levels. This occurs whether or not the meal has a high glycemic index. The same results have not been seen when people drink decaffeinated coffee with meals​ (). Decaffeinated coffee doesn’t increase blood sugar levels any more than does. In the long term, it does lower the risk of type 2 diabetes, however. Decaffeinated coffee might be a good alternative for those who are just beginning to drink coffee. It can also be an ideal choice for people who already have type 2 diabetes but experience a surge in blood sugar after drinking caffeinated coffee. : Decaffeinated coffee has similar beneficial effects as caffeinated coffee when it comes to lowering type 2 diabetes risk, and it won’t temporarily increase blood sugar levels. ​What Compounds in Coffee Are Responsible For Lowering Your Diabetes Risk? The studies that have looked into coffee consumption and diabetes can be confusing. Increased blood sugar is associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Therefore, how can drinking coffee lower your risk of this health condition? Experts aren’t exactly sure how the compounds in coffee lower the risk of type 2 diabetes. Looking at the effects of coffee on different systems in the body can help explain this. Coffee is a stimulant. It influences the release of catecholamines in the body, including epinephrine. Epinephrine can quickly increase blood glucose levels (). Caffeine is an adenosine receptor antagonist. That means that it blocks adenosine receptors (). Adenosine is a neurotransmitter that is responsible for locomotor activity. When the receptors are blocked, the muscles may have trouble pulling glucose from the blood (, ). Adiponectin plays a part in insulin resistance. People with more body fat and type 2 diabetes have lower adiponectin levels. Increasing your adiponectin can improve your insulin sensitivity and lower your blood glucose levels (). People who drink coffee regularly tend to have higher levels of this protein ()​. Sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) has often been considered a marker for type 2 diabetes risk (). One study compared SHBG levels in women who drank four or more cups of coffee a day with those of women who didn’t drink coffee. The coffee drinkers had higher levels of SHBG. Tea and decaffeinated coffee weren’t associated with higher SHBG levels (). Studies have consistently shown that temporary increases in blood sugar levels are associated more with caffeine than with coffee (, , ). This suggests that other compounds in coffee can negate the negative effects of caffeine. Roasting coffee beans releases quinides, which have been shown to change blood sugar levels ().  Drinking coffee can also balance intestinal peptides. These hormones help manage fullness and insulin secretion. The prebiotic qualities of coffee can improve digestion, which in turn may improve glucose levels (). Many components in coffee have anti-inflammatory properties. This can help reduce oxidative stress and protect against the risk of type 2 diabetes (). Coffee has also been associated with improved liver health. Because the liver is involved in digestion and glucose metabolism, this association may be partly responsible for the reduced diabetes risk (, ). : Coffee has several properties that may be responsible for its ability to decrease your risk of type 2 diabetes. There are many hypotheses as to why coffee drinkers may have a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes. Although studies show that coffee can increase blood glucose levels initially, regular drinkers develop a tolerance and benefit from many of coffee’s health-boosting properties. If you already have type 2 diabetes, you need to be vigilant about your blood glucose levels in response to coffee consumption. In addition, you should be careful about drinking specialty coffee drinks or adding sugar to your beverage. Unless you have a medical condition for which a surge in blood glucose levels would be problematic, drinking coffee on a regular basis can help lower your type 2 diabetes. For the average individual, the health benefits of coffee outweigh the risks. That doesn’t mean that you can down a few mugs when you wake up and then follow an unhealthy lifestyle, however. You should also exercise and eat a healthy diet.

Diabetes NSW & ACT CEO, Sturt Eastwood said, “Diabetes is a complex condition that requires daily monitoring, management and care.” “You can’t underestimate the role families’ play in helping people maintain good health. Everyone from mums and dads to grandparents, brothers and sisters to friends, health professionals, teachers, co-workers, researchers and volunteers all play a role in helping to detect, prevent and care for people living with diabetes.” Early diagnosis and treatment of diabetes is key to helping prevent or delay life-threatening complications. If type 1 diabetes is not detected early, it can be fatal. A delayed diagnosis of type 2 diabetes can lead to complications such as blindness, amputation, kidney or heart disease, and depression or anxiety. “Knowing the signs of diabetes can help protect your family,” Mr Eastwood said. “That’s why we’re encouraging everyone to be on the lookout for symptoms such as sudden weight loss, tiredness or excessive thirst and urination. We’re also encouraging anyone over 40 to include a diabetes test in their annual check-up. “Type 2 is more difficult to pick because the symptoms can be mild, which people dismiss as getting a bit older.” “For those with a loved one living with type 2 diabetes, supporting the changes they need to make to their diet and exercise routine can make all the difference to help them live well and avoid serious complications,” Mr Eastwood said.

In people with diabetes, blood glucose levels are higher than normal because the body does not produce enough insulin and often cannot use insulin properly. Insulin is a hormone needed for glucose to enter the cells and be converted to energy. There are two main types of diabetes: type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Occurs when the pancreas does not produce insulin. Represents 10–15 per cent of all cases of diabetes. Usually the onset is abrupt and symptoms are obvious. Symptoms can include excessive thirst and urination, unexplained weight Half of new cases occur in people aged 15 years or over. Latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) is a slow onset form of type 1 diabetes occurring in adults over 30 years of age. LADA is frequently misdiagnosed as type 2 diabetes.  Occurs when either the insulin is not working effectively (insulin resistance) or the pancreas does not produce sufficient insulin (or a combination of both). Represents 85–90 per cent of all cases of diabetes. Usually develops in adults over the age of 45 years but it is increasingly occurring at a younger age. Is more likely to develop in people with a family history or from particular ethnic backgrounds. Symptoms may be similar to those for type 1 diabetes. Other symptoms of type 2 diabetes include; frequent infections (thrush, urinary tract or skin infections), slow wound healing. Many people with type 2 diabetes do not have any symptoms or they may be very mild. In early stages type 2 diabetes can usually be managed with a healthy lifestyle and regular medical checks but eventually medications and/or insulin may be required. What is the difference between type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes? diabetes is an autoimmune condition. Usually the onset is abrupt and symptoms are obvious. Type 1 diabetes is more commonly diagnosed in children and young adults but can occur at any age. Type 1 diabetes is always treated with insulin. diabetes is the form of diabetes that is related to ageing, family history and lifestyle factors (overweight and inactivity). It occurs when the insulin is not working effectively (insulin resistance) or the pancreas does not produce sufficient insulin (or a combination of both).  Most people with diabetes have type 2. It usually develops in adults over the age of 45 years but it is increasingly occurring at a younger age. Type 2 diabetes is treated with healthy eating, exercise and weight control. Tablets and insulin may also be required. Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and impaired fasting glucose (IFG) are both conditions where blood glucose levels are higher then normal but not high enough for a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. The term 'pre-diabetes' is also sometimes used to describe these conditions. Symptoms of type 1 diabetes can include excessive thirst and urination, unexplained weight loss, weakness and fatigue. Symptoms of type 2 are similar to those for type 1 diabetes. However, some people with type 2 diabetes do not have any symptoms at all. For others the first indication may be a complication of diabetes such as a heart attack, vision problems, or a foot ulcer. . Diabetes can cause serious complications. For example: People with diabetes are up to two times more likely to develop heart disease and stroke. Diabetic retinopathy causes 17 per cent of all blindness and vision impairment and is the most common form of blindness in adults 20–74 years. The rate of lower limb amputation is 15 times higher in people with diabetes than those without diabetes. Diabetes is the leading cause of kidney failure. People with diabetes develop kidney damage at three times the rate of those who do not have diabetes. People with diabetes are at similar risk of death to smokers. Over five years people with diabetes are twice as likely to die as people with normal glucose tolerance. The total number of Australians with diabetes and pre-diabetes is estimated to be approximately 3.7 million. About one in four Australian adults over the age of 25 years has either diabetes or impaired glucose metabolism. More than 1.2 million Australians have been diagnosed with diabetes. For every person diagnosed, it is estimated that there is another person who is not yet diagnosed. People with one or more of the following risk factors are at increased risk of type 2 diabetes: People who have a family history of type 2 diabetes. People with pre-diabetes this is where the glucose (sugar) levels in the body are higher than they should be, but not high enough to be diagnosed with diabetes. Not all people with pre-diabetes will develop diabetes but those that do have pre-diabetes are at high risk of developing the condition. People with high blood pressure and/or high fat levels in the blood or a history of cardiovascular disease. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. People from the following ethnic backgrounds: Pacific Island, Maori, Asian (including the Indian sub-continent), Middle Eastern, North African or Southern European. Women who have had diabetes during pregnancy (gestational diabetes). Women who have polycystic ovarian syndrome and who are overweight. People who smoke Women who have had type 2 diabetes when pregnant (gestational diabetes) Gestational diabetes is a form of diabetes that occurs in around five per cent of pregnancies. In the majority of women it disappears after the birth. Gestational diabetes significantly increases a woman's risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Around 17 per cent of Australian women with gestational diabetes develop type 2 diabetes within 10 years and up to 50 per cent within 30 years. If a woman has had gestational diabetes in previous pregnancies she is more at risk of developing gestational diabetes in subsequent pregnancies.  Women with a history of gestational diabetes usually do not perceive that they will develop diabetes, despite knowing the risks associated with gestational diabetes. Men have a higher incidence of diabetes than females. More men than women are overweight or obese, increasing their risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Other groups of Australians who are at risk of type 2 diabetes The rate of diabetes among Aboriginal Australians is over three times that of non-Aboriginal Australians. The higher prevalence is largely due to lifestyle risk factors such as overweight, social disadvantage, smoking and poor diet. Males from culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) backgrounds are about 30 per cent more likely to die from diabetes (as the underlying cause) than other males. Females from CALD backgrounds are 50 per cent more likely to die from diabetes as the underlying cause than other females. Maintaining a healthy weight, being physically active and following a healthy eating plan can reduce a person's risk of developing type 2 diabetes. There is no cure for diabetes. Diabetes can be successfully managed. People with diabetes need to work with a team of health care professionals, which includes their doctor, diabetes educator and dietitian. They should also work closely with their doctor for regular checks of eyes, kidneys, feet, blood pressure, blood lipids, body weight and blood glucose levels. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle can also help reduce the risk of developing the complications of diabetes. This means being physically active most days, maintaining a healthy weight, adopting healthy eating with fruit, vegetables and low fat foods and not smoking. People with type 1 diabetes need insulin for the rest of their lives. Some people with type 2 diabetes can manage their condition with regular physical activity, healthy eating and loss of excess weight. Others may need tablets and/or insulin injections as well. Diabetes can only be diagnosed with a blood glucose test ordered by a GP or specialist and performed at a laboratory. You can assess your risk for type 2 diabetes by taking the Australian Type 2 Diabetes Risk Assessment test. The tool assesses a person's risk of developing type 2 diabetes within the next five years,  based on a score for risk factors. Those with a score of 15 or more are encouraged to see their GP and to consider participating in a Lifestyle modification program, such as the Life! Program.

Men have a higher incidence of diabetes than females. More men than women are overweight or obese, increasing their risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Other groups of Australians who are at risk of type 2 diabetes The rate of diabetes among Aboriginal Australians is over three times that of non-Aboriginal Australians. The higher prevalence is largely due to lifestyle risk factors such as overweight, social disadvantage, smoking and poor diet. Males from culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) backgrounds are about 30 per cent more likely to die from diabetes (as the underlying cause) than other males. Females from CALD backgrounds are 50 per cent more likely to die from diabetes as the underlying cause than other females. Maintaining a healthy weight, being physically active and following a healthy eating plan can reduce a person's risk of developing type 2 diabetes. There is no cure for diabetes. Diabetes can be successfully managed. People with diabetes need to work with a team of health care professionals, which includes their doctor, diabetes educator and dietitian. They should also work closely with their doctor for regular checks of eyes, kidneys, feet, blood pressure, blood lipids, body weight and blood glucose levels. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle can also help reduce the risk of developing the complications of diabetes. This means being physically active most days, maintaining a healthy weight, adopting healthy eating with fruit, vegetables and low fat foods and not smoking. People with type 1 diabetes need insulin for the rest of their lives. Some people with type 2 diabetes can manage their condition with regular physical activity, healthy eating and loss of excess weight. Others may need tablets and/or insulin injections as well. Diabetes can only be diagnosed with a blood glucose test ordered by a GP or specialist and performed at a laboratory. You can assess your risk for type 2 diabetes by taking the Australian Type 2 Diabetes Risk Assessment test. The tool assesses a person's risk of developing type 2 diabetes within the next five years,  based on a score for risk factors. Those with a score of 15 or more are encouraged to see their GP and to consider participating in a Lifestyle modification program, such as the Life! Program.

In people with diabetes, blood glucose levels are higher than normal because the body does not produce enough insulin and often cannot use insulin properly. Insulin is a hormone needed for glucose to enter the cells and be converted to energy. There are two main types of diabetes: type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Occurs when the pancreas does not produce insulin. Represents 10–15 per cent of all cases of diabetes. Usually the onset is abrupt and symptoms are obvious. Symptoms can include excessive thirst and urination, unexplained weight Half of new cases occur in people aged 15 years or over. Latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) is a slow onset form of type 1 diabetes occurring in adults over 30 years of age. LADA is frequently misdiagnosed as type 2 diabetes.  Occurs when either the insulin is not working effectively (insulin resistance) or the pancreas does not produce sufficient insulin (or a combination of both). Represents 85–90 per cent of all cases of diabetes. Usually develops in adults over the age of 45 years but it is increasingly occurring at a younger age. Is more likely to develop in people with a family history or from particular ethnic backgrounds. Symptoms may be similar to those for type 1 diabetes. Other symptoms of type 2 diabetes include; frequent infections (thrush, urinary tract or skin infections), slow wound healing. Many people with type 2 diabetes do not have any symptoms or they may be very mild. In early stages type 2 diabetes can usually be managed with a healthy lifestyle and regular medical checks but eventually medications and/or insulin may be required. What is the difference between type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes? diabetes is an autoimmune condition. Usually the onset is abrupt and symptoms are obvious. Type 1 diabetes is more commonly diagnosed in children and young adults but can occur at any age. Type 1 diabetes is always treated with insulin. diabetes is the form of diabetes that is related to ageing, family history and lifestyle factors (overweight and inactivity). It occurs when the insulin is not working effectively (insulin resistance) or the pancreas does not produce sufficient insulin (or a combination of both).  Most people with diabetes have type 2. It usually develops in adults over the age of 45 years but it is increasingly occurring at a younger age. Type 2 diabetes is treated with healthy eating, exercise and weight control. Tablets and insulin may also be required. Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and impaired fasting glucose (IFG) are both conditions where blood glucose levels are higher then normal but not high enough for a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. The term 'pre-diabetes' is also sometimes used to describe these conditions. Symptoms of type 1 diabetes can include excessive thirst and urination, unexplained weight loss, weakness and fatigue. Symptoms of type 2 are similar to those for type 1 diabetes. However, some people with type 2 diabetes do not have any symptoms at all. For others the first indication may be a complication of diabetes such as a heart attack, vision problems, or a foot ulcer. . Diabetes can cause serious complications. For example: People with diabetes are up to two times more likely to develop heart disease and stroke. Diabetic retinopathy causes 17 per cent of all blindness and vision impairment and is the most common form of blindness in adults 20–74 years. The rate of lower limb amputation is 15 times higher in people with diabetes than those without diabetes. Diabetes is the leading cause of kidney failure. People with diabetes develop kidney damage at three times the rate of those who do not have diabetes. People with diabetes are at similar risk of death to smokers. Over five years people with diabetes are twice as likely to die as people with normal glucose tolerance. The total number of Australians with diabetes and pre-diabetes is estimated to be approximately 3.7 million. About one in four Australian adults over the age of 25 years has either diabetes or impaired glucose metabolism. More than 1.2 million Australians have been diagnosed with diabetes. For every person diagnosed, it is estimated that there is another person who is not yet diagnosed. People with one or more of the following risk factors are at increased risk of type 2 diabetes: People who have a family history of type 2 diabetes. People with pre-diabetes this is where the glucose (sugar) levels in the body are higher than they should be, but not high enough to be diagnosed with diabetes. Not all people with pre-diabetes will develop diabetes but those that do have pre-diabetes are at high risk of developing the condition. People with high blood pressure and/or high fat levels in the blood or a history of cardiovascular disease. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. People from the following ethnic backgrounds: Pacific Island, Maori, Asian (including the Indian sub-continent), Middle Eastern, North African or Southern European. Women who have had diabetes during pregnancy (gestational diabetes). Women who have polycystic ovarian syndrome and who are overweight. People who smoke Women who have had type 2 diabetes when pregnant (gestational diabetes) Gestational diabetes is a form of diabetes that occurs in around five per cent of pregnancies. In the majority of women it disappears after the birth. Gestational diabetes significantly increases a woman's risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Around 17 per cent of Australian women with gestational diabetes develop type 2 diabetes within 10 years and up to 50 per cent within 30 years. If a woman has had gestational diabetes in previous pregnancies she is more at risk of developing gestational diabetes in subsequent pregnancies.  Women with a history of gestational diabetes usually do not perceive that they will develop diabetes, despite knowing the risks associated with gestational diabetes.

This glucose is absorbed by the blood with the help of a hormone called insulin. Diabetes occurs when the body is not able to produce insulin or is not able to use it effectively. Here are some of the reasons why this happens. Genes can be responsible for causing both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. Having certain combination of genes may increase or decrease the risk of diabetes. If your parents were diabetics, you should be extra careful about your lifestyle. Sometimes, our own immune system may recognise the beta cells that produce insulin as antigens, and create antibodies to destroy them. Often, diabetes is diagnosed after most of the cells are destroyed and the patient then needs a daily dose of insulin to survive. Lack of exercise and obesity can be major causes of Type 2 diabetes. An imbalance between calories consumed and calories burned renders our body incapable of absorbing insulin properly.

Certain medicines like nicotinic acid, psychiatric drugs, diuretics, etc. can destroy the beta cells that produce insulin or disrupt insulin absorption. Since the beta cells are present in the pancreas – any injury or diseases like cancer, pancreatitis, etc. can stop beta cells from functioning and ultimately lead to diabetes. (Read: ) Diabetes is diagnosed using blood tests, and the three tests used for diagnosing diabetes are: This test is used for diagnosing Type 2 diabetes. It measures a person’s average blood glucose levels over the past three months. If a person’s A1C level is below 5.7%, it means that he/she is normal. If it is between 5.7 to 6.4%, it indicates prediabetes which may lead to diabetes if appropriate measures are not taken. A person is diagnosed with diabetes if he/she has an A1C level of 5.7% or above.   The Fasting Plasma Glucose test is the most common test used for diagnosing diabetes. It is performed by measuring a person’s blood sugar level, after he/she has fasted for at least 8 hours. If a person has a fasting glucose level of 126 mg/dL or above, he or she has diabetes. It is advised to repeat the test on another day for confirmation. In an oral glucose tolerance test, a person has to fast for at least 8 hours. After that, he/she has to drink a glass of water mixed with 75g of glucose.   If a person’s 2-hour blood glucose-level is between 140 to 199 mg/dL, the person has prediabetes which could lead to diabetes if appropriate measures are not taken. If the blood glucose-level is above 200 mg/dL, then the person is diagnosed with diabetes. If your diabetes can’t be controlled with diet, exercise and weight control, your doctor may recommend anti-diabetic medications or insulin. Most people who have type 2 diabetes start with an oral medicine. Here are some of them: (DiaBeta, Glucotrol, Amaryl, etc.) lower blood glucose levels by increasing the release of insulin from the pancreas. These drugs decrease blood sugar rapidly but may cause abnormally low and dangerous levels of blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) leading to mental confusion and even coma.  (Prandin, Starlix, etc.) also work on the pancreas to increase insulin secretion. Their effects depend on the level of glucose.  (lyraglutide), an injectable medicine, helps the pancreas make more insulin after eating a meal. It improves blood sugar in people with type 2 diabetes when used with a diet and exercise programme.  Drugs that decrease the amount of glucose released from the liver Metformin)decrease glucose production by the liver, decrease the absorption of glucose in the intestines and improve the body’s resistance to insulin. It also suppresses hunger, which may be beneficial in diabetics who are overweight. Drugs that increase the sensitivity (response) of cells to insulin   (Actos and Avandia) lower blood glucose by increasing the sensitivity of the muscle and fat cells to insulin. These drugs may be taken with metformin and/or a sulfonylurea. They can cause mild liver problems but are reversible with discontinuation of the drug. Drugs that decrease the absorption of carbohydrates from the intestine Alpha glucosidase is an enzyme in the small intestine which breaks down carbohydrates into glucose. Acarbose is the drug that inhibits this enzyme. Carbohydrates are not broken down as efficiently and glucose absorption is delayed, thus preventing high glucose levels after eating in people with diabetes.  (Byetta) is a substance like gut hormone (GLP-1) that cannot be easily broken down. It slows stomach emptying, slows the release of glucose from the liver and controls hunger. Administered in the form of an injection, Byetta also causes weight reduction, thus making it particularly suitable for patients with type 2 diabetes who are also overweight. (Januvia, Onglyza, Tradjenta), inhibit DPP-IV enzyme from breaking down gut hormone (GLP-1). This allows the hormone already in the blood to circulate longer. They also increase insulin secretion when blood sugars are high and signal the liver to stop producing excess sugar.  – Insulin is the backbone of treatment for patients with Type 1 diabetes. Insulin is also important in Type 2 diabetes when blood glucose levels cannot be controlled by diet, weight loss, exercise and oral medicines. Different types of insulin are: 1.   – starts working in about 15 minutes and lasts for 3 to 5 hours. There are 3 types of rapid-acting insulin: Insulin lispro, Insulin aspart and Insulin glulisine 2.   (regular insulin) – starts working in 30 to 60 minutes and lasts 5 to 8 hours. 3.   (insulin NPH) – starts working in 1 to 3 hours and lasts 12 to 16 hours. 4.   (insulin glargine and insulin detemir) – starts working in about 1 hour and lasts 20 to 26 hours. 5.  – combination of 2 types of insulin (usually a rapid-acting or short-acting insulin and an intermediate-acting insulin). (Read: ) The various methods for administering insulin are:  – This is similar to an ink cartridge in a fountain pen. An insulin cartridge is held by a small pen-sized device. The amount of insulin to be injected is dispensed by turning the bottom of the pen until the required number of units is seen in the dose-viewing window. The tip of the pen consists of a needle that is disposed off with each injection.  – This is the most recently available advance in insulin delivery. It is composed of a pump reservoir similar to that of an insulin cartridge, a battery-operated pump and a computer chip that allows the user to control the exact amount of insulin being delivered. The pump is used for continuous insulin delivery. The amount of insulin is programmed and is administered at a constant rate.  – Inhaled form of insulin is not much in use these days. The insulin is packaged in dry packs which are inserted into an inhalation device. This device allows the insulin to enter a chamber that has a mouth piece. Through this mouth piece the user can inhale the insulin. –is an injectable medication for use in diabetes patients treated with insulin but unable to achieve adequate sugar control. Amylin is a hormone synthesised by pancreas and helps control glucose after meals. It is absent or deficient in patients with diabetes. Pramlintide, a synthetic form of human amylin, when used with insulin, can improve sugar control. Symlin reduces blood sugar peaks after meal, reduces glucose fluctuations throughout the day and increases the sensation of fullness (leading to weight loss). (Read: Treatments for diabetes: Oral medications, insulin and other methods) Diabetes, if uncontrolled can lead to deadly complications.   1.  (Diabetic ketoacidosis): Since the hormone insulin which breaks down glucose is lacking, in uncontrolled cases, the body starts using fat as the fuel source. While you might think it’s not such a bad idea to lose some fat, what this leads to is build up of by-products of fat digestion called ‘ketones’. If you’re not taking your insulin doses regularly, have fever/diarrhoea/vomiting and/or going through a lot of stress or are an alcoholic, you need to be extra careful about developing this condition called ‘ketoacidosis’.  If you develop symptoms like deep gasping breathing, acute pain in the abdomen, bad dehydration leading to weakness and fainting, vomiting, it’s time you take it seriously and contact your doctor.  2.  (Diabetic retinopathy): Retina (the innermost layer of your eye) is affected by ineffective blood glucose control. The small blood vessels in the retina are damaged and weakened. The early symptom of eye problems related to diabetes is blurred vision and double vision. It can also cause a severe, permanent loss of vision. Diabetes increases the risk of developing cataracts and glaucoma. (Read: ) 3.  (Diabetic nephropathy): If you notice swelling in your feet and legs or around your eyes, your kidneys might get affected because of the uncontrolled blood sugar levels. If you have hypertension (or high BP), your chances of developing this is even higher. 4. : Some of the nerves, especially around your peripheries like legs might get affected first leading to a loss of sensation. You might not be able to figure out if you’ve had an injury and it may end up getting infected. Diabetic gangrene (infection of the leg, leading to decay of flesh) can occur and the leg may have to be amputated. Uncontrolled diabetes can also affect nerves that control your heartbeat, blood pressure, digestion, blood flow to organs etc leading to diarrhoea, erectile dysfunction, loss of bladder control, vision changes, and dizziness.

Are There Home Remedies (, Exercise, and Glucose Monitoring) for Diabetes? What Types of Health Care Professionals Treat Diabetes? Are There Support Groups and Counseling for People With Diabetes? Doctor's Notes on Diabetes (Mellitus, Type 1 and Type 2) Symptoms Learn the signs of diabetes and how it can be managed with diet and lifestyle changes. is a condition characterized by the body's inability to regulate glucose () levels in blood. In , the body does not produce enough insulin. People with can produce insulin, but the body is not able to use the insulin effectively. Symptoms of both type 1 and include The cause of type 1 is an autoimmune disorder in which the immune system slowly destroys the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. Combinations of genetic factors and unhealthy lifestyle choices cause type 2 diabetes. The main diagnostic test for diabetes is measurement of the blood glucose level. Changes in lifestyle and may be adequate to control type 2 diabetes in some people. Other people with type 2 diabetes require medications. Insulin is essential treatment for type 1 diabetes. To date, only the drug teplizumab has proven effective to slow progression to type 1 diabetes in some early cases detected before clinical onset. No approach has yet proven effective to prevent type 1 diabetes. Prevention of type 2 diabetes can be accomplished in some cases by: sustaining a healthy lifestyle, such as abstinence. Prediabetes is a condition that can occur before development of type 2 diabetes. Any type of over time can damage blood vessels and nerves. Damage to blood vessels can lead to , , and vision problems including . can result in . Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a set of related diseases in which the body cannot regulate the amount of (specifically, glucose) in the blood. The blood delivers glucose to provide the body with energy for all daily activities. The converts the food a person eats into glucose (simple sugar) and stores this glucose as starch (called glycogen). The liver releases stored glucose into the bloodstream between meals. In a healthy person, several hormones tightly regulate the blood glucose level, primarily insulin. Insulin is produced by the pancreas, a small organ located in the upper belly between the stomach and liver. The pancreas also releases other important enzymes directly into the gut to help digest food. Insulin allows glucose to move out of the blood into cells throughout the body, where it is used for fuel. People with diabetes mellitus either do not produce enough insulin (type 1 diabetes), cannot use insulin properly (type 2 diabetes), or both (various forms of diabetes). In diabetic patients, glucose cannot move efficiently from the blood into cells, so blood glucose levels remain high. This not only starves all the cells, which need the glucose for fuel, but over time also harms certain organs and tissues exposed to high glucose levels. The body produces little or no insulin to regulate blood glucose level. T1D affects about 10% of all people with diabetes in the United States. T1D is typically diagnosed during childhood or adolescence. In the past T1D was called juvenile-onset diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Insulin deficiency can occur at any age due to destruction of the pancreas by , disease, or removal by surgery. T1D results from progressive destruction by the immune system of the pancreatic beta cells, the only cell type that produces significant amounts of insulin. People with T1D require daily insulin treatment to sustain life. Although the pancreas still secretes insulin in someone with T2D, the body’s tissues are partially or completely incapable of responding to insulin. This is often referred to as . The pancreas tries to overcome this resistance by secreting more and more insulin. People with insulin resistance develop T2D when they fail to secrete enough insulin to cope with their body's demands. At least 90% of adult individuals with diabetes have T2D. T2D is typically diagnosed during adulthood, usually after age 45 years. It was once called adult-onset diabetes mellitus, or mellitus. These names are no longer used, because T2D can occur in young people, and some people with T2D require insulin therapy. T2D is usually controlled with diet, , , and/or oral medications. However, more than half of all people with T2D require insulin to control their levels at some point during the course of their disease. Gestational diabetes (GDM) is a form of diabetes that occurs during the second half of . Although gestational diabetes typically resolves after , a woman who develops gestational diabetes is more likely than other women to develop T2D later in life. Women with gestational diabetes are more likely to have large , complicated pregnancies, and complicated deliveries. (also referred to as ) is a set of abnormalities in which insulin resistance or T2D is almost always present along with (), high fat levels in the blood (increased serum , predominant elevation of , decreased , and ), central , and abnormalities in blood clotting and inflammatory responses. A high rate of cardiovascular disease is associated with . Prediabetes is a common condition related to diabetes. In people with prediabetes, the blood sugar level is higher than normal but not yet high enough to be considered diagnostic of diabetes mellitus. Prediabetes increases a person's risk of developing T2D, , or . Prediabetes can typically be reversed (without insulin or medication) by sustained lifestyle changes, such as losing a modest amount of weight and increasing physical activity levels. Weight loss can prevent, or at least delay, the onset of T2D. An international expert committee of the American Diabetes Association redefined the criteria for prediabetes, lowering the blood sugar level cut-off point for prediabetes in adults. Approximately 20% more adults are now believed to have this condition and may develop diabetes within 10 years unless they change to healthier lifestyles, such as exercising more and maintaining a healthy weight. About 17 million Americans (6.2% of adults in North America) are believed to have diabetes mellitus. Some experts estimate that about one-third of adults with diabetes do not know they have diabetes mellitus. About 1 million new cases of diabetes mellitus are diagnosed each year. Diabetes mellitus directly or indirectly causes at least 200,000 deaths each year. The rates of people affected by T1D and T2D are increasing rapidly. These increases are due to many factors. The most significant reason for T2D is the increasing number of people due to sedentary lifestyles. T1D is an autoimmune disease. The body's immune system specifically destroys the cells in the pancreas that produce insulin. A predisposition to develop T1D may run in families. However, genetic causes (i.e., a positive family history) are much more common for T2D. Common and unavoidable viral infections are among the environmental factors which contribute to T1D by triggering autoimmunity. T1D is most common among people of non-Hispanic, Northern European descent (especially Finland and Sardinia), followed by African Americans, and Hispanic Americans. It is relatively rare among Asian Americans. T1D most often presents before age 21 but can occur at any age. T2D is strongly linked to genetics, so T2D tends to run in families. Several genes have been linked to T2D, and many more are under study. Risk factors for developing T2D include: Gestational diabetes or giving birth to a baby weighing more than 9 pounds Ethnicity, particularly when a close relative had T2D or gestational diabetes. African Americans, Native Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Japanese Americans display greater risks of developing T2D than non-Hispanic white Americans. : Increasing age is a significant risk factor for T2D. Risk begins to rise significantly at about age 45 years, and rises considerably after age 65 years. Symptoms of type 1 diabetes are often dramatic and come on very suddenly. T1D is usually recognized in childhood or early adolescence, often in association with an injury or illness (such as a virus or ). The extra can cause (DKA). Symptoms of ketoacidosis include and . and often serious disturbances in blood levels of potassium and other factors follow. Without treatment, ketoacidosis can lead to and death. Symptoms of type 2 diabetes are often subtle and may be attributed to or obesity. A person may have T2D for many years without knowing it. People with T2D can develop the hyperglycemic hyperosmolar nonketotic (“HONK”) syndrome. If not properly treated, T2D can lead to complications such as blindness, , , and nerve damage. Common symptoms of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes include: With diabetes, the body’s metabolism is inefficient and sometimes unable to use glucose for fuel. The body switches over to metabolizing fat, partially or completely, as a fuel source. This process requires the body to use more energy. The end result is feeling fatigued or constantly tired. People with diabetes mellitus are unable to metabolize food. They may even though they appear to eat appropriate or even excessive amounts of food. Losing sugar and water in the urine can lead to and unintentional weight loss. A person with diabetes mellitus develops levels. When kidneys filter this blood, the high sugar content overwhelms the kidney's ability to control sugar filtering. The kidney spill excess sugar into the urine, resulting in large amounts of urine. The body tries to counteract this by sending a signal to the brain to dilute the blood, which translates into thirst. Thirst encourages more drinking (i.e., water consumption) to dilute the high blood sugar down to normal levels and to compensate for water lost by excessive urination. Typically, people with undiagnosed diabetes will drink more sugary , not just water, which drives the blood sugar higher. The body tries to rid itself of extra sugar in the blood by dumping it via urine. Excessive urination can cause dehydration because a large amount of water is necessary to excrete high amounts of blood sugar. If able, the pancreas will secrete more insulin to control high blood sugar levels. With T2D, the body resists actions of insulin. One action of insulin is to stimulate hunger. Therefore, higher insulin levels can increase hunger. Despite eating more, the person with diabetes may gain very little weight and may even lose weight. White blood cells are critical to defend the body against infection and also to clean up dead tissue. High blood sugar levels prevent white blood cells from functioning normally. When white blood cells do not function properly, wounds take much longer to heal and become infected more frequently. Long-standing diabetes is also associated with thickening of blood vessels, which prevents good circulation needed to deliver oxygen and other nutrients throughout the body. Diabetes can suppress the immune system. Certain infections may indicate poor blood sugar control and can occur more often in a person with diabetes. These include frequent yeast infections of the genitals, dental infections, skin infections, and frequent . Agitation, unexplained irritability, inattention, extreme lethargy, or confusion can all be signs of high blood sugar, or ketoacidosis, or hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome (“HONK” syndrome), or (). Thus, any of these in a diabetic person merit immediate medical assessment of blood glucose. Call your health care professional or 911 for immediate attention by a medical professional. Though not specific for diabetes, blurry vision frequently occurs with high blood sugar levels. When Should Someone Seek Medical Care for Type 1 or Type 2 Diabetes? If a person has diabetes and experiences any of the following, contact a health care professional. Experiencing diabetes symptoms. This may indicate an uncontrolled blood sugar level despite treatment. Blood sugar levels are consistently high (more than 200 mg/dL). Chronically high blood sugar level is the root cause of all complications from diabetes. Blood sugar level is often low (less than 70 mg/dL), called hypoglycemia. This may indicate that the strategy is too aggressive. Hypoglycemia could also indicate infection or other stress on the body's organs, such as kidney failure, liver failure, adrenal gland failure, other conditions, or the concomitant use of certain medications. Injury to the foot or leg, no matter how minor. Even the tiniest cut or blister can become seriously infected in a person with diabetes. Early diagnosis and treatment of problems affecting the and lower extremities, along with regular , are critical to preserve function of the legs and to prevent amputation. Each person with long-standing diabetes must perform self-care by examining their feet daily for wounds. A person can use a mirror or smartphone on a selfie stick to inspect or document the bottoms of his or her own feet. Low-grade (below 101.5 F or 38.6 C). Fever can be one sign of infection. Many common infections can potentially be more dangerous for diabetic people than non-diabetic people. Note symptoms may indicate where the infection is located, such as , redness or swelling of skin, , , or . Nausea or vomiting despite keeping liquids down. The health care professional may adjust medications while the patient is sick. The health care professional will probably recommend an urgent office visit or a visit to the emergency department. Persistent nausea and vomiting can be a sign of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or other serious illnesses. DKA can threaten life. Small sore(s) or ulcer on the foot or leg. Any non-healing sore or ulcer on the feet or legs of a diabetic person must be evaluated by a medical professional. Even a sore less than 1 inch wide, not draining pus, and not exposing deep tissue or bone should be evaluated by a health care professional. When you contact a health care professional, tell the person you are concerned because you or someone you know has diabetes. The patient will probably be referred to a nurse who will ask questions and initially recommend what to do. Be prepared for this conversation. Have handy by the phone a list of all medications and nutritional , medical problems, to medicines, and a blood sugar diary. The nurse may need any or all of this information to decide both the urgency of the patient's condition and how best to treat the problem. The following situations can become medical emergencies (call 911) and warrant an immediate visit to a hospital emergency department. Anyone with a severe diabetic complication should travel to an emergency department by car or ambulance. If the person is unable to speak for himself or herself, a companion should accompany him or her to speak with the health care professional. Always bring a complete and current list of medical problems, medications, nutritional , to medications, and the person's blood sugar diary to the emergency department. This information will help the health care professional diagnose the problem and treat it appropriately. Signs and symptoms of diabetic complications that warrant emergency care Lethargy, agitation, forgetfulness, or just strange behavior can be a sign of low or high blood sugar levels. If a person with diabetes has an altered mental status, then try giving him or her some fruit juice (about 6 ounces) or cake icing if the person is awake enough to swallow normally without . Avoid giving things that can lodge in the throat, such as hard candy. The health care professional can prescribe glucose wafers or gels that melt under the tongue or (a medication given into the nose or by injection). If a diabetic person does not wake up within about 5 minutes and behave normally within about 15 minutes, call 911. If the person is not known to have diabetes, these symptoms can be signs of , drug intoxication, , oxygen starvation, and other serious medical conditions. Call 911 immediately. If a diabetic person cannot keep down food, medications, or fluids at all, he or she may have diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar hyperglycemic nonketotic (HONK) syndrome, or another complication of diabetes. If he or she has not already taken his or her latest insulin dose or oral diabetes medicine, then contact a medical professional. If he or she already has low blood sugar levels, taking additional insulin or medication may drive the blood sugar level down even further, possibly to dangerous levels. If the primary health care professional cannot see the patient right away, seek emergency care for a person with diabetes and high fever. Note any other symptoms such as , painful urination, , or chest pain. If the person’s blood sugar level is above 400 mg/dL, and the primary health care professional cannot see him or her right away, go to the closest emergency department. High blood sugar levels can be a sign of DKA or HONK syndrome. Both conditions can be fatal if not treated promptly. For a diabetic person, a nonhealing sore larger than 1 inch in diameter can be a sign of a potentially limb-threatening infection. Other signs and symptoms that merit immediate care are exposed bone or deep tissue , large areas of surrounding redness and warmth, swelling, and severe pain in the foot or leg. Left untreated, such a sore may ultimately require amputation of the limb. Any cut penetrating all the layers of skin, especially on the legs, is a potential danger to a person with diabetes. Although important to anyone's recovery, proper is critical in diabetic people to assure proper wound healing. Take seriously any or arms (particularly in the middle of the chest or along the left side), and immediately seek medical attention. Diabetic people are more likely than nondiabetic people to have a , with or without experiencing chest pain. Irregular heartbeats and unexplained shortness of breath may also be signs of heart attack. Depending on the location, this can be a sign of heart attack, (dangerous widening of the large artery in the abdomen), DKA, or interrupted blood flow to the bowels. All these are more common in people with diabetes than in the general population. All are potentially life-threatening. People with diabetes also get other common causes of severe abdominal pain, such as , perforated ulcer, inflammation and infection of the gallbladder, , and bowel obstruction. Severe pain anywhere in the body is a signal for timely medical attention. Diabetes: What Raises and Lowers Your Blood Sugar Level? What Tests Do Health Care Professionals Use to Diagnose Diabetes? Doctors use common tests to diagnose diabetes and monitor blood sugar control. The health care professional will take a history including information about the patient's symptoms, risk factors for diabetes, past medical problems, current medications, allergies to medications, family history of diabetes, or other medical problems (such as or heart disease), and personal habits and lifestyle. Various laboratory tests can confirm the diagnosis of diabetes. This rapid test may be performed anywhere, including community-based screening programs. Although not as accurate as testing blood in a hospital laboratory, a fingerstick blood glucose test is easy to perform, and the adequate result is available quickly. The test involves sticking the patient's finger for a tiny blood sample. The blood drop is placed on a strip to be inserted into a machine that reports the blood sugar level. These portable machines are accurate to within about 10%-20% of true laboratory values. Fingerstick blood glucose values tend to be most inaccurate at very high or very low levels. Abnormally low or high results should be confirmed by repeat testing. Point-of-care testing is how most people with diabetes monitor their blood sugar levels at home. The patient will be asked to eat or drink nothing for eight hours before having blood drawn, usually first thing in the morning. If the blood glucose level is greater than or equal to 126 mg/dL (without eating anything) at any age, the person probably has diabetes. If the result is unclear, further testing may be performed to confirm diabetes. Such testing can be a fasting plasma glucose repeated on a different day, an oral glucose tolerance test (described below), or a fingerstick (called """" and described below). If fasting plasma glucose level is greater than 100 mg/dL but less than 126 mg/dL, then the patient has impaired fasting glucose, or IFG. IFG is prediabetes. Though patients with IFG do not yet have diabetes, they carry high risk of developing diabetes in the near future. After fasting for at least six hours, the health care professional draws blood to measure plasma glucose before and at two hours after drinking a specific sweet drink (which contains up to 75 grams of sugar). If the blood sugar level rises to 200 mg/dL or higher, the patient has diabetes. If the blood glucose level rises to between 140 and 199 mg/dL after the sugary drink, then the patient has impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). IGT is also a prediabetic condition. This test measures how high the blood sugar levels have been over approximately the last 120 days, which is the average life span of the red blood cells on which this test is based. Glucose attaches naturally on hemoglobin in red blood cells and stays there for the remaining life of the red blood cell. The percentage of hemoglobin with attached sugar can be measured in a small blood drop, obtained by fingerstick or blood draw. The is a practical measure of blood sugar control in most people with diabetes. The normal hemoglobin A1c value is under 6%. Hemoglobin A1c levels at or below 7% indicate good glucose control. Results at or above 8% indicate blood sugar levels are high too often. The hemoglobin A1c test is most useful for diabetes follow-up care. Though occasionally suboptimal for diagnosing diabetes, hemoglobin A1c above 6% is highly suggestive of diabetes. Often another test will support the diagnosis of diabetes. The hemoglobin A1c is usually measured about every three to six months in people with diabetes. It may be done more frequently for people with difficulty achieving and maintaining good blood sugar control. This test is rarely used to document chronic hypoglycemia in nondiabetic patients. Normal values may vary from laboratory to laboratory. Various treatments exist for diabetes. T1D requires insulin (by multiple daily injections or a pump), diabetic diet, and other lifestyle modifications. T2D is generally treated with diabetic diet, lifestyle changes (such as moderate to vigorous exercise), and medication(s). Are There Home Remedies (, Exercise, and Glucose Monitoring) for Diabetes? If a person has diabetes, healthful lifestyle choices in diet, exercise, , and other habits will help improve glycemic (blood sugar) control and prevent or minimize complications from diabetes. A healthy diet is key to controlling blood sugar levels and preventing . Patients who are obese and have had difficulty losing weight on their own should talk to a health care professional. He or she can recommend a dietitian, help set feasible goals, or supervise a weight-modification program. Eat a consistent, well-balanced diet high in fiber, low in saturated fat, low in concentrated sweets, and eliminate excess calories. A consistent diet includes roughly the same number of calories at predictably similar times of day. Such a disciplined diet helps match the correct dose of insulin or other medications. A healthy diet helps keep the blood sugar level relatively even. A healthy, predictable diet avoids excessively low or high blood sugar levels, which can be dangerous and even life-threatening. In any form, regular exercise helps reduce the risk of developing diabetes. Activity can reduce the risk of developing diabetes-related complications such as heart disease, , kidney failure, blindness, and leg ulcers. As little as 20 minutes of three times a week has proven beneficial. Any exercise is beneficial. No matter how easy or how long, some exercise is better than no exercise. Reducing the time spent sitting is helpful. Patients who have diabetes-related complications (such as eye, kidney, or nerve problems) may be limited in both the type of exercise and the amount of exercise they can safely perform. Consult your health care professional before starting any exercise program. Moderate or eliminate alcohol consumption. One drink is considered 1.5 ounces of liquor, 6 ounces of wine, or 12 ounces of beer. Adult men should not consume more than seven alcoholic in a week, and never more than two drinks in an evening. Adult women should not consume more than three alcoholic drinks in a week, and never more than one drink in an evening. Excessive alcohol use is a known risk factor for T2D. Alcohol consumption can cause low or high blood sugar levels, cause (neuritis), and increase . If a diabetic person smokes cigarettes or uses any other form of , he or she dramatically raises his or her risks for nearly all diabetes-related complications. damages blood vessels. contributes to heart disease, stroke, and poor circulation in the limbs. People who need help to quit tobacco use should talk to a health care professional. Check blood sugar levels frequently, then record the results in a logbook or digital record. At a minimum, check blood sugar before meals and at bedtime. The glucose log should include the doses and times of administration for insulin or oral medications, when and what the person ate, when and for how long the person exercised, and any significant events of the day (such as high or low blood sugar levels and how the person treated the problem). Many mobile applications (""apps"") exist to help log and share data. Simple equipment exists to test sugar levels less painfully and more conveniently. The daily sugar diary is invaluable both to self-management and to professional evaluation of responses to medications, diet, and exercise. Medicare pays for diabetic testing supplies, as do many private insurers and Medicaid. Continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) are useful devices that measure and log glucose levels under the skin. CGMs and their logs can be highly helpful tools for managing diabetes. CGMs must be calibrated carefully with blood glucose monitoring. Treatment of diabetes is highly individualized. Treatment depends on the specific type of diabetes, co-existing medical problems, presence of diabetes-related complications, and the physical and mental skills of the affected person. A health care team helps set healthy and feasible goals for lifestyle changes, blood sugar control, and treatment. Together, the affected person and his or her health care team formulate a plan to help meet these goals. Education about diabetes and its treatment is essential. At the initial diagnosis of diabetes, the health care team will spend much time educating the patient about the condition, treatment, and practical skills for daily self-care. The diabetes care team includes the health care professional and support staff. A professional dietitian and a diabetes educator are usually part of the team. The team may include specialists in hormone health (endocrinology), foot care (podiatry), , kidney diseases (nephrology), eye diseases (ophthalmology), and behavioral health (psychology or psychiatry). Among reputable sources, the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Disease (NIDDK) provides information on diabetes and related research including clinical trials. The health care team will encounter the patient at appropriate intervals to monitor progress and evaluate goals. Treatment of T1D involves multiple daily injections of insulin or continuous insulin delivery by a pump. Daily injections usually combine short-acting insulin (e.g., lispro [], aspart [ or Fiasp], regular) and a long-acting insulin (e.g., NPH, lente, glargine [ or Basaglar], detemir []). Insulin must be given as an injection just under the skin. If taken by mouth, insulin would be destroyed in the stomach before it could get into the blood where it is needed. Most people with T1D inject themselves. Even if someone else usually injects the insulin, every person taking insulin must know how to inject insulin in case the other person is unavailable. A trained professional will show the patient how to store and inject insulin. Usually this is a nurse or a diabetes educator. Fast-acting insulin is usually injected three or four times each day, generally around mealtimes. Dosage is individualized and tailored to the patient's specific needs. Long-acting insulin formulations are typically administered once or twice each day. Some people prefer to receive fast-acting insulin continuously by infusion pumps. Supplemental mealtime insulin is programmed into the pump by the individual in consultation with his or her health care team. It is important to match food intake with insulin dosing, because insulin lowers blood sugar regardless of whether a person eats or not. If excessive insulin is received relative to food intake, the result may be hypoglycemia. This is called an . During the adjustment period after initial diagnosis, the individual learns how insulin affects him or her. He or she learns how to time meals and exercise with insulin injections to keep blood sugar levels as even as possible. Many people with diabetes struggle with adjustment to their condition, especially maintaining high motivation and resilience after many years coping with diabetes. Keeping accurate records of sugar levels and insulin dosages is crucial for diabetes management. Eating a consistent, healthy diet appropriate for the patient's diagnosis and weight is essential to control sugar levels and to prevent diabetes-related complications. Depending on several factors upon diagnosis of T2D, the person may be able to control blood sugar through lifestyle changes, without medication. Such factors include but are not limited to the patient’s age, motivation, self-discipline with diet and exercise, duration of T2D prior to clinical diagnosis, and co-existing conditions. For obese people with T2D, the best initial approach includes dietary restrictions and an exercise program under the supervision of a physician with the aim of weight loss. This course will generally be tried for three to six months. If blood sugar and glycosylated hemoglobin remain high, then the person will receive oral medication, usually a sulfonylurea or biguanide ( []). Even on medication, a healthy diet and physical activity are essential to lose weight or to maintain a healthy weight. People should perform moderate to vigorous physical activity as often as possible. The health care professional will carefully monitor the patient's progress on medication. The therapeutic goals are the right dose(s) of the right medication(s) at the right time(s) to control blood sugar levels with few side effects. Over time, people with T2D often require insulin injections to control their sugar levels. People with T2D commonly take a combination of oral medication and insulin injections to control sugar levels. Many different types of medications are available to help lower blood sugar levels in people with T2D. Each medication works in a different way. Combining two or more medications commonly gets better outcomes. These stimulate the pancreas to release more insulin. Sometimes, the pancreas lacks enough stored insulin to respond adequately to sulfonylurea. These decrease the amount of glucose produced by the liver by improving its sensitivity to insulin. These slow absorption of starch as a person eats, which slows down the rise of blood glucose level during and after meals. These increase tissue sensitivity to insulin but are restricted in the U.S. market. These stimulate the pancreas to release more insulin. These stimulate the pancreas to release more insulin more quickly. Sodium-glucose co-transporter 1 (SGLT2) inhibitors: These block reabsorption of glucose by the kidney, leading to increased glucose excretion and reduction of blood sugar levels. are more common with SGLT2 inhibitors due to higher sugar levels in the urine. Amylin is a naturally occurring hormone secreted by the pancreas along with insulin. Amylin derivatives, such as (), help lower blood sugar levels after meals when insulin alone does not. Pramlintide is injected subcutaneously along with insulin. These promote insulin release by the pancreas. They mimic other natural actions that lower blood sugar level. () was the first incretin mimetic agent approved in the U.S. It is indicated for T2D in addition to metformin (Glucophage) or a sulfonylurea, when these agents alone cannot control the sugar level. Only synthetic types of human insulin are available in the U.S., since they are less likely to cause allergic reactions than the animal-derived insulin used in the past. Different formulations of insulin are categorized according to action onset and duration. Commercial mixtures of insulin sometimes provide constant (basal) control and immediate control. Rapid-acting insulin formulations: Prompt insulin zinc (Semilente, slightly slower acting) Intermediate-acting insulin formulations: Isophane insulin, neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) (, ) Long-acting insulin formulations: Both T1D and T2D create high blood sugar levels, called hyperglycemia. Over years, hyperglycemia damages the of the eye, blood vessels of the kidneys and other organs, and the nerves. Damage to the retina from diabetes () is the leading cause of acquired blindness. Damage to the kidneys from diabetes () is the leading cause of acquired kidney failure. Damage to the nerves from diabetes () is a major cause of foot wounds and ulcers. It remains the leading cause of nontraumatic amputations of feet and legs. Damage to the nerves in the autonomic can lead to paralysis of the stomach (gastroparesis), , and an inability to control heart rate and during postural changes (dysautonomia). Diabetes accelerates , (the formation of fatty plaques inside the arteries), which can lead to blockages or a clot (thrombus). Such changes can then lead to heart attack, stroke, and decreased circulation in the arms and legs (). Diabetes predisposes people to elevated blood pressure (), high levels of and . Both independently and together with hyperglycemia, these conditions increase the risk of heart disease, , and other blood vessel complications. Diabetes can contribute to a number of acute medical problems. Acute means coming on suddenly rather than developing slowly over time (chronic). Many are associated with diabetes. Infections are frequently more dangerous in someone with diabetes because the body's normal ability to fight infections is impaired. Infections may worsen glucose control, which further delays recovery from infections. or low blood sugar occurs intermittently in most people with diabetes. It can result from receiving too much diabetes medication or insulin (an insulin reaction), missing a meal, exercising more than usual, drinking too much alcohol, or taking certain medications for other conditions. You should recognize hypoglycemia and must be prepared to treat it at any time. , feeling dizzy, poor concentration, tremor of the hands, and are common symptoms of hypoglycemia. A person can faint or lose consciousness with a if blood sugar level becomes too low. DKA is a serious condition in which uncontrolled hyperglycemia causes dehydration and inadequate insulin allows buildup of blood ketones (acidic waste products). High acid and altered salt levels in the blood can threaten life. DKA typically occurs at the initial diagnosis of T1D and in people with poor glucose control. DKA can be precipitated by infection, stress, , missing medications like insulin, or medical emergencies such as a stroke or heart attack. Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic nonketotic (HONK) syndrome is a serious condition in which high blood sugar level leads to severe dehydration. When the body tries to rid its excess sugar via the urine, this can cause severe dehydration leading to , coma, and even death. HONK syndrome typically occurs in people with T2D who are not controlling their sugar levels, who have become dehydrated, or who have stress, injury, stroke, or are taking certain medications, like steroids. A person with diabetes should be checked regularly for early signs of diabetic complications. A primary health care professional can order some tests. Other tests require referral to a specialist. People with diabetes who have entered or passed should have their eyes checked at least once a year by an eye specialist (ophthalmologist) to screen for , a leading cause of acquired blindness. The urine should be checked for protein (microalbumin) on a regular basis, at least once annually. Urinary protein is an early sign of diabetic nephropathy, a leading cause of acquired kidney failure. Sensation in the legs should be checked regularly using a tuning fork or a monofilament device. is a leading cause of lower extremity ulcers in individuals with diabetes and the leading contributor to nontraumatic amputations of the feet or legs. The health care professional should check the feet and lower legs of adult diabetic patients at every visit for cuts, scrapes, , or other lesions that could become infected. Adults with diabetes should check the soles of their feet and their legs daily with a hand-held mirror or camera, either themselves or with the assistance of a relative or caretaker. The adult patient should be screened regularly for conditions that may contribute to heart disease, such as and . Follow treatment recommendations of your health care team. Keep records of blood sugar levels or CGM results as often as recommended by your health care team, including times when levels were checked, when and how much insulin or medication was taken, when and what was eaten, and when and for how long the patient exercised. Contact your health care professional if you have issues with treatment or symptoms suggesting poor glucose control. Fast-acting glucose should always be available for emergency use in case of hypoglycemia. Glucagon should always be available for emergency use by the patient or patient's support in case of seizure or unconsciousness suspected to be due to hypoglycemia. People with diabetes should always wear a medical identification tag that identifies their diagnosis and shows contact information for their healthcare provider. For children with diabetes, it is appropriate to show contact information for the parent(s). Attend diabetes education classes at the local hospital. The more educated you and your family are about your diabetes, the better your health is likely to be. If taking insulin, you should see your health care professional about every three months at a minimum. Every three to six months is generally adequate for those with uncomplicated diabetes and not taking insulin. Become educated to recognize the signs and symptoms of low blood sugar levels. Have a clear plan for treating low blood sugar levels, and know when to call 911. Mild symptoms include confusion and . These symptoms can progress to lethargy, agitation (sometimes with violent, jerking motions), or . No approach has yet been approved by the FDA to prevent T1D, though recent research showed promising results for teplizumab for some at highest risk of developing T1D. Control weight to normal or near-normal levels by eating a healthy low-fat, high-fiber diet with appropriate content of calories. Regular physical activity is essential to prevent T2D. To control high blood fat levels (e.g., high total ) or high blood pressure, take medications as directed. Lifestyle modifications and/or certain medications can sometimes prevent progression of prediabetes to T2D. Prediabetes can be diagnosed by checking fasting glucose or two hours after ingesting up to 75 grams of glucose (dose based on patient’s weight). If you or someone you know has any type of diabetes, focus on preventing diabetes-related complications. Complications can cause serious disabilities, such as blindness, kidney failure requiring dialysis, amputation, or even death. Tight glucose control! The single best thing people with diabetes can do is to keep their blood sugar level within the suggested range every day. The only way to accomplish this goal is the combination of glucose monitoring, appropriate diet, high personal motivation sustained over time, and appropriate medical treatment. Consult a nutritionist or your health care professional regarding diet. Quit smoking and stop use of other tobacco products. Increase physical activity. Adults should aim for moderate to vigorous physical activity lasting at least 30 minutes every day. Drink adequate amounts of water, and avoid consuming excessive salt. Take care of your skin. Keep it supple and hydrated to avoid sores and cracks that can become infected. Brush and floss your at least twice every day. Encounter your dentist and dental hygienist regularly to prevent tooth decay and . Wash and examine your feet daily. Including the soles, look for small cuts, sores, or blisters that may worsen. File toenails to avoid damaging the surrounding skin, rather than cutting them. A specialist in foot care (podiatrist) may be necessary to help care for your feet. Diabetes is a leading cause of death in all industrialized nations. Overall, the risk of premature death of people with diabetes is twice that of people without diabetes. Prognosis depends on the duration of diabetes, degree of blood sugar control, and development of complications. About 15% of people with T1D die before age 40 years, which is about 20 times the rate of this age group in the general population. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), kidney failure, and heart disease compose the most common causes of death related to T1D. The good news is prognosis improves with good sugar control. Maintaining tight blood (or CGM) sugar control prevents, slows the progression of, and can improve established complications of T1D. The life expectancy of people who are diagnosed with T2D during their 40s decreases by five to 10 years because of the disease. Heart disease leads the causes of death related to T2D. Aim for excellent glycemic control, tight blood pressure control, keeping the ""bad"" (LDL) level at the recommended level below 100 mg/dL (or even lower, particularly if other risk factors for cardiovascular disease are present), and keeping the ""good"" () cholesterol as high as possible. When indicated, can prevent, slow the progression of, and improve established complications related to diabetes. What Types of Health Care Professionals Treat Diabetes? Most primary care providers have experience managing diabetes, including internists, gynecologists, and family practitioners. Specialists in diabetes care are called endocrinologists or diabetologists. You can locate endocrinologists using the ""Find an Endocrinologist"" search engine online at the . You can locate a pediatric endocrinologist for diabetic youth using the ""Find a Doctor"" search engine of the . Are There Support Groups and Counseling for People With Diabetes?

An individual nutrition plan will depend on many things, including underlying health and level of physical activity, the types of medication(s) being taken, and personal preference. Most people with type 2 diabetes find that having a fairly regular schedule for meals and snacks is helpful. Eating a variety of foods and watching portion sizes is also recommended.

Join the Masterclass to Take Immediate Control of Your Diabetes Health Start feeling better, gain energy, lose weight, and reduce your medication costs quickly Article written and reviewed by  What’s The Difference Between Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes? Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes are two of the on the planet, and combine to affect more than (10.5% of the population). The main difference between the two forms of diabetes is actually quite simple. in which your body’s immune system mistakenly targets insulin-producing beta cells for destruction. Type 2 diabetes, on the other hand, is not an autoimmune condition. With type 2 diabetes, your body can produce insulin, but it is not sufficient to control your blood glucose thanks to a condition called . According to the , type 1 diabetes is less common, occurring in 1.5-2 million people in the United States (5-10% of cases). Type 2 diabetes is more common, occurring in 31-32 million people (90-95% of cases). Prediabetes is the precursor condition to type 2 diabetes, and is estimated to affect another 88 million more people in the US. , of those with prediabetes, more than 84% of them don’t even know it. Type 1 diabetes is , . Meanwhile, type 2 more in life. However, while they both manifest in the same initial symptoms, their causes and overall treatment plan can be very different. In this article, we’ll explore the differences between type 1 and type 2 diabetes in detail. We’ll touch on their causes, risk factors, symptoms, and diagnoses. We’ll also touch on their complications, as well as prevention and treatment strategies. What’s The Difference Between Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes? Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease in which your body’s immune system in your pancreas. This drastically reduces the ability of your body to , the hormone responsible for signaling tissues that glucose is available in your blood, and people with type 1 diabetes require insulin (externally supplied from a syringe, pen, or insulin pump). Sometimes called “juvenile-onset diabetes,” type 1 diabetes typically occurs in , though this is not always the case. Currently, researchers of type 1 diabetes, and there is no known cure. However, through diet and lifestyle, this form of insulin-dependent diabetes can be controlled and managed. For more in-depth information on type 1 diabetes, you can visit our on the topic. Type 2 diabetes manifests as a result of a condition called , which is a buildup of fat in cells that are not meant to store fat. In its early stages, type 2 diabetes is referred to as “non-insulin-dependent”, which means that your beta cells are still capable of producing insulin at levels that would be sufficient without insulin resistance. In later stages, type 2 diabetes can become classified as “insulin-dependent”, in which your beta cells have become worn down from overproduction, and can no longer produce sufficient insulin. Traditionally, this type of diabetes manifests later in life as a result of diet and lifestyle factors, and is often called “adult-onset” diabetes. Unlike type 1 diabetes, which can be effectively managed, most cases of type 2 diabetes can be entirely reversed if caught early enough. For more in-depth information on type 2 diabetes, you can explore our on the subject. One of the main areas that these diabetes types differ is through their causes, which are detailed below. Type 1 diabetes is caused by an autoimmune reaction that originates from foreign pathogenic proteins from viruses, bacteria, and/or specific foods using a phenomenon known as . Molecular mimicry, a sneaky tactic used by various bacteria and viruses in which pathogenic proteins attempt to evade detection by the human immune system by “disguising” themselves as mammalian proteins. When these foreign proteins mimic the structure of proteins found on the surface of insulin-producing beta cells, cells in your immune system mistakenly attack beta cells, crippling their ability to manufacture and secrete insulin. The exact triggers of type 1 diabetes are documented, but are still being actively researched. For more information about molecular mimicry, in which we talk about this process in detail. In addition, researchers have discovered certain antigens that can may cause type 1 diabetes, including: (MAP), a mycobacterium present in dairy and meat products , associated with in young children with increased genetic susceptibility to type I diabetes, Childhood consumption of cow’s milk, often before 1 year of age Mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis (MAP) in dairy and meat products In essence, type 1 diabetes is a disease that manifests beyond your control, while type 2 diabetes is loosely determined by your genetics and largely determined by your lifestyle. Both type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes have the same primary side effect: hyperglycemia, or a chronically high blood glucose. The of type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes, therefore, tend to be similar. Type 1 diabetes is often diagnosed with extremely high blood glucose values that occur during , whereas type 2 diabetes is often diagnosed with more moderate hyperglycemia. For this reason, the differences between these two conditions can vary slightly (bolded below). Both type 1 and type 2 diabetes are related to your genetics. Type 1 diabetes has a stronger genetic connection than type 2 diabetes, meaning that if a family member is also living with type 1 diabetes, the chances of developing the condition are higher. Type 2 diabetes on the other hand has a weak genetic component. While it is true that a family history of type 2 diabetes can increase your risk, your lifestyle is the primary determinant of your diabetes risk. With type 1 diabetes, significant evidence suggests that both dietary proteins and viral infections can trigger the destruction of beta cells, eventually causing type 1 diabetes. Despite this, significant research is still required to gain more clarity on the exact causes of beta cell autoimmunity. Type 2 diabetes, on the other hand, has a wide variety of , of which the vast majority are controllable. Childhood consumption of cow’s milk, often before 1 year of age Mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis (MAP) in dairy and meat products Diet high in fats, processed foods, and artificial sweeteners Previous diagnosis of gestational diabetes mellitus Just like the causes, the risk factors of type 1 diabetes are primarily uncontrollable, while the risk factors of type 2 diabetes are primarily related to your lifestyle. Both type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes may be detected using the same initial diagnostic tests, including an or an . While both of these tests identify your body’s inability to sufficiently metabolize glucose, the presence of type 1 diabetes requires the two tests listed below. Definitively diagnosing type 1 diabetes requires two further tests: A to measure your endogenous insulin production A to detect the presence of autoantibodies A complete diabetes antibody panel includes detection of the five following antibodies: Glutamic Acid Decarboxylase Autoantibodies (GADA or Anti-GAD) Testing positive for one or more of these antibodies indicates the presence of beta cell autoimmunity. The presence of one or more diabetes autoantibodies (anti-GAD, IA-2A, ICA, IAA, or ZnT8Ab) A random finger stick blood glucose greater than 200 mg/dL An Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) with a blood glucose value exceeding 200 mg/dL at any time Type 1 and type 2 diabetes share the vast majority of their from hyperglycemia, including low energy, weight gain, increased risk for cardiovascular disease, , and (Alzheimer’s disease). The most common complication of type 2 diabetes is heart disease, and that cardiovascular disease accounts for up to 80% of the excess mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes. Nonvascular causes of include cancer, , , and pneumonia. The most common complication of type 1 diabetes is heart disease, and suggests that 65 percent of all people living with type 1 diabetes for more than 20 years will die of cardiovascular disease and that more than 50 percent of people living with type 1 diabetes for more than 30 years will die of kidney failure. In 2015, researchers published a of all people living with type 1 diabetes in Scotland. The most significant cause of death was heart disease (36% in men, 31% in women). Damage to macrovascular (large) and microvascular (small) blood vessels Damage to macrovascular (large) and microvascular (small) blood vessels The preventative tactics for type 2 diabetes listed below will vastly improve your overall health, even if you are living with type 1 diabetes. Since type 2 diabetes is primarily a result of lifestyle choices, it can be prevented by making lifestyle changes. While these strategies can delay or prevent the onset of type 2 diabetes, they may not delay or prevent the onset of type 1 diabetes. There are currently no known ways to definitively prevent type 1 diabetes, however you may be able to reduce your risk for type 1 diabetes by delaying the introduction of cow’s milk until a minimum of one year of age, or preventing its introduction altogether. Following a and integrating regular exercise can dramatically reduce your risk of developing type 2 diabetes, and have other benefits like achieving your ideal body weight, increasing your energy, and reducing your risk for many chronic diseases. Delaying the introduction of cow’s milk until a minimum of one year of age Preventing the introduction of cow’s milk altogether The treatment plan for both type 1 and type 2 diabetes depends on your c-peptide value. For those with a medium to high c-peptide value (greater than 1.0 ng/mL), insulin therapy is likely not required, but may become necessary over time. For those with a low c-peptide value (less than 1.0 ng/mL), insulin therapy may be necessary to counteract an insulin deficiency. Insulin injections can be administered via a pen, syringe, or insulin pump, and is necessary in those with a low c-peptide value to ensure that your body has sufficient insulin to properly control your blood glucose within range. With both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, the same lifestyle changes used for prevention — a low-fat, plant-based, whole-food diet, intermittent fasting, and daily movement — are also the most effective treatment to maximize your insulin sensitivity and reduce your chronic disease risk. With type 1 diabetes (or insulin-dependent type 2 diabetes), the end goal is to reduce or eliminate insulin resistance, so that you can: Reduce or eliminate your need for oral medications With non-insulin-dependent type 2 diabetes, the end goal is to fully reverse insulin resistance so that you can fully reverse type 2 diabetes altogether. Reduce or eliminate your need for oral medications Reverse insulin resistance to effectively manage type 1 diabetes and minimize your chronic disease risk Reverse insulin resistance, in order to fully reverse type 2 diabetes As you can see above, the most powerful prevention and treatment methods for all forms of diabetes are in your hands. Through adjustments to your diet, strategies like intermittent fasting, and daily movement, you can transform your body, gain control of type 1 diabetes, or entirely reverse type 2 diabetes.

Coronary Heart Disease and ABO Blood Group in Diabetic Women: A Case-Control Study Coronary Heart Disease and ABO Blood Group in Diabetic Women: A Case-Control Study     , Article number:  () Numerous investigations conducted in general population have reported that certain ABO blood group may increase the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). However, this association has not been yet well established and even is less clear in diabetic patients. Considering that women with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are at greater risk to develop CHD and have higher cardiovascular mortality, this study aimed to evaluate the association between CHD and ABO blood group in women with T2DM. A case control study of eight hundred eighty-one (881) diabetic women was enrolled in this study. Among them, two hundred thirty eight (238) patients were identified to have CHD (CHD+) and two hundred eighty two (282) of them were identified without CHD but matched with the first group for other CHD risk factors (CHD−). ABO blood type (A, B, AB, O, and Rhesus factor) for both groups were determined. To compare the magnitude of the correlation between various blood groups with CHD development, odd ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) was calculated. Our results demonstrates that the percentage of AB blood group was significantly higher in the diabetic women with concurrent CHD than in those without CHD [30 (12.7%) . 13 (4.6%), Odd ratio: 2.9 (95%CI: 1.5–5.7), P = 0.001]. The results of the present study clearly demonstrate that the AB blood group has a higher odd ratio for the development of CHD and can be considered as a risk factor for the development of CHD in females with T2DM. More comprehensive studies are required to confirm these results. Coronary heart disease (CHD) is more common among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The male sex is considered an important risk factor for CHD in the general population, but studies on diabetic patients suggest that diabetic women have a higher risk of developing CHD. In addition, women with concomitant T2DM and CHD achieve LDL-C goals less than men do. In fact, cardiovascular mortality is almost doubled in diabetic women compared to men. There are several risk factors attributed to CHD such as hypertension, family history of CHD, obesity, cigarette smoking, older age, and lipid abnormalities. Some of the risk factors are shared between diabetes mellitus and CHD, which can potentiate comorbidity of these two non-communicable disorders. In addition, diabetes mellitus, itself, is a proven risk factor for CHD. Given that CHD is the major cause of mortality in diabetic patients, seeking for other probable risk factors to develop CHD in diabetic patients is of utmost importance. Numerous investigations have reported that certain ABO blood group can increase people’s susceptibility to some disorders, including cancers and infectious diseases. Various investigations have also been conducted to determine the role of ABO blood group on CHD development. In some studies, conducted in the general population, non-O blood groups were identified as potential risk factor for the development of cardiovascular diseases. Moreover, CHD was less common among individuals with the O blood group. In addition, some studies have reported a significant association between the A and B alleles and cardiovascular disease. Although higher prevalence rates of T2DM have been reported among individuals with certain blood groups, we could not find any research that specifically evaluates the role of ABO blood groups in the development of CHD in diabetic patients. Due to the close comorbidity of T2DM and CHD, especially in female patients, this study was designed to evaluate, for the first time, the association between ABO blood groups and the development of CHD among diabetic women in Iran. This case control study was conducted among women with T2DM living in the north of Iran in the Mazandaran province, city of Sari. Eight hundred and eighty-one (881) outpatient diabetic women referred to the academic diabetes clinic of ‘Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences’, between March 2015 to January 2016. They were selected using the purposive sampling method. To diagnose T2DM, the American Diabetes Association criteria were employed. Additionally, individuals who were taking medications for their T2DM at the time were also enrolled in the study. The student research committee and ethics committee of ‘Mazandaran University of medical sciences’ approved the research protocol (code 94–277). The informed consent was obtained from all participants. All enrolled subjects were evaluated for CHD. Diagnostic methods were based on the American College of Cardiology Foundation and the American Heart Association (ACCF/AHA) guidelines and regulations published and updated for the diagnosis and management of patients with stable ischemic heart disease (SIHD) in 2012 and 2014. Some patients had documented CHD: previous myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), coronary stent placement, balloon angioplasty, or just angiographically confirmed coronary artery disease. The patients without documented CHD were referred to a cardiologist for CHD evaluation. At first a functional study (exercise stress test or radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging for patients who were unable to exercise) was conducted. If the functional study results were positive, coronary angiography was performed. The case group included diabetic women with CHD (CHD+) and the control group (CHD−) included diabetic women who had negative exercise or nuclear stress tests and/or normal angiography results, but had matching CHD risk factors (age, duration of diabetes, lipid profile, blood pressure, body mass index and smoking), with the case group. Pregnant patients, and those who had liver disease of different etiologies, malignancies, or serum creatinine levels higher than 2 mg/dl, were excluded from this study. The standard, slide agglutination technique was performed to determine the ABO blood group in both case and control subjects. Normally distributed variables were presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Independent t-test and chi-square tests were used to compare the quantitative and qualitative variables between the two groups, respectively. Odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used to compare the magnitudes of the correlations of the various blood groups with CHD development. -values < 0.05 were deemed statistically significant. Of the 881 diabetic women enrolled in this study, 238 were confirmed to have CHD and were considered as the case group (CHD+). CHD evaluation was negative in other 643 subjects. Among those, 282 subjects were matched with the CHD+ group for other cardiac risk factors such as: age, body mass index (BMI), systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP), hemoglobin, lipid profile, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), duration of T2DM, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and plasma creatinine levels. These patients were considered as the control group (CHD−) (Table ). The history of CHD in the first-degree relatives of the patients was not significantly different between the two groups (p = 0.871). The mean age and duration of diabetes in CHD+ and CHD− groups were 59.03 ± 9.19 vs 59.02 ± 9.35 years (p = 0.995) and 11.41 ± 7.27 vs 11.91 ± 5.92 years (p = 0.385) respectively. Fourteen patients (6.3%) in CHD+ group and sixteen patients (6.2%) in CHD− group were smokers (p = 0.961). None of the patients reported alcohol consumption. Thirty percent (30%) of patients in CHD+ group and 14.9% in CHD− group received insulin to control their blood glucose level (p = 0.729). Blood groups were determined using specific antibodies by agglutination method. The prevalence of blood group in the CHD+ and CHD− are shown in Fig. . Our results showed that the percentage of AB blood group was statistically higher in the diabetic women with concurrent CHD than in those without CHD (12.3 vs. 4.7%). The odds of CHD occurring in diabetic women with AB blood group, compared to the odds (OR) of the CHD occurring in diabetic women with non-AB blood groups was 2.9 (CI: 1.5–5.7) (P = 0.001). The results showed no significant differences in the percentage of the other blood groups between CHD+ and CHD−groups. The percentage of the non-O blood groups was higher in the patients with CHD, however this difference did not reach significance (65 vs. 58.2%, P = 0.104). The percentage of the A and B blood groups in the CHD+ and CHD− groups were (27.8 vs. 24.1%, P = 0.304) and (24.9 vs. 29.4%, P = 0.236) respectively. The Rhesus factor (RH) was positive in 219 (92.0%) of the cases and 263 (93.3%) of the controls (P = 0.705). Association between AB blood group type and CHD risk factors In order to determine the cause-association between the blood group and CHD, we compared other cardiac risk factors in CHD+ group between AB blood group and non-AB blood group (Table ). We found that the systolic blood pressure was slightly higher in the AB blood group but this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.065).There were no statistical differences in any other risk factors between the two groups. Researchers have been trying to evaluate the association between ABO blood groups and various disorders for years; including studies to determine the association between ABO group and the development of CHD. However, there are currently no study on diabetic patients addressing the correlation between ABO blood groups and the development of CHD. The present study, to the best of our knowledge, is the first study that focuses on diabetic women and shows a correlation between AB blood group and the development of CHD. Non-O blood groups have been introduced as a CHD risk factor, and it has been suggested that people with the non-O blood group have more serious coronary artery stenosis than those with O blood group. In a prospective, five-year study conducted by Medalie and colleagues, among 10,000 males, subjects with blood group A, B, and AB experienced higher rates of myocardial infarction than those with other blood groups. There is no consensus regarding the importance of non-O blood groups (A, B, or AB) in the risk of CHD development. Some researchers have suggested the A blood group to be a CHD risk factor, while others have suggested the B and AB blood groups to be risk factors. In addition, none of the above studies focused on diabetic patients and more specifically on diabetic women. In study conducted by Meade and colleagues, among 1393 male subjects, the blood groups of subjects were determined, and they were followed for about 16 years. Similar to our study, they reported significantly higher incidences of CHD among the individuals with AB blood group than those with non-AB blood groups. In addition, a combined analysis of two large, prospective cohort studies (the Nurses’ Health Study [NHS] including 62,073 women and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study [HPFS] including 27,428 men), the incidence rate of CHD per 100,000 person/years was higher in people with non-O blood groups. Compared with individuals with O blood groups, individuals with blood groups A, B, or AB had a 5%, 11%, and 23% increased risk of developing CHD in an age-adjusted model, respectively. The adjusted hazard ratios [95% CI] for the incidences of CHD in participants with blood groups A, B, or AB, compared with participants with blood group O, were 1.06 [0.99–1.15], 1.15 [1.04–1.26], and 1.23 [1.11–1.36]; respectively. The blood group antigens A, B, O have been introduced as a probable independent risk factor for CHD development. The association between ABO blood groups and CHD development can be explained through different mechanisms such as higher incidence of thrombotic events, higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure and/or worse blood lipid profile. In a cohort study, on the 64,686 blood donors aged ≥18 years in Quebec, thrombotic events were higher in subjects with blood group AB compared to blood group O, OR = 1.19 (95% CI: 1.01–1.40). They showed that the events were higher in women aged ≥40 years with A blood group. In the Framingham heart cohort study, non-O blood groups, especially A blood group, were associated with CHD development. Various factors are considered for the development of thrombus in some blood groups.The higher levels or functional modifications of specific endothelial-derived glycoproteins (GPs), specific platelet GPs, and GPs from either source, and/or GPs from additional cells and tissues, might attribute to the increased risk of thrombosis associated with non-O blood groups. Some investigators have reported that elevated plasma levels of Factor VIII and the Von Willebrand factor (VWF) are associated with the higher prevalence rate of thrombotic events. In addition, several studies have demonstrated that patients with AB blood group have the highest levels of VWF, which is associated with thrombus formation. Some other reports have shown that VWF levels are lower among patients with O blood group versus non-O groups. Furthermore, another study has noted that the plasma half-life of VWF was significantly shorter in patients with the O blood group than the non-O groups. Kesteloot and colleagues reported patients with AB blood group to have higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure rates compared with non-AB individuals. Additionally, the role of systolic blood pressure in increasing the risk of CHD has been well documented by various other studies. Number of investigations has noted a positive association between high serum cholesterol levels and CHD in patients with non-O blood groups than those with O blood group. Biswas and colleagues evaluated the distribution of ABO blood groups in CHD patients in India, and reported that the risk of cardiovascular disease in AB blood group is higher than those with other groups. They attributed this finding to a lower concentration of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) in patients with the O blood group and a higher concentration in individuals with the AB blood group, respectively. In our study, the systolic blood pressure was higher in the AB blood group type, although this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.065). In addition, lipid profiles were also comparable between patients with AB and non-AB blood groups. This discrepancy between our results in diabetic women and the aforementioned findings in general population could be explained by the intensive care given to the diabetic patients to control their lipid profile and blood pressure. They often take lipid lowering and/or antihypertensive drugs for some other comorbidity, such as albuminuria, in spite of their normal blood pressures or lipid profiles. One limitation of our study is the lack of data on plasma levels and half-life of VWF, which could provide a more clear association between AB blood group and CHD as mentioned in other studies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case-control study in women with T2DM who evaluates the correlation between the risk of CHD development and various blood groups, in which all patients were matched for baseline and demographic variables. In summary, our current study demonstrates an association between CHD development and AB blood group in women with T2DM. Therefore, we recommend considering AB blood group as another CHD risk factor in daily clinical practice. More comprehensive studies are required to confirm the role of the AB blood group type in CHD in diabetic patients. While there are several studies on the effect of ABO blood group on coronary heart disease, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on T2DM women. Additionally, we went to great lengths to match coronary heart disease risk factors between our cases and controls. We found that the percentage of the AB blood group was significantly higher in T2DM women with concurrent CHD than in those without coronary heart disease. Almdal, T., Scharling, H., Jensen, J.

Diabetes Self-Management offers over 900 diabetes friendly recipes to choose from including desserts, low-carb pasta dishes, savory main meals, grilled options and more. Diabetes was described as early as 1552 BC, but it wasn’t until the late 1800’s that it was linked to the pancreas, and not until 1936 that it was classified into two different types. Today, the cause of , the most common form, is still an open question. Still, scientists are closing in on a more thorough understanding of what Dr. J. Denis McGarry, former Professor of Internal Medicine and Biochemistry at the University of Texas, Southwestern Medical Center, once described as “the enormous complexity of a disease process in which almost every aspect of the body’s metabolism goes awry.” What causes Type 2 diabetes is an important question, not least because people with diabetes want to know why they have it. The questions only go on from there: Could it have been prevented? Can it be reversed? Are my children at risk? Does obesity cause diabetes, or does diabetes cause obesity? Does (the reduced ability of muscle, fat, and other cells to respond to insulin) harm the insulin-producing of the pancreas, or is insulin resistance the result of damaged beta cells? These “chicken and egg” questions are at the heart of current investigations into the cause of Type 2 diabetes. What is immediately apparent is that diabetes is more than a disease; it is a disease process. It begins long before it becomes evident, as much as 15 years before the appearance of any signs or symptoms. More and more, in fact, it is obvious that it begins at conception. “It’s widely felt that genetics plays a role in why some people can be subjected to the obesifying environment in which we live and not develop diabetes, and others can become equally obese and develop it,” says David E. Cummings, MD, Associate Professor of Medicine at Seattle VA Puget Sound Health Care System. “It largely has to do with the health of their beta cells.” There is an undeniable association between obesity and diabetes. In one study, 30% of people newly diagnosed with diabetes had a (BMI) of 25—30 kg/m2, and 60% had a BMI greater than 30 kg/m2. A BMI of 25—30 is considered overweight, and a BMI above 30 is considered obese. Genetic mapping has found a number of genes that are associated with diabetes, and others associated with obesity. Recently, a gene locus was identified that influences the risk of diabetes primarily by increasing fat mass. A study of the Pima Indians of Arizona found an exact match between the locations of an obesity susceptibility gene and a diabetes susceptibility gene. These are the first, but likely not the last, indications that diabetes and obesity may be “co-inherited.” Generally, obesity is believed to be a genetic predisposition, though one that can be compensated for by behavior. As evidence, Dr. Cummings points to studies of identical twins in which both will become obese even if raised in different environments, and studies of fraternal twins (who are not genetically identical) in which one will become obese and one not, even though raised in the same environment. These studies and others demonstrate, he says, that 70% to 80% of obesity has a genetic basis. “The fallacy of the ‘willpower’ argument,” Dr. Cummings says, “is the genetic basis of obesity. It is possible to modify lifestyle and achieve a 5% to 10% reduction in weight, and this should be encouraged, but the biological set-points are difficult to change.” Obesity is a problem because it increases insulin resistance, limiting the body’s ability to use insulin. Insulin resistance is believed to be the first sign of what can become diabetes. As it turns out, fat is not just an inactive tissue that sits there in the body. It produces, especially when inflamed, cytokines (a type of protein) that affect the liver, which in turn produces substances that interfere with insulin usage. Another potentially negative impact of excess fat is that people who are obese have high levels of free fatty acids (FFAs) in their blood. Various tissues take up the FFAs and use them instead of glucose as fuel. The result is insulin resistance and increased blood glucose levels. Obesity is not a guarantee of diabetes, however. In fact, only 20% to 25% of people at risk for diabetes (whether obese or not) will develop abnormal beta-cell function and ultimately diabetes. The reason goes back to Dr. Cumming’s reference to the “health” of the individual’s beta cells, and is thought to be tied to the cells’ genetic programming. An increase in insulin resistance causes the beta cells to compensate by increasing secretion of insulin. In fact, people who are obese and have insulin resistance actually increase the number of beta cells and their output of insulin. This compensation keeps blood glucose levels normal. The compensation can go on for many years, or for a lifetime. People can be obese and even insulin resistant their entire lives and never develop diabetes. In diabetes, however, the compensation either fails to occur at all, or cannot keep up with the insulin resistance. Essentially, the beta cells are either genetically programmed to compensate, or they aren’t. Taken as a whole, the most common contemporary view is that a genetic predisposition to diabetes is necessary – but not sufficient – to develop the disease. The trigger is environmental: obesity (which itself has a genetic basis), aging, and/or lifestyle. Once the process starts, a cascade of dysfunctions occurs: The beta cells begin to fail, there is an increase in glucose secretion by the liver, and insulin resistance increases. The beta cells cannot compensate, and they continue to deteriorate, raising blood glucose levels – a vicious cycle. There is another view, however. Dr. Daniel Porte, Jr., Professor of Medicine at the University of California, San Diego, School of Medicine, and his collaborators have suggested that a “primary defect” in the beta cell reduces insulin secretion. This affects the complex central nervous system regulatory mechanism that controls energy homeostasis, or a state of equilibrium in the body. Specifically, in this theory, reduced insulin availability to the brain causes signals to increase food intake, leading to obesity and subsequent obesity-induced insulin resistance. Ultimately, the same vicious cycle is created. The difference is that the “neurocentric” model places the beginning of the process in the beta cells rather than in excess body fat. The neurocentric model would place more emphasis on environmental factors such as abundant, high-calorie foods and lack of physical activity. Both of these factors enhance the response to the brain’s hunger signals. Another interesting hypothesis that may ultimately support either of the others is the “fetal origins” hypothesis. It has long been observed that there is a relationship between birth weight and the risk of developing diabetes later in life. Some researchers have described the relationship as “linearly inverse”–that is, low birth weight is a predictor of diabetes–while others have described it as “u-shaped,” meaning that there are consequences to both low and high birth weight. Various causal factors that have been suggested include either maternal undernutrition or overnutrition. Notably, a relationship has been observed between the risk of diabetes associated with low birth weight and the risk of later development of diabetes in the father. This could indicate a genetic link in support of the fetal origins hypothesis. Given the genetic link, prevention of diabetes even in the presence of the predisposition is a major research goal. Clinical trials have demonstrated that the number of people who develop diabetes can be reduced by 25% to 62% over a period of three to six years. The concept is to reduce body fat or to counter the effect that excess fat has on insulin resistance. The Finnish Diabetes Study in Finland and the Diabetes Prevention Program in the United States showed that reducing caloric intake and increasing physical activity can reduce the risk that people with impaired glucose tolerance (sometimes called ) will go on to develop diabetes. The “Xenical in the Prevention of Diabetes in Obese Subjects” study combined this kind of intensive lifestyle modification with the weight-loss drug orlistat and produced a 37% relative risk reduction for diabetes compared with lifestyle intervention alone. Several studies using the diabetes drugs known as (Actos and Avandia), , and (brand name Precose) have also resulted in significant risk reductions. There is another way to reduce body fat, and to reduce it dramatically: . A trial in Australia randomly assigned study participants with recently diagnosed Type 2 diabetes to either lifestyle modification or laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (commonly referred to as the Lap-Band procedure). After two years, 73% of the people who had had the Lap-Band surgery were diabetes- free, compared with just 13% of those in the lifestyle group. An even more dramatic result has been reported in studies of the impact of the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass procedure on diabetes and obesity. Some 84% of people who have the surgery have complete remission of diabetes following the procedure. What’s more, a third of those people go into remission before they even leave the hospital, and most of the rest are diabetes-free within a month. “It’s true that gastric bypass surgery causes diabetes to remit long before it would be expected to do so as a result of the weight loss,” Dr. Cummings says. “Also, people who lose weight due to bypass surgery have better glucose tolerance later on than do those who have lost equivalent weight due to diet or banding.” Scientists speculate that the bypass surgery brings other factors into play beyond the loss of weight. One theory is that after bypass, food is brought to the far end of the small intestine more quickly, where it stimulates production of the hormone glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1). GLP-1 stimulates the secretion of insulin and may also send signals of satiety (fullness) to the brain. This “antidiabetic” effect could account for the rapid resolution of diabetes. Another possibility is that the procedure impairs the production of the hormone ghrelin in the stomach. Ghrelin is a hunger hormone and has the opposite effect of GLP-1. This is a treatment, or arguably a cure, for existing Type 2 diabetes. The exciting possibility, however, is the potential for using the procedure to prevent diabetes from developing in obese people who have insulin resistance. Dr. Cummings explains that early in the development of diabetes, the beta cells are overwhelmed and eventually lose the ability to secrete the insulin they’re still producing. However, the cells are not destroyed, and significant weight loss can bring them back to normal functioning. “You might say we should do bypass surgery earlier, because if you wait too long, the cells are gone and you can’t rescue them,” he says. “There is controversy about this approach, but perhaps it would be best to reduce the weight earlier, and skip the 20 years of toxicity from high blood sugar levels and the development of . “The difference between the 84% of people whose diabetes disappeared after bypass surgery and the 16% who remained diabetic,” he points out, “was the length of time they had the disease.” The Swedish Obese Subjects Study compared surgical versus nonsurgical interventions in 4,000 obese people and found that people in the surgical group not only had improved remission of diabetes, but also improved prevention of new diabetes. There is even evidence that bariatric surgery lowers long-term mortality. The final answer, or answers, will take some time. As recently as 2008, researchers at Joslin Diabetes Center published work demonstrating that insulin resistance in the liver alone could, in mice, cause the development of metabolic syndrome. The metabolic syndrome is a collection of conditions – , high , glucose intolerance, and obesity – that is generally viewed as a precursor to diabetes. The Joslin researchers tested their hypothesis by genetically engineering mice with no insulin receptors in their livers, mimicking insulin resistance in the organ. The mice developed many of the conditions of metabolic syndrome and, when fed a high-fat diet, they all developed coronary artery disease. The control animals with normal livers did not display these results, leading to the conclusion that if insulin uptake in the liver is compromised, the metabolic syndrome and, potentially, diabetes will result. The study did not address the possible cause of insulin resistance in the liver in humans, so it opens yet another line of investigation into the cause or causes of Type 2 diabetes.

It can be hard to know where to start, but just letting someone know you care can make all the difference. Low mood can prevent good self-care of your diabetes, make it harder to reach your blood glucose targets, and increase the risks of diabetes related complications. Type 1 and type 2 diabetes equally stressful for young adults Young adults with type 2 diabetes experience similar levels of anxiety and depression as those with type 1 Research that analysed more than 270 studies found people who held strong negative emotions about their illness and viewed it as more serious were more likely to be in denial and experience depression or anxiety, and less likely to get better. Diabetes and depression share some of the same symptoms such as fatigue, sleep problems, difficulty concentrating. Here are our tips to help you manage your mental health and diabetes. Past depression increases risk of gestational diabetes A past history of depression may increase the chance of women developing gestational diabetes Can extreme stress cause type 2 diabetes in otherwise healthy people?

The average child is in their mid-teens by the time they are diagnosed with , by which time many have developed dangerous symptoms. In the UK, heel-prick tests are already used to check for nine rare but serious conditions, including cystic fibrosis and sickle cell disease. Scientists from the and the in Seattle, who did the study, are pushing for diabetes to be included on the list of conditions. They are currently analysing their test in clinical trials at hospitals in Washington. For the latest study, researchers drew on data from the Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young (TEDDY) Study. The TEDDY study followed 7,798 children at high risk of developing type 1 diabetes from birth over nine years. The researchers analysed the children’s records and found that children who developed the condition had large amounts of islet autoantibodies, biomarkers that appear when the pancreas is damaged, in their body. They said they were able to use this approach to ‘dramatically improve prediction of which children would develop Type 1 diabetes’. Type 1 diabetes is caused when the pancreas does not produce enough to regulate the body’s blood-glucose levels. It’s different from , which is a progressive condition where the pancreas is either not producing enough insulin or the insulin you are producing is not working effectively. It has been linked to obesity and a poor lifestyle which includes lack of exercise and poor diet. Type 1 diabetes is much less common than type 2, affecting approximately 10 percent of all diabetes patients worldwide. As many as four in 10 children with type 1 diabetes suffer ketoacidosis, when acidic substances called ketones build up to dangerous levels in the blood. Although there are preventive treatments, they are rarely used because it is difficult to determine which children are at highest risk until diabetes manifests itself – by which time it’s too late. Identifying which children are at highest risk will also benefit clinical trials on drugs that are showing promise in preventing the condition, the scientist say. Dr Lauric Ferrat at the University of Exeter Medical School, said: ‘At the moment, 40 percent of children who are diagnosed with type 1 diabetes have the severe complication of . ‘For the very young this is life-threatening, resulting in long intensive hospitalisations and in some cases even paralysis or death. ‘Using our new combined approach to identify which babies will develop diabetes can prevent these tragedies, and ensure children are on the right treatment pathway earlier in life, meaning better health.’ Professor William Hagopian of the Pacific Northwest Research Institute, said: ‘We’re really excited by these findings. ‘They suggest that the routine heel prick testing of babies done at birth, could go a long way towards preventing early sickness as well as predicting which children will get type 1 diabetes years later. ‘We’re now putting this to the test in a trial in Washington State. We hope it will ultimately be used internationally to identify the condition as early as possible, and to power efforts to prevent the disease.’ New research finds ways to identify people with pre-diabetes most at risk of developing type 2 diabetes All types of diabetes have been found to increase the risk of falls Adapted cancer therapy could treat type 1 diabetes  Researchers have adapted a cancer therapy which has the potential to treat type 1 diabetes Join our community of over 45,000 people living with diabetes Copyright ©2021 Diabetes NSW & ACT.

Why is becoming a global epidemic, and is it just a coincidence that its rise is joined by another global epidemic — obesity? Could it be that the two are linked in some way, and if so, how? Dr. Nicola Davies, author of I Can Beat Obesity! Finding the Motivation, Confidence and Skills to Lose Weight and Avoid Relapse, investigates. The role of insulin resistance in the obesity-diabetes link Understanding is fundamental to answering the obesity-diabetes link question. The pancreas produces insulin, which helps the sugar we eat become fuel for cells in the muscles, fat, and liver to use for energy. Insulin resistance, however, reduces the ability of these cells to use the sugar for energy. This is more likely to occur in people who are overweight or obese since excess fat makes the cells less responsive to insulin, causing insulin resistance. There is also scientific evidence showing that fat cells are more insulin resistant than muscle cells. In other words, insulin is less effective in people who are overweight or obese, causing glucose in the bloodstream to remain high. There are several contributing factors to insulin resistance, not all of which are weight related. Some can be controlled, while others cannot. Genetics, age, and ethnicity all play a part. Medications like steroids can interfere with the insulin mechanism. Lifestyle factors such as alcohol intake, smoking, exercise level, and also play a key role, and there’s a cardiovascular connection too; individuals with high blood pressure and cholesterol are more prone to diabetes. Yet the one overarching indicator that outshines all other factors in terms of whether you’ll develop insulin resistance is your body weight. Nearly one-third of all American adults are obese, and the number of obese children has tripled in the last four decades. Indeed, obesity is the single best predictor of whether a person will develop Type 2 diabetes. If you are overweight or obese (characterized by a greater than 30), you have an exponentially higher risk of developing diabetes during your lifetime. In fact, almost 90 percent of people with Type 2 diabetes are overweight or obese. People with a BMI above 30 are 80 times more likely to develop Type 2 diabetes than people with a BMI under 22. Why is this? If we look more closely, it isn’t necessarily the weight itself that contributes to diabetes, but where it is stored in the body. Body fat can be classified according to two locations — visceral or subcutaneous. • is stored inside the belly area and wraps around the walls of internal organs, which means it can’t easily be removed by typical diets or exercise. • Subcutaneous fat is found right beneath the skin and is what you can physically measure when taking your waist circumference — the so-called “love handles.’” Visceral fat is the type that increases the risk of developing serious health problems such as diabetes. While subcutaneous fat isn’t as dangerous in general, when it comes to the belly area, both types of fat are present, so a growing belly can be a sign that one or both types of fat are increasing in the stomach region, raising your risk for diabetes. Ultimately, the weight around the midsection is the type we need to watch when it comes to preventing or controlling diabetes. People with excess abdominal fat (see table below) are much more prone to developing Type 2 diabetes because abdominal fat cells release inflammatory chemicals that reduce the body’s ability to incorporate and utilize insulin. It isn’t just where body fat (also known as adipose) is stored, but also the type of fat being stored. There are two kinds of adipose (fat) tissues. • Brown adipose tissues are, as you might expect, dark brown in color. They are linked with many blood vessels and associated with calorie burning, heat production, and energy balance. • White adipose, on the other hand, is responsible for storing energy and accumulates excessively in obesity. In a healthy body, muscles, fat tissue, and the liver absorb glucose from the bloodstream. White adipose supports this process of glucose regulation, which in turn helps reduce the risk of obesity and diabetes. However, when white adipose becomes excessively thick, its ability to help regulate glucose levels is disrupted. Understanding fat and how it is stored in the body can be useful if you are embarking on a weight-management regimen to prevent or control diabetes. The risk of developing Type 2 diabetes by age 25 quadruples in obese children. One large study in the United Kingdom examined electronic health records from 1994 to 2013 for nearly 370,000 children ages 2 to 15 for high BMI values indicative of childhood obesity. Researchers then looked at the diagnoses of either Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes up to age 25 in those same people. Obese children had four times the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes by age 25 compared to those children with a normal BMI during childhood. Historically, Type 2 diabetes had been considered an adult disease, but currently, Type 2 diabetes in children is being diagnosed at an alarming rate, with doctors attributing it to obesity, unhealthy diets, and lack of physical activity. Obesity is also an indicator of childhood Type 1 diabetes. Although Type 1 is an autoimmune disorder, factors such as obesity and insulin resistance further complicate the condition. In one study comprised of nearly 100,000 children who were monitored for weight changes during the first year of life, overweight and obese babies had a positive correlation with increased Type 1 diabetes incidence. The heavier the child, the younger the age of diabetes diagnosis. Although insulin resistance is not the main driver for Type 1 diabetes, this study shows that obesity does play a role and could explain why more children are developing both types of diabetes. The link between obesity and diabetes isn’t straightforward because other factors can exacerbate the link. is one area where this is particularly the case. Sleep is vital to so many of the body’s core functions, including insulin regulation. Untreated sleep issues such as , which is more common in overweight people, can increase the risk of developing obesity, which in turn increases the risk for insulin resistance and Type 2 diabetes. Abdominal fat and overall obesity are the two biggest risk factors for developing sleep apnea because the excess fat in the pharynx (the part of the throat behind the mouth and nasal cavity) is more likely to block the airways. A cascade effect occurs in that obese people are more likely to develop obstructive sleep apnea, with even moderate sleep apnea disrupting metabolic processes and increasing the risk of developing diabetes. Endocrinologists point out that poor sleep negatively affects blood sugar levels and also disrupts many other bodily processes like cholesterol and blood pressure. These problems are much worse in obese individuals. Unfortunately, many people with Type 2 diabetes do suffer from poor sleep. Both the quantity of sleep as well as the quality matter in this equation. People who get too little sleep (less than six hours) or too much (more than nine hours) are more prone to Type 2 diabetes. Indeed, a British study of approximately 4,500 children showed that insufficient sleep was associated with three risk factors for Type 2 diabetes: higher BMI, increased insulin resistance, and elevated glucose readings. Researchers have another theory that obesity leads to , a condition characterized by elevated blood glucose levels that are not high enough to make a diabetes diagnosis. The number of people with prediabetes is rising sharply — at least 84 million people in the U.S. had it in 2015. Over time, prediabetes causes the body’s cells to start losing the ability to uptake insulin. In fact, most people with prediabetes end up developing Type 2 diabetes within 10 years. , a related condition, is a complex set of risk factors including excess abdominal fat, high blood pressure, elevated triglycerides, low HDL or “good” cholesterol, and high blood sugar levels. Many obese people suffer from this condition, which dramatically raises their chances of developing diabetes, among many other illnesses. In fact, having multiple metabolic syndrome risk factors leads to a five-fold increase in your risk for diabetes. Metabolic syndrome, also called Syndrome X or obesity syndrome, is hereditary, and as you get older, the risk gets higher. It’s very common among Native Americans, African Americans, Hispanics, and Asians — some of the same ethnicities that are more prone to diabetes. Doctors aren’t sure exactly why metabolic syndrome develops, but two of the biggest indicators are obesity (particularly abdominal fat) and insulin resistance. Obesity is the single biggest predictor of Type 2 diabetes, but fortunately, even small weight-related changes are very effective. Losing as little as five to 10 percent of your weight has been found to result in drastic improvements in overall health and well-being, which in turn reduce diabetes risk. If you weigh 200 pounds, lose 10 and see what happens. Diet interventions to reduce carbohydrates can be very effective. Get moving too — moderate walking for as little as 20 minutes per day can rev up your metabolism. Studies in which people employed these measures showed as much as a 60 percent reduction in the development of diabetes. If you already have prediabetes or full-blown Type 2 diabetes, stay focused and stay positive. You can make many lifestyle changes to your diet and exercise routine to prevent the situation from getting any worse. The same measures mentioned above will work even if you’ve already been diagnosed. Indeed, increasing evidence shows that weight loss can actually . The fact that weight and diabetes are so intertwined is a good thing, even if it might not seem so. It gives many of us some control over how we can avoid or manage diabetes. Indeed, the more we learn about how the link between these two conditions, the more empowered we are to tackle them head on in pursuit of better health and well-being. *** Being overweight is not the same as being obese. Overweight may simply be a result of having heavy bones or muscle mass, or even high body water content, but not necessarily fat. Obesity, on the other hand, refers only to having too much adipose tissue or fat in the body. Both conditions, however, refer to having weight or fat that is in excess of what is considered healthy for your height. Some people assume that they are unhealthy or “too fat” when their weight doesn’t fall in the ideal range. A healthy weight is computed based on your height, weight, and other factors. On the other hand, your ideal weight is often based on your personal preference and how you want your physique to appear. For obese people, losing five or 10 percent of their weight can already be healthy (or healthier) because it can reduce the risk of developing certain health problems. So, always try to aim for a healthy weight, rather than your ideal weight — they aren’t necessarily the same thing. • Obesity is detected through shrinking clothes and extra pounds Some people assume they are overweight or obese when their clothes feel tighter, the scale shows they’ve gained weight, or their waist feels wider than before. Although these signs show that you have gained some weight, they do not automatically mean you are obese. *** Interesting fact: the obesity-diabetes-memory link Type 2 diabetes has been linked to , and researchers now believe this could be related to increased weight in many people with Type 2 diabetes. People who are overweight or obese have been found to develop thinner grey matter in parts of the brain related to memory. Not only could weight management help with your diabetes, but it could also improve your memory. *** Want to learn more about weight and diabetes?

Diabetes isn’t going away any time soon. According to the American Diabetes Association, with diabetes each year. And 84 million people in the United States with are headed towards developing . Diabetes isn’t unique to the United States: It’s a global issue, affecting hundreds of millions of people worldwide. Many people describe diabetes as being a pandemic. When people are diagnosed with diabetes, they often have many questions, especially about the differences between and Type 2 diabetes. There are, in fact, multiple different forms of diabetes, but the more common forms are Type 1 and Type 2. Let’s take a look at these and hopefully clear up any confusion or questions you may have. Type 1 diabetes was formerly known as “juvenile diabetes” and “insulin-dependent diabetes.” These terms are inaccurate and obsolete. We know that it’s not just “juveniles” who get Type 1 diabetes — adults get Type 1, too, and many people who have Type 2 diabetes must take insulin. So, Type 1 diabetes is the correct term. Type 1 diabetes (also known as Type 1 diabetes melluits, or T1DM) is an autoimmune condition. This means that the body’s immune system turns on itself; in this case, it attacks the of the pancreas. These are the cells that produce insulin. As a result, the pancreas produces very little, if any, insulin, meaning that a person with Type 1 must take insulin to survive. Scientists don’t exactly know what causes Type 1 diabetes. However, it’s likely that genetics and environmental factors, such as certain types of viruses, play a role. Type 1 diabetes accounts for about 5 percent to 10 percent of diabetes cases. It’s more commonly diagnosed in people under the age of 20, but it can occur at any age. Type 1 diabetes is also relatively uncommon, affecting roughly 1 in 250 Americans. It’s more common in whites than in African-Americans and Latinos, but it equally affects men and women. High blood glucose (sugar) and, often, the presence of (by-products of fat breakdown), are indicators of Type 1 diabetes. A person may present of dehydration, weight loss, extreme thirst and frequent . , a physician may order an (which measures blood sugar control over the previous 2–3 months), a fasting blood sugar test or a random blood sugar test. A random blood sugar level of 200 mg/dl or higher, a fasting blood sugar of 126 mg/dl or higher, or an HbA1c result of 6.5 percent or higher indicates diabetes. The doctor may also check C-peptide levels (C-peptide is a by-product of the creation of insulin in the pancreas; a low level usually indicates Type 1 diabetes), along with antibody tests, especially if it’s unclear which type of diabetes a person has. There’s no cure for Type 1 diabetes. Treatment consists of injecting insulin with a syringe or insulin pen or infusing insulin via a device called an insulin pump. There’s also an ultra-rapid-acting inhalable form of insulin, but someone with Type 1 diabetes still needs to inject a long-acting insulin, as well. At this time, there’s no oral form of insulin available. Most people with Type 1 diabetes need to check their blood sugars, at a minimum, four times a day, but six to ten times a day is more likely. is also an option for those with Type 1 diabetes, and using CGM can help to greatly reduce the number of fingersticks someone needs to do to determine glucose levels. A healthy eating plan that consists of counting and controlling carbohydrate intake is generally a mainstay for those with Type 1 diabetes. If desired, a person can base meal-time insulin doses on how much carb they choose to eat at a meal. Physical activity is encouraged, but may require adjustments to insulin doses and/or carb intake to prevent (low blood sugar). What is the Difference Between Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes? I’m Alison Massey, Registered Dietician, Certified Diabetes Educator and Contributor to Diabetes Self-Management Magazine. Today I am going to answer the most common question people ask me during their very first visit. Diabetes is a hormone condition. It involves the hormone “insulin”. Insulin, I always tell my clients, think of it like a key. It’s job is to really open the cells so the blood glucose can be regulated and stored. What is Type 1 Diabetes? With Type 1 diabetes, these individuals don’t make any of the hormone insulin. It’s an auto-immune form of the disease. Meaning, something’s triggered the body to destroy the beta cells where insulin is made. These individuals need to take the medication insulin from day 1 of their diagnosis for the rest of their life to really manage their diabetes. It’s normally diagnosed at a younger age, under the age of 35. Although sometimes we do see type 1 diabetes diagnosed in older individuals. Type 2 diabetes, on the other hand, is much more common. Most people that have diabetes have type 2 diabetes. With type 2 diabetes, these individuals are making some of the hormone insulin. They may not be making quite enough. The other thing that is happening often, is that the body is not using the hormone that their making, very well. And we call that “Insulin Resistance”. Type 2 diabetes can be diagnosed, really at any age, in childhood, teen years, and or adulthood. With type 2 diabetes, there’s various ways to manage the disease. Lifestyle, of course, comes into play. I mean it, there’s also a lot of diabetes medications out there. Oral medications, injectable medications that are not insulin that lower blood sugar. And then, if insulin production is low, individuals with type 2 diabetes, might also take insulin as well. If you have more questions on the differences between type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Check out the resources on DiabetesSelfManagement.com and subscribe to Diabetes Self-Management Magazine. Type 2 diabetes (also known as Type 2 diabetes mellitus or T2DM) was formerly known as “adult-onset diabetes” and “non-insulin-dependent diabetes.” These two terms are incorrect, as , and, as previously mentioned, many people with Type 2 diabetes use insulin. Type 2 diabetes is not an autoimmune condition. Rather, it’s a chronic condition that affects how the body uses glucose. Type 2 diabetes generally results in part from insulin resistance, which means that the body has difficulty using insulin, along with impaired insulin secretion. As a result, glucose builds up in the bloodstream. Some people label Type 2 diabetes as being “not as serious” as Type 1 diabetes; however, both forms of diabetes are equally serious as they can both lead to , including heart disease, , , and . A combination of genetics and lifestyle factors can cause Type 2 diabetes by causing . If your parents or siblings have Type 2 diabetes, your chances of getting it are increased. In addition, , not doing enough , and eating an unhealthful diet of processed and sugary foods can raise your risk. Type 2 diabetes is the more common form of diabetes, accounting for 90 percent to 95 percent of cases. It can run in the family, and certain racial and ethnic groups have a higher risk, including African-Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans, Native Americans and Pacific Islanders. Also, women who have have a higher risk of getting Type 2 diabetes within 5 to 10 years. According to current projections, by 2050, one in three adults in the U.S. will have Type 2 diabetes, and more than 5,000 children and teens are diagnosed with this condition every year. Type 2 diabetes is diagnosed with a blood test. This may be a random blood sugar test, a fasting blood sugar test, an oral glucose tolerance test, or an HbA1c test. A random blood sugar level of 200 mg/dl or higher, fasting blood sugar of 126 mg/dl or higher, oral glucose tolerance test result of 200 mg/dl or higher after two hours, or an HbA1c result of 6.5 percent or higher indicates diabetes. The tests may be repeated before confirming a diagnosis. Some people , such as thirst and increased urination, but many people with Type 2 have no symptoms. It’s important to get checked regularly for Type 2 diabetes, especially if you are at high risk. As with Type 1 diabetes, there is no cure for Type 2 diabetes. Bariatric surgery can put Type 2 diabetes into remission, but it’s not a cure. This condition can be managed in a number of ways, including using lifestyle measures (weight loss, , and physical activity), and taking medication. Medications available to help manage Type 2 diabetes include diabetes pills, non-insulin injectable medications, and insulin. Type 2 diabetes tends to change over time, which usually means that more medication, including insulin, is needed to keep blood glucose levels in a safe range. Not everyone with Type 2 diabetes checks their blood sugars, but checking your blood sugar is a good thing to do, as it gives you and your diabetes team helpful information to see how your diabetes is doing and to adjust your treatment plan, if needed. The frequency of checking depends on how your diabetes is treated and how well it’s managed. Talk with your doctor about whether checking your blood sugars would be helpful for you. And CGM use is becoming more prevalent among people with Type 2 diabetes, especially those who take insulin — this may be an option for you, as well. A healthy eating plan that controls carb intake, 5 percent to 10 percent of body weight (if needed), and becoming and staying active are important steps to fit into your lifestyle. Medication may be one part of your treatment plan, but it works hand-in-hand with these lifestyle measures. For more information on what, when and how much to eat, ask your doctor for a referral to a registered dietitian, or look for a diabetes program in your community that provides classes. Both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes are serious, chronic conditions that require a lot of attention and self-management. Left unmanaged, the risk for complications greatly increases. It can be hard to do this on your own, so seek out support and information from your health-care team, online communities, and credible websites (like this one) to educate yourself, stay informed and keep abreast of new developments and therapies.

8e253965-ec18-47cc-9da5-2b533abf4f21,"— is an autoimmune condition in which the immune system attacks cells in the pancreas that produce insulin. Insulin is the hormone that’s responsible for moving glucose into the cells. Without insulin, the body can’t regulate blood sugar levels, which can lead to dangerous complications in people with this condition. Type 1 diabetes is thought to be caused primarily by genetic components, although it’s suggested that there are some nongenetic causes as well. In this article, we will explore the genetic components and other nongenetic factors that cause type 1 diabetes, as well as the symptoms and common misconceptions of this condition. Genetic predisposition is thought to be a major risk factor in the development of type 1 diabetes. This can include both family history, as well as the presence of certain genes. In fact, according to , there are over 50-plus genes that may be a risk factor for this condition. As with many health conditions, having a family history of type 1 diabetes may the risk of developing type 1 diabetes. People who have a parent or sibling with type 1 diabetes may be at an increased risk. According to the , a child’s risk of developing type 1 diabetes can even be as high as if both parents have the condition. The major histocompatibility complex is a group of genes found in humans and animals that aids the immune system in recognizing foreign organisms. In 2004, found that the presence of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules on certain chromosomes is a precursor to the development of type 1 diabetes. The presence of antibodies is a natural, necessary immune system response to foreign threats. However, the presence of indicates that the body is producing an autoimmune system response to its own healthy cells. have shown the presence of several different types of autoantibodies in people with type 1 diabetes. While genetics are thought to be the primary risk factor in the development of type 1 diabetes, there are a handful of outside factors that have been thought to trigger the autoimmune reaction associated with this condition. Other factors that may trigger type 1 diabetes include: A investigated the link between maternal exposure to viruses during pregnancy and the development of type 1 diabetes in their children. The researchers found that there was a strong association between maternal viral infections and the development of type 1 diabetes in the child. A found that there may be a possible link between climate and the development of type 1 diabetes. In this study, the researchers found that there was a higher incidence of childhood type 1 diabetes in oceanic climates, higher latitudes, and areas with lower sun exposure. A investigated the potential perinatal risks of developing type 1 diabetes in childhood. The researchers discovered that factors such as gestation period and maternal weight may be associated with a slight increase in the risk of developing this condition. Other factors, such as the role of infant feeding, vitamin supplementation, and maternal blood type, have also been researched for their link to type 1 diabetes. However, more research is still needed in these areas. Most of the nongenetic risk factors are thought to trigger type 1 diabetes by increasing the autoimmune stress of the body. Type 1 diabetes is commonly diagnosed during childhood, most often between the ages of 4 and 14. When the condition is undiagnosed, type 1 diabetes symptoms may develop during this time due to the complications of high blood sugar levels. The most common symptoms of the condition include: in children who didn’t previously wet the bed If type 1 diabetes isn’t diagnosed and treated, it can lead to a condition called .

Do you know the truth behind these common diabetes myths? is part of a complicated set of disorders, and there are quite a few common misconceptions about this condition. Here are some of the most common myths and truths about type 1 diabetes. Type 1 diabetes is caused by eating too much sugar. Type 1 diabetes is primarily genetic in origin, and there’s no research to suggest that eating too much sugar is a risk factor for diabetes. Type 1 diabetes is caused by having overweight. While weight and diet is a risk factor for type 2 diabetes, there’s little scientific evidence to suggest that type 1 diabetes is caused by having overweight. Type 1 diabetes can be reversed or cured. Unfortunately, there’s no cure for type 1 diabetes. Children can’t outgrow this condition, and taking insulin as a treatment for this condition won’t cure it. People with type 1 diabetes can never eat sugar again. Many people who have type 1 diabetes manage their condition through medication and dietary interventions. People with type 1 diabetes can still eat a well-rounded diet that includes complex carbohydrates or sugars. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition that’s thought to be greatly influenced by genetic factors and triggered by outside factors. Certain genes, such as those relating to the function of the immune system, have been linked to an increased risk of developing type 1 diabetes. Certain outside factors, such as exposure to viruses and living in certain climates, have also been suggested to trigger autoimmunity in this condition.

908aca54-0063-48a2-8eb7-7c7808689421,"Wednesday, 19 April 2017 Associate Professor Stuart Mannering, a global leader in diabetes research, is hoping he can discover a therapy that will ‘turn-off’ the immune response that may cause type 1 diabetes. Diabetes Australia today announced the prestigious 2017 Millennium Award for Type 1 Diabetes to Associate Professor Mannering for his work at St Vincent’s Institute of Medical Research. The Award provides funding of $150,000. Diabetes Australia also announced the 2017 Millennium Award for Type 2 diabetes which goes to Dr Seth Masters from the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research who will be able to continue his research into how the immune system contributes to obesity, associated with the development of type 2 diabetes. Associate Professor Stuart Mannering said he hoped his research would pave the way for a vaccine to prevent people from developing type 1 diabetes. “We are looking at the specific immune responses that we think trigger type 1 diabetes,” Associate Professor Mannering said. “At this stage we have identified a particular molecule, ‘C-peptide’, which may trigger an immune response that leads to the development of type 1 diabetes.” “We are looking at ways of developing a blood test that could alert us to this immune response at work which could then lead us to developing a vaccine.” Dr Seth Masters from the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, said his research was focussed on immune signals that can fight obesity, and help to prevent people from developing type 2 diabetes. “The immune system can detect when an individual is becoming obese, and sends signals to try and stop this from happening. We think that the body becomes resistant to these signals, increasing the risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes,” Dr Masters said. “My research is looking into how the immune system detects persistent excess food intake and then how molecules made by immune cells can keep fat levels in a normal range.” “If we can understand how these immune molecules deplete fat stores, then we may be able to use them safely to treat obesity and prevent type 2 diabetes.” The Millennium Grants are part of a suite of research projects Diabetes NSW & ACT, along with other state organisations and Diabetes Australia, funds through the Diabetes Australia Research Program (DARP). In 2017 the Diabetes Australia Research Program funded 50 new research grants across all types of diabetes. The Diabetes Australia Research Program was established in 1987 to support and develop diabetes related research across Australia. The program provides funding towards the prevention, management and cure of all types of diabetes, as well as enabling and fostering young and upcoming researchers in the field of diabetes research.

7365bf30-9f49-4b73-a0e1-7ce71f361392,"Overview Diagnosis and Tests Management and Treatment Prevention Living With Diabetes mellitus is a disease that prevents your body from properly using the energy from the food you eat. Diabetes occurs in one of the following situations: The pancreas (an organ behind your stomach) produces little insulin or no insulin at all. Insulin is a naturally occurring hormone, produced by the beta cells of the pancreas, which helps the body use sugar for energy. The pancreas makes insulin, but the insulin made doesn't work as it should. This condition is called insulin resistance. To better understand diabetes, it helps to know more about how the body uses food for energy (a process called metabolism). Your body is made up of millions of cells. To make energy, the cells need food in a very simple form. When you eat or drink, much of your food is broken down into a simple sugar called glucose. Glucose provides the energy your body needs for daily activities. The blood vessels and blood are the highways that transport sugar from where it is either taken in (the stomach) or manufactured (in the liver) to the cells where it is used (muscles) or where it is stored (fat). Sugar isn't able to go into the cells by itself. The pancreas releases insulin into the blood, which serves as the helper, or the ""key,"" that lets sugar into the cells for use as energy. When sugar leaves the bloodstream and enters the cells, the blood sugar level is lowered. Without insulin, or the ""key,"" sugar can't get into the body's cells for use as energy. This causes sugar to rise. Too much sugar in the blood is called . There are two main types of diabetes: and : Type 1 diabetes occurs because the insulin-producing cells of the pancreas (beta cells) are damaged. In Type 1 diabetes, the pancreas makes little or no insulin, so sugar can;t get into the body's cells for use as energy. People with Type 1 diabetes must use insulin injections to control their blood glucose. Type 1 is the most common form of diabetes in people who are under age 30, but it can occur at any age. Ten percent of people with diabetes are diagnosed with Type 1. In Type 2 diabetes (adult onset diabetes), the pancreas makes insulin, but it either doesn't produce enough, or the insulin doesn't work properly. Nine out of 10 people with diabetes have Type 2. This type occurs most often in people who are over 40 years old but can occur even in childhood if there are risk factors present. Type 2 diabetes may sometimes be controlled with a combination of diet, weight management and exercise. However, treatment also may include oral glucose-lowering medications (taken by mouth) or insulin injections (shots). Other types of diabetes might result from pregnancy (), surgery, use of certain medicines, various illnesses and other specific causes. Gestational diabetes occurs when there is a high blood glucose level during pregnancy. As pregnancy progresses, the developing baby has a greater need for glucose. Hormone changes during pregnancy also affect the action of insulin, which brings about high blood glucose levels. Pregnant women who have a greater risk of developing gestational diabetes include those who: Have a history of Blood glucose levels usually return to normal after childbirth. However, women who have had gestational diabetes have an increased risk of developing Type 2 diabetes later in life. The causes of diabetes are not known. The following risk factors may increase your chance of getting diabetes: Family history of diabetes or a personal history of gestational diabetes. African-American, Hispanic, Native American, or Asian-American race, Pacific Islander or ethnic background. Injury to the pancreas (such as infection, tumor, surgery or accident). There are risk factors that you might have more control over, including: Abnormal blood cholesterol or triglyceride levels. It is important to note that sugar itself doesn't cause diabetes. Eating a lot of sugar can lead to , but it doesn't cause diabetes. s (even though you are eating and feel hungry). Frequent or . Most people have symptoms of when their blood sugar is less than 70 mg/dl. (Your healthcare provider will tell you how to test your blood sugar level.) When your blood sugar is low, your body gives out signs that you need food. Different people have different symptoms. You will learn to know your symptoms. Common early symptoms of low blood sugar include the following: Feeling weak or dizzy, including trembling and feeling shaky. Feeling confused or being able to keep your mind on one subject. Diabetes is diagnosed with fasting sugar blood tests or with A1c blood tests, also known as . A fasting blood sugar test is performed after you have had nothing to eat or drink for at least eight hours. Normal fasting blood sugar is less than 100 mg/dl (5.6 mmol/l). You do not have to be fasting for an A1c blood test. Diabetes is diagnosed by one of the following (see chart): Your blood sugar level is equal to or greater than 126 mg/dl (7 mmol/l). You have two random blood sugar tests over 200 mg/dl (11.1 mmol/l) with symptoms. You have an oral glucose tolerance test with results over 200 mg/dl (11.1 mmol/l). Your A1c test is greater than 6.5 percent on two separate days. An A1c test should be performed in a laboratory using a method that is certified by the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP) and standardized to the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) assay. There is no cure for diabetes, but it can be treated and controlled. The goals of managing diabetes are to: Keep your blood glucose levels as near to normal as possible by balancing food intake with medication and activity. Maintain your blood cholesterol and triglyceride (lipid) levels as near the normal ranges as possible. Control your blood pressure. Your blood pressure should not go over 140/90. Decrease or possibly prevent the development of diabetes-related health problems. Planning what you eat and following a balanced meal plan. Taking medication, if prescribed, and closely following the guidelines on how and when to take it. Monitoring your blood glucose and . Keeping your appointments with your healthcare providers and having laboratory tests completed as ordered by your doctor. What you do at home every day affects your blood glucose more than what your doctor can do every few months during your check-up. Insulin pumps are small, computerized devices, about the size of a small cell phone that you wear on your belt, in your pocket, or under your clothes. They deliver rapid-acting insulin 24 hours a day through a small flexible tube called a cannula. The cannula is inserted under the skin using a needle. The needle is then removed leaving only the flexible tube under the skin. The pump user replaces the cannula every two to three days. An insulin pump can deliver insulin 24 hours a day. It is important for pump users to frequently monitor their glucose levels either with a or a fingerstick monitor. The pump delivers a continuous flow of insulin that can be adjusted if needed for things like exercise and . A pump user regularly enters information about their food intake and blood sugar levels into the pump so it can help them calculate insulin doses for food intake and high blood sugar levels. Benefits of an insulin pump include fewer insulin injections, a more flexible lifestyle, and a more consistent and adjustable delivery of insulin. Can I take both pills and insulin to control my blood sugar? Yes. The combination of insulin and an , when taken as directed by your healthcare provider, is very safe and effective in controlling blood sugar. A typical combination therapy consists of taking an oral medication during the day and insulin at night. Once you begin taking insulin, you will need to monitor your blood sugar more often to reduce the risk of low blood sugar reactions. Combination therapies are often helpful for people who have Type 2 diabetes. If you have been taking an oral medication, your doctor may change your treatment plan to include insulin injections. This change is often made to help people with Type 2 diabetes gain better control of their blood sugar. Although diabetes risk factors like family history cannot be changed, there are other risk factors that you do have some control over. Implementing some of the healthy lifestyle habits below can improve these modifiable risk factors and help to decrease your chances of getting Type 2 diabetes: What are some of the long-term complications of high blood sugar levels? : All patients with diabetes should see an ophthalmologist (eye specialist) every year for a dilated eye examination. Patients with known eye disease or symptoms of blurred vision in one eye or who have blind spots may need to see their ophthalmologist more often. : Urine testing should be performed every year. Regular blood pressure checks are also important because management of high blood pressure is essential in slowing kidney disease. Have your blood pressure checked at every visit with your healthcare provider. The American Diabetes Association recommends keeping blood pressure below 140/90 for most adults. Persistent swelling in the leg or feet also may be a symptom of kidney disease and should be reported to your doctor. : Numbness or tingling in your feet should be reported to your doctor at your regular visits. Check your feet every day for redness, calluses, cracks or breakdown in the skin tissue. If you notice these symptoms before your scheduled visits, notify your doctor immediately.

To know how diabetes affects your heart, kidney, and brain, read the article. What Are the Complications of Gestational Diabetes? Diabetes or diabetes mellitus is a condition that affects how your body uses blood glucose or blood sugar. Glucose is an important source of energy for the cells in the body, and it is the main source of fuel of the brain. There are many types of diabetes depending on the cause, but all types increase the blood sugar levels. Excess sugar can affect organs in the body and can also result in heart attacks and stroke. Glucose is an important source of energy for the cells. The two major sources of glucose for your body is from the food you eat and your liver. With the help of insulin, this glucose is absorbed from the intestine to the blood and into the cells. Glucose is also stored and made in the liver, which is broken down and released into the blood when you fast or do not eat for in a while. The normal fasting blood sugar levels are between 70 and 99 mg/dL, and normal blood glucose 2 hours after a meal should be below 140 mg/dL. - Prediabetes or borderline diabetes is when blood sugar is 100 to 125 mg/dL. Here, the blood glucose is higher than usual, but not so high to diagnose it as diabetes. or Juvenile diabetes - Here, the body fails to produce insulin. As such patients do not have insulin production, they must take Insulin shots throughout their life. - Type 2 diabetes is the most common type of diabetes, and it impairs the way the body uses insulin. Here, the cells in the body do not respond to insulin effectively, even after the body produces it. - Diabetes that affects pregnant woman, as the body becomes less sensitive to insulin, is . The other less common types of diabetes are monogenic diabetes and cystic fibrosis-related diabetes. - The exact cause is still not known, but it is believed that the immune system attacks and destroys the cells in the pancreas that produce insulin. This results in less or no insulin production. In the absence of insulin, glucose is not transported to the cells and builds up in the blood. This type of diabetes is believed to be caused by both genetic and environmental factors. - As prediabetes increases the risk of type 2 diabetes, the causes are almost the same. Here, your cells become resistant to the action of insulin, and the pancreas is unable to produce enough insulin, which results in sugar build up in the blood. Obesity is believed to be the primary cause of this type of diabetes. - The hormones produced by the placenta during pregnancy makes the cells more resistant to insulin. This is usually compensated by pancreas producing more insulin, but if it does not, it results in gestational diabetes. The symptoms vary depending on the level of blood sugar. Prediabetes and type 2 diabetes usually do not cause any symptoms early on. Some of the signs and symptoms of diabetes are: Unintentional weight loss. Is it fine to eat carbohydrates within 40 minutes after taking a GH shot? I am suffering from premature ejaculation. Is it curable? The risk factors for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes are: The complications of diabetes develop if your blood sugar level is left uncontrolled from a long period. These complications can be life-threatening. The complications include: - It increases the risk of heart problems like angina, heart attack, stroke, and atherosclerosis. - Diabetes damages the tiny blood vessels that supply the nerves in the limbs, which results in tingling, numbness, and pain at the tips of the toes or fingers. - The kidney function is affected when excess sugar damages the tiny blood vessel in the kidneys. It can also lead to kidney failure or irreversible end-stage kidney disease. - It is when the blood vessels of the retina get damaged, resulting in blurred vision, and blindness. It can also cause cataracts and glaucoma. - Poor blood supply and nerve damage results in sores and blisters to form on the toes. If left untreated, it can get infected and cause gangrene, which might require amputation of the affected toe, foot or leg. - Diabetes makes the skin susceptible to many fungal and bacterial infections. - Increases the risk of hearing problems. - It increases the risk of dementia or Alzheimer's disease. What Are the Complications of Gestational Diabetes? Gestational diabetes can affect both the mother and her baby. - Excess sugar in the mother’s blood can reach the baby through the placenta, which results in the production of excess insulin by the baby's pancreas. This results in the baby growing too big, which requires birth by cesarian. - The blood sugar level drops in some babies shortly after birth due to the high production of insulin, which requires prompt treatment. - Babies are at higher risk of being overweight later in life if the mother had gestational diabetes. - Gestational diabetes if left untreated, can result in fetal death. - It is a life-threatening condition, which causes high blood pressure, protein in the urine, and swelling in the legs and feet. - It increases the risk of you having gestational diabetes in the next pregnancy. If you are experiencing the symptoms of diabetes, it is best you get the following tests done: - This indicates the average blood sugar level for the past three months, by measuring the percentage of blood sugar attached to hemoglobin. - Here, blood is collected and glucose level is checked at any time. If the random blood sugar level is 200 mg/dL or higher, it indicates diabetes. - Here, blood is collected and glucose level is checked after fasting overnight. A fasting blood sugar level between 100 and 125 mg/dL is considered prediabetes, and if it is 126 mg/dL or higher, it is diabetes. - After the fasting blood sugar level is measured, you are supposed to drink a sugary liquid, and the doctor will check the blood sugar levels for the next two hours. Blood sugar level less than 140 mg/dL is normal, and more than 200 mg/dL, indicates diabetes. - Insulin is used to in type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes that is not controlled by medicines. The types of diabetes are: Rapid-acting insulin - starts working in 15 minutes and lasts for 3 to 4 hours. Short-acting insulin - starts working in 30 minutes and lasts for 6 to 8 hours. Intermediate-acting insulin - starts working in 1 to 2 hours and lasts for 12 to 18 hours. Long-acting insulin - starts working some hours after injection and lasts for a day or longer. - The drugs that lower the blood glucose levels are: Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors - Acarbose, Miglitol.

Diabetes is a condition associated with excess blood sugar levels. It leads to the inability of wound healing. A person experiencing a diabetes attack might experience anxiety, fatigue, and weakness. They will have frequent urination symptoms. This might be difficult for some patients. If a small wound occurs, it would be difficult to heal, and it might make the patient worried. To date, there is no cure for diabetes. Diabetes mellitus can only be treated and controlled. In some people, though it is controlled and treated, it might occur again. To manage diabetes effectively, patients would always need to control their blood glucose levels. How Do You Feel When Your Blood Sugar Is Too High? The following are the symptoms that will be experienced by a patient who is affected by hyperglycemia. - Increased thirst. - Frequent urination. - Fatigue. - Nausea and vomiting. - Shortness of breath. - Stomach pain. - Fruity breath odor. - A very dry mouth. Diabetes is commonly diagnosed with the help of fasting sugar blood tests or HbA1c blood tests. It is also known as glycated hemoglobin tests. A fasting blood sugar test is taken after the patient has been on an empty stomach for at least eight hours. The time taken to lower the blood glucose levels differs from patient to patient. However, they can follow these. - Exercising regularly. - Control the intake of carbohydrates. - Increasing fiber intake. - Drinking adequate water and staying hydrated. - Choosing foods that have a low glycemic index. - Controlling stress levels. Overeating sugar does not cause diabetes. But, if you are already having diabetes, you should restrict the intake of sweets and sugars. This will help you to prevent further complications. If you are following a healthy diet plan, eating chocolate and sugar in considerable quantities is good. People with diabetes have few restrictions on having sweets. They can choose some alternatives. The following are some diabetic friendly sweets. - Granola with no added sugars and fresh fruit. - Graham crackers with nut butter. - Angel food cake. - Sugar-free hot chocolate sprinkled with cinnamon. - Sugar-free fudge popsicle. The presence of the following signs and symptoms might indicate that you are affected by diabetes. - Increased thirst. - Frequent urination. - Extreme hunger. - Unexplained weight loss. - Fatigue. - Irritability. However, definitive laboratory testing of blood glucose levels is mandatory to confirm the diagnosis. The following are specific lifestyle measures you can make to avoid getting affected with diabetes mellitus. - Manage your weight. - Exercise regularly. - Eat a balanced and healthy diet. - Limit processed foods. - Limit your alcohol intake. - Quit smoking. - Control your blood pressure. The following are the foods that any diabetic patient should strictly avoid to control his or her blood sugar levels. - Sugar-sweetened beverages. - Grains that are rich in trans fats. - White bread. - Pasta and rice. - Fruit-flavored yogurt. - Sweetened breakfast cereals. - Flavored coffee drinks. - Honey. - Dried Fruits. There are three main types of diabetes. They are as follows. - Type 1 is known as diabetes insipidus. - Type 2 is known as diabetes mellitus. - Gestational diabetes. The following are the signs and symptoms that can be warning signals for gestational diabetes in a female patient. They are: - Extreme fatigue and lethargy. - Urge to urinate increases. - Extremely dry mouth and constant thirst. - Feeling severe nausea and vomiting, especially after eating. - Unusually intense cravings for sweet foods and drinks. - Blurred vision. - Tingling in the hands or feet. The excess blood sugar levels seen in diabetes mellitus can severely affect blood vessels all over the body and cause complications. It can cause severe damage to the eyes, kidneys, nerves, and other body organs. It can also cause sexual problems and increase the risk of heart attack and stroke. How Long Can You Live With Diabetes Without Diagnosis? Untreated or undiagnosed diabetes mellitus can go unnoticed for a longer duration. This is because a mild to moderate increase in blood sugar levels do not cause any symptoms. When blood sugars rise significantly, people start to notice symptoms. The earliest sign is usually excessive thirst. How Long Does It Take for Diabetes to Damage Kidneys? The majority of the patients with diabetes insipidus usually develop some functional change in the kidneys within a period of two to five years after diagnosis. About 30 to 40 percent may progress to even more severe kidney disease, usually within a period of about 10 to 30 years. Yes, diabetes will be affecting the eyes, but only in severe cases. Diabetic retinopathy does not occur immediately once diabetes occurs in a patient. It occurs only in patients who are suffering from chronic diabetes. The only way to know if diabetes is affecting your eye is by having a clinical eye examination with an ophthalmologist. The root cause of diabetes is primarily our diet and sedentary lifestyle. After consuming food, the food containing carbohydrates are broken down into sugar. These sugars trigger the pancreas to produce insulin and are then stored in the liver and muscles as glycogen for future use. However, there is a limit for the amount of glycogen the liver and muscles can store. When this limit exceeds, the person can get affected by diabetes. Patients who are chronic smokers are more likely to get affected with type 2 diabetes than non-smokers. Smoking can also make it challenging to manage the disease and regulate insulin levels.

The problem is that the term “sugar” is used as a blanket term to describe compounds that have drastically different biological effects in your body, which causes confusion. Whole carbohydrates from plant foods are extremely beneficial to your health and provide “natural sugars,” which metabolize to glucose for your brain, liver, and muscles. On the other hand, “refined sugars” are for type 2 diabetes and other chronic diseases that negatively affect your overall health. Unlike , which is an autoimmune condition, , and its precursor condition prediabetes, are caused by , the accumulation of excess fat in tissues that are not designed to store large quantities of fat. The type of sugar you eat (natural vs. refined) can influence your level of insulin resistance, which means that the correct question to ask is: “Which sugars cause insulin resistance and which sugars reverse insulin resistance?” In this article, we’ll clear up some of the sugar misunderstandings and give you some new terms to use that will clear up the confusion about sugar. Then we’ll explain how each of these new concepts affects your diet and overall health, along with some simple, effective strategies to prevent and reverse type 2 diabetes. Changing the Sugar Conversation: Your New Key Definitions Quick Myth Check — What About Low-Carb Diets? Aren’t They Popular Because All Carbs are Bad? Refined Sugars, Obesity, Diabetes, and How They Relate Other Factors That Can Cause or Contribute to Diabetes How to Fight Back Against Diabetes and Insulin Resistance Changing the Sugar Conversation: Your New Key Definitions The term “natural sugars” refers to the carbohydrate chains found in whole foods like fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains. They can still be sweet, but their chemical structure is very different to that of refined sugars. Natural sugars are sometimes called “complex carbohydrates,” because they are long-chain molecules that take time to digest, cut, and absorb. As a result, natural sugars take a longer time for your body to process, resulting in a more sustained release of energy over time. Natural sugars are eaten in whole foods that also contain that are essential for optimal nutrient absorption, transport, and storage. These micronutrients include vitamins, minerals, fiber, water, antioxidants, and phytochemicals and can be thought of as “information” for tissues throughout your body. Refined sugars are artificial sweeteners that are added to processed and prepared food, including table sugar (sucrose), high fructose corn syrup (HFCS), maltodextrin, dextrose, and many others. Refined sugars are added to foods and beverages to increase sweetness and consumer appeal. Refined sugars are sometimes called “simple carbohydrates” due to their short-chain chemical structure. Because refined sugars can be metabolized very easily and are generally not “protected” by the vitamins, minerals, fiber, antioxidants, and phytochemicals found in whole foods, when you eat them they can elevate your blood glucose very quickly and increase your risk for . Glucose is a sugar that is the predominant building block of most whole carbohydrates found in nature. In addition, glucose is also the only monosaccharide found in fiber. Glucose is the primary fuel for your liver, muscles, and brain, and is the most important fuel in your entire body. The fundamental distinction that is important to make when talking about sugar is using the word “natural” or “refined” before the word “sugar.” Simply talking about “sugar” is not descriptive enough. are found in plants, and are excellent for your body. Your digestive system slowly cuts natural sugars into their monosaccharide building blocks, which are then absorbed into your blood to be burned for energy or stored for later use. The human body has evolved over millions of years to thrive on a , which have historically been the food that’s most widely available throughout human history. The shift to a diet high in meat and added sugars has only been possible recently on the time scale of human evolution, and the research shows that diets and have coincided with the and . are manufactured in a laboratory, and are the results of a manufacturing process. They are designed to make foods taste unnaturally and . These hyper-concentrated sweeteners, like HFCS, table sugar, and aspartame are often found in foods that are also high in trans fats, like donuts, pastries, chips, cookies, and ice cream. The difference between natural and refined sugars is not only helpful to understand, it’s . Natural sugars found in plant foods are one of the sources of nutrition you can put in your body. When you eat a diet containing predominantly plants, your liver, muscle and receive a steady stream of glucose throughout the day, helping to keep you feeling high energy at all times. Refined sugars found in processed foods dramatically increase your risk for obesity, heart disease, and diabetes, all of which we’ll tackle in the next section. Quick Myth Check — What About Low-Carb Diets? Aren’t They Popular Because All Carbs are Bad? Low-carb diets, like the Paleo diet and the ketogenic diet, originated from a mistaken understanding of human evolution, and a flawed understanding of the function of insulin. In individuals living with existing insulin resistance, high-carbohydrate diets can cause spikes in blood glucose, especially when those carbohydrates come from processed foods. As a result, some doctors recommend high-fat, low-carbohydrate diets, with the goal of eliminating these blood glucose spikes. However, it’s actually high-fat diets that cause insulin resistance in the first place, decreasing the ability of your liver and muscle to uptake glucose from your blood. So while the short-term results of reducing your carbohydrate intake can lead to decreased fasting blood glucose, decreased fasting insulin, and a lower A1c, the long-term result is an increase in insulin resistance, which in turn increases your risk for chronic disease. You can learn more about the topic in our article on . Refined Sugars, Obesity, Diabetes, and How They Relate Coming now from the perspective of two, very different types of sugars, the question should instead be ““ And the answer is clear — refined sugars increase your risk for diabetes, while natural sugars from fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains actually help reduce your risk for diabetes. The relationship between refined sugars and diabetes can be complicated. The direct effects of refined sugars include blood glucose spikes and liver insulin resistance, but there are also many interrelated secondary effects. are clearly linked to obesity, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes, resulting from a rapid rise in blood glucose values that can overwhelm your liver in the post-meal state, resulting in fat and cholesterol synthesis in your liver. Obesity, in turn, leads to a , which is the underlying cause of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. But this relationship is not always a direct cause-and-effect relationship. The big picture is what’s important to understand: a diet high in refined sugar is a risk factor for weight gain, obesity, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes whereas a diet high in natural sugar from whole carbohydrates decreases your chronic disease risk. Other Factors That Can Cause or Contribute to Diabetes There are both controllable risk factors and uncontrollable risk factors for type 2 diabetes. Fortunately, the vast majority of these are within your control, including: The amount of packaged and processed foods you eat The quantity of fat in your diet (especially saturated fat) In fact, there is only one major factor of increased risk for type 2 diabetes that is technically out of your control: However, despite the fact that your genetics may increase your risk for type 2 diabetes, this condition is still extremely treatable and preventable . How to Fight Back Against Diabetes and Insulin Resistance The first, most powerful step in improving your healthy living with all forms of diabetes is through your diet. There are many other factors that can help improve your diabetes health, but the single most effective change you can make is to improve the quality of your diet. For preventing and reversing insulin resistance, the research overwhelmingly points to a , which can help you keep your target weight, avoid and reverse insulin resistance, and provide better mood and overall health, all without needing to restrict portions. To learn more, you can go into detail with our , which touches on the science behind this diet and some commonly asked questions. Increasing your exercise and daily movement has a positive feedback loop with dietary changes. More activity means your body can burn fat and glucose more efficiently. Ultimately, integrating more movement stimulates your muscle to produce more mitochondria, which in turn makes your muscles more efficient at processing glucose, thus accelerating the process of reversing insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Humans have evolved to withstand long periods of time without eating – an evolutionarily conserved trait from times when food was less available. The result is that during periods of (usually 16-24 hours), your body begins a process called to ensure that cells still have the energy to function. When intermittent fasting, your body can oxidize excess fat, and recycle dysfunctional protein. It’s a sort of “internal recycling program,” and studies have shown dramatic improvements in overall health. To learn more about intermittent fasting, feel free to use our .

dbde28de-c69c-4fde-a523-bf30fc25f2ab,"Incorporating Type 1 Diabetes Prevention Into Clinical Practice There are numerous global trials to prevent and reverse type 1 diabetes. Although these efforts are largely directed by specialized investigative teams, enrollment is open to individuals at risk for diabetes who may never encounter a subspecialty provider. Thus, there are exciting new opportunities for primary practitioners to involve their patients in research for diabetes prevention and reversal. This article reviews the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes, factors that determine likelihood of disease, intervention strategies being researched, and the role of primary care providers in disease prevention. ype 1 diabetes is estimated to affect between 1.2 and 2.4 million individuals in America. For most patients, the disease will present in childhood. This early presentation compounds the challenges all parents face in helping their children achieve independence and exposes children to the risk of diabetes complications throughout their entire lifetime. Although the rising epidemic of type 2 diabetes in children has garnered significant attention in recent years, type 1 diabetes remains the predominant diagnosis seen by pediatricians and pediatric endocrinologists. Surprisingly, the incidence of type 1 diabetes is also increasing. Two large, multinational studies analyzing incidence trends of type 1 diabetes during nearly four decades found 2.8 and 3.0% annual increases globally. Although the reasons for this increased incidence are unknown, it highlights the need for efforts to prevent and cure type 1 diabetes. Currently, numerous research efforts worldwide are engaged in this endeavor, including the clinical trials networks Type 1 Diabetes TrialNet (TrialNet; ) and the Immune Tolerance Network (). In this article, we will review what is known about the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes, present a summary of prevention efforts, and examine how primary care providers can participate in and facilitate research to prevent type 1 diabetes. To understand the multiple approaches to the prevention of type 1 diabetes, it is valuable to begin with an overview of diabetes pathogenesis. Type 1 diabetes is first and foremost an autoimmune disease. It is frequently found in families with a high prevalence of other autoimmune diseases, and individuals with type 1 diabetes are at higher risk to develop other autoimmune disorders over their lifetime (). A predisposition for diabetes begins at birth because of the inheritance of genetic risk factors, many of which remain unknown. Although most new-onset patients will have no clear family history of type 1 diabetes, those currently unaffected children with a parent, sibling, or other relative with diabetes are at increased risk compared to the general population (). The translation of these genetic factors into disease requires additional events, however, a feature best evidenced by the fact that monozygotic twins are not uniformly concordant for disease development. It has been proposed that environmental factors play a substantial role in the development of type 1 diabetes in those genetically at risk. Although no single trigger of diabetes onset has been identified, a number of candidates have emerged from epidemiological studies. The most well known among these are viral infections such as Coxsackie virus, influenza B, herpes simplex, and human herpes 6 virus and dietary factors such as exposure to cow's milk. In a study of 28 children aged 3–14 years with recently diagnosed type 1 diabetes, 39% had a Coxsackie B virus–specific IgM response compared to 5.5% of 290 age-matched control children. These triggers may contribute directly to immune activation by inciting cross-reactivity against islet proteins bearing a similar structure or nonspecifically by inciting the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines that injure islet tissue. Identifying these environmental factors and understanding their effects is part of the ongoing Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young study (). Comparison of Incidence of Autoimmune Disorders in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes and the General Population Risk of Progression to Type 1 Diabetes for Family Members of Probands With Type 1 Diabetes in Selected Studies Although the process that leads to the activation of islet-reactive lymphocytes is not known, T-lymphocytes mediate islet tissue injury. At the earliest stages, islet injury is not readily detectable by any simple clinical monitoring and thus goes undetected by parents and practitioners. As islet destruction progresses, the loss of β-cells is evidenced by a decrease in the insulin response to a meal challenge even before the onset of frank hyperglycemia. This change in insulin secretory dynamics is a strong predictive factor for the future appearance of disease and indicates significant islet injury. Eventually, the process progresses to a stage where the plasma glucose becomes persistently elevated, and the clinical features of diabetes emerge. Diabetes is defined by a fasting plasma glucose exceeding 126 mg/dl or a postprandial plasma glucose exceeding 200 mg/dl on two separate occasions. Thus, diabetes progresses from genetic risk to immune activation to β-cell injury to impaired insulin secretion to glucose intolerance and, finally, to frank disease. Although practitioners are most familiar in the clinical setting with the latter stages of the disease pathogenesis, identifying individuals at risk for type 1 diabetes before substantial islet injury is our best chance for diabetes prevention. At the time of clinical presentation of diabetes, these individuals will usually have diminished islet cell mass in addition to abnormal immune activation. Both of these processes must be addressed to reverse new-onset disease. If diabetes can be predicted earlier, it may be possible to prevent disease progression while an adequate islet mass remains to maintain euglycemia throughout a patient's lifetime. Studies suggest that individuals must lose 50–90% of their islet mass before onset of hyperglycemia. Substantial efforts have been directed to develop models that predict when susceptible individuals will develop diabetes. At present, the most highly predictive model results from identifying people with autoantibodies and abnormal insulin secretion and glucose intolerance who do not yet meet the criteria for diabetes diagnosis; these individuals have a > 50% 5-year risk for diabetes progression, and it is likely that nearly 100% of them will eventually develop the disease. However, identification at this stage is relatively late, and it is not clear whether preventing diabetes in these patients will be any more achievable than reversing diabetes in patients who have been recently diagnosed. Although the biochemical criterion of abnormal glucose tolerance is highly predictive, its clinical utility for diabetes prevention is limited because of the substantial islet injury that precedes this finding. Thus, predictive models that measure abnormalities more remote from diabetes diagnosis are sought. The most widely applied model at present involves the detection of β-cell–directed autoantibodies in the blood. These autoantibodies are markers of autoimmunity and are not themselves directly destructive to islets. These markers include antibodies against the insulin molecule, glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), zinc-transporter-8, and insulinoma antigen 2 (IA2). In addition, the histochemical islet cell antibody test (ICA) detects any immunoglobulin directed at intact human islets but does not identify the specific antigen(s). Antibodies against whole islets and insulin are specific to pancreatic β-cells, whereas IA2 and GAD are also present in brain, pituitary, and other areas in the pancreas. The Diabetes Prevention Trial-1 (DPT-1) showed that the number of autoantibodies correlates with eventual development of type 1 diabetes. Higher titers of ICA correspond to a higher 5- to 10-year risk of developing type 1 diabetes according to multiple studies. The DiMe Study Group in Finland measured antibodies in a large cohort of children newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes who were < 15 years of age. Nearly 75% of children were GAD-positive at diagnosis; just over half had anti-insulin antibodies. IA2 was the most common and was found in 85.7% of newly diagnosed children, and most children (72.6%) tested positive for more than one antibody at diagnosis. The authors also observed an inverse relationship between age at onset and number of positive autoantibodies; younger children present with a higher number of positive antibodies than older children. Another large, ongoing study, Diabetes Autoimmunity Study in the Young (DAISY: www.uchsc.edu/misc/diabetes/Teddy/DAISY/DAISY_home.htm) was an observational study that compared children who have first-degree relatives with type 1 diabetes and children without affected family members but who expressed high-risk HLA haplotypes, with a focus on the implications of known autoantibodies. Of the children in this study who progressed to type 1 diabetes, all were positive for at least one autoantibody, although not all positive progressed to overt diabetes, and some patients were transiently positive. Because some antibody-positive children in the DAISY trial did not develop diabetes, hope remains that the factors responsible for disease progression will be elucidated or protective factors will be identified. The Finnish Type I Diabetes Prediction and Prevention study (DIPP) is evaluating the general population to describe the natural history of preclinical type 1 diabetes while determining the predictive values of risk markers including specific genes and antibodies. Almost half of antibody-positive children in both the DIPP and the DAISY studies have since tested antibody-negative. The German BABYDIAB study examined newborns of patients with type 1 diabetes to better characterize early detectable predictive factors. Although antibodies were found in infancy, determining whether these were acquired via placental transmission is important because they are all of the IgG subclass; one study following serial antibody measurements showed that most maternal antibodies associated with increased risk for diabetes are cleared from the infant's circulation by 12 months of age. Considering the risk of maternally acquired positives in the first year of life and in light of the rarity of presentation of clinical disease in infancy, Hämäläinen et al. proposed targeting general population screens to the 18- to 24-month age-group. Considering that > 90% of individuals testing positive for more than two anti-islet antibodies progressed to type 1 diabetes in one long-term study of first-degree relatives of people with the disease, testing for autoantibody positivity is clearly important in targeting individuals for prevention. However, anti-islet antibodies are not the sole predictor of type 1 diabetes risk, especially given that some patients are antibody negative at diagnosis. Although some of these antibody-negative patients may have nonautoimmune forms of diabetes, such as defects in pancreatic development or insulin secretion (so-called monogenic diabetes or mature onset of diabetes in youth, some still likely have classic type 1 diabetes as evidenced by the presence of other factors such as characteristic diabetes risk genes. Understanding the genetic risk for diabetes ultimately may be even more valuable than antibody screening because at-risk genes could be identified long before the production of even the first autoantibody. The most significant genetic linkage to type 1 diabetes is the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) group, the family of genes that controls antigen presentation within the immune system. Antigen presentation is a critical aspect of T-lymphocyte activation. At-risk HLA genes may allow abnormal presentation of islet proteins and survival and expansion of islet-reactive T-cells and thus compromise regulatory lymphocyte function. In fact, half of the heritable risk can be traced to HLA haplotypes, with HLA-DR and -DQ carrying the highest risk for auto-immune changes leading to type 1 diabetes. Combining knowledge of high-risk HLA haplotypes with antibody testing allows practitioners to more specifically classify patients at highest risk of diabetes. The HLA-DR3/4 DQ8 genotype when combined with positive autoantibodies has been highly successful in predicting progression to clinical diabetes. In the BABYDIAB study, certain HLA genes were highly predictive of autoantibody positivity and thus anti-islet autoimmunity. In addition, many polymorphisms of these genes exist, and some have been shown to protect against the disease. Nonetheless, not all individuals who have anti-islet autoimmunity or who eventually develop diabetes have the at-risk haplotype. Thus, the risk conferred by these genes may be modified by other loci, and a number of other important genetic regions have been identified. Some important non-HLA genes include insulin, polymorphic cytotoxic T-lymphocyte–associated antigen, and protein tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor type 22. By altering insulin transcription and T-cell activation, these genes contribute to persistent islet autoimmunity as well as affect deterioration to clinical diabetes. To date, no intervention has been developed that can unequivocally prevent the development of type 1 diabetes or arrest the progression of immune system destruction of β-cells after diagnosis, although some promising studies have given the field much encouragement. The potential benefits of such interventions are clear: preservation of islet mass, even when it is insufficient to maintain normal glucose homeostasis, results in a clinical scenario in which diabetes is much easier to regulate in terms of glucose excursions and is accompanied by fewer episodes of potentially dangerous hypoglycemia. Obviously, earlier intervention, before the autoimmune process has begun or early enough to prevent significant islet loss, holds the promise of true diabetes prevention. Although prediction of type 1 diabetes remains complex and actively investigated, models using antibody screening are currently used to drive diabetes prevention trials. In addition, several trials have reported modest utility in diabetes reversal. Although strategies that prevent diabetes may not be potent enough to reverse disease, it is likely that therapies that achieve diabetes reversal may be useful in diabetes prevention. As mentioned above, the goals for diabetes prevention depend in part on when during the pathogenesis of disease the intervention is applied. In the late stages of diabetes progression (or with reversal), several goals must be achieved including deactivation of islet-reactive lymphocytes, correction of the inflammatory milieu that injures islets and promotes lymphocyte activation, and restoration of an adequate islet mass. In earlier stages of diabetes prevention, it remains possible that these interventions may be effective even if applied singly. The following sections consider the current state of each of these strategies based on completed and ongoing trials and proposals. In efforts to prevent type 1 diabetes, it is highly desirable to either correct the abnormal function of or eliminate those lymphocytes that have targeted the β-cells. It is well established that insulin itself is a primary target of the immune response, and modulation of anti-insulin reactivity may be beneficial. In animal models, both parenteral and oral insulin delayed or prevented disease onset, by acting either metabolically by allowing the β-cells to rest, or immunologically by inducing tolerance or reducing T-cell infiltration into the pancreatic islets. DPT-1 examined the effects of antigen-based therapy with insulin in first-degree relatives at risk of type 1 diabetes. Two studies sought to determine whether exposure to insulin in ways thought to induce tolerance (oral administration or very-low-dose injection) could delay or prevent the onset of type 1 diabetes in these individuals. In the first study, relatives projected to have a 5-year risk of > 50% for progression to type 1 diabetes were given low-dose parenteral insulin, and in the second study, relatives with a 25–50% risk were given oral insulin therapy. The oral insulin is metabolically inactive because of degradation in the stomach, but these degraded peptide products were hypothesized to possess immune-regulating potential. Unfortunately, neither intervention groups showed a significant delay in type 1 diabetes progression compared to placebo. However, oral insulin was retrospectively observed to delay progression to type 1 diabetes in the subgroup of participants with the highest anti-insulin antibody levels. These findings inspired the Type 1 Diabetes TrialNet Oral Insulin Study, analyzing the preventive or delaying effect of oral insulin in individuals with similar characteristics. This trial is presently enrolling subjects. Other antigen-specific interventions currently in development include the use of a GAD vaccine and the isolation and expansion of regulatory T-cells that are able to suppress islet-reactive lymphocytes in an antigen-specific manner. While some studies have looked at modulating the autoimmune response specific to the β-cells, others seek to alter the body's immune response in general. Although antigen-specific therapies are desirable because they should affect only those immune cells that have targeted the β-cells, we do not presently know the full range of β-cell autoantigens. Thus, more globally directed, nonspecific therapies may have a better chance to reach all islet-injurious lymphocytes. Many components of the immune system have been implicated in autoimmunity leading to type 1 diabetes, including cytotoxic and helper T-cells, B-cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells. In fact, global defects have been characterized in all these cell types in both type 1 diabetes–prone mice and people with diabetes. To date, nonspecific interventions directed against the T-lymphocyte have been the most widely used because T-cells are the known end-stage effectors of islet destruction. T-cells express CD3 along with CD4 or CD8, so targeting either receptor could in theory modulate T-cell response and therefore alter autoimmunity. Targeting of the CD3 receptor with monoclonal antibodies has been tested on newly diagnosed patients with type 1 diabetes and showed improved insulin production 2 years after diagnosis but did not successfully lead to remission of the disease. Other constituents of the immune system are also emerging as foci for intervention. Although T-lymphocytes are most closely linked with the immunopathogenesis of type 1 diabetes, B-lymphocytes also play a central role in type 1 diabetes and other autoimmune diseases and depleting B-cells can prevent and reverse diabetes in mouse models. Rituximab, an anti-CD20 chimeric antibody that depletes B-lymphocytes, has shown encouraging initial clinical results. A recent TrialNet-funded study demonstrated that a four-dose course of rituximab could preserve β-cell function over a 1-year period in patients with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes. In addition, systemic anti-inflammatory agents such as IL-1 receptor antagonists and agents that stimulate β-cell proliferation are being studied as potential components of a multidrug prevention of β-cell destruction. Although it is crucial to prevent or halt β-cell destruction, diabetes prevention and therapy also necessitates ensuring adequate β-cell number and function. Ideally, immunomodulation will protect against β-cell decline, but this strategy will require both early detection of at-risk individuals and highly effective interventions. Successful preventive and therapeutic regimens will ultimately depend on β-cell replacement, which is currently provided by a limited number of allogeneic islet transplants. Sources of new β-cells. 1. Proliferation of β-cells, which requires specific cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases (cdk), and the forkhead box (Fox) M1 transcription factor.(81–83) 2. Differentiation of endocrine progenitors, which express neurogenin 3 (Ngn3) and are located within pancreatic ducts.(59,84,85) 3. Transdifferentiation of other cell types by transfection with transcription factors necessary for endocrine differentiation such as Ngn3, pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 (Pdx1), and V-MAF avian musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene homolog A (MafA) . 4.Directed differentiation of embryonic stem (ES) and induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. To make this therapy feasible for more patients, additional supplies of β-cells will be required. Potential sources include existing β-cells, progenitor cells, and stem cells (), but utilization of these sources will depend on understanding and manipulating β-cell differentiation and proliferation. Although high rates of β-cell differentiation and proliferation occur during embryogenesis and early development, proliferation slows later in life, and little, if any, differentiation occurs. Accordingly, the β-cell population does not readily replete itself when under immunological attack, although there is evidence of continued production of new β-cells in patients with type 1 diabetes. Furthermore, β-cell proliferation can be stimulated in vivo and in vitro. However, because β-cells are highly differentiated, their proliferative potential is inherently limited. Thus, there is much interest in identifying and isolating progenitor cells that can be stimulated to proliferate and subsequently differentiate into β-cells. Additionally, because stem cells can proliferate indefinitely and differentiate into any cell type, much work is being performed to direct their differentiation down the normal β-cell developmental pathways. However, stem cells have yet to be used in clinical trials, so their efficacy and potential risks, particularly of tumorigenecity, are unknown. It is also unclear whether exogenously derived β-cells will be more or less susceptible to immunological attack and whether this susceptibility can be manipulated genetically or during the differentiation protocol. Nonetheless, developing an adequate and clinically potent β-cell resource is likely to be a key component of any strategy to prevent or cure type 1 diabetes. Although there are exciting opportunities in diabetes prevention and reversal, most of these efforts are unfolding at large academic or research-focused medical centers. Nonetheless, there is a vital role for practitioners who work with families at risk for developing type 1 diabetes. In families with established type 1 diabetes, all first-degree relatives, including the parents of the proband (if they are < 45 years of age) are at increased risk for type 1 diabetes and should be counseled regarding this risk. Identical twins are the greatest risk. Second- and third-degree relatives of a proband with type 1 diabetes are also at heightened risk if they are < 21 years of age. Once apprised of their diabetes risk, these individuals should be made aware of type 1 diabetes screening and intervention studies such as Type 1 Diabetes TrialNet. The advantages of screening for type 1 diabetes risk through such research-oriented programs include state-of-the-art antibody determinations in specialized research laboratories, a superb follow-up and support network of type 1 diabetes specialists, protection of laboratory data from insurance carriers, and the opportunity to participate in further clinical research studies aimed at diabetes prevention. Participating in a research study incurs no cost to patients or their insurance companies. Far better than tertiary diabetes centers, primary care provider offices are able to reach the unaffected relatives of index patients with type 1 diabetes. Unaffected individuals may visit their family practitioner for routine health maintenance and express that they are aware of a new diagnosis in their family; these same individuals are unlikely to ever encounter a subspecialty provider unless they are diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. Thus, there is great opportunity for primary care physicians to engage in conversations about such patients' potential risk for developing type 1 diabetes and the possibility of enrolling in monitoring or prevention trials. If the primary care community outside of the research setting is aware of such opportunities to promote awareness about diabetes trials, we will have the chance to move ever more quickly toward preventing and reversing type 1 diabetes. Although we have been successful in recruitment for diabetes prevention trials at the Monroe Carell, Jr. Children's Hospital at Vanderbilt, we anticipate that there are many patients whom we are unable to reach or who are unwilling to participate. To address this concern, we recently undertook a survey to better understand parental attitudes toward clinical trials for type 1 diabetes. As part of this study, we determined that parents' willingness to enroll their child in a study was most strongly influenced by whether they had received clear information about trials from their primary pediatric endocrine provider (D. Buscariollo, W. Russell, D. Moore, unpublished observations). By extension, it is likely that there is a very important role for all practitioners in promoting awareness and confidence in families that will ensure the success of these ongoing efforts. In addition to informing families about the opportunities for diabetes prevention trials, it is reasonable to wonder whether primary care providers can make recommendations that may limit future diabetes risk. Although many current trials are developing pharmacological approaches to type 1 diabetes prevention, some trials are investigating approaches that can be utilized routinely and safely in practice. For example, there has been growing interest in the potential role of early feeding patterns in the development of diabetes. This interest is founded on a body of evidence suggesting a protective effect of breastfeeding for children at risk for type 1 diabetes. In 1984, Borch-Johnson et al. first reported an inverse correlation between the duration of breastfeeding and diabetes risk in humans. Since then, there has been a long debate in the literature about the possible beneficial effects of breastfeeding for children at risk for type 1 diabetes. Part of the challenge has been isolating the effects of breastfeeding from other potentially contributing factors (e.g., delayed exposure to exogenous stimuli such as cow's milk proteins). Nevertheless, both prolonged breastfeeding and delayed exposure to cow's milk proteins have been associated with protection against the development of type 1 diabetes. Putative mechanisms of protection include passive immunity provided by secreted immunoglobulin A antibodies against infectious agents that may contribute to the autoimmunity trigger and delayed exposure to diabetogenic agents such as cow's milk proteins, which may be involved in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes among those with a dysfunctional gut immune system. The Trial to Reduce IDDM in the Genetically at Risk (TRIGR) is the first primary prevention effort to explore whether avoidance of exposure to cow's milk can prevent type 1 diabetes in infants with a genetic predisposition. Although this ongoing trial is limited to genetically high-risk infants, it is reasonable to recommend breastfeeding to families in which there is risk for type 1 diabetes. Current recommendations include exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months of life for those without contraindications. Whether specific alternate formulas would be of benefit is the subject of ongoing trials. As their tolerability is low and expense high, we would not recommend these at the present time. Another protective intervention of ongoing interest is early vitamin D supplementation. The exact mechanism by which vitamin D may protect against type 1 diabetes remains unclear, but this effect is likely to be through the prevention of vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin D is a potent modulator of the immune system and is involved in regulating cell proliferation and differentiation. A meta-analysis of data from five observational studies recently indicated that children supplemented with vitamin D had a 29% reduction in type 1 diabetes risk compared to their unsupplemented peers. Nevertheless, firm conclusions that can be drawn from these data in terms of appropriate recommendations are limited by the lack of specification of dosage, duration, and particular vitamin D preparations. Thus, data from adequately powered, randomized, controlled trials are still needed. Although current trials are generally considering pharmacological dosing of vitamin D, it is reasonable to ensure that individuals at risk for autoimmune disease maintain their vitamin D stores in the normal range if they are not able to participate directly in these trials. It is currently recommended that all infants should receive 400 IU of vitamin D supplementation until the infant is ingesting at least 400 IU of vitamin D daily through formula, milk, or other food sources. In addition, it is recommended that an intake of 400 IU of vitamin D per day be continued throughout childhood and adolescence for those who do not ingest that amount per day or for those who do not receive adequate sunlight exposure. Type 1 diabetes is a clearly heritable disease with multiple genetic and environmental risk factors. No treatment has been devised to date that will successfully prevent the development of type 1 diabetes. However, sentinel laboratory abnormalities have been identified that provide multiple targets for preventive interventions. Nonetheless, successful intervention efforts demand a thorough understanding of disease pathogenesis and a refined approach to disease prediction so that risks and benefits can be well balanced. The inception of global-scale networks for diabetes trials such as the Type 1 Diabetes TrialNet has presented unprecedented opportunity to alter the course of type 1 diabetes. These trials simultaneously aim toward several clinical end-points including better identification of at-risk individuals, better prediction of disease progression, and successful implementation of protocols for diabetes prevention and reversal. The success of these efforts is strongly dependent on enrollment, and many eligible patients are not aware that they are at risk for type 1 diabetes or may benefit from these opportunities. Our discussions with patients suggest that physicians remain the most trusted and important source of this information. Given that, there is a vital role for practitioners in all settings in current efforts to prevent and reverse type 1 diabetes.

By , Laura Hieronymus, DNP, MSEd, RN, MLDE, BC-ADM, CDCES, FADCES Most likely, you knew very little about diabetes before you learned that you had it. After your diagnosis, your next few doctor visits were probably a crash course in diabetes: learning how to check your blood glucose level, inject insulin or follow a schedule for taking pills, adjust your eating habits, etc. Your doctor may also have mentioned what diabetes is and what causes it in this blitz of information, but with so much to learn at once, you may not remember what he said — or remember him saying anything at all on these topics. It can be difficult to take in so much new information at one time, especially when you are just learning diabetes terminology and adjusting to the idea of having diabetes; many people find they miss a lot of the background information about the underlying causes of their diabetes. However, understanding how and why diabetes develops can help you to be an active member of your diabetes-care team. Diabetes mellitus, usually referred to as just diabetes, is characterized by a high blood glucose level. There are several different types of diabetes, each with a unique underlying cause. The most common forms are Type 1 diabetes and Type 2 diabetes. Both are considered chronic diseases, meaning that once diagnosed, they don’t go away. Blood glucose levels that are higher than normal but not high enough to be diabetes are now called . For descriptions of other types of diabetes and related conditions, see Type 1 diabetes used to be called juvenile or insulin-dependent diabetes, and Type 2 diabetes was called adult-onset or non-insulin-dependent diabetes. The American Diabetes Association now favors the terms Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, which are defined based on the underlying cause of the diabetes, not on a person’s age at diagnosis or treatment method. Type 1 diabetes occurs when the body’s immune system launches an attack against the -producing in the pancreas. Why the immune system does this is not completely understood, but it is thought that both genetics and some sort of environmental trigger are involved. Certain combinations of genes make some people more likely to develop Type 1 diabetes, but having a genetic tendency alone is not enough: Not everyone at increased risk for Type 1 develops it. For instance, in identical twins (who by definition have the exact same genetic makeup), when one twin has Type 1 diabetes, the other twin also develops it only 50% of the time. It is believed that for a genetic tendency toward Type 1 to be “expressed,” a person must be exposed to an environmental “trigger” that sets the autoimmune process in motion. Many potential triggers have been proposed, including viruses, bovine serum albumin (a protein in cow’s milk), hormones, and environmental toxins, but none have been definitively proven to lead to Type 1 diabetes. Once the process is set in motion, the immune system produces antibodies to beta cells and to insulin and begins to destroy them. (Under normal circumstances, antibodies seek out and flag harmful foreign substances within the body, such as bacteria or viruses, for destruction.) This process starts many years before diabetes is diagnosed. In fact, it’s possible to identify people at risk of developing Type 1 diabetes by checking their blood for antibodies to beta cells and to insulin. Over time, the quantity of insulin produced by the pancreas and the amount circulating in the bloodstream progressively decline. The resulting signs and symptoms of Type 1 diabetes, which include high blood glucose levels, weight loss, increased urination, hunger, and thirst, and large amounts of ketones in the blood and urine, generally occur only after a majority of the beta cells have been destroyed. In the absence of insulin, glucose in the bloodstream cannot be transferred into cells as it normally would, resulting in high glucose levels in the bloodstream and a state of “starvation” within cells. The kidneys filter the excess glucose out of the blood, causing increased urination, thirst, and dehydration. Starving cells, no longer able to use glucose for energy, begin to use fat, resulting in loss of body fat and the production of (chemical by-products of fat metabolism). If not treated (with insulin) in time, the combination of high blood glucose, high levels of ketones, and dehydration can lead to a very serious condition called diabetic ketoacidosis and, potentially, death. Some people with Type 1 diabetes experience a “honeymoon” period after diagnosis, during which their pancreas regains the ability to produce insulin, and they require little or no injected insulin, but this generally lasts only a short time. Within a few months, most people have very little insulin-producing capacity and require an outside source of insulin. Type 2 diabetes is much more common than Type 1 and has a stronger genetic link. (If one identical twin develops Type 2 diabetes, there is a 90% chance that the other one will also.) Symptoms of high blood glucose are less pronounced in Type 2 diabetes compared to Type 1 diabetes; because of this, diagnosis often occurs many years after diabetes initially develops. However, the damage starts even in the absence of acute symptoms: Blood glucose levels above normal are known to increase a person’s chances of eventually developing heart disease and other complications of diabetes. Unlike Type 1 diabetes, Type 2 diabetes is not caused by an autoimmune attack. Instead, there are usually two underlying problems: and inadequate insulin production. Insulin resistance is when the cells of the body have a decreased response to insulin. Under normal circumstances, when blood glucose levels are high (after eating, for example), the pancreas releases insulin into the bloodstream. Insulin then interacts with muscle cells, fat cells, and other tissues, allowing them to transport glucose into the cells to be burned for energy or stored for use later. In insulin resistance, these important messages do not get through. Remember playing “telephone” as a child, when one person would whisper a word to the person next to them, and that person would whisper what they heard to the next person, and so on down the line? By the time it got to the end of the line, the word had usually mutated to something completely unrecognizable. A similar breakdown in communication is thought to occur in insulin resistance, where the signal from insulin becomes garbled, and the cell does not respond normally, taking up much less glucose than normal. When blood glucose levels remain high, the pancreas continues to secrete more insulin to compensate for its decreased effectiveness, and eventually, blood glucose returns to the normal range. Over time, however, the pancreas loses the ability to produce enough extra insulin to compensate for insulin’s decreased effectiveness, and blood glucose levels remain high. At this point, a person might be diagnosed with diabetes or prediabetes, depending on his blood glucose level at the time of testing. The liver also plays a key role in regulating blood glucose level. It releases glucose to the bloodstream when the blood glucose level is low, and it stores glucose when the level is high. When the blood glucose level is high, insulin has the important role of signaling the liver to turn off glucose production and start storing extra glucose. But if a person is insulin resistant, the liver does not respond normally to insulin, so it continues to release glucose to the bloodstream even if the blood glucose level is already elevated, making it even higher. Treating Type 2 diabetes involves treating both underlying problems (insulin resistance and inadequate insulin production). An individual’s treatment may change over time as his degree of insulin resistance or ability to produce insulin changes. Many people still make a fair amount of insulin when they are initially diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes, so their treatment may focus mainly on decreasing insulin resistance. Ways to decrease insulin resistance include increasing physical activity, following a healthy meal plan, and losing weight (even losing as little as 10 pounds can make a difference). Certain drugs are also targeted to treat insulin resistance. (brand name Glucophage) decreases the amount of glucose made by the liver, and pioglitazone (Actos) and rosiglitazone (Avandia) make fat and muscle tissues more sensitive to insulin. Other drugs address insulin deficiency by stimulating the pancreas to release more insulin, slowing the digestion of carbohydrate in foods, affecting certain hormones involved in blood glucose regulation, or preventing the kidneys from reabsorbing glucose into the bloodstream. Using one or more of these medicines and keeping carbohydrate intake moderate and spread out over the day can help the pancreas keep up with insulin needs. Ultimately, however, it is not unusual for many people with Type 2 diabetes to eventually need to take insulin injections to supply their bodies with enough insulin. Many people with Type 2 diabetes see the progression to using insulin as a negative reflection on their ability to follow their meal plan, lose weight, or otherwise take care of their diabetes. But while there are always additional steps anyone could take to further improve their health, for most people, the need to use insulin to control their diabetes does not mean they lack willpower or the desire to take good care of their diabetes. It is simply a matter of disease progression and the decreased ability of their pancreas to continue producing supernormal levels of insulin. Diabetes is diagnosed based on blood glucose level, and keeping your blood glucose level in a near-normal range has been shown to prevent common complications of diabetes such as eye disease, kidney disease, and nerve disease. But blood glucose level is not the only concern in diabetes. High blood pressure and high blood fats (such as and ) often occur along with high blood glucose and can also lead to complications, including heart disease. All of these concerns — blood glucose, blood pressure, and blood fats — should be addressed in a comprehensive diabetes treatment plan for good health today and to prevent diabetes-related complications down the road.

By , Laura Hieronymus, DNP, MSEd, RN, MLDE, BC-ADM, CDCES, FADCES Taking care of your diabetes is a bit like building a home. With input from your diabetes care team contractors, you begin by drafting a well-thought-out set of blueprints and assembling all the tools you need to control your blood glucose levels. Healthy eating and physical activity serve as a sturdy foundation for your house of diabetes care, while monitoring blood glucose provides you with feedback for changes to the existing plans. Although eating well and exercising are always the first line of therapy for all types of diabetes, there may come a time when you and your health-care team decide to intensify your Type 2 diabetes control by adding an oral blood-glucose-lowering medicine to your carefully crafted plan. Oral medicines are one tool that can give you a step up toward reaching your blood glucose targets and reinforcing your strong diabetes home. Type 2 diabetes is a complex condition, which means there are a multitude of options for successful treatment. In a person without diabetes, blood glucose rises whenever food is eaten. The pancreas quickly senses the glucose and produces , which opens the doors of the muscle and fat cells so the glucose can be used for energy. People with Type 2 diabetes may release the proper amount of insulin in response to glucose, but the cells are “insulin resistant”; that is, they can’t sense the insulin and don’t take in much glucose. This leaves glucose in the bloodstream, which stimulates the pancreas to produce more insulin than would normally be necessary. Over the course of years, the pancreas may fail to keep up with the demand for insulin, leading to persistently elevated blood glucose levels and a diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes. The liver is also involved in the process by tracking insulin levels in the blood. In a person without diabetes, both insulin and glucose levels are elevated at the same time after eating. If a person hasn’t eaten for several hours (such as overnight), the liver senses the lack of insulin and responds by producing glucose from storage to keep the blood glucose level from dropping too low. When Type 2 diabetes sets in, the liver may fail to sense insulin levels properly and may produce more glucose than required. In a nutshell, three areas “in need of repairs” characterize Type 2 diabetes: (muscle cells that don’t easily take in glucose), insulin deficiency (a pancreas that doesn’t make enough insulin), and increased hepatic glucose output (a liver that releases too much glucose). Fortunately, there are several options in the diabetes toolbox to make the needed repairs, including healthy eating, physical activity, and oral medicines. Keeping blood glucose levels near to normal can reduce your risk of the chronic or long-term complications of diabetes such as (eye disease), (kidney disease), (nerve damage), and cardiovascular disease. You and your health-care team should work together to draw up the blueprints for successfully reaching your individualized target blood glucose goals. Many health-care providers and their patients choose to begin the path to intensified blood glucose control with oral medicines. It’s important to note up front that oral medicines are not insulin. Insulin can’t be given orally because digestive enzymes would destroy it. Control of Type 2 diabetes involves a stepwise approach that begins with identifying the proper treatment plan based on your age, weight, desired level of blood glucose control, and specific characteristics of the medicines being considered. Often the plan begins with monotherapy, which is one blood-glucose-lowering medicine in addition to a healthy lifestyle. If this doesn’t achieve the desired result, adding one or more additional medicines (combination therapy) may be considered. Combination therapy may involve taking two or more individual pills, or it may be achieved with one of the newer combination pills, which have two drugs in one pill. Research has shown that most of the oral diabetes medicines currently on the market lower glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) approximately 1% to 2%. The test is an indicator of average blood glucose control over the previous 2–3 months. The American Diabetes Association currently advocates an HbA1c reading lower than 7% for most people with diabetes. The American Academy of Clinical Endocrinologists recommends an HbA1c value below 6.5%. You and your health-care provider should agree on a target that is right for you. Higher HbA1c levels are associated with the development of diabetes complications. In general, certain classes of drugs, including the , meglitinides, d-phenylalanine derivatives, and biguanides, are more potent in lowering blood glucose than are others, such as the or when used as monotherapy. (See for a comparison.) However, there are limits to how much of any one drug can be taken. When a maximal dose of one drug isn’t enough to keep blood glucose levels in the desired range, adding a drug from a different class can lower blood glucose further. Insulin injections are another option for treating Type 2 diabetes and may eventually be necessary due to its progressive nature. Many physicians recommend starting insulin when three oral medicines are not effective at keeping blood glucose under control. Insulin may either be added to the current regimen of pills or used in place of one or more of the oral medicines a person has been taking. Type 2 diabetes involves several problems in metabolism, and oral medicines have been developed to provide solutions to each one. Six distinct classes of oral drugs are now available for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes. summarizes the important characteristics of each class. Each class has a different mechanism of action, which means that each contributes to blood glucose control in a different way. . This class of drugs, which includes acarbose (brand name Precose) and miglitol (Glyset), acts by inhibiting the breakdown and subsequent absorption of carbohydrates from the gut following meals, so it is most effective in controlling postprandial (after-meal) elevations in blood glucose. (low blood glucose) generally does not occur when one of these pills is taken as monotherapy, but it can occur when one or the other is taken in combination with a blood-glucose-lowering drug that can cause hypoglycemia. It’s important to note that because of the carbohydrate-blocking effect of alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, some traditional treatments for low blood glucose, such as fruit juice, aren’t as effective at raising blood glucose as they normally would be. Sources of pure glucose, such as tablets or gel, are recommended. Gastrointestinal side effects such as abdominal discomfort, bloating, flatulence, and diarrhea may occur when using an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor. . Only one biguanide, namely (Glucophage), is currently approved for marketing in the United States. Metformin is most effective in overweight or obese people who are insulin-resistant. It works by reducing liver glucose output, and it may also improve insulin sensitivity in the liver and muscle and fat cells. Metformin appears to suppress appetite and also lower cardiovascular risk factors without risk of hypoglycemia. Its major disadvantage is that it can cause gastrointestinal problems, particularly at higher doses. A rare but serious side effect of metformin is , in which lactic acid builds up in the bloodstream. People with heart, lung, kidney, or liver problems and those who drink alcohol heavily are more prone to developing lactic acidosis. . This class of drugs—which includes glipizide (Glucotrol, Glucotrol XL), glyburide (DiaBeta, Glynase, Micronase), glimepiride (Amaryl), and the less commonly used chlorpropamide (Diabinese), tolazamide (Tolinase), and tolbutamide (Orinase)—works most successfully in those who have recently been diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes. Sulfonylureas are “pancreas stimulators” that cause the beta cells to release more insulin. They are generally inexpensive, and they reduce fasting blood glucose levels effectively. Side effects associated with their use include weight gain and hypoglycemia. . There is one meglitinide on the market, repaglinide (Prandin), and one d-phenylalanine derivative, nateglinide (Starlix). These drugs are not sulfonylureas, but their mechanism of action closely resembles them. They stimulate the release of insulin from pancreatic , but they take effect more quickly, and their effects last for only a short amount of time. They are also most effective in people recently diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes, and they act to control postprandial blood glucose elevations. Either drug should be taken immediately before a meal; if you skip a meal, don’t take a pill or you will risk hypoglycemia. If you have trouble maintaining a regular eating pattern, you may have a problem remembering to take these pills. . Thiazolidinediones, often referred to as TZDs or glitazones, are insulin sensitizers, designed to help insulin work better in muscle and fat tissue while protecting insulin-producing beta cells from further damage. The first approved drug in this class, troglitazone (Rezulin), was removed from the market in 2000 because of reports of severe liver toxicity. The currently available TZDs, pioglitazone (Actos) and rosiglitazone (Avandia), have not been associated with this problem. Nonetheless, periodic liver function tests are still recommended for people taking either pioglitazone or rosiglitazone. Because the TZDs don’t increase insulin secretion, they do not carry the risk of hypoglycemia. People who already use insulin may find that adding a TZD to their diabetes regimen may help to significantly reduce their daily insulin requirement. However, TZDs are costly, and significant weight gain has been reported with their use. Oral blood-glucose-lowering medicines are generally not recommended for use in Type 1 diabetes because of the total lack of pancreatic insulin production that characterizes this condition. However, research has shown that the alpha-glucosidase inhibitors may be helpful in controlling postprandial blood glucose in people with Type 1 diabetes because of the drug’s ability to block the absorption of carbohydrate. Also, because of the insulin resistance that occurs in puberty, metformin has been shown to improve metabolic control in adolescents with Type 1 diabetes. This effect seems to be associated with improved insulin-induced glucose uptake by tissues. In both situations, oral medicines are not a substitute for insulin. They are used in addition to the insulin regimen. It should be noted that these are “off-label” uses of these drugs; neither is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for marketing as a treatment for Type 1 diabetes. During pregnancy, insulin has always been the treatment of choice for diabetes because oral medicines have long been thought to increase the risk of damage to the fetus. However, research into certain oral medicines (particularly glyburide and metformin) has led to their consideration as treatment for gestational diabetes and Type 2 diabetes during pregnancy. This is an area of controversy, however, and one in which a woman and her health-care team have to carefully weigh the risks and benefits together. Caring for your diabetes requires attention to detail in many areas, from meal planning to physical activity to monitoring of blood glucose. With everything else to consider, it’s no surprise that some people occasionally forget to take their oral medicines. In fact, research shows that nearly one in three people with Type 2 diabetes who need oral medicines fail to take them daily. Unfortunately, this doubles the likelihood of hospitalizations for heart- or diabetes-related complications. What should you do if you forget to take your diabetes pill or pills? As a general rule, you can take a missed dose of medicine as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for your next scheduled dose, you may be advised to skip the missed dose and go back to your regular schedule. Do not take a double dose. Taking a missed dose of repaglinide or nateglinide between meals could result in hypoglycemia because these drugs stimulate the release of insulin from the pancreas. If you miss a dose of acarbose or miglitol, taking it between meals will have little effect, because its action is based on stopping the absorption of carbohydrate after eating. Instead, resume taking it at your next meal. Treating diabetes is an art grounded in science. Work with your diabetes team to choose and use the oral medicine or combination of oral medicines that works best for your situation. You may want to consider the cost of the drug and the number of times per day you have to take it, as well as side effects and possible interactions with any other drugs you may take.

Reviewed By: Type 1 diabetes is a chronic condition that usually starts in childhood, but can occur in adults (30 to 40-year-olds). In type 1 diabetes, the pancreas produces very little insulin. Insulin helps cells in the body convert sugar into energy. When the pancreas cannot make enough insulin, sugar starts to build up in the blood, causing life-threatening complications. Individuals with type 1 diabetes must take some form of insulin for the rest of their lives. Unusual thirst is a very common symptom of type 1 diabetes. This condition causes the kidneys to remove excess sugar in the blood by getting rid of more water. The water is removed through urinating, causing dehydration and dehydration causes you to drink more water. Patient with type 1 diabetes develop unintentional weight loss and an increase in appetite because blood sugar levels remain high and the body metabolizes fat for energy. Disrupted glucose metabolism also causes patient to feel a lack of energy and drowsy for extended periods Excess urination also cause weight loss because many calories are leaving the body in urine. The disruption in glucose metabolism in patient with type 1 diabetes causes skin changes. Type 1 diabetics are at a higher risk for bacterial infections and fungal infections. Poor blood circulation in the skin may also occur. Patient with type 1 diabetes are often infected with fungal infections caused by the yeast Candida albicans. Common fungal infections include athlete's foot, vaginal yeast infection in women, jock itch, ringworm, and diaper rashes in babies. Diaper rash caused by the yeast Candida albicans can spread to other areas of the body such as the stomach and legs. Patient with untreated type 1 diabetes can experience serious symptoms such as blurry vision, numbness or tingling in the extremities (especially the feet), loss of consciousness, fatigue, fruity breath, dry mouth, and diabetic coma. In contrast to high sugars in the blood, occasionally patient with type 1 diabetes can get low blood sugars (hypoglycemia) when their blood glucose level falls suddenly. In patient with type 1 diabetes, loss of consciousness, diabetic coma, and in some cases hypoglycemia, are medical emergencies. Some people who are undiagnosed may have no warning signs, yet still can develop diabetic coma or hypoglycemia. The problem with type 1 diabetes is that the person's cells are deprived of the sugar they need for energy. Without the insulin produced by the pancreas, sugar has difficulty entering the body's cells. Consequently, the body cells start burning fat for energy, which causes ketones to build up in the blood. These acids can change the person's blood pH level and can trigger a life-threatening coma. This is termed diabetic ketoacidosis. Diabetic ketoacidosis is a medical emergency that needs to be treated quickly, usually in a hospital setting. Symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis include the following: What is the Difference Between Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes? Type 1 diabetes usually starts in childhood or young adulthood, whereas type 2 diabetes usually starts in adulthood. In patient with type 1 diabetes, the body's immune system attacks and destroys pancreatic cells (Beta cells) that produce insulin. In patient with type 2 diabetes, the pancreas is not attacked and usually produces insulin. However, patient with type 2 diabetes, for numerous reasons, cannot use the available insulin effectively. Patient with type 2 diabetes can have the same symptoms as patient with type 1 diabetes, but patient with type 1 diabetes usually have symptoms occur more rapidly. Type 1 diabetes cannot be prevented, but type 2 diabetes can be prevented or delayed with a healthy lifestyle. When the body’s immune system destroys beta cells in part of the pancreas, type 1 diabetes develops. Beta cells in the pancreas produce insulin. Researchers are not sure why a person's immune system attacks its own insulin producing cells. However, researchers and clinicians suspect that genetic susceptibility and environmental factors raise the risk for developing type 1 diabetes. Scientists have identified genes and gene regions that raise the risk of developing type 1 diabetes, but they are not the only factors that cause the disease. Researchers suggest that environmental triggers such as a viral infection or perhaps dietary or pregnancy-related factors may also play a role in developing type 1 diabetes. Although type 1 diabetes can develop at any age, about two-thirds of new cases are diagnosed in individuals under the age of 19. Researchers have noted two peak times for development of type 1 diabetes; the first is in early childhood and the second occurs at puberty. Type 1 diabetes affects males and females equally, and is more common in Caucasians than in other ethnic groups. A family history of type 1 diabetes also increases one’s risk for developing type 1 diabetes. Simple blood tests can indicate the presence of abnormal sugar levels in the blood. If a person has any symptoms of diabetes, a fasting blood sugar test or even a random blood sugar test is usually the first step in diagnosis. A hemoglobin A1c test can reveal average blood sugar levels for the past 2 to 3 months. In most cases these tests are repeated on at least two separate days. Other tests used are the glucose tolerance test or testing for specific antibodies in the blood. Type 1 diabetes damages arteries and makes them susceptible to hardening (atherosclerosis), which can lead to high blood pressure and other heart and circulation problems. Unfortunately, undiagnosed or prolonged high blood sugar levels can result in damage to organ systems in the body over time. Patient with type 1 diabetes have a high risk of vision problems, heart disease, stroke, kidney failure, gum disease, tooth loss, and nerve damage (especially in the hands and feet). Other organs may also be damaged. For patient with diabetes, complications that can damage organs can be prevented or reduced by regulating their blood sugar level. This is done by pricking the finger and putting a drop of blood on a test strip. The strip is then placed in a monitor that reads the glucose level. Close monitoring of glucose levels allows the individual to regulate their blood sugar by either medication if the sugar is high, or taking in sugar if the level is low. If a person with diabetes is able to keep blood sugar levels in or near the normal range, they will decrease the likelihood of developing complications and have more energy and fewer problems related to diabetes. Another device that measures glucose is termed a continuous glucose monitoring system (CGM). This system consists of a tiny sensor under the skin to check blood sugar levels. It send the information to a cell phone sized device that records an average glucose value every five minutes for about 72 hours. CGM is now accepted for long term use in some patients with models that turn off insulin infusion when sugars start to drop. Every person with type 1 diabetes needs to take insulin to help their body process sugar in the blood. Most people with type 1 diabetes take insulin in the injectable form and require several shots per day. There are different types of insulin available. Rapid-acting insulin starts to work within a few minutes and lasts for a couple of hours. Regular or short-acting insulin takes about 30 minutes to work and lasts 3-6 hours. Intermediate-acting insulin takes 2-4 hours to work and lasts up to 18 hours. You and your doctor can adjust your insulin shots based on results of blood sugar testing. As previously stated, the goal is to keep glucose levels in the blood within normal range as often as possible. Insulin can be injected using a needle and syringe, a cartridge system, or a pre-filled pen system. Inhaled insulin, insulin pumps, and a quick-acting insulin device can also be used. If injecting insulin into your body the best place is the abdomen, but the arms, thighs, and buttocks are also effective. Insulin is a hormone from the pancreas that allows sugar to enter the cells. Insulin also lowers the amount of sugar in the bloodstream. Without insulin, sugar is unable to enter the cells. This means that cells that make up muscles and other tissues will not be able to receive their main source of energy. Patient with type 1 diabetes will have a buildup of sugar in the bloodstream, causing life-threatening conditions. Although insulin is a wonderful drug that helps people with diabetes, it needs to be used carefully. If a person takes too much insulin it is possible the blood sugar level will lower into dangerous levels. This situation is termed an insulin reaction (low blood sugar due to excessive insulin). Too much insulin can result in symptoms that may be mild, moderate, or severe, depending on how low and how long the low blood sugar levels exist in a person's blood. Some signs and symptoms of low blood sugar include fatigue, excessive yawning, mild confusion, decreased coordination, sweating, muscle twitching, and pale skin. As these symptoms get progressively worse, seizures, loss of consciousness, and even death may occur. People with diabetes, especially type 1 diabetes, are advised to carry about 15 grams of a quick-acting carbohydrate at all times. Quick-acting carbohydrates are foods or drinks containing glucose that is rapidly absorbed into the body and the blood. Examples include a half-cup of fruit juice or a non-diet soda, five Life Savers (small hard candies), two tablespoons of raisins, one cup of milk, or three glucose tablets. These carbohydrates may resolve mild to moderate insulin reactions. For severe reactions, a drug called glucagon should be injected under the skin by a family member or friend familiar with treating severe insulin reactions and the person should be seen by a medical health care professional. Although many people administer insulin through several shots per day, some people may be able to utilize an insulin pump. This pump delivers insulin around-the-clock by pushing insulin through a thin tube inserted into the person's skin. The insulin pump can be programmed to deliver exact amounts of insulin in a continuous dose as well as deliver extra doses certain times, typically when eating. People with diabetes are encouraged to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this insulin delivery system with their doctor. There is a test called the hemoglobin A1c blood test that is used to help determine how well a person is managing their blood glucose levels. This test is taken at the doctor's office and measures how well the blood sugar has been controlled over a 2 to 3 month span. If the results show poor blood sugar control (high A1c levels), it suggests that the person's insulin therapy, dietary habits, and/or physical activity be modified to lower blood sugar levels into a more normal range. Some people with diabetes fail insulin therapy and may have reactions to the insulin that is injected. These people may be candidates for a procedure that some clinicians consider experimental. The procedure is a transfer of healthy insulin-producing cells from a donor into the pancreas of the patient with type 1 diabetes. Although there are benefits to this procedure, there are also drawbacks including medications with serious side effects that must be used to prevent rejection of the donor cells, and the probability that the transplanted cells may only function for a few years. People with type 1 diabetes benefit from exercise, but they need to take precautions to prevent sudden drops in blood glucose levels. Diabetics should check their blood sugars before exercising and may require eating a snack before or during exercise. They may need to adjust their insulin dosage before exercising to ensure they stay within normal ranges of blood glucose. People with type 1 diabetes may also need to check their urine for ketones – ketones suggest that your blood sugar is too high. Strenuous activity needs to be avoided if ketones are detected or if your blood sugar level is either high or low before exercise. People with type 1 diabetes, like everyone else, need to eat a well-balanced diet. This will help their insulin therapy and reduce the chance of diabetic complications. There is no “diabetes diet”. Even a person with type 1 diabetes can eat sweets as long as it is part of a well-balanced diet. That is not to say they can eat anything all the time, but they need to consider how sweets can fit into their well-balanced diet. Type 1 diabetics should also consider the fact that carbohydrates raise blood sugar levels faster than any other food. Food low in carbs, but high in calcium, potassium, fiber, magnesium, and other vitamins are excellent food choices for diabetics. Consider the following guidelines when planning your meals: Healthcare workers such as dietitians can help people with diabetes plan a well-balanced and varied diet. Women with type 1 diabetes need to let their doctors know if they plan to become pregnant. Poor control of their blood sugars may cause complications such as birth defects. Planning ahead, even before conception, to control blood sugar levels can lower the risk of miscarriage and birth defects. During pregnancy, it is important to test blood glucose often and keep your A1c below 7%. Good blood sugar control can reduce other complications during pregnancy such as high blood pressure or retinal damage in the mother. Preeclampsia is a condition that 18%-30% of pregnant women with diabetes develop. Preeclampsia develops after the 20-week mark and is characterized by high blood pressure and proteins in the urine. It is important to treat preeclampsia, if untreated it may harm the baby and put the mother at risk for stroke and seizures. Once the baby is born and if the mother is breastfeeding, it is important for her to check her glucose levels frequently. In the United States, 13,000 children are diagnosed with type 1 diabetes each year. Diagnosis of diabetes in children is a life-changing situation because it affects the whole family. Parents must help children monitor blood sugar and plan family meals that are appropriate for the child with diabetes and other family members. Insulin dosages must be monitored and blood sugar levels need to be checked by the child’s caregivers. Diabetes in children is a 24-hour-a-day problem that needs to be considered when a child is attending school and participating in extracurricular activities. Parents and their children need to make arrangements to follow through with insulin treatments even while the child is at school. These arrangements need to be planned in advance, as not every state or school may participate in the child’s care the same way. Researchers are attempting to develop an artificial pancreas. This device is a combination of an insulin pump and continuous glucose monitoring system controlled by a computer program. The goal for the system is to release insulin in response to blood sugar levels and to reduce the release of insulin if blood sugar levels drop. The goal is to have a device that mimics the function of a normal pancreas. Some early trials of experimental devices suggest this device may be available in the future.

0e792432-d61d-4ce6-9e1e-8761e7f690d1,"From marinara sauce to peanut butter, added sugar can be found in even the most unexpected products. Many people rely on quick, processed foods for meals and snacks. Since these products often contain added sugar, it makes up a large proportion of their daily calorie intake. In the US, added sugars account for up to 17% of the total calorie intake of adults and up to 14% for children (). Dietary guidelines suggest limiting calories from added sugar to less than 10% per day (). Experts believe that sugar consumption is a major cause of obesity and many chronic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes. Here are 11 reasons why eating too much sugar is bad for your health. Rates of obesity are rising worldwide and added sugar, especially from sugar-sweetened beverages, is thought to be one of the main culprits. Sugar-sweetened drinks like sodas, juices and sweet teas are loaded with fructose, a type of simple sugar. Consuming fructose increases your hunger and desire for food more than glucose, the main type of sugar found in starchy foods (). Additionally, excessive fructose consumption may cause resistance to , an important hormone that regulates hunger and tells your body to stop eating (). In other words, sugary beverages don’t curb your hunger, making it easy to quickly consume a high number of liquid calories. This can lead to weight gain. Research has consistently shown that people who drink sugary beverages, such as soda and juice, weigh more than people who don’t (). Also, drinking a lot of sugar-sweetened beverages is linked to an increased amount of visceral fat, a kind of deep belly fat associated with conditions like diabetes and heart disease (). Consuming too much added sugar, especially from sugary beverages, increases your risk of weight gain and can lead to visceral fat accumulation. High-sugar diets have been associated with an increased risk of many diseases, including heart disease, the number one cause of death worldwide (). Evidence suggests that high-sugar diets can lead to obesity, inflammation and high triglyceride, blood sugar and blood pressure levels — all risk factors for heart disease (). Additionally, consuming too much sugar, especially from sugar-sweetened drinks, has been linked to atherosclerosis, a disease characterized by fatty, artery-clogging deposits (). A study in over 30,000 people found that those who consumed 17–21% of calories from added sugar had a 38% greater risk of dying from heart disease, compared to those consuming only 8% of calories from added sugar (). Just one 16-ounce (473-ml) can of soda contains 52 grams of sugar, which equates to more than 10% of your daily calorie consumption, based on a 2,000-calorie diet (). This means that one sugary drink a day can already put you over the for added sugar. Consuming too much added sugar increases heart disease risk factors such as obesity, high blood pressure and inflammation. High-sugar diets have been linked to an increased risk of dying from heart disease. A diet high in refined carbs, including sugary foods and drinks, has been associated with a . Foods with a high glycemic index, such as processed sweets, raise your blood sugar more rapidly than foods with a lower glycemic index. Sugary foods quickly spike blood sugar and insulin levels, causing increased androgen secretion, oil production and inflammation, all of which play a role in acne development (). Studies have shown that low-glycemic diets are associated with a reduced acne risk, while high-glycemic diets are linked to a greater risk (). For example, a study in 2,300 teens demonstrated that those who frequently consumed added sugar had a 30% greater risk of developing acne (). Also, many population studies have shown that rural communities that consume traditional, non-processed foods have almost non-existent rates of acne, compared to more urban, high-income areas (). These findings coincide with the theory that diets high in processed, sugar-laden foods contribute to the development of acne. High-sugar diets can increase androgen secretion, oil production and inflammation, all of which can raise your risk of developing acne. The worldwide prevalence of diabetes has more than doubled over the past 30 years (). Though there are many reasons for this, there is a clear link between excessive sugar consumption and diabetes risk. Obesity, which is often caused by consuming too much sugar, is considered the strongest (). What’s more, prolonged high-sugar consumption drives resistance to insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas that regulates blood sugar levels. causes blood sugar levels to rise and strongly increases your risk of diabetes. A population study comprising over 175 countries found that the risk of developing diabetes grew by 1.1% for every 150 calories of sugar, or about one can of soda, consumed per day (). Other studies have also shown that people who drink sugar-sweetened beverages, including fruit juice, are more likely to develop diabetes (, ). A high-sugar diet may lead to obesity and insulin resistance, both of which are risk factors for type 2 diabetes. Eating excessive amounts of sugar may increase your risk of developing certain cancers. First, a diet rich in sugary foods and beverages can lead to obesity, which significantly raises your risk of cancer (). Furthermore, diets high in sugar increase inflammation in your body and may cause insulin resistance, both of which increase cancer risk (). A study in over 430,000 people found that added sugar consumption was positively associated with an increased risk of esophageal cancer, pleural cancer and cancer of the small intestine (). Another study showed that women who consumed sweet buns and cookies more than three times per week were 1.42 times more likely to develop endometrial cancer than women who consumed these foods less than 0.5 times per week (). Research on the link between added sugar intake and cancer is ongoing, and more studies are needed to fully understand this complex relationship. Too much sugar can lead to obesity, insulin resistance and inflammation, all of which are risk factors for cancer. While a healthy diet can , a diet high in added sugar and processed foods may increase your chances of developing depression. Consuming a lot of processed foods, including high-sugar products such as cakes and sugary drinks, has been associated with a higher risk of depression (, ). Researchers believe that blood sugar swings, neurotransmitter dysregulation and inflammation may all be reasons for sugar’s detrimental impact on mental health (). A study following 8,000 people for 22 years showed that men who consumed 67 grams or more of sugar per day were 23% more likely to develop depression than men who ate less than 40 grams per day (). Another study in over 69,000 women demonstrated that those with the highest intakes of added sugars had a significantly greater risk of depression, compared to those with the lowest intakes (). A diet rich in added sugar and processed foods may increase depression risk in both men and women. Wrinkles are a natural sign of aging. They appear eventually, regardless of your health. However, poor food choices can worsen wrinkles and speed the skin aging process. (AGEs) are compounds formed by reactions between sugar and protein in your body. They are suspected to play a key role in skin aging (). Consuming a diet high in refined carbs and sugar leads to the production of AGEs, which may cause your skin to age prematurely (). AGEs damage collagen and elastin, which are proteins that help the skin stretch and . When collagen and elastin become damaged, the skin loses its firmness and begins to sag. In one study, women who consumed more carbs, including added sugars, had a more wrinkled appearance than women on a high-protein, lower-carb diet (). The researchers concluded that a lower intake of carbs was associated with better skin-aging appearance (). Sugary foods can increase the production of AGEs, which can accelerate skin aging and wrinkle formation. Telomeres are structures found at the end of chromosomes, which are molecules that hold part or all of your genetic information. Telomeres act as protective caps, preventing chromosomes from deteriorating or fusing together. As you grow older, telomeres naturally shorten, which causes cells to age and malfunction (). Although the shortening of telomeres is a normal part of aging, unhealthy lifestyle choices can speed up the process. Consuming high amounts of sugar has been shown to accelerate telomere shortening, which increases cellular aging (). A study in 5,309 adults showed that regularly drinking sugar-sweetened beverages was associated with shorter telomere length and premature cellular aging (). In fact, each daily 20-ounce (591-ml) serving of sugar-sweetened soda equated to 4.6 additional years of aging, independent of other variables (). Eating too much sugar can accelerate the shortening of telomeres, which increases cellular aging. Foods high in added sugar quickly spike blood sugar and insulin levels, leading to increased energy. Products that are loaded with sugar but lacking in protein, fiber or fat lead to a brief energy boost that’s quickly followed by a sharp drop in blood sugar, often referred to as a crash (). Having constant blood sugar swings can lead to major fluctuations in energy levels (). To avoid this , choose carb sources that are low in added sugar and rich in fiber. Pairing carbs with protein or fat is another great way to keep your blood sugar and . For example, eating an apple along with a small handful of almonds is an excellent snack for prolonged, consistent energy levels. High-sugar foods can negatively impact your energy levels by causing a spike in blood sugar followed by a crash. A high intake of fructose has been consistently linked to an increased risk of . Unlike glucose and other types of sugar, which are taken up by many cells throughout the body, fructose is almost exclusively broken down by the liver. In the liver, fructose is converted into energy or stored as glycogen. However, the liver can only store so much glycogen before excess amounts are turned into fat. Large amounts of added sugar in the form of fructose overload your liver, leading to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a condition characterized by excessive fat buildup in the liver (). A study in over 5,900 adults showed that people who drank sugar-sweetened beverages daily had a 56% higher risk of developing NAFLD, compared to people who did not (). Eating too much sugar may lead to NAFLD, a condition in which excessive fat builds up in the liver. Aside from the risks listed above, sugar can harm your body in countless other ways. Having consistently high blood sugar levels can cause damage to the delicate blood vessels in your kidneys. This can lead to an increased risk of kidney disease (). Eating too much . Bacteria in your mouth feed on sugar and release acid byproducts, which cause tooth demineralization (). is an inflammatory condition characterized by pain in the joints. Added sugars raise uric acid levels in the blood, increasing the risk of developing or worsening gout (). High-sugar diets can lead to impaired memory and have been linked to an increased risk of dementia (). Research on the impact of added sugar on health is ongoing, and new discoveries are constantly being made. Consuming too much sugar may worsen cognitive decline, increase gout risk, harm your kidneys and cause cavities. Excessive added sugar has many negative health effects. Although consuming small amounts now and then is perfectly healthy, you should try to cut back on sugar whenever possible. Fortunately, simply focusing on eating automatically decreases the amount of sugar in your diet. Here are some tips on how to : Swap sodas, energy drinks, juices and sweetened teas for water or unsweetened seltzer. Drink your coffee black or use Stevia for a zero-calorie, natural sweetener. Sweeten plain yogurt with fresh or frozen berries instead of buying flavored, sugar-loaded yogurt. Consume whole fruits instead of sugar-sweetened fruit smoothies. Replace candy with a homemade trail mix of fruit, nuts and a few dark chocolate chips. Use olive oil and vinegar in place of sweet salad dressings like honey mustard. Choose marinades, nut butters, ketchup and marinara sauce with zero added sugars. Look for cereals, granolas and granola bars with under 4 grams of sugar per serving. Swap your morning cereal for a bowl of rolled oats topped with nut butter and fresh berries, or an omelet made with fresh greens. Instead of jelly, slice fresh bananas onto your peanut butter sandwich. Use natural nut butters in place of sweet spreads like Nutella. Avoid alcoholic beverages that are sweetened with soda, juice, honey, sugar or agave. Shop the perimeter of the grocery store, focusing on fresh, whole ingredients. In addition, keeping a food diary is an excellent way of becoming more aware of the main sources of sugar in your diet. The best way to limit your added sugar intake is to prepare your own healthy meals at home and avoid buying foods and drinks that are high in added sugar. Focusing on preparing healthy meals and limiting your intake of foods that contain added sweeteners can help you cut back on the amount of sugar in your diet. Eating too much added sugar can have many negative health effects. An excess of sweetened foods and beverages can lead to weight gain, blood sugar problems and an increased risk of heart disease, among other dangerous conditions. For these reasons, added sugar should be kept to a minimum whenever possible, which is easy when you follow a based on whole foods. If you need to cut added sugar from your diet, try some of the small changes listed above. Before you know it, your sugar habit will be a thing of the past.

71152aa7-feb5-4a04-9eba-789dda7861ad,"NIH Awards Grant to Develop At-Home Type 1 Diabetes Risk Testing Right now, there are a variety of methods available to assess someone’s risk of developing type 1 diabetes[1]. As we recently discussed on this blog, tests for antibodies[2] in the blood of people with a family history of diabetes can predict this risk with a high degree of accuracy. And genetic testing[3] may be helpful in identifying who is at an elevated risk for developing these antibodies in the first place. More experimentally, there is a newly discovered way to identify early beta cell death[4] at the onset of the type 1 disease process, before someone shows any symptoms or develops elevated blood glucose levels. To get cutting-edge diabetes news, strategies for blood glucose management, nutrition tips, healthy recipes, and more delivered straight to your inbox, sign up for our free newsletter[5]! As promising and potentially transformative as all these tests and developments might be, they all require a visit to a doctor’s office or another healthcare facility. For many people, this may be a barrier to getting screened. That’s why it’s noteworthy that a division of the National Institutes of Health (NIH)[6] has awarded a grant to a company[7] that’s working to develop risk assessment tests for type 1 diabetes that can be taken at home. Enable Biosciences[8], a healthcare diagnostics company established to commercialize technology licensed by the University of California, Berkeley, announced in a press release[9] that it has received a grant of nearly $1.5 million from the National Institute for Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK)[10] to help develop techniques for at-home type 1 diabetes risk screening tests. These tests would involve collecting a small blood sample that’s sent to a lab, as a dried blood spot, for testing. There are many technological barriers to getting accurate results from mailed-in samples on existing tests, and the NIDDK grant will be used to help advance “efforts to automate the extraction of dried blood spots” for use with Enable’s “award-winning autoimmune diabetes test.” The press release notes that new preventive therapies for type 1 diabetes, as well as monitoring to help prevent emergency hospitalization at the onset of the condition, depend on screening tests, so making these tests easier and more widely available could potentially both save money and help people stay healthier. “The ability to collect samples in the convenience of the home is a major step to ensure that all patients reap the benefits of breakthrough therapies,” says Enable Biosciences COO Peter Robinson, PhD, in the press release. “The NIDDK’s support for this project will lower the barrier to universal screening.” Want to learn more about type 1 diabetes?

Why Some People Don’t Seek Mental Health Services For QAnon Believers Facing Reality, What Happens Now? Diabetes is a major health consequence of poor quality sleep. One of the most serious health consequences of disrupted, poor quality sleep is a significantly increased risk for diabetes. The relationship between sleep and diabetes is complex, and scientists are still working to understand all the ways that sleep and circadian rhythms (also known as your internal biological clock) affect this disease. That said, we have some hints, since we know sleep has a powerful connection to metabolism (how our body uses food for energy), to that regulate and eating patterns, and to the body’s use of blood sugar and insulin. Sleep is an important time for restoration and repair of the body at a cellular level. That includes maintenance of the immune system (which keeps us from getting sick) and of the body’s metabolic functions. Stages 3 & 4—called deep or slow-wave sleep—appear to be especially important to the body’s ability to use insulin to regulate blood sugar. Poor sleep affects diabetes both directly and indirectly, by triggering changes to hormones, contributing to weight gain and , and causing changes to behavior and lifestyle. Sleep disruption increases the risk of type 2 diabetes People with diabetes are much more likely to have obstructive and other sleep disorders. The more severe sleep problems are, the more severe—and less well controlled—diabetes is likely to be. There’s a lot of paid to short sleep and its risks. And rightly so. At middle age and during older adulthood, people who report not getting enough sleep are roughly twice as likely to be diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, according to several large-scale studies. Over the past several decades, we’ve seen a rise in the number of people with chronic sleep deprivation, obesity, and diabetes. The increases in these serious public health problems appear to be connected. According to the Center for Disease Control figures released in 2017, more than 100 million Americans currently have diabetes or prediabetes. That’s close to a third of the population. Nearly one in four people with diabetes don’t know they have it, according to the CDC report. And almost 90 percent of people with prediabetes aren’t aware of their condition. At the same time, more than a third of Americans are routinely getting less sleep than they need. For most of us, that’s in the neighborhood of seven hours a night. And currently, more than 36 percent of adults in the US are obese. Obesity is a prime risk factor for diabetes—and overwhelming scientific evidence shows poor sleep contributes to obesity. Obesity has doubled worldwide over the past nearly four decades, and during that same period, rates of insufficient sleep have increased. But not enough isn’t the only sleep problem that can increase the risk for diabetes and compromise its effective . We know from scientific research that in addition to a lack of sleep quantity, poor sleep quality can also interfere with the body’s metabolic functioning and elevate risks for the disease. It comes as a surprise to many of my patients, but there’s also increasing evidence that sleeping too much can also raise risks for diabetes.  And scientists are increasingly investigating the role circadian rhythms (your biological clock) play in the development of diabetes. Circadian rhythms affect many areas of your health, some of which you might not be aware of. In addition to sleep-wake cycles, circadian rhythms also regulate hormones that affect metabolism, appetite, insulin, and blood glucose. When circadian rhythms are out of sync, the body’s metabolic health can decline—and a risk for diabetes can increase. When we think about sleep and its influence over diabetes, it’s important to consider not only amounts of sleep but sleep quality, sleep habits, and sleep patterns.  Despite the increasingly strong evidence linking sleep to diabetes, sleep problems remain an overlooked factor in the risk for and management of the disease. Let’s take a closer look at the ways poor sleep can affect the development of diabetes and the health of people who are living with the condition. Poor sleep interferes with insulin and blood glucose  Among the more recent discoveries scientists have made about the sleep and diabetes connection is this important one: Poor sleep changes how the body produces and uses insulin. Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas that enables cells in muscles and tissues of the body to absorb glucose from the bloodstream, to be used for energy. In this way, insulin regulates blood glucose—or blood sugar—helping maintain a level that is neither too high (hyperglycemia) nor too low (hypoglycemia). I often tell my patients to think of insulin as a key to a lock, or the doorman to a hotel, allowing glucose to exit the blood and enter cells. Cells can become resistant to insulin, making them less able to absorb glucose from the blood. In this case, our “key” may not be working as smoothly as we would like. This leads to persistently high levels of glucose (i.e., sugar) in the blood—which, in turn, triggers the body to increase production of insulin. Sometimes, the body under-produces insulin, which also results in high blood sugar. Over time, this dynamic of high blood sugar and insulin resistance (or lack of sufficient insulin production), can lead to the development of type 2 diabetes. In type 1 diabetes, a person’s body can’t make insulin naturally (very different, but also affected by sleep). Recent research indicates that insulin, like many other hormones and body systems, operates on a daily cycle. Scientists now think the body’s circadian clock directs this cycle by affecting the timing of the production and release of insulin from the pancreas. And there also appear to be certain times of the day when cells are more, and less, sensitive to insulin. Disruptions to circadian clocks—which often go hand-in-hand with sleep problems—appear to reduce the effectiveness of insulin and, over time, contribute to insulin resistance. Because insulin’s job is to regulate blood glucose, changes to insulin create changes to blood sugar. Irregular sleep schedules (like shift work, being a new parent, etc.) Patterns of poor quality, restless sleep (from the effects of your environment or use of ) The presence of sleep disorders, ( and sleep apnea) Lack of sleep also appears to affect the health of cells in the pancreas, where insulin is made and released. In a recent study using mice, scientists investigated the effects of sleep deprivation on cell function and found that insufficient sleep created in pancreatic cells and also disrupted blood glucose levels. Both the cellular stress and the disruptions to blood sugar were more pronounced in older mice, suggesting the body becomes less adept at coping with the impact of sleep deprivation over time. Sleep itself affects insulin activity and blood sugar  According to a growing body of research, insufficient and poor-quality sleep can decrease insulin sensitivity and decrease glucose tolerance (a measurement of how quickly and effectively the body removes glucose from the bloodstream). And it doesn’t take months or years for these negative effects to kick in. A single night of total sleep deprivation decreased insulin sensitivity more than six months of a high-fat , according to a 2016 study. Partial sleep deprivation—the kind of chronic sleep debt many people experience on a routine basis—decreases the body’s ability to use insulin effectively and keep blood sugar balanced. After a week of sleeping five hours a night, a group of healthy men saw significant reductions to insulin sensitivity, scientists reported in a 2010 study. Living with chronic sleep loss also diminishes glucose tolerance, making the body less effective at converting glucose to energy. And disrupted sleep interferes with the body’s ability to regulate glucose throughout the day and night. We know less about the impact of oversleeping on insulin and glucose. But recent research suggests getting too much sleep also has negative effects on insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance. Sleep affects other hormones that influence metabolic health Sleep deprivation also increases the production of cortisol—which can make cells more resistant to insulin—and other hormones, including thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and , which can lead to decreased insulin sensitivity and higher blood glucose.  Melatonin, which plays such a critical role in maintaining regular sleep patterns in keeping our circadian clocks synchronized, also appears to affect insulin. We’ve known for several years that certain variants associated with melatonin receptors are strongly linked to higher risks for type 2 diabetes. Recent research has shown higher levels of melatonin reduce the ability of insulin-making cells in the pancreas to release insulin—and that people with those genetic variants experience this insulin-suppressing effect more strongly. All these sleep-related changes—to insulin and blood sugar, and other hormones that affect metabolism—occur in healthy and non-diabetic people, bringing them closer to prediabetes and eventually diabetes. These changes also happen in people who have diabetes, making the condition harder to treat and control effectively. Sleep’s role in diet and weight raises risks for diabetes Obesity is the single most important predictor in the development of type 2 diabetes. More than 90 percent of people with type 2 diabetes are overweight or obese. Scientists have referred to the simultaneous rise of obesity and diabetes as “twin epidemics.” Sleep has a strong influence on appetite and eating patterns, exercise habits, and the hormones that regulate hunger and the feeling of fullness. In all these ways, sleep plays a powerful role in risks for obesity. You’ve seen how sleep can affect diabetes directly through its effects on insulin and blood sugar. Sleep also affects diabetes indirectly, because of its impact on body weight. Poor-quality and insufficient sleep alter hunger hormones. When we don’t get enough high-quality sleep, levels of the hormone leptin go down. Leptin is a hormone that helps maintain energy balance in the body. It curbs appetite, sending signals that you’ve consumed enough energy through calorie intake—signals that translate into feelings of fullness. Leptin also helps regulate metabolism and the rate at which the body burns fat. Lower leptin levels slow metabolism down. Poor sleep may also make the body resistant to leptin’s appetite-curbing effects. And recent research indicates leptin plays a direct role in regulating blood glucose. Scientists are looking at leptin—not for the first time—as a possible treatment for obesity and diabetes. Sleeping well is one way to keep your body supplied with leptin naturally. At the same time that poor sleep lowers leptin, it also increases levels of another hormone important to energy balance and weight: ghrelin. Sometimes referred to as the “hunger hormone,” ghrelin stimulates appetite, increasing hunger and the desire to eat. This double-hit of hormone imbalance—reduced leptin and increased ghrelin—can make it difficult to maintain a healthy weight, leading to weight gain and an elevated risk for diabetes. It also makes weight harder to control in people with prediabetes and diabetes. Poor sleep makes us more sedentary. When you’re not rested—whether because you’re not getting enough sleep or sleep is restless and disrupted—you tend to expend less energy in physical activity. Regular exercise is one important way to lower risk for diabetes and manage the condition more effectively if you have it. We eat the wrong things at the wrong times. Lack of sleep creates cravings for high-fat and high-sugar foods—the type of diet that, over time, can lead to diabetes, and also makes diabetes more difficult to control. When we’re sleep deprived, our brain’s reward centers go into overdrive. We also become more impulsive and less able to execute complex judgment and , the cognitive functions that enable us to make healthful, moderate food decisions. This makes us more likely to overeat. Sleep deprivation can make us eat more overall (one analysis suggests an additional 385 calories a day!), and cause us to eat less healthfully. Poor sleep also shifts a larger share of daily calorie intake to the evening hours. Nighttime eating disrupts circadian function, contributing to weight gain and also to problems with insulin and blood sugar. It also disrupts sleep itself—setting up a vicious cycle of disrupted sleep and eating habits.

651e4b65-8dd7-4eea-a736-e020c2ab6e12,"Are you sure your patient has type 1 diabetes mellitus? What are the typical findings for this disease? Diabetes mellitus is a disorder of the metabolic homeostasis controlled by insulin, resulting in abnormalities of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. Type 1 diabetes is caused by the autoimmune destruction of the insulin-producing beta cells of the pancreas. This results in an absolute insulin deficiency. Although there has been a marked rise in the percentage of cases of diabetes mellitus in children and adolescents caused by type 2 diabetes mellitus in the past one to two decades, type 1 diabetes remains the most common etiology of diabetes mellitus in prepubertal children. The most common symptoms are polydipsia and polyuria. Nocturia, re-emergence of bed-wetting, or a frequent need to leave class in school to use the bathroom are typical complaints that suggest polyuria. Other common symptoms at presentation of type 1 diabetes mellitus are polyphagia and weight loss. The above symptoms are typically present for less than a month; less commonly, the symptoms may be present for several months. Patients with diabetes mellitus will have an elevated plasma glucose level; a level greater than 200 mg/dl (11.1 mmol/L) in a child with symptoms of diabetes is diagnostic of diabetes mellitus (see below). Glucosuria on urinalysis will often be seen in patients with diabetes mellitus, but an absence of glucosuria does not exclude the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, and glucosuria can be caused by other conditions (see below). Urine ketones on urinalysis in a child with suspected diabetes mellitus raises the possibility that the child may be developing diabetic ketoacidosis. What are the findings of a child with type 1 diabetes mellitus presenting in diabetic ketoacidosis? Children with diabetic ketoacidosis present with nausea, vomiting, and lethargy, as well as with signs of dehydration. Some patients will develop abdominal pain that is severe enough to suggest appendicitis or other intraabdominal process. There may be a fruity odor to the breath from expired acetone. With severe acidosis, the patient will develop the deep labored breathing of Kussmaul respirations. As the DKA worsens, the lethargy can progress to severe obtundation and coma. On questioning, these children will usually also have a history of the classic symptoms of diabetes (polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weight loss). Diabetic ketoacidosis should be suspected in all children presenting with vomiting and lethargy, but particularly in the absence of fever and diarrhea. What other disease/condition shares some of these symptoms? Viral gastroenteritis (for a child presenting in diabetic ketoacidosis) Symptoms of diabetes occur when the capacity to produce insulin is insufficient to maintain metabolic homeostasis. It is felt that this point is not reached until greater than 80% of the beta-cells are destroyed, a process that probably takes months to years. When the serum glucose level rises above approximately 180 mg/dl (10 mmol/L), the kidneys are unable to resorb all the glucose being presented to them. This results in glucosuria, which stimulates an osmotic diuresis and the symptom of polyuria. Polydipsia is then triggered to maintain euvolemia. Insulin deficiency also results in increased lipolysis and protein breakdown. This, along with the calories lost with glucosuria, results in weight loss in spite of polyphagia. With profound insulin deficiency there is decompensation into ketoacidosis. The severe insulin deficiency allows for excessive lipolysis and the generation of ketoacids in the liver from the liberated fatty acids. As these ketoacids accumulate they cause an ileus. This ileus results in nausea, and later, vomiting, both of which impair fluid intake. The impaired fluid intake in the presence of the glucosuric osmotic diuresis produces dehydration. The dehydration impairs the ability to excrete glucose and acids, worsening the hyperglycemia and acidemia. The worsening hyperglycemia increases the osmotic diuresis, setting up a cycle of worsening dehydration and worsening hyperglycemia. The dehydration also stimulates the release of stress hormones including cortisol and catecholamines, both of which further stimulate lipolysis and hepatic glucose release, further worsening the metabolic derangements. Medical stress, including simple viral illnesses, results in insulin resistance. Because of this, a child may present with diabetes mellitus during a viral illness or other medical stress. In this situation, the illness resulted in an earlier presentation of the diabetes mellitus, because the increased insulin needs imposed by the insulin resistance exceeded the capacity for insulin production sooner than if the insulin needs remained stable. What laboratory studies should you request to help confirm the diagnosis? How should you interpret the results? A plasma glucose level of greater than 200 mg/dl (11.1 mmol/L), in the presence of the classic symptoms of diabetes mellitus, confirms the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. A hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) greater than 6.5% is also presumptive confirmation of a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. Confirmation of the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes mellitus is generally straightforward, with glucose and hemoglobin A1c levels unambiguously elevated above the diagnostic thresholds. Diabetes mellitus can also be diagnosed based on a fasting plasma glucose level greater than or equal to 126 mg/dl (7 mmol/L), or a plasma glucose level greater than or equal to 200 mg/dl (11.1 mmol/L) obtained 2 hours after ingestion of an oral glucose load (the oral glucose tolerance test, OGTT). If this testing is performed in the absence of the classic symptoms of diabetes mellitus, the diagnosis requires confirmation with repeat testing on a subsequent day. Because type 1 diabetes mellitus does not have a prolonged asymptomatic period, it is rarely appropriate to do such testing in an asymptomatic child. In cases where fasting plasma glucose testing or the OGTT is performed to investigate a possible diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, a diagnosis other than type 1 diabetes mellitus (such as MODY or type 2 diabetes mellitus) may be more likely. DKA is present if the child has hyperglycemia (glucose greater than 300 mg/dl (16.7 mmol/L)), along with acidosis (venous pH 7.3 or less; serum bicarbonate 15 mEq/L or less), and significant ketonuria or ketonemia. How do you differentiate stress-induced hyperglycemia from type 1 diabetes mellitus? Occasionally, a child will be found to have hyperglycemia during an acute illness. While this could represent the situation of a viral illness accelerating the presentation of type 1 diabetes mellitus (see above), it may also represent stress-induced hyperglycemia. Stress-induced hyperglycemia is most often relatively mild, but can result in plasma glucose levels above 300 mg/dl (16.7 mmol/L). In addition, transient hyperglycemia is common in children treated with beta-agonists and glucocorticoids for asthma. A lack of a history of the classic symptoms of diabetes mellitus preceding the acute illness makes it more likely the hyperglycemia is due to stress hyperglycemia rather than diabetes mellitus. In most cases, a normal hemoglobin A1c is sufficient to demonstrate the acute nature of the hyperglycemia and to exclude a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes mellitus. Positive diabetes autoantibodies, especially the presence of multiple diabetes autoantibodies, suggests an increased risk of the patient developing type 1 diabetes mellitus in the future, although progression to diabetes mellitus from stress-induced hyperglycemia is very rare. What other diseases/conditions present with glucosuria? In type 1 diabetes mellitus, glucosuria will occur when the plasma glucose level exceeds approximately 180 mg/dl (10 mmol/L). Thus, in a child with the classic symptoms of diabetes mellitus, glucosuria suggests a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, although this should be confirmed with plasma glucose testing. Renal tubular dysfunction can lead to glucosuria in the absence of hyperglycemia. This will occur in Fanconi syndrome, as an isolated congenital disorder, or due to an acquired tubular dysfunction. The lack of hyperglycemia and/or a normal hemoglobin A1c excludes the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus when glucosuria is noted. Would imaging studies be helpful? If so, which ones? There are no imaging studies that help in diagnosing diabetes mellitus. The diagnosis of diabetes mellitus is made based on documenting hyperglycemia through measurement of the plasma glucose level or by measurement of the HbA1c (see above). Once a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus is made, one should consider whether it is a case of type 1 diabetes mellitus, or another type of diabetes mellitus. In some cases, the definitive determination of the type of diabetes the patient has cannot be made at the time of presentation. In such cases, the type of diabetes mellitus present is determined over time by the clinical course, including follow-up testing (such as measurement of the c-peptide level two or more years after the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, to quantify the amount of ongoing endogenous insulin production). A diagnosis of something other than type 1 diabetes mellitus is very unlikely in a child with all of the following at presentation: a prepubertal child that is older than 1 year of age diabetes mellitus diagnosed based on a random plasma blood sugar of greater than 200 mg/dl (11.1 mmol/L) after presenting with the classic symptoms of diabetes mellitus over a period of days to a few months there is no acute illness that could be causing stress hyperglycemia the child is not being treated with medications that can cause hyperglycemia (such as glucocorticoid) positive diabetes autoantibodies support the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes mellitus, but are probably unnecessary in such patients. When should a diagnosis of neonatal diabetes/monogenic diabetes be considered? Neonatal diabetes/monogenic diabetes mellitus should be considered in any infant less than 12 months of age who is diagnosed with diabetes mellitus. Monogenic diabetes is much less likely in infants presenting after 6 months of age, but should be considered up through 12 months of age. When should a diagnosis of MODY (maturity onset diabetes of youth) be considered? MODY should be considered in a child diagnosed with diabetes who has a family history suggesting an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern of early-onset diabetes mellitus. Type 2 diabetes mellitus has a strong inheritance pattern that can suggest autosomal dominant inheritance. However, in families with type 2 diabetes, the individuals with diabetes will generally be obese. MODY should be considered in a lean patient with evidence of significant endogenous insulin secretion more than 2-3 years after diagnosis (i.e., a detectable C-peptide level [>200nmol/l] with the glucose level > 144 mg/dl (8 mmol/L).) MODY2 should be considered in a patient identified with mild hyperglycemia (i.e., fasting glucose level 100-150 mg/dl (5.6-8.3 mmol/L)) in the absence of the classic symptoms of diabetes mellitus or of risk factors for type 2 diabetes mellitus. When should a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus be considered? In most pubertal or postpubertal children diagnosed with diabetes mellitus, it is appropriate to consider the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes as well as type 1 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is particularly likely in an obese child of minority racial/ethnic background. In contrast, a Caucasian child diagnosed with diabetes who is not overweight or obese is unlikely to have type 2 diabetes. A presentation with ketoacidosis does not exclude a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, insulin is needed for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis regardless of the underlying type of diabetes. In addition, children with type 2 diabetes presenting with ketoacidosis will likely require ongoing treatment with insulin, at least for some period of time. If diabetes mellitus is diagnosed based on testing done in a child because of risk factors for type 2 diabetes, the presumptive diagnosis is type 2 diabetes mellitus. How is type 1 diabetes mellitus differentiated from type 2 diabetes mellitus? When it is appropriate to consider whether a child with diabetes mellitus has type 1 diabetes versus type 2 diabetes, diabetes autoantibodies should be measured. The diabetes autoantibodies that can be measured are: these antibodies may develop in any patient treated with insulin. Therefore, positive insulin antibodies are not useful in differentiating type 1 versus type 2 diabetes if they are measured more than 1-2 weeks after a patient is treated with insulin antibody to insulinoma-associated protein 2 (IA-2; also known as ICA512) One or more positive diabetes autoantibodies supports a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes mellitus Each of the diabetes autoantibodies are positive in 50-90% of patients at diagnosis Negative tests for three or more diabetes autoantibodies supports the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus less than 5% of patients with type 1 diabetes will be negative for three or more tests for diabetes autoantibodies Positive diabetes autoantibodies may be found in up to 36% of youth with what otherwise appears to be type 2 diabetes mellitus It is unclear what the appropriate categorization of diabetes type in these patients is: whether they are obese, insulin resistant patients with type 1 diabetes, or whether they are type 2 diabetes patients with a low level of beta cell autoimmunity. Most of these patients will require insulin treatment. In patients with type 2 diabetes treated with oral agents, positive diabetes autoantibodies indicates an increased risk of a need for insulin treatment in the near future in order to maintain glycemic control. In a patient with presumed type 2 diabetes who is initiated on treatment with insulin, the presence of autoantibodies indicates a need for caution and careful consideration before discontinuing insulin. If you are able to confirm that the patient has type 1 diabetes mellitus, what treatment should be initiated? All patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus are treated with subcutaneous insulin. Treatment for the child presenting in DKA is presented in a separate section. For children not presenting in DKA, treatment should also be started the same day as the diagnosis is made, in order to avoid the risk that the child develops DKA awaiting initiation of treatment. In the vast majority of patients, insulin treatment for type 1 diabetes will be a basal/bolus regimen. In this regimen, a long acting insulin is given to provide for basal (fasting) insulin needs, and a rapid-acting insulin is given to provide prandial insulin needs. Use of an insulin pump to deliver continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion also provides a basal/bolus regimen. In this case, the basal insulin needs are provided by the basal rate of insulin delivered by the pump; the basal rate can be set to vary throughout the day. Prandial doses for patients using an insulin pump are calculated the same as those for patients using subcutaneous injections. Pumps provide a number of advantages over injection therapy (including the need to insert the infusion catheter subcutaneously only once every 2-3 days rather than a minimum of 4 subcutaneous injections with injection therapy). However, logistically pump therapy is not feasible to be started at the time of diagnosis. In addition, insulin pumps occasionally fail, in which case injection therapy must be used until a working pump is obtained. Therefore, it is important that all patients and families with type 1 diabetes know and be comfortable using injection treatment. To calculate insulin doses, the first step is to calculate the total daily insulin dose. In an established patient with type 1 diabetes, after there is complete loss of ß-cell function, total daily insulin needs are approximately 0.75-1 unit per kilogram of body weight (Puberty is associated with a physiologic insulin resistance, so that insulin requirements in adolescents are higher – typically 1-1.2 U/kg/day). However, at the time of diagnosis, the patient with type 1 diabetes still has some remaining insulin production. Therefore, initial insulin requirements are lower. In addition, the initial insulin dose chosen is intentionally somewhat low to avoid the acute risk of hypoglycemia. As the patient’s response to these initial doses is determined, the insulin doses can be increased to achieve the desired glycemic control. For children less than 2 years of age, a typical starting dose of insulin is 0.5 U/kg/day For older children the typical starting dose is 0.6-0.7 U/kg/day. Basal insulin needs are approximately 50% of the total daily insulin needs: -Insulin glargine insulin detemir are used as the basal insulin as these insulins have no significant peaks in their action. -Insulin glargine is typically given once a day, and can be given at any time of day (but then is given at the same time of day for a given patient). -Insulin detemir has a shorter half life than insulin glargine, and is therefore generally given twice a day (at breakfast and at bedtime). -Neither insulin glargine nor insulin detemir should be mixed with another insulin (i.e., they should not be mixed in the syringe with rapid-acting insulin in order to inject them together). Rapid-acting insulin is used for the bolus insulin. The three rapid-acting insulins (aspart, glulisine, lispro) are equivalent in their pharmacokinetics. The bolus insulin doses have two roles. First, they provide the insulin needed to meet the requirements of food intake. Second, the bolus dose provides additional insulin to correct for hyperglycemia. While euglycemia is the goal of insulin therapy in diabetes, this is never perfectly achieved. Various factors result in significant variability in glucose levels, even in response to apparently identical situations of insulin doses, activity, and food intake. To calculate a bolus dose the patient or caregiver calculates the insulin dose needed based on the amount of food to be eaten, measures the patient’s blood sugar level and calculates the dose of insulin needed to correct for hyperglycemia (if present), and adds these two amounts to give the total bolus dose (see example below). The onset of action of the rapid-acting insulins is approximately 15 minutes, with a peak action occurring at 30-60 minutes, and a duration of 3-4 hours. To optimally match the pharmacodynamics of these insulins, the rapid-acting insulin is injected at the start of the meal. However, this requires an accurate prediction of the amount to be eaten during that meal. For younger children in particular, this may not be possible, and injection of insulin at the start of the meal would then have the risk of over-dosing the insulin and causing hypoglycemia. In such cases, the insulin is injected immediately after the meal is completed. The amount of insulin needed at a meal is predominantly affected by the carbohydrate content of the meal. The actual ratio of insulin needed per carbohydrate consumed will vary from patient to patient. Typically, infants and toddlers will need 1 unit of insulin for every 20 to 40 grams of carbohydrate consumed, school-age children may need 1 unit for every 10 to 20 grams of carbohydrate consumed, while adolescents may need 1 unit for every 5 to 7.5 grams of carbohydrate consumed. (These doses are typical for a child with established diabetes – the requirement at the time of diagnosis will be for less insulin due to ongoing endogenous insulin production.) To calculate an initial insulin to carbohydrate ratio, an empiric formula can be used whereby the grams of carbohydrate covered by a unit of insulin is equal to 450 divided by the total daily insulin dose. An initial correction dose can be calculated using an empiric formula whereby 1 unit of insulin will lower the blood glucose (in mg/dl) level by 1800 divided by the total daily insulin dose. This will give the amount the blood sugar will decrease (in mg/dl) in response to a unit of insulin (in the absence of food intake). (To convert glucose level in mg/dL to mmol/L, divide by 18; 180 mg/dL = 10 mmol/L.) This correction dose is given when the preprandial blood sugar is above the target glucose level. For older preschool and school age children, correction doses may be given starting for blood sugars greater than 150 mg/dl. For infants and toddlers, correction doses may not be given unless the blood sugar is somewhat higher, perhaps greater than 180 mg/dl. This is due to a greater concern for hypoglycemia in these children, due in large part to the greater difficulty identifying hypoglycemia in these children. In addition, the threshold for adding the correction dose of insulin is dependent on the fall in blood sugar expected with the smallest correction dose that can be given. For example, if the patient is using an insulin syringe calibrated to give insulin in 0.5 unit increments, and has a correction dose of 1 unit per 200 mg/dl (0.5 units per 100 mg/dl), then the typical correction would start with giving 0.5 units only once the blood sugar level is above 200 mg/dl, as this extra 0.5 units would be expected to decrease the blood sugar level by 100 mg/dl (e.g., 201 mg/dl down to 101 mg/dl). In children in whom the bolus dose is given after the meal because of an inability to accurate predict the amount to be eaten at the meal, the bolus dose is based on the carbohydrates eaten calculated after the meal is completed but the correction dose is still based on the blood sugar obtained just prior to the meal. A 10-year-old girl weighing 27 kg presents with polydipsia and polyuria of 2 weeks’ duration. She is not in DKA. Insulin:carbohydrate ratio = 450 ÷ TDD = 450 ÷ 16.2 = 27.7 Use 1 unit per 100 mg/dl for blood sugars that are above 200 mg/dl Use 0.5 units per 50 mg/dl for blood sugars that are above 150 mg/dl This child’s usual breakfast contains 55 grams of carbohydrate. Her blood sugar one morning is 212 mg/dl. 55 grams of carbohydrate ÷ Insulin:carb ratio = 55÷25 = 2.2; give 2 units 212 mg/dl is two 50 mg/dl increments above 150 mg/dl; give 1.0 unit 3.0 units of rapid-acting insulin before breakfast this morning The goal of the basal insulin (glargine or detemir) is to maintain glucose levels steady during fasting. A rising blood glucose level during a fasting period (i.e., overnight), indicates a need to increase the basal insulin dose. Note, however, that unless fasting blood glucose levels fall below normal, a falling blood glucose level during fasting in a patient recently diagnosed with diabetes may represent the effect of the remaining endogenous insulin production, rather than indicating too high a dose of basal insulin. The goal of the insulin to carbohydrate ratio is to provide sufficient insulin so that the glucose level after a meal is the same as the level before the meal (“after” means after full absorption of the meal and after the majority of the action of the rapid-acting insulin; i.e., 3 hours after the insulin injection). Thus, if the blood sugar level consistently rises from within the target range before meals to above the target range after meals, more insulin should be given for carbohydrate ingestion (e.g., a change from 1 unit of insulin per 10 grams of carbs to 1 unit of insulin per 7 grams of carbs). The insulin to carb ratio is best assessed by evaluating the glucose levels after a meal when the glucose level before the meal was within the target range, since at these meals, no correction dose is given, isolating the effect of the insulin to carb ratio. The role of the correction dose is to bring any glucose level that is above the target range down into the target range (Note that this is the only dose whose role is to bring the blood glucose level into the target range). The correction dose can be directly tested by treating a fasting blood sugar that is above the target range with insulin and measuring the fall that occurs over the subsequent 2-3 hours (while maintaining the fast). The correction factor is the fall in the blood glucose level divided by the units of insulin given. Practically, however, the usual approach to evaluating the correction dose is to evaluate the glucose response to the rapid-acting bolus given with meals. This requires that the insulin to carbohydrate ratio first be determined to be correct. If glucose levels then remain above the target range when measured 3 hours after bolus doses given with meals when the blood sugar is above the target range, more insulin needs to be given as a correction dose (e.g., a change in the correction dose from 1 unit per 50 mg/dl to a dose of 1 unit per 40 mg/dl). Because of day to day and dose to dose variations, insulin doses are usually not adjusted based on single blood glucose levels, but rather based on the pattern of glucose levels identified over a period of days or weeks. The exception might be at the initiation of insulin treatment at the time of diagnosis, when early adjustments may be appropriate based on fewer blood glucose measurements. At the time of diagnosis with type 1 diabetes, the autoimmune destruction of β-cells is incomplete, with approximately 10-20% of β-cell function remaining. Chronic hyperglycemia impairs β-cell function. Thus, the chronic, unrecognized hyperglycemia that exists prior to the diagnosis of diabetes being made further impairs β-cells function at the time of diagnosis beyond that of the immune destruction. This metabolic impairment of β-cells resolves as insulin treatment is initiated. This temporary improvement can result in some degree of clinical remission. Many patients will have a decrease in their requirement for exogenous insulin, with a small minority able to maintain normal or near normal glucose levels without insulin treatment. This “honeymoon period” of improved β-cell function is temporary, as the remaining β-cells continue to be lost through the ongoing immune destruction. The duration of the honeymoon period is typically a few months, but it can vary from weeks to years, with the duration generally being inversely related to the age at presentation. What is the target range for blood glucose levels? Because subcutaneous delivery of insulin cannot match the pharmacodynamics of endogenous insulin secretion, patients with type 1 diabetes are not able to achieve completely normal blood sugar levels. The target for blood sugar levels is shown below. While the levels listed below are guidelines, the true target range is the lowest glucose levels that can be achieved without causing hypoglycemia (or with an acceptable frequency and severity of hypoglycemia). Even patients with excellent glycemia control will not have all of their blood glucose measurements in the target range. Getting 75% of blood glucose levels into the target range would be excellent control. Prior to the advent of rapid-acting and basal insulin analogues, insulin regimens for type 1 diabetes comprised 2 to 3 injections a day utilizing short-acting regular insulin and intermediate-acting NPH (neutral protamine Hagedorn) insulin. These have a greater risk of hypoglycemia because the peak action of these insulin does not correspond to a time of peak insulin need (food intake). This regimen requires that food intake match the insulin regimen, in contrast to the basal/bolus regimen where insulin doses match the food intake. Thus, using this regimen, meals should be taken at the same time and should have the same amount of carbohydrate each day. Split-mixed regimen using rapid-acting insulin in place of regular insulin decrease the risk of between-meal hypoglycemia associated with regular insulin use, but continue to have the risk of hypoglycemia from the non-physiologic peak of NPH. In the split-mixed regimen, regular (or rapid-acting) insulin plus NPH is given at breakfast and dinner. Because NPH can be combined in a single syringe with either regular or rapid-acting insulins, this regimen requires only two injections a day. A variation of the split-mixed regimen is to divide the evening dose into an injection of regular (or rapid-acting) insulin at dinner and an injection of NPH at bedtime (this was often necessary because the duration of NPH action is not always sufficient to persist from dinner through to breakfast). The dose of insulins used for a split-mixed regimen when initiating treatment in a newly diagnosed patient with diabetes again starts with estimating the total daily insulin dose as 0.5-0.7 U/kg/day (see above). 2/3 of this dose is given at breakfast; 2/3 of this breakfast dose is NPH, 1/3 is regular (or rapid-acting). 1/3 of the total daily dose is given in the evening; 1/2 of this evening dose is NPH, 1/2 is regular (or rapid-acting). For example, for the 27 kg 10-year-old, the total daily dose is again 16 units (0.6 x 27). Breakfast regular (or rapid acting) insulin = 1/3 x 10.6 = 3.5 units (give 3.5 units) Evening regular (or rapid-acting) insulin = 1/2 x 5.3 = 2.67 (give 2.5 units) After initiating the above insulin regimen, doses are adjusted based on monitored blood glucose levels (preprandial, at bedtime, and middle of the night). Generally, the breakfast NPH dose is adjusted based on the pre-dinner blood glucose, the breakfast regular (or rapid-acting) insulin dose is adjusted based on the pre-lunch blood glucose, the evening NPH dose is adjusted based on the overnight and pre-breakfast blood glucoses, and the evening regular (or rapid-acting) insulin dose is adjusted based on the pre-bedtime blood glucose. What are the adverse effects associated with each treatment option? No current insulin regimen can perfectly match the insulin requirements needed to maintain euglycemia. This results in blood sugar levels that are frequently above and below the target range. Before meal target: 90-130 mg/dL (5.0-7.2 mmol/L); before bedtime target: 90-150 mg/dl (5.0-8.3 mmol/L). The goal of insulin management in type 1 diabetes is to minimize both the magnitude and the frequency of out-of-range glucose levels. Minimizing the amount of hyperglycemia is important because this decreases the risk of long-term microvascular diabetes complications (retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy). Acutely, however, hyperglycemia has no associated morbidity other than polyuria, unless the hyperglycemia becomes extreme as in DKA. Hypoglycemia can result in the loss of consciousness and seizure. While the vast majority of even severe episodes of hypoglycemia have no apparent long-term morbidity, each episode does have the risk of complication resulting in morbidity and mortality. Injury can occur when hypoglycemia causes a loss of consciousness. This is particularly true during specific activities such as swimming and driving. And as with seizures from other causes there is a risk of hypoxic injury during hypoglycemic seizures. Up to 6% of deaths in individuals with type 1 diabetes may be due to hypoglycemia. In addition, approximately 6% of deaths in patients with type 1 diabetes are individuals found “dead in bed” with no apparent explanation for their death with a higher proportion of deaths in younger patients with diabetes ascribed to this phenomenon. Hypoglycemia is one of the hypothesized causes for the “dead in bed” phenomenon. There is also data that suggests that recurrent severe hypoglycemia has a negative effect on children’s cognitive function. Thus, iatrogenic hypoglycemia is a consequence of insulin therapy in type 1 diabetes mellitus, and the risks associated with hypoglycemia limits the ability to prevent hyperglycemia in type 1 diabetes mellitus. Among the most important initial skills that patients and families must be taught at the initiation of insulin treatment is the ability to recognize and treat hypoglycemia. What blood glucose level defines hypoglycemia? What are the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia? Signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia occur due to the effects of cerebral glucose deficiency (neuroglycopenic symptoms) and to the effects of catecholamines that are released as a counterregulatory response to the falling glucose level (adrenergic signs and symptoms). Hypoglycemia is defined as a plasma glucose <70 mg/dl 3.9 mmol/L). Catecholamine release is triggered as blood glucose falls below this level. Catecholamine release can also be stimulated at higher glucose levels if the level is declining rapidly, or in those with chronic hyperglycemia. Conversely, catecholamine release may be blunted, and only occur at a lower glucose level in those with chronic hypoglycemia (causing hypoglycemic unawareness). The adrenergic signs and symptoms include pallor, sweating, trembling, palpitations, and anxiety. Neuroglycopenic symptoms occur at lower glucose levels than adrenergic signs and symptoms, typically at blood glucose levels less than 50-55 mg/dl (2.8-3.1 mmol/L). The neuroglycopenic symptoms include hunger, headache, lightheadedness, drowsiness, and confusion. As discussed above, with severe hypoglycemia coma, seizures and, very rarely, death can occur. Mild to moderate hypoglycemia – when the child is conscious and able to cooperate – is treated by ingestion of 10-15 grams of glucose: If the child is conscious, but is not cooperative, a glucose gel can be squeezed into the patients mouth. Note that glucose is not absorbed in the mouth – it must be swallowed to be absorbed. Therefore, this approach is not appropriate for an unconscious or seizing patient. Tubes of glucose gel marketed specifically for treatment of hypoglycemia contain 15g of glucose. Tubes of cake decoration gel can also be used. It is important that hypoglycemia be treated with a source of pure carbohydrate, as protein and fat ingestion slows gastric emptying which would delay the correction of hypoglycemia (therefore, candy containing chocolate, for example, is not appropriate treatment of hypoglycemia.) For severe hypoglycemia – when the child is having a seizure or is unconscious – glucagon is given as an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection. Patients should have a glucagon emergency kit with them at all times. These kits contain 1 mg of glucagon as well as a syringe for injection. For children less than 20 kg, 0.5 mg (1/2 of the emergency vial) is given; for larger children the full 1 mg vial is injected. What are the possible outcomes of type 1 diabetes mellitus? Type 1 diabetes mellitus is a lifelong disease. It does not go away, and there currently is no cure. However, our current treatment and management of type 1 diabetes allows children to grow to be healthy adults. While the proper management of type 1 diabetes requires numerous tasks each and every day, individuals with diabetes can participate in any activities and can pursue any goals that they would have if they did not have diabetes. Life expectancy is shortened for those with type 1 diabetes, but with current therapies, this shortening is quite small. For individuals born between 1965-1980, life expectancy is only 1.4-4.9 years less than that of the general population. The prevalence of type 1 diabetes in children 0-19 years of age in the United States is approximately 2 per 1000. The incidence of type 1 diabetes varies substantially across the globe. Rates in China and parts of South America are near 1 per 100,000 person-years, while rates above 30 per 100,000 person-years occurs in Sweden, Finland and Sardinia. The incidence of type 1 diabetes also varies across racial and ethnic groups within the United States. For youth 1-9 years of age: The incidence in non-Hispanic whites is now greater than 20 per 100,000 children per year The incidence in African American and Hispanic youth is approximately 15 per 100,000 children per year The incidence in Asian and Pacific Islander youth is approximately 7 per 100,000 children per year The incidence in Native American (Navajo) youth is below 5 per 100,000 children per year. The incidence of type 1 diabetes mellitus is increasing worldwide, at a rate of approximately 3% per year: For US youth ages 0-14 years, the incidence of type 1 diabetes has increased from approximately 16 per 100,000 per year in the 1980s to 1990s to over 27 per 100,000 per year in 2002-2005. There are two peaks in the age-specific incidence of type 1 diabetes mellitus: the largest is at 10-14 years of age, with a smaller peak in earlier childhood. There is some seasonal variation in the onset of type 1 diabetes mellitus, with fewer cases presenting during the summer months. Type 1 diabetes mellitus is caused by the autoimmune destruction of the insulin-producing β-cells in the pancreatic islets of Langerhans. This results in an absolute deficiency of insulin. Symptoms become evident when approximately 80% of the β-cells are destroyed. Over time, nearly all of the β-cells are destroyed. Type 1 diabetes is felt to occur when an environmental trigger initiates the autoimmune response in a genetically susceptible individual. What is known about the genetics of type 1 diabetes mellitus? There is an increased risk of type 1 diabetes in relatives of individuals with type 1 diabetes. In spite of this, however, only 10-20% of individuals with type 1 diabetes have family members with type 1 diabetes (See Figure 1). The strongest contributor to the genetic risk of type 1 diabetes is the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), and specifically the class II DR and DQ antigens. This risk association is complicated by the extensive allelic variation of these genes, as well as by the genetic linkage between MHC genes. Up to 90% of individuals with type 1 diabetes carry either the DR3/DQ2 or the DR4/DQ8 haplotypes. Thus only 10% of individuals with type 1 diabetes lack both of these haplotypes, while almost 60% of the general population will lack both of these haplotypes. However, while 2% of the population carry the high risk DR3-DR4/DQ8 genotype, 95% of these individuals will not develop type 1 diabetes. Another locus conferring risk for type 1 diabetes is the variable number of tandem repeats located upstream of the insulin and IGF2 genes. What are the environmental triggers for type 1 diabetes mellitus? The concordance for type 1 diabetes in monozygotic twins is only 30-40%, indicating that something other than genes are responsible for the development of type 1 diabetes. This could include differences in the immune system, such as differences in T- and B-cell receptor gene rearrangements. However, another possibility is that environmental factors contribute to the development of type 1 diabetes. A number of viruses have been implicated in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes: Up to 20% of children born with congenital rubella infection will develop type 1 diabetes. The role of other viruses in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes is less certain. There is, however, accumulating evidence of an association of enterovirus infections with type 1 diabetes. However, whether this association indicates a causative role of enteroviruses in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes, and the mechanism of such a role is not known. Other factors have been proposed as environmental triggers for type 1 diabetes based on association studies including nitrosoureas, gliadin, and cow’s milk/bovine serum albumin. As for enteroviruses, the role of these agents in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes remains unproven. The rodenticide Vacor causes an insulinopenic diabetes associated with islet cell antibodies. While Vacor-induced diabetes is a rare cause of diabetes, like congenital rubella infection and viruses, this finding demonstrates the potential for environmental toxins to contribute to the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes. What acute complications might you expect from type 1 diabetes mellitus? The acute complications of type 1 diabetes are diabetic ketoacidosis and hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia occurs in response to treatment with insulin, resulting from a mismatch of insulin action with insulin needs. DKA reflects the severe metabolic decompensation that results from severe insulin deficiency. DKA is the most common cause of morbidity and mortality in children with type 1 diabetes. Early identification and treatment is key to avoiding severe DKA and its attendant risks. Intercurrent illnesses, particularly infections, increase insulin needs. If these increased needs are not met, blood glucose levels will rise, and lipolysis and ketogenesis will begin. If the increased insulin needs remain unmet, decompensation into DKA can occur. Therefore, it is important to identify developing ketosis and to prevent this decompensation. Ketones in blood and urine can be measured by patients at home. This should be done at times of illness or persistent significant hyperglycemia (i.e., blood glucose >250 mg/dl (13.9 mmol/L)). Once identified, aggressive treatment with insulin is given to reverse the ketosis. While intercurrent illness is a precipitant of DKA, in children DKA is often caused by the inappropriate omission of insulin. What are the long-term complications of type 1 diabetes mellitus? Diabetes mellitus causes injury to the microvascular circulation. This results in tissue and organ damage, leading to the diabetic microvascular complications of retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy. Diabetes mellitus also increases the risk of atherosclerotic vascular disease, the macrovascular complication of diabetes. Because of this, blindness, renal failure, and amputations are possible long-term complications of diabetes, and patients with diabetes have an increased risk of strokes and heart attacks. Both the microvascular and macrovascular complications of type 1 diabetes mellitus are related to the hyperglycemia that persists even with treatment of the disease. The risk of these complications increases with the duration of the disease, and with higher levels of glycemia. Some late adolescents who had an early onset of diabetes may show early evidence of complications such as non-proliferative retinopathy, microalbuminuria without loss of renal function, or clinically silent changes in nerve conduction. Fortunately, however, it is very rare for a child to have significant diabetic microvascular or macrovascular complications as these generally take decades to appear, even in patients with poorly controlled diabetes. However, children with type 1 diabetes have decades of life ahead of them with the disease, so it is important that glycemic control be maximized to minimize their risk of developing these complications as they age. The hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) is directly proportional to the average blood glucose level that was present during the lifespan of the red blood cell – and thus reflects the blood glucose level over the prior 3 months. An improvement in glycemic control that results in a decrease in HbA1c of 1% (reflecting a decrease in the average blood glucose level of 30-35 mg/dl (1.7-1.9 mmol/L)) decreases the risk of microvascular complications by 20-50%. There is no threshold for this effect; lowering the average blood glucose level always decreases the risk of microvascular complications. The challenge, however, is that lowering the average blood glucose level increases the acute risk of hypoglycemia. There are a number of interventions that have been proposed as means to prevent the development of type 1 diabetes mellitus. These have been based on either observations and findings regarding the epidemiology of type 1 diabetes, or on theories of immune regulation. However, as yet there remains no proven prevention strategy. Breastfeeding has been associated with a decreased incidence of type 1 diabetes, although it is not known for certain whether this is due to a protective effect of breastmilk per se or due to the effects of delayed exposure to cow’s milk proteins (or other complex dietary components). Even in the absence of definitive studies, given the overall health benefits of breastfeeding, for those families seeking recommendations, it is reasonable to recommend breastfeeding as a possible means to decrease the risk of type 1 diabetes. Immune therapies have been investigated in attempts to prevent type 1 diabetes in individuals at increased risk of the disease. These have included treatment with the diabetes autoantigens insulin and GAD. While some studies have had preliminary data suggesting benefit, definitive studies have either not shown benefit, or have yet to be completed. Thus, while there are ongoing attempts to identify a therapy that could reduce the risk of type 1 diabetes in individuals with increased risk, no such treatment has been found yet. The other approach to altering the immune destruction of β-cells in type 1 diabetes has been to use immunomodulators in patients with newly diagnosed diabetes to attempt to preserve the β-cell function that remains at the time of diagnosis. Such “secondary prevention” would be of benefit to patients with type 1 diabetes, as optimal glycemic control is more successfully achieved in the presence of residual β-cell function. In addition, if such a treatment were safe and effective, it could, at least in theory, be used prior to diagnosis in an at-risk individual to preserve sufficient β-cell function to prevent the development of diabetes. Treatments that have been investigated include those directed at T-lymphocytes, such as monoclonal anti-CD3 antibody and anti-thymocyte globulin, as well as those directed against B-lymphocytes (Rituximab, a CD20 monoclonal antibody). While some studies have suggested that such an approach may be possible, no such treatment with a clear lasting benefit has yet been identified. “Standards of medical care in diabetes. 11”. vol. 39. 2016. pp. S86-93.

Ongoing controversies regarding etiology, diagnosis, treatment One approach to cure type 1 diabetes is to use transplantation to replace the destroyed β-cells. Such transplantation requires ongoing immunosuppression in order to prevent the immune destruction of the transplanted β-cells. In patients already exposed to the risks and side-effects of immunosuppression for a renal transplant, subsequent or concurrent pancreas transplant is an appropriate consideration. However, assumption of the risks of immunosuppression is not felt to be appropriate for the vast majority of patients with type 1 diabetes. Pancreas only transplants could be considered in patients with recurrent, severe acute complications of diabetes (hypoglycemia, ketoacidosis) with a consistent failure to prevent these acute complications with usual diabetes treatments. Because pediatric patients will not develop diabetes nephropathy sufficient to require a kidney transplant, the issue of kidney-pancreas transplant does not arise in pediatric patients. In addition, the risks of transplantation and life-long immunosuppression are not felt to be appropriate for pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes, even those with recurrent severe acute complications. In such patients, poor compliance is very likely a significant contributor to their acute complications, and would be a contraindication to transplantation. Injection of isolated cadaveric islets into the portal vein is a less invasive approach to islet-only transplantation. As with pancreas transplantation, islet transplantation requires lifelong immunosuppression. Survival of islet function in this approach remains significantly lower than that of whole pancreas transplantation. This technique remains experimental, and is currently restricted to adults with recurrent, severe hypoglycemia. Another experimental avenue of investigation for a cure of type 1 diabetes is the use of stem cell therapies to replace the lost β-cells. Such an approach would also require an intervention to prevent the destruction of these cells by the underlying immune process present in those with type 1 diabetes. As for other approaches to cure diabetes, this approach remains experimental. Copyright © 2017, 2013 Decision Support in Medicine, LLC. All rights reserved.

7b0c1045-1147-4db3-bc91-686a3c01008c,"Diabetes management for health professionals – Webinar Series Training for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Workers / Practitioners A new study from Seoul Hospital has found that brushing your teeth three times a day or more can lower your risk of developing diabetes. While poor dental hygiene and many missing teeth (15 or more) is linked to an increased risk of developing the condition. These findings underline the importance of good oral hygiene. Healthy teeth and regular brushing can reduce your risk of diabetes. Diabetes is one of the fastest growing chronic health conditions globally and inflammation plays a role in the development of the condition. Because periodontal disease and poor oral hygiene can bring on infection and systemic inflammation, the team conducting the study hypothesised that poor oral hygiene indicators could be associated with the development diabetes (both and diabetes). The study which analysed data collected on 188,000 subjects from the National Health Insurance System-Health Screening Cohort in Korea, found around one in six had periodontal disease. After a median follow-up of 10 years, 16% developed diabetes. Using computer modelling, adjusted for patient demographics (including age, sex, weight, height, blood pressure, socioeconomic status), the team found that presence of periodontal disease and number or missing teeth were both linked to increased risk of developing diabetes by 9% and 21 % respectively. While frequent brushing (3 times per day or more) lowered the risk of developing the diabetes by 8%. Further analysis revealed that women who practiced good oral hygiene were also at a lower risk of developing diabetes than men of the same age. While this study does not reveal the exact mechanism connecting oral hygiene to development of diabetes, tooth decay, especially as it worsens, can contribute to chronic and systemic inflammation. This increases the production inflammatory biomarkers, which previous studies have shown are linked to insulin resistance and the development of diabetes. The research concluded that frequently brushing your teeth can reduce the risk of diabetes, while periodontal disease and a number of missing teeth increased the risk. Practicing good oral hygiene, not only keeps your teeth healthy and your smile bright it is good for your overall health too. Check out our factsheet on for more information.

a02c9f4f-db3b-403f-adfa-1e94a0e3e0cb,"— During pregnancy, some women develop high blood sugar levels. This condition is known as gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) or gestational diabetes. Gestational diabetes typically develops between the 24th and 28th weeks of pregnancy. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it’s estimated to occur in 2 to 10 percent of pregnancies in the United States. If you develop gestational diabetes while you’re pregnant, it doesn’t mean that you had or will have it afterward. But gestational diabetes does raise your risk of developing in the future. If poorly managed, it can also raise of developing diabetes and increase the risk of complications for you and your baby during . It’s rare for gestational diabetes to cause symptoms. If you do experience symptoms, they’ll likely be mild. They may include: The exact cause of gestational diabetes is unknown, but hormones likely play a role. , your body produces larger amounts of some hormones, including: These hormones affect your placenta and help sustain your pregnancy. Over time, the amount of these hormones in your body increases. They may start to make your body resistant to , the hormone that regulates your blood sugar. Insulin helps move out of your blood into your cells, where it’s used for energy. In pregnancy, your body naturally becomes slightly insulin resistant, so that more glucose is available in your blood stream to be passed to the baby. If the insulin resistance becomes too strong, your blood glucose levels may rise abnormally. This can cause gestational diabetes. You’re at a higher risk of developing gestational diabetes if you: gain a while you’re pregnant have previously given birth to a baby weighing have , , or other conditions that are associated with have African, Native American, Asian, Pacific Islander, or Hispanic ancestry The American Diabetes Association (ADA) encourages doctors to routinely for signs of gestational diabetes. If you have no known history of diabetes and normal blood sugar levels at the beginning of your pregnancy, your doctor will likely screen you for gestational diabetes when you’re to pregnant. Some doctors may begin with a glucose challenge test. No preparation is needed for this test. You’ll drink a glucose solution. After one hour, you’ll receive a . If your blood sugar level is high, your doctor may perform a three-hour . This is considered two-step testing. Some doctors skip the glucose challenge test altogether and only perform a two-hour glucose tolerance test. This is considered one-step testing. Your doctor will start by testing your fasting blood sugar levels. They’ll ask you to drink a solution containing 75 grams (g) of carbohydrates. They’ll test your blood sugar levels again after one hour and two hours. They’ll likely diagnose you with gestational diabetes if you have any of the following : fasting blood sugar level greater than or equal to 92 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) one-hour blood sugar level greater than or equal to 180 mg/dL two-hour blood sugar level greater than or equal to 153 mg/dL For the two-step test, you will not need to be fasting. They’ll ask you to drink a solution containing 50 g of sugar. If at that point your blood sugar level is greater than or equal to 130 mg/dL or 140 mg/dL, they’ll conduct a second follow-up test on a different day. The threshold for determining this is decided by your doctor. During the second test, your doctor will start by testing your fasting blood sugar level. They’ll ask you to drink a solution with 100 g of sugar in it. They’ll test your blood sugar one, two, and three hours later. They’ll likely diagnose you with gestational diabetes if you have at least two of the following values: fasting blood sugar level greater than or equal to 95 mg/dL or 105 mg/dL one-hour blood sugar level greater than or equal to 180 mg/dL or 190 mg/dL two-hour blood sugar level greater than or equal to 155 mg/dL or 165 mg/dL three-hour blood sugar level greater than or equal to 140 mg/dL or 145 mg/dL Should I be concerned about type 2 diabetes as well? The ADA also encourages doctors to screen women for at the beginning of pregnancy. If you have for type 2 diabetes, your doctor will likely test you for the condition at your . having low levels of good (HDL) in your blood having a past history of gestational diabetes, , or signs of insulin resistance having previously given birth to a baby who weighed more than 9 pounds being of African, Native American, Asian, Pacific Islander, or Hispanic descent Are there different forms of gestational diabetes? Class A1 is used to describe gestational diabetes that can be controlled through alone. People with class A2 gestational diabetes will need or oral medications to control their condition. If you’re diagnosed with gestational diabetes, your treatment plan will depend on your blood sugar levels throughout the day. In most cases, your doctor will advise you to test your blood sugar before and meals, and manage your condition by eating healthy and exercising regularly. In some cases, they may also add if needed. According to the , only 10 to 20 percent of women with gestational diabetes need insulin to help control their blood sugar. If your doctor encourages you to , they may supply you with a special . They may also prescribe insulin injections for you until you give birth. Ask your doctor about properly timing your insulin injections in relation to your meals and exercise to avoid low blood sugar. Your doctor can also tell you what to do if your blood sugar levels fall too low or are consistently higher than they should be. A balanced diet is key to properly managing gestational diabetes. In particular, women with gestational diabetes should pay special attention to their carbohydrate, protein, and fat intake. Eating regularly — as often as every two hours — can also help you to control your blood sugar levels. Properly spacing out carbohydrate-rich foods will help to prevent . Your doctor will help you determine exactly how many carbohydrates you should eat each day. They may also recommend that you see a registered dietician to help with meal plans. Pregnant women should eat each day. Good sources of protein include lean meats and , , and . Healthy fats to incorporate into your diet include unsalted , , , and . Get more tips here on what to eat — and avoid — if you have gestational diabetes. What complications are associated with gestational diabetes? If your gestational diabetes is poorly managed, your blood sugar levels may remain higher than they should be throughout your pregnancy. This can lead to complications and affect the health of your child. For example, when your baby is born, he or she may have: , which causes their shoulders to get stuck in the birth canal during labor They may also be at higher risk of developing diabetes later in life. That’s why it’s so important to take steps to manage your gestational diabetes by following your doctor’s recommended treatment plan. Your blood sugar should return to normal after you give birth. But developing gestational diabetes raises your risk of type 2 diabetes later in life. Ask your doctor how you can lower your risk of developing these conditions and associated .

72115054-1788-4d78-8ea6-44bfad040476,"Friday, 14 February 2020 Genetics, is a major factor when it comes to the risk of developing autoimmune conditions, like In human cells, a person’s genome – about six feet of DNA – is compressed inside the nucleus via a three-dimensional folding process. Specialized proteins decode the genetic information, reading instruction from our genome in a sequence-specific manner. In a world first study, researchers at Penn Medicine decided to look at what would happen if there was a variation in the sequence affecting the folding pattern in the nucleus and whether it would make people more susceptible to autoimmune conditions. What they’ve found, in mice, is that changes in DNA sequence can trigger the chromosomes to misfold in a way that puts one at a heightened risk for The study, published in Immunity, revealed that differences in DNA sequences dramatically changed how the DNA folded inside the nucleus, ultimately affecting the regulation–the induction or repression–of genes linked to the development Type 1 diabetes. While we know that people who inherit certain genes have a heightened risk of developing , there has been little information about the underlying molecular factors that contribute to the link between genetics and autoimmunity. This research, demonstrates how DNA misfolding–caused by sequence variation–contributes to the development of Type 1 diabetes. With this deeper understanding, it’s hoped it will be possible to reverse DNA misfolding and change the course of Type 1 diabetes.” Autoimmune conditions, which affect millions of people worldwide, and occur when the body’s immune system attacks and destroys healthy organs, tissues and cells. There are more than 80 types of autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and In Type 1 diabetes, the pancreas stops producing insulin, the hormone that controls . White blood cells called T lymphocytes play a significant role in the destruction of insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells. Until now, little has been known about the extent to which sequence variation could cause unusual chromatin folding and, ultimately, affect gene expression. In this study, Penn Medicine researchers generated ultra-high resolution genomic maps to measure the three-dimensional DNA folding in T lymphocytes in two strains of mice: a diabetes-susceptible and diabetes-resistant mouse strain. The two strains of mice have six million differences in their genomic DNA, which is similar to the number of differences in the genetic code between any two humans. The Penn team, found that previously defined insulin-diabetes associated regions were also the most hyperfolded regions in the T cells of mice with diabetes. Researchers then used a high-resolution imaging technique to corroborate the genome misfolding in diabetes-susceptible mice. Importantly, they found the change in folding patterns occurred before the mouse developed the condition. Researchers suggest that the observation could serve as a diagnostic tool in the future if investigators are able to identify such hyperfolded regions in the T cells of humans. While much more work is needed, the findings are pushing the team closer to a more mechanistic understanding of the link between genetics and autoimmune conditions.

Arteries are thicker than veins and have stronger, more elastic walls. — a disease of the arteries in the heart (also called or arteriosclerosis). Atherosclerosis occurs when the normal lining of the arteries deteriorates, the walls of the arteries thicken and deposits of fat and plaque block the flow of blood through the arteries. The arteries that supply blood to the heart become severely narrowed, decreasing the supply of oxygen-rich blood to the heart — especially during times of increased activity. — a disorder of the body’s immune system in which the immune system mistakes your body's own cells as invaders and attack them. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease. — nerve damage most often affecting the digestive system, blood vessels, urinary system and sex organs. Autonomic nerves are not under a person's control and function on their own. — also called nonproliferative retinopathy. Is the early stage of retinopathy caused by diabetes. It does not usually impair vision. — continuous supply of low levels of insulin, such as provided by the insulin pump. — a type of cell in an area of the pancreas called the Islets of Langerhans. Beta cells make and release insulin, which controls the glucose level in the blood. — the measurement of the pressure or force inside the blood vessels (arteries) with each beat of the heart. Blood pressure is written as two numbers; the first number, the systolic pressure, is the pressure in the arteries when the heart beats and fills the arteries with blood. The second number, the diastolic pressure, is the pressure in the arteries when the heart rests between beats. — waste product of the kidneys. Increased BUN levels may indicate early kidney damage. — a bump or bulge on the first joint of the big toe caused by the swelling of a sac of fluid under the skin. Shoes that fit well can prevent bunions from forming. Bunions may lead to other problems, such as serious infection. — a small area of skin, usually on the foot, that has become thick and hard from rubbing or pressure. Calluses may lead to other problems, such as serious infection. Shoes that fit well can prevent calluses from forming. — energy that comes from food.

Food is not digested properly and does not move through the stomach normally. — a high blood glucose level that is discovered during pregnancy. As pregnancy progresses, there is an increased need for glucose for the developing baby. Additionally, hormone changes during pregnancy affect the action of insulin, resulting in high blood glucose levels. Usually, blood glucose levels return to normal after childbirth. However, women who have had gestational diabetes are at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes later in life. — an eye disease associated with increased pressure within the eye. Glaucoma can damage the optic nerve and cause impaired vision and blindness. — a hormone that raises the level of glucose (sugar) in the blood. Glucagon is sometimes injected when a person has lost consciousness (passed out) from a low blood sugar reaction. The injected glucagon helps raise the level of glucose in the blood. — a simple sugar found in the blood. It is the body’s main source of energy; also known as dextrose. — a test that can be used to determine if a person has diabetes. The test is done in a lab or doctor’s office in the morning before the person has eaten. First a sample of blood is taken. Then the person drinks a liquid that has glucose (sugar) in it. Periodically, another sample of blood is taken to see how the body processes the glucose in the blood. — the average amount of glucose that has been in a person’s blood over the past two to three months. It can be used to diagnose diabetes. It is also used along with home glucose monitoring to determine overall diabetes management. A level of 6.5% or higher is a diagnosis of diabetes. The target HbA1c for most people with diabetes is less than 7%. — a condition when the blood flows through the blood vessels at a force greater than normal. High blood pressure strains the heart, harms the arteries, and increases the risk of heart attack, stroke and kidney problems. Also called hypertension. — a way in which a person can measure how much glucose (sugar) is in the blood. Also called self monitoring of blood glucose. — a chemical released by the endocrine glands and other tissues to help control certain functions in the body. For instance, insulin is a hormone made by the beta cells in the pancreas, and when released, it triggers other cells to use glucose for energy. — bio-engineered insulin that is very similar to insulin made by your own body. — high blood sugar. Many things can cause hyperglycemia. It occurs when the body does not have enough insulin or cannot use the insulin it does have. — low blood glucose. Hypoglycemia in people with diabetes is often caused by an imbalance in diabetes medications, food intake, and/or activity levels. — persistent inability of the penis to become erect or stay erect. Men with diabetes may become impotent if blood sugar levels are high for a long time due to nerve and blood vessel damage caused by the high blood sugar. — changing the areas on the body where a person injects insulin. If the same injection site is used over and over again, hardened areas, lumps or indentations can develop under the skin which keep the insulin from being used properly. These lumps or indentations are called lipodystrophies. — recommended places on the body where people can inject insulin. These sites include the back of the upper arm, the abdomen, the thighs and the buttocks. — a hormone that helps the body use glucose for energy. The beta cells of the pancreas make insulin. — former term used for type 1 diabetes, also formerly called juvenile diabetes. — a small, computerized device that is worn on a belt , in a pocket, or under clothes. Most insulin pumps delivers insulin through a small, flexible tube inserted under the skin. It delivers a steady flow of insulin 24 hours a day, and on-demand doses programmed by the user for food or high blood sugar. — areas on the outer part of a cell that allow insulin in the blood to join or bind with the cell. When the cell and insulin bind together, the cell can take glucose from the blood and use it for energy. — when a person’s body will not allow insulin to work properly in the body. This condition can occur when a person is overweight, and it often improves when the person loses weight. — loss of consciousness as a result of severe hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). — former term used for type 1 diabetes. — the waste products of fat burning. When your blood glucose gets too high, the body breaks down its own fat and protein for energy instead of glucose. When fat is used, ketones appear in your urine and blood. A large amount of ketones can lead to a serious condition called diabetic ketoacidosis. — a fine, sharp pointed needle for pricking the skin. Used in blood glucose monitoring. — the use of a strong beam of light (laser) to heal a damaged area. A person with retinopathy from diabetes might receive laser treatments to heal blood vessels in the eye. — former term used for type 2 diabetes. – a collection of health risks that increase the chance of developing heart disease, stroke and diabetes. It is also known as Syndrome X, insulin resistance syndrome and dysmetabolic syndrome. — all of the physical and chemical processes in the body which occur when food is broken down, energy is created, and wastes are produced. — measurement that indicates the amount of glucose in a specific amount of blood. — disease of the kidneys caused by damage to the small blood vessels in the kidneys . People with diabetes may develop nephropathy as a result of high blood sugar damaging the blood vessels. — nerve damage. People with diabetes may develop neuropathy as a result of high blood sugar damaging the blood vessels and nerves. — former term for type 2 diabetes. —too much body fat for a person’s age, height, and gender. Obesity is a risk factor for type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance. — a doctor who treats people with eye diseases. — a person professionally trained to test the eyes and to detect and treat eye problems and some diseases by prescribing and adapting corrective lenses. — an organ behind the lower part of the stomach that is about the size of a hand. It has many roles, including the production of insulin and glucagon. — the time when the effect of something is as strong as it can be, such as when insulin is having the most effect on blood glucose. — damage to the gums and tissues around the teeth. People who have high blood sugar are more likely to have periodontal disease than people who do not . — a type of nerve damage most commonly affecting the feet and legs. The arms, abdomen and back may rarely be affected. — any abnormal condition that affects the blood vessels outside the heart and lymphatic vessels. Often occurs as decreased blood flow to the hands and feet. People with diabetes may develop PVD as a result of high blood sugar damaging the blood vessels. — a health professional who diagnoses and treats foot problems. — excessive thirst that lasts for long periods of time; may be a sign of diabetes. —excessive hunger and eating; may be a sign of diabetes. People with polyphagia as a result of diabetes often lose weight even though they are eating more than normal. — a type of fat that comes from vegetables. — increased need to urinate often; a common sign of diabetes. – a mixture of insulin that contains two different types of insulin. Using pre-mixed insulin prevents someone from having to take two injections at the same time or mixing insulin from two vials (bottles). — one of three main classes of nutrients. Proteins are made of amino acids, which are called the ""building blocks of the cells."" The cells need proteins to grow and to mend themselves. Protein is found in many foods such as meat, fish, poultry, eggs, legumes and dairy products. — the point at which the blood is holding so much of a substance, such as glucose, that the kidneys allow the excess to ""spill"" into the urine. — the center part of the back lining of the eye that senses light. It has many small blood vessels that can be harmed by high blood sugar levels. — a disease of the small blood vessels in the retina of the eye. People with diabetes may develop retinopathy as a result of high blood sugar damaging the blood vessels in the eyes. — anything that increases the chance of a person developing a disease or condition. — an artificial sweetener that is sometimes used in place of sugar because it has no calories. — also called rebound effect. A swing to a high level of glucose in the blood after an extremely low level It often happens as the result of an untreated low blood sugar during the night. People who experience high levels of blood glucose in the morning may need to test their blood glucose levels in the middle of the night. If blood glucose levels are repeatedly low overnight, adjustments in evening snacks or insulin doses may be recommended. —table sugar; a form of sugar that the body must break down into a more simple form before the blood can absorb it and take it to the cells. — a type of carbohydrate. Sugar is a quick and easy fuel for the body to use. Some types of sugar are lactose, glucose, fructose and sucrose. — fats carried in the blood from the food we eat. Most of the fats we eat, including butter, margarines and oils, are in triglyceride form. Excess calories, alcohol or sugar in the body are converted into triglycerides and stored in fat cells throughout the body. The body needs insulin to remove this type of fat from the blood. — a type of diabetes in which the insulin-producing cells (beta cells) of the pancreas are damaged. People with type 1 diabetes produce little or no insulin, so glucose cannot get into the body’s cells for use as energy. This causes blood glucose to rise. People with type 1 diabetes must use insulin injections to manage their blood glucose. — a type of diabetes in which the insulin produced is either not enough or doesn’t work properly in the body. As a result, glucose cannot get into the body’s cells for use as energy. This causes blood glucose to rise. — a break in the skin; a deep sore. People with high blood sugar levels may develop ulcers from minor scrapes on the feet or legs, from cuts that heal slowly, or from the rubbing of shoes that don’t fit well. Ulcers can become infected and should be treated promptly. — the basic measure of insulin. U-100 is the most common concentration of insulin. U-100 means that there are 100 units of insulin per milliliter (ml) of liquid. – an infection of the urinary system (kidneys, bladder, and/or the tubes that connect them. Symptoms can include burning or pain with urination and frequent urination. People with high blood sugar levels have a higher risk of getting a UTI than people with target blood sugar levels. - an inflammation or infection of the vaginal tissues, usually caused by a fungus. A woman with this condition may have itching or burning or vaginal discharge.

Diabetes Self-Management offers over 900 diabetes friendly recipes to choose from including desserts, low-carb pasta dishes, savory main meals, grilled options and more. When you received a diagnosis of diabetes, it likely was based on the results of one of three tests (or a combination of these tests): a , an test, or a random plasma glucose reading. For many years, these have been the standard tests for assessing people with symptoms of diabetes and for screening people believed to be at risk of developing diabetes. In 2010, the American Diabetes Association began recommending that another blood test, the – abbreviated either or A1C – be used for diagnosing or . The A1C test has already proved its usefulness for monitoring the level of blood glucose control over time in people already diagnosed with diabetes. In its new, diagnostic, role, it is not intended to completely replace the older options, which still may be preferred in certain circumstances. But the A1C test is believed to have certain advantages over the older options, particularly when screening for Type 2 diabetes. This is not the first time in history that new methods of diagnosing diabetes have been developed or have become more widely accepted by the medical profession. Indeed, diabetes has been around a lot longer than any modern laboratory blood test. The word “diabetes” is derived from a Greek word that means to siphon, pass through, or rapidly drain. (Accounts differ as to when it was coined; some say 200 BC, others during the second century AD.) But many centuries before the term was ever applied to the condition we now know as diabetes, a disease in which too much urine is eliminated was recognized. Somewhere along the line, it was noticed that this urine had a sweet smell and taste (and attracted insects and other animals), and for hundreds of years, the sweet taste of urine was the key to diagnosing diabetes. The relationship between sweetness in the urine and sweetness in the blood was observed in 1776 by English physician Matthew Dobson. When Dobson evaporated the urine of people with diabetes, he found a substance that looked and tasted like brown sugar, and he also observed that people with diabetes had a sweetish taste to their blood. This led to the understanding of diabetes as not just a disease of the kidneys but as a system-wide disorder. In the 1800’s, the first laboratory tests for glucose in the urine were developed, sparing physicians from having to taste it. The first tests simply identified that glucose was present in urine; later ones were able to measure the amount of glucose. A further advance, attributed to British physician Frederick Pavy, was to establish a quantitative relationship between the level of glucose in the blood with the level of glucose in the urine. The 1900’s brought better ways to measure glucose in urine, as well as the first blood glucose tests. As might be expected, the first blood glucose tests were not all that accurate, but over time, more and more accurate blood tests have been developed, leading to a greater understanding of the disease itself. As mentioned earlier, the four tests currently used in the United States to diagnose diabetes are the fasting plasma glucose (FPG) test, the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), the random plasma glucose test, and the A1C test. The FPG measures the concentration of glucose in the plasma (liquid) portion of the blood after a person has fasted for at least eight hours. Currently, a plasma glucose level over 126 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dl) is called diabetes, and, according to American Diabetes Association criteria, a level from 100 mg/dl to 125 mg/dl is called . The OGTT involves two measurements of glucose in blood plasma: the first after a person has fasted for at least eight hours, the second two hours after the person has ingested 75 grams of glucose. A two-hour level of 200 mg/dl or higher is called diabetes, and a level from 140 mg/dl to 199 mg/dl is called prediabetes. (When the OGTT is used to detect gestational diabetes, or diabetes that occurs during pregnancy, different amounts of glucose and more frequent blood tests may be used, and the blood glucose levels at which diabetes is diagnosed are different, too.) This test measures blood glucose without regard to when a person last ate. A level of 200 mg/dl in a person who also has symptoms of diabetes can mean a person has diabetes. Generally, the diagnosis is confirmed with an FPG or an OGTT. The A1C test measures the percentage of hemoglobin molecules in the blood that have glucose molecules attached to them. Currently, a test result of 6.5% or higher is diagnostic of diabetes. As early scientists no doubt discovered, everyone has some glucose in their blood. So how do you know whether a person has diabetes? Just as methods of diagnosing diabetes have changed over the years, so have beliefs about what level of blood glucose should be called diabetes. In 1979, for example, the World Health Organization and the National Diabetes Data Group issued criteria for the diagnosis of diabetes stating that a fasting plasma glucose test result of 140 mg/dl or higher indicated diabetes. For the oral glucose tolerance test, a two-hour blood glucose level of 200 mg/dl or higher meant diabetes. Almost 20 years later, in 1997, the American Diabetes Association updated these criteria, stating that a fasting plasma glucose test result of 126 mg/dl or higher indicated diabetes. But they retained the diagnostic level of a two-hour reading of 200 mg/dl or higher for the oral glucose tolerance test (for people who are not pregnant). Why the change? High blood glucose may or may not cause symptoms, depending on how high it is and how accustomed a person has become to living with elevated blood glucose. (This is why people with Type 2 diabetes often have the condition for many years before they are diagnosed.) But whether or not high blood glucose is causing noticeable symptoms, it is potentially damaging a variety of bodily systems and setting the stage for long-term . The change from 140 mg/dl to 126 mg/dl when using the fasting plasma glucose test was largely based on studies showing that the number of cases of retinopathy (a form of diabetes-related damage to the eye) increased at fasting plasma glucose levels of 126 mg/dl and higher. As researchers continue to conduct studies in which they measure participants’ blood glucose levels and whether and when these people develop diabetes-related complications, it’s possible the diagnostic cut point will change again. In 2002, the term “prediabetes” became more widely used to describe blood glucose levels that are higher than normal but not high enough for a diagnosis of diabetes. Many people with prediabetes go on to develop Type 2 diabetes, but it is possible to take preventive action. There is evidence that increasing physical activity and improving eating habits can delay or prevent the onset of Type 2 diabetes in those with prediabetes. Among the benefits of using the A1C test to diagnose diabetes or prediabetes is that a blood sample for the test can be obtained at any time. It is not necessary to fast before having the test done, nor does the test re-quire drinking a glucose solution as part of the test. In addition, A1C level is unaffected by stress or illness at the time of the blood draw. The A1C test may be less useful for diagnosing Type 1 diabetes than Type 2 because people with Type 1 diabetes often have acute symptoms and very high blood glucose levels when they are diagnosed. A random plasma glucose test, which also doesn’t require fasting or drinking glucose, can easily pick this up. The A1C test is not recommended for diagnosing gestational diabetes, because a woman with gestational diabetes would likely not have an elevated A1C, even when her OGTT result is diagnostic of diabetes. This is because the A1C test gives an estimate of average blood glucose level over the past two to three months, and the OGTT is done when a woman would typically start having high blood glucose during pregnancy, not three months after she might start having high blood glucose. Waiting for her A1C to rise would delay necessary treatment. The A1C test is also not recommended for diagnosing previously undiagnosed Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes during pregnancy, because changes in the rate of red blood cell turnover that occur during pregnancy would make the test inaccurate. There are also some medical conditions affecting the blood that make A1C testing inaccurate. For people who have these conditions, either the FPG or the OGTT must be used for diagnosis (and different tests must be used for evaluating long-term blood glucose control). When the A1C test is used to test for diabetes, the ADA’s International Expert Committee has proposed 6.5% as the level at which diabetes is diagnosed. (Diagnosis should be confirmed with a repeat A1C test unless symptoms of diabetes and blood glucose levels over 200 mg/dl are present.) The committee has also proposed the range of 6% to 6.5% as the level of highest risk for progression to diabetes, indicating that preventive measures might be in order. However, when a person has known risk factors for diabetes, an A1C level lower than 6% might also call for preventive measures. These recommended cutoffs are based on research showing the usual range of A1C levels found among people who do not have diabetes, those with prediabetes, and those with diabetes. However, researchers have already raised concerns that these cutoffs underdiagnose diabetes in the elderly population as well as in certain ethnic and minority groups. The cutoffs may also not be right for diagnosing diabetes in nonwestern countries. Also, in some countries, the higher cost of A1C testing and/or the lack of standardization among laboratories may make the A1C test less useful as a screening tool. Research will no doubt continue as use of the A1C test for diagnostic purposes becomes more widespread, and more will be learned about how best to use it in different populations. The vast majority of cases of diabetes are either Type 1 diabetes, Type 2 diabetes, or gestational diabetes. All are diagnosed on the basis of high blood glucose, but none of the tests used for diagnosis discriminates between types of diabetes. For that, physicians use other criteria, such as symptoms, whether a woman is pregnant, and personal characteristics such as age, , family history, and the presence of certain other health conditions. In many if not most cases, that’s enough to make a correct diagnosis. But sometimes it’s not clear what type of diabetes a person has. In those cases, a health-care provider may order further tests, since a misdiagnosis can lead to suboptimal treatment. One type of testing that may be done is autoantibody testing. When Type 1 diabetes or (LADA) is suspected, a blood test that screens for autoantibodies to islet cells, , and glutamic acid decarboxylase (and possibly some others) may be done. The presence of such autoantibodies indicates that the body is engaged in a destructive immune response against its insulin-producing cells. Another test that may be done if a doctor suspects Type 1 diabetes or LADA is a C-peptide test. C-peptide is a by-product of insulin formation in the pancreas. The pancreas first creates proinsulin, a large protein that breaks down into three chains of amino acids, two of which recombine to become insulin, and one of which, known as C-peptide, is secreted into the bloodstream along with insulin. While the function of C-peptide is currently not known, a person’s C-peptide level gives an indication of how much insulin his pancreas is producing. Infants who develop diabetes within the first six months of life may undergo genetic testing to see whether they have a rare form of diabetes called neonatal diabetes, which occurs because of a genetic defect. Neonatal diabetes may be mistaken for Type 1 diabetes, but infants who have it may do better when treated with sulfonylureas (a type of oral drug) than with insulin. Another type of diabetes that is caused by a genetic defect is Maturity Onset Diabetes of Youth (MODY). In fact, there are several varieties of MODY, each caused by a different gene abnormality. Some forms of MODY can be treated well with pills, while others require insulin therapy. Because genetic testing for MODY is expensive, it is not done frequently. However, if a parent has a form of MODY, his children have a 50% chance of also having it. Detecting it early in children allows for early treatment and possibly prevention of long-term complications. Currently, the ADA recommends testing for diabetes when a person has symptoms of diabetes such as frequently passing large volumes of urine, excessive thirst, weight loss, and sometimes increased hunger and blurred vision. The ADA states that health-care providers should consider screening for Type 2 diabetes in adults of any age who are overweight or obese and who have one or more additional risk factors for Type 2 diabetes. Those risk factors include the following: Being a member of an ethnic population with a high prevalence of diabetes (African-American, Latino, Native American, Asian American, Pacific Islander) Having delivered a baby weighing more than 9 pounds or having been diagnosed with gestational diabetes Having high blood pressure (equal to or higher than 140/90 mm Hg) or being treated for high blood pressure Having an HDL cholesterol level lower than 35 mg/dl and/or a triglyceride level higher than 250 mg/dl Having an A1C equal to or greater than 5.7% or having been diagnosed with impaired glucose tolerance or impaired fasting glucose on a previous occasion Having other conditions associated with insulin resistance such as severe obesity or (a darkening of the skin that commonly occurs in the folds of the armpits, neck, or groin) In adults without these risk factors, the ADA states that diabetes screening should begin at age 45. If tests do not show elevated blood glucose, testing should be repeated at least every three years. However, at least one recent study concludes that it is cost-effective to screen US adults for Type 2 diabetes between the ages of 30 and 45. So it’s possible the criteria for screening for Type 2 diabetes may change some day, too. The news that the A1C test will now be used to diagnose diabetes in the United States will likely have no great impact on people already diagnosed with diabetes. However, because Type 2 diabetes is known to have a genetic component – meaning that the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes is higher if your close relatives have it – this new use of the A1C test is something you may want to share with your family members. If they’ve been putting off getting screened for diabetes because of the inconvenience of fasting for eight hours before having blood drawn, now there’s no more reason to delay. And if they’re still not convinced to get screened, direct your relatives to the Web page . This online tool can tell an individual whether he is at low, moderate, or high risk of having prediabetes or Type 2 diabetes. If your family members have a little more time (about 15 minutes), the ADA’s “My Health Advisor” tool, found at http://myhealthadvisor.diabetes.org/cmrm/index.jsp, can calculate a person’s risk of developing Type 2 diabetes, heart attack, or stroke. It can additionally show how much a person’s risk of these conditions can be changed by making certain lifestyle changes. There’s never a good time to be diagnosed with diabetes, but if you have it – or you have prediabetes – the best time to know about it is as soon as possible. Once you know, you can start taking steps to prevent prediabetes from becoming Type 2 diabetes or to prevent long-term diabetes complications if you already have Type 2 diabetes. Encourage your friends and family members to take advantage of today’s modern laboratory tests and to get screened for Type 2 diabetes if they have any risk factors.

There is a lot of information out there about what to do when blood glucose levels (BGLs) are low, but what about when they are high? With temperatures continuing to rise over summer it’s important to keep yourself healthy in the heat, particularly if you live with diabetes. Here are our top 10 tips for staying safe when the heat comes in. When testing your blood glucose levels (BGLs) you want to be sure that your monitor is as accurate as possible. Our Diabetes Educator take you through what you need to check to make sure your equipment is up to scratch. Like clockwork, when the weather warms up Aussies head out to the water. Swimming is a great way to socialise and be active, just keep in mind these diabetes summer safety tips. Also known as ‘Impaired Awareness of Hypoglycaemia’, this state refers to your body no longer sending you early warning signs that your blood glucose level (BGL) is low, or when you are no longer recognising symptoms. Make sure that when you are thrown into change you know how to cope with it and manage your diabetes as best you can. Your blood glucose level (BGL) is affected by a number of things including exercise, physical activity, medications, stress, illness, alcohol and in particular the food you eat. Checking and recording your BGL regularly will help you to see and monitor the effect of a healthy diet and lifestyle choices. Diabetes Australia launches a new position statement on glucose self-monitoring for adults with type 1 or type 2. Up to 640 Australians are hospitalised each year before being diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. People living with diabetes need to plan for hospital visits to ensure they stay in good health. The Federal Government announces $54 million CGM subsidy for children and young people living with type 1 diabetes. From January 2017 people with non-insulin-treated type 2 diabetes will need a health professional to confirm their clinical need for subsidised blood glucose test strips. Research looks at alternatives for blood glucose testing Diabetes research looking at saliva-based glucose test to make blood tests a thing of the past for people living with diabetes. Smart insulin could make constant monitoring of Blood Glucose Levels a thing of the past Researchers have come up with a tattoo that can measure glucose levels without the need for invasive needle pricks.

968a42d4-9613-41d6-9df0-b826184929bd,"Tuesday, 14 January 2020 A new computer algorithm has been developed that can predict women in the early stages of pregnancy, who may be at a high risk of – according to a study by researchers at the Weizmann Institute of Science. The study analyzed data on nearly 600,000 pregnancies and using predictions found it may be possible to prevent gestational diabetes using nutritional and lifestyle changes. “Our ultimate goal is to help the health system take measures so as to prevent diabetes from occurring in pregnancy,” said senior author Prof. Eran Segal. is characterized by high blood sugar levels that develop during pregnancy in women who did not previously have diabetes. About one in seven Australian women are diagnosed with gestational diabetes during pregnancy. Typically, gestational diabetes is diagnosed between the 24th and 28th weeks of pregnancy, with the help of a glucose tolerance test and blood. In the new study, Segal and colleagues started out by applying a machine learning method to the health records of 450,000 pregnancies in women who gave birth between 2010 and 2017. had been diagnosed by glucose tolerance testing in about 4 percent of these pregnancies. After processing big data – an enormous dataset made up of more than 2,000 parameters for each pregnancy, including the woman’s blood test results and her and her family’s medical histories – the scientists’ algorithm revealed that nine of the parameters were sufficient to accurately identify the women who were at a high risk of developing gestational diabetes. The nine parameters included the woman’s age, body mass index, family history of diabetes and results of her glucose tests during previous pregnancies (if any). Next, to make sure that the nine parameters could indeed accurately predict the risk of gestational diabetes, the researchers applied them to the health records on about 140,000 additional pregnancies that had not been part of the initial analysis. The results validated the study’s findings: The nine parameters helped to accurately identify the women who ultimately developed gestational diabetes. These findings suggest that by having a woman answer just nine questions, it should be possible to tell in advance whether she is at a high risk of developing gestational diabetes. And if this information is available early on – in the early stages of pregnancy or even before the woman has gotten pregnant – it might be possible to reduce her risk of diabetes through lifestyle measures such as and . On the other hand, women identified by the questionnaire as being at a low risk of gestational diabetes may be spared the cost and inconvenience of the glucose testing. In more general terms, this study has demonstrated the usefulness of large human-based datasets, specifically electronic health records, for deriving personalized disease predictions that can lead to preventive and therapeutic measures.

Insulin regulates the level of glucose in your blood. Glucose is a simple form of sugar found in foods and sugary drinks. It’s absorbed by your body as a natural part of digestion and is carried around your body in your blood. When glucose reaches your body tissues, such as muscle cells, it's absorbed and converted into energy. Insulin is secreted into your blood by your pancreas, which is a gland located behind your stomach. If your cells don't respond properly to insulin, it can cause glucose to build up in your blood. This is called insulin resistance. If this happens, your pancreas needs to produce more and more insulin to overcome the resistance and control your blood glucose...

Please refer to an authoritative source if you require up-to-date information on any health or medical issue.     Diabetes Mellitus is a group of metabolic diseases, diabetes mellitus happen when body does not capable to use insulin efficiently or the insulin is not produce more enough in a person blood. According to Kowalczyk N (2013), this syndrome is related with chronic hyperglycemia in combination with glucose intolerance and alterations in the metabolism of carbohydrates, fats and proteins. There is certain test to indicate the presence of this syndrome. Usually patient undergo blood glucose levels test, before the patient take this test, they need to fast 12.00 mid night, the normal blood glucose levels range from 70 to 120 mg/dL, but if the blood glucose levels is greater than 126 mg/dL it is show that patient might have Diabetes Mellitus syndrome. If you need assistance with writing your essay, our professional essay writing service is here to help! According to Kishore,P (2013), Pancreas released a hormone called Insulin which controls the amount of glucose in the blood. The pancreas is stimulated by glucose in the bloodstream. Insulin allows glucose to move from the blood into the cells. Inside the cells glucose can transformed to energy, which is used instantly or the glucose is stored as fat glycogen until it is required. Insulin production is related with the levels of glucose, when the glucose in blood is high the insulin production increases, once the levels of glucose in the blood come back to normal, insulin production will decreases, normal blood glucose levels for healthy people is about 70 to 120 miligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). Symptoms and complications of diabetes happen when the body does not generate enough insulin to move the glucose into the cells or if the cells stop responding normally to insulin, the consequential high levels of glucose in the blood and the insufficient amount of glucose in the cells together produce the symptoms and complications of diabetes. There were three types of diabetes mellitus, Type 1, Type 2 and Gestational Diabetes Diabetes mellitus type 1 is a genetic disorder and can be classify as an autoimmune disease, this disease also know as juvenile diabetes or insulin dependent diabetes, according to Kowalczyk N (2013) diabetes mellitus type 1 is usually diagnosed in children and young adults, these young individuas produce little to no insulin because of an autoimmune disease of the pancreatic B cells and are insulin dependent from a young age. Type 1 diabetes accounts for 5 to 10 percent of cases of diabetes worldwide which is stated by The Health on the Net (HON) (2014). Diabetes mellitus type 2 is categorized as insulin resistant diabetes with an insufficient secretion of insulin. Type 2 dibetes mellitus is more common than type 1 and the risk of developing this type increases with age, especially after the age of 40 years. It is also more prevalent in women than in men which are stated by Kowalczyk N (2013). According to Wisse B (2014) type 2 diabetes happen when insulin is not been respond correctly by fat, liver and muscle cells, this is called insulin resistance, therefore blood sugar or glucose does not get into these cells to be stored for energy. When sugar cannot go into cells, a high level of sugar builds up in the blood. This is called hyperglycemia This type affects females during pregnancy. Gestational diabetes is caused when insulin receptors do not function properly, and their bodies are unable to produce enough insulin to transport all of the glucose into their cells, resulting in increasingly rising levels of glucose. Undiagnosed or uncontrolled gestational diabetes can elevate the risk of problems during childbirth. The baby may be bigger than he/she should be. Generally the cause of type 1 diabetes mellitus is unknown. A number of descriptive theories have been put forward, and the cause may be one or more. One of the causes is autoimmune disease. This is a condition that occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys healthy body tissue, an infection causes the body to mistakenly attack the cells in the pancreas that make insulin in which destruction or damaging of the beta cells, beta cells is special cells that produced insulin hormone in the pancreas. According to Wisse B (2014) Insulin is needed to move glucose into cells. Inside the cells, glucose is stored and later used for energy. Without sufficient insulin, glucose builds up in the bloodstream instead of going into the cells. This increase glucose in the blood is called hyperglycemia, therefore body is unable to use the glucose for energy. Genetics is one of the causes, according to American Diabetes Association (2014) if you are a man with type 1 diabetes; the chances of your child developing diabetes are 1 in 17. If you are a woman with type 1 diabetes and your child was born before you were 25, your child’s risk is 1 in 25, if your child was born after you turned 25, your child’s risk is 1 in 100. Your child’s risk is doubled if you developed diabetes before age 11. If both you and your partner have type 1 diabetes, the risk is between 1 in 10 and 1 in 4. Another cause of Type 1 diabetes mellitus is viruses that might promote autoimmunity. According to American Diabetes Association (2014) A significant number of viruses have been associated with type 1 diabetes, including enteroviruses such as Coxsackievirus B , but also rotavirus, mumps virus, and cytomegalovirus . Rubella virus has been suggested to cause type 1 diabetes, but so far only congenital rubella syndrome has convincingly been linked with the disease. The prime viral candidates for causing type 1 diabetes in humans are enteroviruses. Type 2 diabetes mellitus generally causes from the pancreas does not make sufficient insulin or the body is unable to use the insulin that is produced, as we know insulin resistance. According to Khardori. R (2014) Type 2 diabetes mellitus appears to involve complex relations between environmental and genetic factors, environmental factor is including lifestyle for example (excessive caloric intake, inadequate caloric expenditure, obesity), high body mass index (BMI) increases risk for diabetes. In addition, an in utero environment consequential in low birth weight may influence some individuals to develop type 2 diabetes mellitus. Infant weight velocity has a small, indirect effect on adult insulin resistance. In addition about 90% of obese patient develop type 2 dibetes mellitus. According to Winter S (2014). Second diabetes mellitus type 2 causes is by genetic, diabetes mellitus type 2 strongly has a hereditary component. However not everyone who carries a mutation will get diabetes. Gestational Diabetes type affects females during pregnancy. The cause’s gestational diabetes according to Mayo Clinic (2014) during pregnancy, the placenta, which connects your baby to your blood supply, produces high levels of various other hormones. Almost all of them impair the action of insulin in your cells, raising your blood sugar. As your baby grows, the placenta produces more and more insulin-blocking hormones. In gestational diabetes, the placental hormones provoke a rise in blood sugar to a level that can affect the growth and welfare of your baby. Gestational diabetes usually develops during the trimester. Our academic experts are ready and waiting to assist with any writing project you may have. From simple essay plans, through to full dissertations, you can guarantee we have a service perfectly matched to your needs. According to Nucleus Medical Media (2014) Pathogenesis for diabetes mellitus type 1 is summaries that beta cells in the pancreas lose their ability to produce insulin, resulting in high blood glucose levels.In type 1 diabetes, your immune system, specifically your white blood cells, mistake your pancreatic beta cells for foreign invaders.In an autoimmune response, your white blood cells secrete auto antibodies that destroy your own beta cells.As a result, your pancreas produces little or no insulin.Without insulin, glucose cannot get into your cells, so they are starved for the calories they should be receiving from glucose.In addition, the glucose level builds up in your bloodstream, resulting in a condition called hyperglycemia. Diabetes mellitus type 2 usualy caused by obesity and physical inactivity, Diabetes mellitus type 2 is categorized as insulin resistant diabetes, it commonly referred to as the metabolic syndrome according to Hannele Yki-Järvinen (2011) Insulin resistance can be defined as the inability of insulin to produce its usual biological actions at circulating concentrations that are effective in normal subjects. In addition pathogenesis diabetes mellitus type 2 happen when beta cells of the pancreas are no longer capable to meet the body’s requirement for insulin. Hyperglycaemia therefore develops earlier in the course of beta cell failure, and in association with a greater beta cell mass, in insulin-resistant compared with insulin-sensitive individuals. The relative importance of reduced secretion of insulin and increased demand insulin resistance ranges along a range from one individual or population to the next. Pathogenesis of gestational diabetes. According to Manda when pregnant, human body will produce several hormones. Some pregnancy hormones disrupt the usual function of insulin by interfering cell signalling pathways. In the bloodstream insulin will stimulates fat tissue and skeletal muscle cells to absorb glucose. Because of presence insulin resistance the process uptake of blood glucose is prevented as a result the blood sugar level remains high. In the pregnancy glucose usually present in the blood stream in the placenta through the Glucose transporter 1 (GLU1) carrier to reach the fetus. If not been treated, amount of insulin develop by the fetus will increase, then the baby born larger body than is normal. After baby born the excess of glucose through placenta is done. However, the insulin production still increased it may lead to low blood glucose levels or hypoglycaemia. According to Kishore P (2013), The types of diabetes have very related symptoms. The first symptoms are related to the direct effects of high blood glucose levels. When the blood glucose level rises above 160 to 180 mg/dL, glucose spills into the urine. When the level of glucose in the urine rises even higher, the kidneys excrete additional water to dilute the large amount of glucose. Because the kidneys produce excessive urine, people with diabetes urinate large volumes frequently. The excessive urination creates abnormal thirst. Because excessive calories are lost in the urine, people may lose weight. To compensate, people often feel excessively hungry. Other symptoms include blurred vision, drowsiness, nausea, and decreased endurance during exercise. There are severe test can done to demonstrate diabetes mellitus (DM). According to Mayo Clinic (2014), the common test done is Glycated hemoglobin (A1C). Test this blood test indicates your average blood sugar level for the past two to three months. It measures the percentage of blood sugar attached to hemoglobin, the oxygen carrying protein in red blood cells. The higher your blood sugar levels, the more hemoglobin you’ll have with sugar attached. An A1C level of 6.5 percent or higher on two separate tests indicates that you have diabetes. An A1C between 5.7 and 6.4 percent indicates prediabetes. Below 5.7 is considered normal. However If the A1C test results aren’t consistent, the test isn’t available, or if you have certain conditions that can make the A1C test inaccurate — such as if you’re pregnant or have an uncommon form of hemoglobin (known as a hemoglobin variant) — your doctor may use the next tests to diagnose diabetes such as.

Mayo Clinic Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences Mayo Clinic School of Continuous Professional Development Type 1 diabetes, once known as juvenile diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes, is a chronic condition in which the pancreas produces little or no insulin. Insulin is a hormone needed to allow sugar (glucose) to enter cells to produce energy. Different factors, including genetics and some viruses, may contribute to type 1 diabetes. Although type 1 diabetes usually appears during childhood or adolescence, it can develop in adults. Despite active research, type 1 diabetes has no cure. Treatment focuses on managing blood sugar levels with insulin, diet and lifestyle to prevent complications. Type 1 diabetes signs and symptoms can appear relatively suddenly and may include: Bed-wetting in children who previously didn't wet the bed during the night Consult your doctor if you notice any of the above signs and symptoms in you or your child. The exact cause of type 1 diabetes is unknown. Usually, the body's own immune system — which normally fights harmful bacteria and viruses — mistakenly destroys the insulin-producing (islet, or islets of Langerhans) cells in the pancreas. Other possible causes include: Exposure to viruses and other environmental factors Once a significant number of islet cells are destroyed, you'll produce little or no insulin. Insulin is a hormone that comes from a gland situated behind and below the stomach (pancreas). The pancreas secretes insulin into the bloodstream. Insulin circulates, allowing sugar to enter your cells. Insulin lowers the amount of sugar in your bloodstream. As your blood sugar level drops, so does the secretion of insulin from your pancreas. Glucose — a sugar — is a main source of energy for the cells that make up muscles and other tissues. Glucose comes from two major sources: food and your liver. Sugar is absorbed into the bloodstream, where it enters cells with the help of insulin. When your glucose levels are low, such as when you haven't eaten in a while, the liver breaks down the stored glycogen into glucose to keep your glucose levels within a normal range. In type 1 diabetes, there's no insulin to let glucose into the cells, so sugar builds up in your bloodstream. This can cause life-threatening complications. Some known risk factors for type 1 diabetes include: Anyone with a parent or sibling with type 1 diabetes has a slightly increased risk of developing the condition. The presence of certain genes indicates an increased risk of developing type 1 diabetes. The incidence of type 1 diabetes tends to increase as you travel away from the equator. Although type 1 diabetes can appear at any age, it appears at two noticeable peaks. The first peak occurs in children between 4 and 7 years old, and the second is in children between 10 and 14 years old. Over time, type 1 diabetes complications can affect major organs in your body, including heart, blood vessels, nerves, eyes and kidneys. Maintaining a normal blood sugar level can dramatically reduce the risk of many complications. Eventually, diabetes complications may be disabling or even life-threatening. Diabetes dramatically increases your risk of various cardiovascular problems, including coronary artery disease with chest pain (angina), heart attack, stroke, narrowing of the arteries (atherosclerosis) and high blood pressure. Excess sugar can injure the walls of the tiny blood vessels (capillaries) that nourish your nerves, especially in the legs. This can cause tingling, numbness, burning or pain that usually begins at the tips of the toes or fingers and gradually spreads upward. Poorly controlled blood sugar could cause you to eventually lose all sense of feeling in the affected limbs. Damage to the nerves that affect the gastrointestinal tract can cause problems with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation. For men, erectile dysfunction may be an issue. The kidneys contain millions of tiny blood vessel clusters that filter waste from your blood. Diabetes can damage this delicate filtering system. Severe damage can lead to kidney failure or irreversible end-stage kidney disease, which requires dialysis or a kidney transplant. Diabetes can damage the blood vessels of the retina (diabetic retinopathy), potentially causing blindness. Diabetes also increases the risk of other serious vision conditions, such as cataracts and glaucoma. Nerve damage in the feet or poor blood flow to the feet increases the risk of various foot complications. Left untreated, cuts and blisters can become serious infections that may ultimately require toe, foot or leg amputation. Diabetes may leave you more susceptible to infections of the skin and mouth, including bacterial and fungal infections. Gum disease and dry mouth also are more likely. High blood sugar levels can be dangerous for both the mother and the baby. The risk of miscarriage, stillbirth and birth defects increases when diabetes isn't well-controlled. For the mother, diabetes increases the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis, diabetic eye problems (retinopathy), pregnancy-induced high blood pressure and preeclampsia. There's no known way to prevent type 1 diabetes. But researchers are working on preventing the disease or further destruction of the islet cells in people who are newly diagnosed. Ask your doctor if you might be eligible for one of these clinical trials, but carefully weigh the risks and benefits of any treatment available in a trial.

49ecc6b7-81f0-4522-8420-f21f3ffa5b5c,"Friday, 14 September 2018 Every 20 seconds someone, somewhere on the planet, loses a foot due to diabetes. Foot ulcers are the starting point of more than 80% of these amputations, and they could be prevented. The number of people diagnosed with diabetes, globally, has risen from . This is a huge burden on healthcare services as diabetes is associated with many long-term health complications, including , where nerves become damaged, leading to pain, numbness or weakness. People with diabetes who develop neuropathy don’t feel pain when they are injured, so they may not notice soft tissue damage in the foot (or elsewhere) until the damage is quite extensive. Many of these people also have peripheral artery disease (PAD) as a result of poor blood circulation to the legs. PAD reduces a person’s ability to fight infection and puts them at a higher risk of developing foot ulcers. People with diabetes have a of getting foot ulcers. And if a person develops a foot ulcer they are at an increased risk of amputation because of infection and other related complications. Diabetes is one of the main causes of lower-limb amputation. There are several ways to prevent or treat diabetic foot ulcers: regulating the person’s blood-sugar levels; ensuring that they are regularly screened for foot and other diabetes-related problems; educating them about their condition; and providing special shoes, insoles and foot braces. The cost of treating diabetes-related foot issues puts a significant financial burden on healthcare services. In the UK alone the annual cost of treating “diabetic foot” (as these conditions are called) is about £650m. In the US, it is reported that the annual direct costs of diabetic foot complications are greater than the . While costs are increasing, healthcare professionals have yet to find an effective way to screen diabetic patients and treat complications caused by the disease. Our show that more research is needed before we can be sure about which specialist footwear and footwear materials are the most effective for diabetic foot. In most cases, diabetic foot ulcers can be attributed to the accumulation of some kind of injury, nerve damage and deformity. About involve some form of trauma and are therefore potentially preventable. Also, many foot ulcers develop as a result of . Previous research examining the causal chain leading to diabetic amputations in 80 patients found that footwear was a factor in . Evidence shows that providing appropriate footwear to all patients with diabetes at risk of ulceration would be a cost-effective and potentially cost saving measure. Screening in also needs to . Our review of from various countries shows that there are disparities and inconsistencies in the methods and tools used to screen and diagnose patients at an early stage of their disease. Many of the screening guidelines are classified as “strong recommendation, based on low evidence”. When there is a strong recommendation for a specific treatment, there should be a high quality of evidence. Often, when high quality evidence is not available, doctors have to make an educated guess based on their clinical experience. But there are lots of technological developments, such as , and , and healthcare professionals should start using these technologies to develop better diagnostics and treatments. Current guidelines also fail to take the needs of different cultural and ethnic groups into account. For example, in certain cultures people don’t wear shoes in the house or places of worship, and this puts them at a higher risk of developing ulcers. Our review shows that there is a clear need for culturally specific, up-to-date guidelines on screening for and treating diabetic foot. Without them, we will continue to see unnecessary amputations and mounting costs. , Professor of Clinical Biomechanics, This article was originally published on . Read the .

Con Leontsinis lives with type 2 diabetes and loves his life. In-house psychologist Katherine Dixon shares some of the common concerns she hears from people living with type 1 diabetes. Often overlooked are the benefits exercise and physical activity can have for your mental health. Exercise can have a significant impact on your mood and mental wellbeing, not just your physical health. When you're living with diabetes it can take its toll on your emotional health. Follow these four tips and help get yourself back on track. Winter weather can have an effect on your mood but what you eat can make a difference. Find out more about the impact the food you eat can have on your mood. Have you ever had that feeling of “failing” at managing your diabetes? You may be suffering from diabetes distress. June 11-17 marks Men’s Health Week where we look at men’s health overall and the different ways men can keep healthy, physically and emotionally. The cold weather is upon us and for some this can affect our mood, leading us to feel sluggish and gloomy, and increasing our levels of stress. Research continues to show that men are less likely than women to take an active role in maintaining their health and less likely to seek professional help for problems. It's been estimated that about half of the physical decline associated with ageing may be due to a lack of physical activity, so reducing sedentary behaviour is more important than you might think. Easter can be a challenging time for managing blood glucose levels. Here are our tips for balancing your diabetes management while still enjoying the holiday. Easter can be a stressful time for people living with diabetes,so we’ve put together some suggestions so you feel on top of your diabetes and can enjoy yourself. There's a lot of talk about how good ‘mindfulness’ is for us, but what does it mean and why is it important for people living with diabetes? During the silly season it’s especially important to be mindful of your stress levels as they can impact your blood glucose levels. Sleep is vital to many of our bodily functions and with an estimated 45% of Australian’s suffering from inadequate sleep, it's something worth paying attention to. Living with diabetes can be challenging enough and getting unsolicited advice can make you feel frustrated, isolated or upset. Managing these conversations can be difficult and you don’t have to do it by yourself. We all strive for happiness in our lives and it's important to review what's impacting your mood and your mental health. We don’t just eat when we are hungry. For some of us, eating is a way of coping with unpleasant feelings, like stress, anxiety and depression. In a recent Australian survey, 28% of people with type 1 diabetes and up to 22% of people with type 2 diabetes reported experiences severe diabetes-related distress. Hypo symptoms are the brain’s reaction to a lack of glucose and may greatly increase your emotional response which can make you exceptionally happy, silly, worried, frightened, paranoid or angry. While it’s normal to feel stressed or anxious at times about having to manage a chronic condition such as diabetes, intense or  ongoing feelings can be a sign of diabetes distress, burnout or depression. It can be hard to know where to start, but just letting someone know you care can make all the difference. Low mood can prevent good self-care of your diabetes, make it harder to reach your blood glucose targets, and increase the risks of diabetes related complications. Many people with diabetes experience common feelings of worry, frustration, concern and ‘burn-out’. These feelings can often arise from concerns about looking after your diabetes, lack of support, emotional burden, and difficulty accessing health care services. Make sure that when you are thrown into change you know how to cope with it and manage your diabetes as best you can.

8d72a612-ee31-4ec2-ba81-7416bd788bd5,"Introduction Type II diabetes is a heterogeneous syndrome results from the progressive defects of impairment of ß- cell insulin secretion and insulin resistant of the target tissues. It also increases due to the rising rate of obesity which involves the deficiency of insulin to compensate for resistance by increasing insulin secretion [1]. However it is increasingly clear that reductions in insulin sensitivity and ß- cell functions leads to the rise of type II diabetes [2]. The normal pancreatic ß- cells displaying the remarkable response to nutrients and obesity – associated insulin resistance by the hyper secretion of insulin to maintain fuel homeostasis. But the cellular resistance unable to sustain the ß– cells compensatory response in type II diabetes [3]. Although the cause of the metabolic deterioration is unknown, but several hypothesis have been proposed including mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, ER stress, and gluco-lipotoxicity [4, 5]. Recent studies with intensive investigations suggesting that elevated glucose along with circulating free fatty acids distributed especially from the intra abdominal fat are the major culprits of insulin resistance and beta cell dysfunction [6, 7]. But the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms of gluco-lipotoxicity contribute to ß- cell dysfunction and loss in type II diabetes remains debated. A recent observation from experimental, clinical and genetic evidence suggests endoplasmic reticulum was responsible for molecular mechanism of gluco-lipotoxicity which may contribute to ß - cell dysfunction in type II diabetes [8, 9]. In this review, we discussed about the involvement of ER in gluco-lipotoxicity induced ß- cell dysfunction along with the brief involvement of mitochondria. ER stress response Adaptation to metabolic changes requires the high regulation and co-ordination of many homeostatic systems, since the quality and quantity of available nutrients does not temporally match their needs. Pancreatic ß - cells displaying remarkable response to nutrients by the balance between the anabolic hormone insulin and the catabolic hormone glucagon in order to maintain fuel homeostasis. For an appropriate response, the cells require the development of suitable sensors and signaling molecules, which integrates all these signals into an appropriate insulin secretory rate in order to maintain homeostasis. In addition, in hyperglycemia, glucose is not taken up by the cells; therefore, the glucose remains in circulation in the blood. Another consequence of insulin depletion is the increase in the breakdown of fats in the body and fatty oxidation. This consequence of insulin depletion results in the overproduction of ketones and leads to ketosis.

Furthermore, within the HLA locus are three classes of genes. Type II, is where the body can’t make enough or properly use insulin, also known as non-insulin dependent. Other specific type of diabetes may have its origin from certain genetic syndromes, surgery, drugs, malnutrition inflection and other illness. The cause of this disease remains a mystery. Genetics, environmental factors, lack of exercise, plays an important role in the cause of diabetes. Diabetes can cause different types of problems depending on which types of diabetes they have. A person’s lifestyle choices can greatly increase or decrease his/her chances of developing diabetes. Poor lifestyle choices can lead to increased levels of fat, which is dangerous because excess levels of fat makes it more difficult for one’s body to utilize insulin effectively.

Type 2 diabetes (non–insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus [NIDDM]) is a heterogeneous disorder. Patients with NIDDM have insulin resistance, and their beta cells lack the ability to overcome this resistance. Although this form of diabetes previously was uncommon in children, 20% or more of new patients with diabetes in childhood and adolescence now have NIDDM, a change associated with increased rates of obesity. Insulin is essential to process carbohydrate, fat, and protein. Insulin reduces blood glucose levels by allowing glucose to enter muscle cells and fat cells and by stimulating the conversion of glucose to glycogen as a carbohydrate store. This hormone is responsible for maintaining an optimal glucose level in the blood. It allows the body cells to use glucose as a main energy source. Due to abnormal insulin metabolism, in a diabetic person, the body cells and tissues cannot make use of glucose from the blood, resulting in elevated blood glucose level or hyperglycemia. Over time, elevated blood glucose level in the bloodstream can lead to severe complications, such as disorders of the eyes, cardiovascular diseases, kidney damage and nerve destruction. In Type 1 diabetes, the pancreas is not able to produce sufficient amount of insulin as required for the body. The disease, diabetes mellitus presents from complications of carbohydrate, fat, and protein metabolism. Many routes can contribute to the rise of the disease, beta cell dysfunction, insulin release mechanisms fail or tissue cells become insulin resistant from over exposure to high concentrations of glucose. This disorder can be diagnosed as an autoimmune disorder as well, resulting from the destruction of insulin producing β-cells. The chronic effects of such disease processes can lead to critical failures of major bodily systems, such as the kidneys, heart, nerves, and vascular system. Significant microvasuclar and macrovascular complications arise from chronic hyperglycemia caused by diabetes mellitus and will be the main focus of this essay. Type 1 diabetes results from the autoimmune destruction of insulin producing beta cells located in the Pancreas. It is because of this destruction that Type 1 diabetes patients need to take shots of insulin for the remainder of their life in order to control the glucose in the body itself. Where as a patient with type 2 diabetes can have higher levels of blood sugar in the body, and can eventually level out without the aid of insulin. It should be said that in both cases the bodies lack of insulin production causes the body to be unable to convert the glucose to energy. When this occurs the body begins to burn fatty acids required for energy production which begins to produce ketones in the body which are r... ... middle of paper ... ... predisposing the patient to renal deficiency. SECTION I Scientific Rationale for Selection of the Target A. Characterization of Target Diabetes Mellitus is a heterogeneous group of metabolic diseases characterized by the presence of excessive amounts of glucose and glucagon in the blood of diabetic patients. The most frequently cited reason for Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is either a lack of insulin secretion (DM Type I) and/or, more commonly, the resistance to insulin in the peripheral tissues, particularly muscle and adipose tissue (DM type II). Hence, insulin has long been a target for the treatment of DM. In DM Type I, intravenous or subcutaneous insulin injection has often been the norm. Diabetes is a disease known by most of the people which occurs when the blood sugar level is exceptionally high compared to normal level. The essay will focus more on diabetes type 1 by which the production of insulin in the pancreas is inhibited because the β-cells in the pancreas are destroyed by the immune system (Dr Ananya Mandal). The unusually high blood sugar level can cause adverse effects on the human body. The kidney eventually will be damaged by the high concentration of glucose in the blood. This is a result of the extra work for the glomerulus to filter the high sugar level in the blood, causing the glomerulus to become leaky (American Diabetes Association, 2013). This is a discussion of research article listed at end of paper When muscle is damaged, there is a general resistance to insulin. The physiological stress that is associated with damaged muscle impairs how insulin stimulates IRS-1, PI 3-kinase, and Akt-kinase. This presumably leads to less glucose absorption. Previous studies have shown that there has been temporary insulin resistance due to the physiological stress associated with muscle damage. However, the molecular mechanisms by which physiological stress induces insulin resistance is not known. Copyright © 2000-2020. 123Helpme.com.

6b7b3f9a-8eba-44f8-b666-7c5e97f213da,"/ Gestational diabetes Pregnant women who were not diabetic before but who have high blood sugar levels during pregnancy are said to have gestational diabetes (GD). Normally, the disease affects women quite late in her pregnancy, around the 24 week. The disease does not show noticeable signs or symptoms. In some cases however, gestational diabetes may cause excessive thirst or increased urination. 32 million people are living with diabetes in India, and more than 16 percent of pregnant Indian women have gestational diabetes. And the prevalence percentage of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is increasing rapidly. According to a study published in the Journal of the Association of Physicians of India, an overall prevalence of GDM in their study area is about 17% in Chennai, 15% in Trivandrum, 21% in Alwaye, 12% in Bangalore, 18.8% in Erode and 17.5% in Ludhiana. The study also indicated that Indian women have high prevalence of diabetes and their relative risk of developing GDM is 11.3 times compared to white women. Further, Asian women are ethnically more prone to develop glucose intolerance compared to other ethnic groups. It has also been seen that pregnant women in the age group of 30 to 39 years had greater prevalence of GDM as compared with those in the age group of 20 to 29 years. Considering all these facts, the researchers suggest screening all pregnant women for glucose intolerance. Scientists are not sure what causes gestational diabetes (GD) but the most likely theory is that hormones from the placenta may be responsible for the same. The placental hormones help the baby develop but they may also block the action of mother’s insulin in her body. This causes insulin resistance. Since the body cannot make and use the insulin required for pregnancy, high levels of glucose build up in the blood and cause gestational diabetes. Knowing the risk factors for GDM can help you to incorporate early intervention measures. Women who have a history of infertility have an increased risk of developing GDM. Studies have found that low socioeconomic status women in India are at an increased risk for gestational diabetes. Women with irregular menstrual cycles are more prone to gestational diabetes. Overweight and obese Indian women are more prone to develop GDM say researchers at Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences, Thiruvananthapuram. Increased BMI and insulin resistance is also linked to polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), especially in Indian subcontinent Asian women and is a predictor for GDM. Family history of diabetes in first-degree relatives from the mother’s side of the family is significantly associated with a risk of GDM, besides, subsequently developing type-2 diabetes later on in life. History of UTI (urinary tract infection) and history of moniliasis (an infection caused by fungi of the genus Monilia or Candida) are also associated with GDM. Polyhydramnios, another risk factor for GDM, is a condition in which an excess of amniotic fluid builds up in the amniotic sac. It is typically diagnosed when the amniotic fluid index (AFI) is greater than 24 cm. Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) measures the body’s ability to use glucose and it is the normal procedure to diagnose GDM. The World Health Organization (WHO) proposes using a 2-hour 75g OGTT, with a threshold plasma glucose concentration of greater than 7.8 mmol* /L (140 mg/ dL) at 120 minutes as screening for gestational diabetes. The procedure is simple and cost effective, but the disadvantage is that the pregnant woman has to come in the fasting state to undergo the OGTT. So, Diabetes in Pregnancy Study Group India (DIPSI) came out with a modified version of WHO OGTT wherein pregnant women are given 75 g oral glucose load irrespective of their last meal timing and 2-hour plasma glucose greater than or equal to 7.8 mmol/L (140 mg /dL) is diagnosed as GDM. This is because after a meal, a non-GDM woman would be able to maintain normal glucose levels despite glucose challenge due to brisk and adequate insulin response. Whereas, in a woman with GDM who has impaired insulin secretion, glucose levels increases with a meal and with further glucose load, plasma glucose levels will rise further. Due to high prevalence of GDM in India, it is necessary to closely monitor and control blood sugar when you are pregnant and in the risk category.  The Diabetes in Pregnancy Study Group India (DIPSI) lays down the following guidelines to manage GDM – Know the implications of GDM for your baby and yourself. Learn how to monitor blood glucose yourself. It may be inconvenient to always seek professional help. Reduce stress and anxiety. Develop techniques to cope with denial and anxiety issues. If necessary seek professional help. You need to intake adequate calories and nutrients to meet the needs of pregnancy. The expected weight gain during pregnancy is 300 to 400 gm/week and total weight gain is 10 to 12 kg by term. Avoid excess weight gain and post prandial hyperglycemia (increase in blood sugar levels after meals). Your calorie requirement is 30 to 40 calorie per kilogram of your ideal body weight. Distribute your calorie consumption especially the breakfast. It is best if you split the usual breakfast into two equal halves and consuming the portions with a two hour gap in between. If nutrition therapy fails to achieve normal blood glucose levels, then may have to be initiated. The success of the treatment for a woman with GDM depends on the glycemic control maintained with meal plan or pharmacological intervention. Although GD does not cause birth defects the way diabetes (mothers who had diabetes before pregnancy) does, it still can hurt the baby. Since it occurs in the later stages of pregnancy, the body of the baby is already formed but the baby is still growing and developing. What happens is, the blood sugar (glucose) levels are high in the mother with gestational diabetes and this blood glucose goes through the placenta and into the baby’s blood. Now, the pancreas in the baby begins to produce more insulin so as to process the extra glucose and convert it to energy. The baby thus gets more energy than is required for growth and development. The extra energy is then stored as fat leading to ‘macrosomia’ or fat baby and causing health problems such as – Very low blood sugar levels at birth because of extra insulin produced by the baby’s pancreas Higher risk for obesity (because of excess insulin production) Higher risk for type-2 diabetes as adults (because of obesity and excess insulin) Know that, nothing you had done triggered the onset of gestational diabetes for you. But what you can do is avoid potential complications by monitoring your blood sugar and modifying your diet accordingly. It is a common belief in India that eating eggs, pineapples and few other fruits can cause abortion. But it’s very far from true! Ripe fruits and vegetables in moderate quantities should be essential part of your diet. And egg is a very rich in protein and other essential nutrients, and if your doctor does not say ‘no’ to it, go ahead and make it a part of your diet. And of course, most pregnant Indian women know how they are cajoled into eating a lot of carbs because ‘you need to eat for two’. That’s a potentially dangerous habit during pregnancy. You need only 300 calories extra for carrying the baby. Excess carb intake will only result in extra glucose in your blood leading to blood sugar and insulin sensitivity problems. In the same way, you might want to avoid consuming lot of ‘ghee’ because it is an unsaturated fat and it does not serve any other purpose other than making you overweight or fat. And being fat or overweight is one of the significant risk factors of gestational diabetes. Along with nutrition therapy and / or insulin therapy it is also necessary to get regular physical exercise. Your well wishers and relatives may advise you to restrict your physical activities to the minimum so as not to hurt the baby inside. But for sure, it is a myth. Regular physical activity helps lower your blood sugar by moving the glucose into your cells and also by increasing your sensitivity to insulin. Aim for moderately vigorous exercise on most days of the week, but first check with your doctor.

Alzheimer’s disease is a form of vascular dementia and is so pervasive in today’s world that it has become the third leading cause of mortality in both the United States and the United Kingdom. Dementia is a broad term for multiple neurodegenerative diseases that typically affect older adults, causing cognitive impairment and a steady decline in brain function and mental acuity. Scientists are actively studying the relationship between type 3 diabetes and Alzheimer's, and many have begun to . , dementia is arguably the most devastating disease of the 21st century: Dementia affects almost 6 million people in the USA alone, which may be an underestimate A person is diagnosed with dementia once every 64 seconds After the age of 85, almost 50% of adults have dementia This results in almost $340 billion of direct cost and $260 billion in indirect cost each year Estimates show this number reaching as high as $3 trillion worldwide by 2050 The cost of dementia absolutely dwarfs other leading causes of mortality in the U.S., including and cancer . In this article, we'll explore the connection between insulin resistance, diabetes, dementia, and Alzheimer's disease and showcase the research that demonstrates that your brain health is determined mainly by your lifestyle – not by your genetics. Why is Alzheimer’s Disease Considered Type 3 Diabetes? Is Type 3 Diabetes The Same as Type 3C Diabetes Mellitus? Alzheimer's Disease and Diabetes: A Scientific Look Why is Alzheimer’s Disease Considered Type 3 Diabetes? The negative effects of diabetes come from , a buildup of fatty acids in cells that are not meant to store fats. This prevents cells from effectively processing glucose, leading to hyperglycemia (high blood glucose) and many other side effects. For an in-depth understanding of insulin resistance and the metabolic dysfunction it causes, check out our In the case of , insulin deficiency is primarily caused by the autoimmune attack of insulin producing beta cells in your pancreas, dramatically reducing your ability to manufacture and secrete insulin. In the case of , oftentimes beta cells are capable of manufacturing and secreting sufficient insulin, but insulin resistance in your muscle and liver results in reduced insulin action in both tissues. However, rather than manifesting early in life (as is often the case with type 1 diabetes) or in young to middle adulthood (as often happens with type 2 diabetes), type 3 diabetes typically affects adults 65 and older. The other difference with type 3 diabetes is that it primarily manifests in damage to the brain, and can cause a dramatic decline in cognitive function. Is Type 3 Diabetes The Same as Type 3C Diabetes Mellitus? Even though type 3 diabetes and type 3c diabetes have similar names, these two forms of diabetes are actually quite different. Type 3 diabetes is a form of diabetes that affects the brain and impairs cognitive function. is a form of diabetes that reduces insulin secretion, not from damage to the brain, but from damage to the pancreas caused mainly by . Alzheimer's Disease and Diabetes: A Scientific Look Your brain is the most powerful and most important organ in your body. In fact, your brain is a fascinating tissue that: Consumes between Is estimated to , which is more powerful than any supercomputer in existence Can compute an estimate of calculations per second! Contains upwards of (and has the ability to rewire itself) As a result, your brain has a high demand for blood flow to bring a constant supply of oxygen and nutrients. However, it is also a very delicate organ, with millions of capillary blood vessels and very specific requirements for nutrients. Over time, a brain that is constantly adjusting to suboptimal nutrition and impaired blood flow will accumulate slow and steady damage. Your brain is very adaptable, so typically a condition like dementia doesn’t manifest when you’re young, and becomes more apparent as you age. However, over the course of a lifetime, these can each contribute to cognitive decline and increase your risk for type 3 diabetes: Chronic insulin resistance (present in the majority of patients living with all forms of diabetes eating a low-carbohydrate diet) An insufficient supply of high-quality nutrients found in fruit and vegetables Once type 3 diabetes takes hold, this long term damage can increase, causing a wide variety of cognitive impairments like memory loss, cognitive decline, and more. Type 3 diabetes is different from other forms of dementia like based on the rate of loss of cognitive function. Vascular dementia is often caused by a stroke or other traumatic event, and results in an immediate decline in cognitive function, followed by a plateau. Type 3 diabetes manifests as a slow and steady decline in cognitive function. Once type 3 diabetes manifests, there is currently . There are drugs that help with the symptoms and cognitive decline, but the underlying disease is not currently curable. For this reason, the scientific community has very recently begun to focus on , and how through a plant-based diet, exercise, proper sleep, cognitive activity, and management of stress it’s possible to reverse early signs of type 3 diabetes and prevent cognitive decline. The symptoms of type 3 diabetes are , and include: Trouble understanding visual or spatial relationships Misplacing things, losing the ability to retrace steps One other early sign of type 3 diabetes is , which can occur both due to the same insulin resistance that often accompanies type 3 diabetes as well as behavioral changes. There is currently no single agreed-upon method to diagnose type 3 diabetes. In most cases, noticing one or multiple symptoms will result in a doctor running several cognitive tests. These tests, which , are administered to determine your degree of cognitive impairment, and also eliminate other causes of impairment. These cognitive tests tend to be frequently administered starting in early middle age, which can also help establish a baseline to show any decline in brain health. On a physical level, there are two biomarkers that can help indicate the presence of type 3 diabetes: , and . Cognitive impairment combined with the presence of these biomarkers, along with other diabetes markers like high glucose levels, is a very strong indication of the presence of type 3 diabetes. Type 3 diabetes . Despite $2.8 billion of research funding expected in 2020, currently, 100% of medications . Research continues for a cure for type 3 diabetes, but recent years have placed a focus heavily on more effective of the disease. One of the most effective prevention methods has involved identifying the highest risk factors for type 3 diabetes and working to counteract them. There’s a common misconception that type 3 diabetes is untreatable and unpreventable. However, this is not true. There are in which type 3 diabetes is genetically , which means that no change in lifestyle will affect whether or not it manifests. In the rest of cases, type 3 diabetes manifests as a result of genetic and lifestyle factors, where the effect of lifestyle vastly outweighs the effect of genetics. There are several risk factors that you cannot control that can potentially affect your risk for developing type 3 diabetes, and all are related to genetics. According to the research, the following factors can signal an : On the other hand, there are a number of different, for type 3 diabetes that are very controllable. They include, but are not limited to: Excessive ‘bad’ stress, and a lack of ‘good stress’ Currently, there’s no way to reverse type 3 diabetes. However, as mentioned above, less than 3% of all type 3 diabetes cases are genetically determined. The remaining 97% of cases can be affected by your lifestyle. The same risk factors above, when controlled, can drastically decrease your chance of developing type 3 diabetes, or at the very least delay its onset. One helpful acronym developed by the experts at is NEURO, which stands for Nutrition, Exercise, Unwind, Restorative Sleep, and Optimize Brain Function. Each of these lifestyle areas has a strong neuroprotective effect and reduce the factors that can lead to type 3 diabetes, like high blood pressure, high blood glucose, and inflammation. Proper nutrition is quickly rising to prominence as maybe the most powerful preventative step for type 3 diabetes, with one clear emphasis: low-fat, plant-based, whole-food nutrition. Studies have shown that , and even the , which has a very low portion of meats, can slow the early stages of dementia, while high-fat diets clearly . Fortunately, the guidelines for type 3 diabetes are the same as for type 1 and type 2 diabetes, which you can find at our . Frequent exercise is another powerful preventative measure for type 3 diabetes, with research by the Alzheimer’s Research and Prevention Foundation showing that frequent exercise can . Their research also shows that frequent exercise can slow mental deterioration in individuals diagnosed with type 3 diabetes or other forms of dementia, which makes it a powerful habit to start and maintain. We have a podcast talking about some easy ideas to starting today. Though it can be hard to quantify, researchers agree that can increase the incidence of type 3 diabetes and worsen its neurodegenerative effect. However, with stress as a , it’s more important than ever to pursue activities that lower stress. Whether that’s socializing, time in the outdoors, mindfulness practices, or one of many other techniques, managing your stress is a health issue to take seriously. Mild stress and challenges can actually your brain. ‘Bad’ stress, however, is a chronic form of stress that can increase your risk for cognitive decline. Just as getting insufficient sleep can , taking care to get adequate sleep every night has a powerful neuroprotective effect. Sleep has been proven to improve , which have the added effect of improving other aspects of type 3 diabetes prevention. For example, when you sleep enough you are less stressed, more likely to be active, and are more — all factors that help prevent type 3 diabetes. The last major area for type 3 diabetes prevention (and prevention of dementia as a whole) is in maintaining a high level of brain function. Research shows that having a , , and continuing to all have a strong neuroprotective effect while aging. Finding this balance is different for everyone, but Team Sherzai has an to get started. As we mentioned above, you can’t reverse type 3 diabetes once it occurs. However, you can slow its progression, and help reduce the symptoms. The core lifestyle changes laid out in NEURO are the exact same lifestyle changes that can help treat and slow the progression of type 3 diabetes. See above for an in-depth list, and accompanying resources. In addition to lifestyle changes, there are several forms of medications and treatments that can help with the various symptoms of type 3 diabetes. Metformin and other common diabetes medications can, in addition to dietary changes, help lower blood glucose and fight hyperglycemia. There are also medications to help with , , and , which can provide more acute treatment to specific issues faced by individuals with type 3 diabetes. The Alzheimer’s Association has a thorough set of on their website. Note: The extended-release version of . For detailed information read the article linked above. Though type 3 diabetes still does not have a cure, the good news is that the vast majority of type 3 diabetes risk factors are entirely within your control. By taking steps early to reduce your insulin resistance and improve your diabetes health, you can drastically reduce your risk for not only type 3 diabetes, but also type 2 diabetes and many other health conditions.

Easter can be a stressful time for people living with diabetes,so we’ve put together some suggestions so you feel on top of your diabetes and can enjoy yourself. There's a lot of talk about how good ‘mindfulness’ is for us, but what does it mean and why is it important for people living with diabetes? During the silly season it’s especially important to be mindful of your stress levels as they can impact your blood glucose levels. In a recent Australian survey, 28% of people with type 1 diabetes and up to 22% of people with type 2 diabetes reported experiences severe diabetes-related distress. While it’s normal to feel stressed or anxious at times about having to manage a chronic condition such as diabetes, intense or  ongoing feelings can be a sign of diabetes distress, burnout or depression. It can be hard to know where to start, but just letting someone know you care can make all the difference. Low mood can prevent good self-care of your diabetes, make it harder to reach your blood glucose targets, and increase the risks of diabetes related complications. Type 1 and type 2 diabetes equally stressful for young adults Young adults with type 2 diabetes experience similar levels of anxiety and depression as those with type 1 Anxiety disorders are high amongst people living with diabetes. Research that analysed more than 270 studies found people who held strong negative emotions about their illness and viewed it as more serious were more likely to be in denial and experience depression or anxiety, and less likely to get better.

Dietary carbohydrate: relationship to cardiovascular disease and disorders of carbohydrate metabolism Dietary carbohydrate: relationship to cardiovascular disease and disorders of carbohydrate metabolism , –() The nature of carbohydrate is of considerable importance when recommending diets intended to reduce the risk of type II diabetes and cardiovascular disease and in the treatment of patients who already have established diseases. Intact fruits, vegetables, legumes and wholegrains are the most appropriate sources of carbohydrate. Most are rich in nonstarch polysaccharides (NSPs) (dietary fibre) and other potentially cardioprotective components. Many of these foods, especially those that are high in dietary fibre, will reduce total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and help to improve glycaemic control in those with diabetes. There is no good long-term evidence of benefit when NSPs or other components of wholegrains, fruits, vegetables and legumes are added to functional and manufactured foods. Frequent consumption of low glycaemic index foods has been reported to confer similar benefits, but it is not clear whether such benefits are independent of the dietary fibre content of these foods or the fact that low glycaemic index foods tend to have intact plant cell walls. Furthermore, it is uncertain whether functional and manufactured foods with a low glycaemic index confer the same long-term benefits as low glycaemic index plant-based foods. A wide range of carbohydrate intake is acceptable, provided the nature of carbohydrate is appropriate. Failure to emphasize the need for carbohydrate to be derived principally from wholegrain cereals, fruits, vegetables and legumes may result in increased lipoprotein-mediated risk of cardiovascular disease, especially in overweight and obese individuals who are insulin resistant. Traditional dietary patterns, which are high in carbohydrate, are associated with low rates of coronary heart disease (CHD). This appears to be the case regardless of the carbohydrate containing primary staple, for example rice in most Asian countries and a range of cereals, root crops and pulses in different parts of Africa. However, cross-cultural comparisons provide no indication as to whether the percentage of energy intake derived from total carbohydrate intake, total quantity of carbohydrate, particular classes of carbohydrate and other nutrients, which are found in carbohydrate-containing foods or method of food preparation, account for the cardioprotection afforded by such traditional carbohydrate-containing diets. Furthermore, it is possible that cardiovascular risk is reduced simply because traditional high carbohydrate diets are low in fat, especially saturated fat, or because they promote satiety and thus protect against overweight and obesity. Indeed, it is conceivable that high carbohydrate diets simply act as a marker for some other protective factor. Prospective epidemiological studies and a range of experimental approaches examining the effects of carbohydrates on cardiovascular risk factors have attempted to clarify the role of total carbohydrate and carbohydrate classes (sugars, oligosaccharides and polysaccharides) and subgroups (for example starch, nonstarch polysaccharide (NSP)) in CHD and stroke. Several limitations are common to all prospective studies examining the relationship between foods and nutrients and disease risk. However, there are issues that are of particular relevance when considering the role of carbohydrates. The lack of consistency in the methods used for the measurement of different classes and subgroups of carbohydrate, especially the NSP, complicates comparisons between the results of studies and their extrapolation into nutritional recommendations. The term ‘dietary fibre’ is often incorrectly regarded as being synonymous with NSP. However, in this paper, the terms will be used as they occur in the relevant literature, dietary fibre having been measured and reported in most of the epidemiological studies and much of the experimental research. In some countries, total carbohydrate is measured ‘by difference’, after water fat, protein and ash have all been measured. This is a less reliable measure than that derived from adding the various classes of carbohydrate measured individually (see accompanying papers on ‘definition’ and ‘measurement’). Of equal, or arguably greater, importance is the extent to which sources of dietary carbohydrate have changed over time or differ throughout the world. In some developing countries, a high proportion of total sugars may be derived from intact fruits and vegetables. The same may have been true in the past for societies that are now relatively affluent. However, nowadays, in most countries, sucrose, high fructose corn syrup and other free sugars contribute a substantial proportion of total sugars. Foods rich in free sugars are usually energy dense and are often poor sources of essential micronutrients (), and are thus likely to be associated with different physiological effects and clinical consequences when compared with fruits and vegetables. Thus, knowledge of total sugar content provides little information relating to physiology. Similarly, until relatively recently, dietary fibre was likely to be derived principally from minimally processed cereals, vegetables, fruits, legumes and ‘wholegrain’ cereal foods likely to contain at least a reasonable proportion of intact or lightly processed grains. Now, dietary fibre is often an added ingredient and the definition of ‘wholegrain’ permits foods to be described as such if they contain the constituents of the grain without requiring the structure to be intact. Again, the physiological effects of dietary fibre, when derived from intact fruits, vegetables and grains, may differ from that added to manufactured products. Thus, it may not be appropriate to extrapolate the findings of epidemiological studies involving the consumption of conventional foods to carbohydrate-containing manufactured and functional foods, which provide a substantial proportion of total energy in most affluent and many developing counties. Early prospective studies reporting the cardioprotective effect of total carbohydrate intakes and intake of dietary fibre were published in the 1970s and early 1980s (; ; ). They were relatively underpowered and confounding of results by a range of factors certainly could not be excluded. During the past 20 years, results have been published from a substantial number of prospective studies involving cohorts of sufficient size to enable examination of potentially confounding factors. There has been particular emphasis on the cardioprotective role of cereal grains and dietary fibre. Most studies define wholegrain as either intact or milled grain with bran, germ and endosperm in the same proportion as the unmilled grain. Wholegrain foods have generally been arbitrarily defined as those foods with more than 25% wholegrain or bran content by weight (). The studies have been systematically reviewed (for example ; ; ; ; ) and meta-analysed (, ). Despite the use of different instruments for assessing dietary intake, the results of the studies show a remarkably consistent trend. Meta-analysis, involving four of the largest published studies, suggested a 28% reduction in risk of CHD when comparing individuals in the highest and lowest quintiles of intake of wholegrains (relative risk 0.72, 95% confidence intervals: 0.48, 0.94) (). The size of the most recent cohort studies has enabled analyses to examine the extent to which these findings might be confounded by other cardioprotective factors. While residual confounding cannot be excluded with absolute certainty, such analyses provide reasonable evidence that wholegrains protect against CHD regardless of the degree of adiposity and other measured variables associated with healthy lifestyles and eating habits. However, it is acknowledged that people who consistently eat wholegrain breads do indeed have different lifestyles from those who do not, and it may not be possible in epidemiological studies to measure all attributes of lifestyle. The possibility that an association is truly causal is strengthened by the existence of a dose response effect. Such an effect has been demonstrated in the Iowa Women's Health Study. After adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors, relative risks for cardiovascular disease were 1.0, 0.96, 0.71, 0.64 and 0.70 in ascending quintiles of wholegrain intake, for trend=0.02 (). However, the epidemiological studies do not provide an indication of whether all grains are equal in this respect. There is no clear evidence as to which constituent of the grain provides cardioprotection or as to whether the structure of the grain needs to be wholly or partially intact. Relatively few groups have examined the extent to which wholegrain intakes influence the risk of stroke. Reporting on the largest of the prospective studies, the Nurses' Health Study, observed risk reductions of magnitude similar to those observed for CHD (relative risk 0.69, 95% confidence intervals: 0.50, 0.98 when comparing highest relative to lowest quintile of intake of wholegrains). Similar risk reductions have been observed in three other somewhat smaller cohorts. Wholegrains differ in a number of respects from highly refined cereals, and several of the constituents may explain their cardioprotective effects (). Dietary fibre has been studied more than the other constituents. Several groups of researchers have pooled the results from a number of studies. For example, reported a relative risk of 0.90 (95% confidence intervals: 0.77, 1.07 that is not statistically significant) for total CHD events for each 10 g/day increase in cereal fibre. When considering CHD deaths, the relative risk, 0.75 (95% confidence intervals: 0.63, 0.91) was statistically significant, the association being independent of a number of dietary factors and other cardiovascular risk factors. However, other analyses suggest that while cereal fibre is inversely associated with CHD rates, the relationship is not as strong as the inverse relationship between CHD and wholegrain bread (). Furthermore, the effect of dietary fibre may be largely explained by fibre derived from wholewheat, rye or pumpernickel breads (). A single study suggested risk reduction among those with the highest intake of added bran compared with those who consumed no added bran (). The suggestion that reduced cardiovascular risk principally results from consumption of the wholegrain rather than dietary fibre is supported by findings from the Iowa Women's Health Study. CHD rates were compared in women consuming similar amounts of cereal fibre from either predominantly refined grain sources or predominantly wholegrains. After adjustments, all cause mortality was significantly lower, and CHD appreciably (though not statistically significantly) reduced among the latter group (). The absence of a universally adopted definition of ‘wholegrain’, and the even more inconsistent use of the terms ‘wholemeal’ and ‘wholewheat’ preclude more definitive conclusions and complicate extrapolation into guidelines. Fruits and vegetables are important sources of carbohydrate and also contain a range of potentially cardioprotective components, including dietary fibre, folate, potassium, flavonoids and antioxidant vitamins. Pooled analyses of the Nurses' Health Study and the Health Professionals' Follow-up Study suggested risk reductions of 20 and 30% for CHD and ischaemic stroke, respectively, when comparing extreme quintiles of fruit and vegetable intake (). Similar findings were reported in a recent meta-analysis (). A dose–response effect was reported with lowest risk for CHD being associated with eight servings or more per day and for stroke, four or more servings daily. It is noteworthy that in this, the largest study reported to date, individual items relatively low in total carbohydrate appear to have the most striking protective effect—green leafy vegetables in the case of CHD and cruciferous vegetables, citrus fruits and juices and vitamin C-rich fruits and vegetables in the case of stroke. In the Physicians' Health Study, reported an inverse association between carotenoid rich vegetables and CHD risk, and Finnish data suggested that flavonoid-rich foods (for example berries, onions, apples) were especially beneficial in this regard (). Legume consumption four or more times per week compared with less than once per week has also been associated with cardiovascular risk reduction (). During the 1960s, and co-workers reported strong associations between high sugar intakes and CHD. The data were cross-sectional and flawed (; ). The Iowa Women's Health Study found no relationship between intake of sweets and desserts and CHD in over 30 000 women followed for 9 years (). The glycaemic index (GI; and more recently the glycaemic load, GL) has provided a means of determining the extent to which carbohydrate-containing foods may determine cardiovascular risk through their potential to raise blood glucose. reported from the Nurses' Health Study that women who consumed diets with a high-glycaemic load (that is high in rapidly digested starches) were at increased risk of CHD compared with those with a lower consumption; a twofold increase in risk over a 10-year follow-up was observed when comparing those in the highest and lowest quintiles of intake. The effect appeared to be independent of total energy intake and other cardiovascular risk factors. The potential of dietary patterns, rather than the effect of individual foods and nutrients on human health, have been examined in two of the largest cohort studies—the Nurses' Health Study and the Health Professionals' Study (; ). Factor analysis was used to examine the association between CHD and two major dietary patterns identified: ‘western’ and ‘prudent’. The prudent pattern was characterized by higher intakes of fruits, vegetables, legumes, fish, poultry and wholegrains and the western pattern, by higher intakes of red and processed meats, sweets and desserts, French fries and refined grains. After adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors, the prudent diet score was associated with relative risks of 1.0, 0.87, 0.79, 0.75 and 0.70 from the lowest to the highest quintiles. Conversely, the relative risks across increasing quintiles of the western pattern score were 1.0, 1.21, 1.35, 1.40 and 1.64. The patterns were also related to biochemical markers of CHD. Positive correlations were noted between the western pattern score and plasminogen activator antigen, fasting insulin, C-peptide, leptin, C-reactive protein and homocysteine after adjustment for confounders. A significant inverse correlation was observed between plasma folate and the western dietary pattern score. Inverse correlations were observed between the prudent pattern score and fasting insulin and homocysteine, and a positive correlation was observed with folate (). In summary, prospective epidemiological studies provide strong evidence for a protective role of wholegrain cereals, fruits and vegetables and dietary patterns characterized by relatively high intakes of such foods. While a high consumption of dietary fibre derived from cereals is also associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, it is not clear whether the cardioprotection can entirely be attributed to the polysaccharides . The effect seems to stem largely from dietary fibre in dark breads and may therefore be at least partially attributable to other constituents of wholegrains. It is not possible to determine the extent to which other potentially protective constituents of wholegrains are relevant. Epidemiological studies do not permit separating the effects of different wholegrains. Even the best prospective studies cannot conclusively eliminate the possibility of residual confounding, so recommendations regarding the intake of carbohydrates in relation to cardiovascular disease also depend on the intervention studies described below. The effect of carbohydrates on lipids and lipoproteins has dominated discussions regarding the amounts and classes of carbohydrate likely to reduce cardiovascular risk. While there is no doubt that increasing total carbohydrate at the expense of fat, especially saturated and fatty acids in the Western diet, will result in reduction of total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, concern has been expressed that other predictors of lipoprotein-mediated cardiovascular risk may be adversely affected by substantial increases in total carbohydrate. The potential of high carbohydrates to increase fasting triglycerides was first demonstrated in the 1960s () but later considered to be a transient phenomenon, the hypertriglyceridaemia diminishing with prolonged exposure to a high carbohydrate intake (; ). However, more recent and more sophisticated studies suggest that, at least in certain circumstances, a low-fat, high carbohydrate diet may be associated with slightly elevated triglyceride levels for as long as 2 years (). Furthermore, such a diet may result in the appearance of small dense LDL particles that are particularly atherogenic and in an adverse ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol considered to be a more specific marker of CHD than total LDL cholesterol (). The effect of carbohydrate as replacement energy for fatty acids has been examined in a fairly recent meta-analysis involving 60 mostly short-term controlled trials (). The results appeared to offer a strong message: regardless of the source of the fat displaced, an increase in total carbohydrate was associated with an increased ratio of total to HDL cholesterol. However, although these studies paid careful attention to ensure that the comparisons were carried out under isoenergetic conditions and food intake was thoroughly controlled, there was less consistency with regard to the source and class of carbohydrate that was used as fat replacement. A fairly substantial body of evidence suggests that the type of carbohydrate influences lipid and lipoprotein levels. The effect of sugars on triglyceride levels differs from that of polysaccharides. Compared with starches and NSPs, sugars, especially sucrose and fructose, may be associated with appreciable increases in triglyceride levels, especially when the sugars are consumed in the context of a diet high in total carbohydrate or when dietary fat comprises principally of saturated fatty acids (). The effect appears to be more marked in insulin resistant individuals with abdominal obesity (). Unfortunately, few long-term data are available. However, the CARMEN study suggested that after 6 months, a very modest weight loss could mitigate the hypertriglyceridaemic effect of a moderate increase in sucrose (). This has also been observed for diets high in total carbohydrate and starches, which might otherwise have been associated with hypertriglyceridaemia when compared with diets lower in total carbohydrates (). Dietary fibre has a potentially important effect on lipids and lipoproteins when consumed in plant foods or as supplements Viscous subgroups, including pectins, β-glucans, glucomannans, guar and psyllium, which are generally water soluble, all lower total and LDL cholesterol between 5 and 10 g/day, lowering LDL by about 5% (). The mechanism appears to be by reducing ileal bile acid absorption (). These soluble forms of dietary fibre appear to have a negligible effect on triglyceride or HDL levels. Insoluble dietary fibre subgroups are derived largely from cereal sources and have little or no effect on lipids and lipoproteins (). A Cochrane Review has been undertaken of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the effects of wholegrain cereals on CHD and cardiovascular risk factors. Only 10 studies were identified that met the strict criteria required for such a review. None had clinical end points. They compared wholegrain foods or diets high in wholegrain foods with other foods or diets with lower levels or no wholegrains. Eight of the ten studies evaluated wholegrain oats and clearly demonstrated the potential of such foods to reduce total LDL cholesterol. Levels were about 0.2 mmol/l lower on the diet rich in oats compared with the control diet. No changes were observed in triglyceride or HDL cholesterol levels. Lack of appropriate studies precluded conclusions on wholegrains other than oats (). A Cochrane Review has also been undertaken to explore the extent to which low glycaemic index diets might influence CHD and risk factors. The average reduction in total cholesterol when comparing low and high GI diets was 0.17 mmol/l, =0.03 (95% CI −0.32 to −0.02). No convincing differences were apparent in LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol or triglyceride levels (). In studies of free living individuals in whom fruits, vegetables and legumes rich in the viscous forms of NSPs replaced some of the relatively high fat foods typically consumed in a western diet, total and LDL cholesterol fell as expected, and the ratio of total (or LDL) cholesterol to HDL cholesterol improved with no change reported in triglyceride despite an appreciable increase in total carbohydrate (). Total carbohydrate provided 59 and 43% total energy on the high and low carbohydrate diets. While the aim of these studies was not to achieve weight loss, small reductions in body weight did occur on the high carbohydrate diets, perhaps as a result of the enhanced satiety associated with the more bulky, less energy dense foods. This, together with the effects of dietary fibre, are likely to have contributed to the less atherogenic lipid profile observed on the high carbohydrate diet. Such findings provide a clear indication of the need to consider the nature of dietary carbohydrate when carbohydrate rich foods are recommended as replacement for dietary saturated fatty acids. Type II diabetes, impaired carbohydrate metabolism and insulin resistance See later section, which deals more fully with this topic. There has been considerable recent interest in the role of inflammation as a determinant of cardiovascular risk. Much of the research relating to the role of nutritional determinants has centred around different dietary fats (). reported reduced C-reactive protein levels in hyperlipidaemic patients consuming a high carbohydrate diet rich in viscous fibre-containing foods. However, the diets were also high in nuts (almonds), plant sterols and soy proteins, and it is therefore impossible to disentangle separate effects. A very recent study () found that when carbohydrate replaced a substantial proportion of dietary fat under eucaloric conditions, the levels of several inflammatory markers increased along with an increase in triglyceride. However, when the participants (post-menopausal women) consumed the 15% fat diet under free living conditions, they lost weight and triglyceride and the levels of inflammatory markers decreased. Several ‘high carbohydrate’ dietary approaches have been shown to be associated with reduced levels of blood pressure. However, these have invariably involved many dietary changes. For example, the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension approaches have involved an increase in intakes of fruits and vegetables, low fat dairy products and a reduction in sodium. Thus, it has been impossible to disentangle individual effects (). A single RCT has examined the effect of altering dietary carbohydrate intakes on clinical end points. randomized 2033 men who had survived a myocardial infarction to receive one of eight possible combinations of dietary advice. Those who were advised to increase cereal fibre had a similar rate of CHD recurrences and deaths as those who did not receive this advice when considering a 10-year follow-up period. However, the study was underpowered and the degree of compliance is uncertain (). Other RCTs, which involved an increase in dietary carbohydrate, from fruits, vegetables, legumes and wholegrain, as part of a multifactorial dietary approach to primary and secondary prevention of CHD, demonstrated reduction in clinical events among those receiving intensive dietary advice compared with control groups (; ). The Women's Health Initiative Randomised Control for Dietary Modification Trial involved the intervention group being recommended a high carbohydrate low fat diet. Failure to demonstrate significant differences in CHD rates in control and intervention groups contributed little to the understanding of the role of carbohydrates since long-term compliance with the intervention diet was poor (). Dietary carbohydrate and cardiovascular disease: recommendations The joint WHO/FAO Expert Consultation on Diet, Nutrition and the Prevention of Chronic Disease () considered that the evidence suggesting a cardio-protective effect of fruits and vegetables was ‘convincing’ and that relating to wholegrain cereals and NSP was ‘probable’. The evidence that high intakes of total carbohydrate might increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases was considered to be ‘insufficient’ (Table 10, p88 TRS 916). Difficulties with regard to the definition of wholegrains and inability to exclude the possibility of residual confounding provide the justification for regarding the protective effect being graded as ‘probable’ rather than ‘convincing’. The Expert Consultation recommended that total carbohydrate should provide 55–75% total energy and that free sugars should provide less than 10%. Recommended intake of fruits and vegetables was 400 or more g per day, excluding tubers (that is potatoes, cassava). Precise amounts of NSPs or dietary fibre were not recommended. However, it was considered that appropriate intakes of fruits, vegetables, legumes and regular consumption of wholegrain cereals would provide in excess of 20 g/day of NSP and over 25 g of total dietary fibre. There was also no recommendation regarding glycaemic index. These recommendations would appear to be generally compatible with this update of the relevant literature with the following caveats: Many western countries have average intakes of carbohydrate, which are below 55% total energy. There is no good evidence that total carbohydrate intake for populations or individuals must reach the lower recommended intake in order to achieve a cardioprotective dietary pattern provided guidelines relating to dietary fat and other nutrients are met. Several national guidelines suggest a lower limit of 50% total energy. A wide range of carbohydrate intakes is compatible with cardioprotection. However, it is important to be prescriptive with regard to the nature of carbohydrate, especially when total carbohydrate intakes are at the upper end of the recommended range. Failure to emphasize the need for carbohydrate to be derived principally from wholegrain cereals, fruits, vegetables and legumes may result in increased lipoprotein-mediated risk of CHD associated with an increase in the ratio of total (or LDL) cholesterol to HDL cholesterol and an increase in triglyceride. This may apply particularly to overweight and obese individuals who are insulin resistant (see separate section on diabetes and insulin resistance). While fruits and legumes rich in viscous (soluble) forms of NSP and dietary fibre are associated with reduced LDL cholesterol, insoluble forms derived from wholegrain cereals also appear to confer cardioprotection possibly in association with other constituents of wholegrains. There is no convincing evidence that fibre supplements and manufactured and functional foods containing them reduce cardiovascular risk. Dietary carbohydrate and diabetes, impaired carbohydrate metabolism and the metabolic syndrome The escalating rates of type II diabetes worldwide and the realization that insulin resistance and its associated metabolic abnormalities contribute increasingly to the global epidemic of cardiovascular disease () have resulted in renewed interest in the nutritional determinants of these metabolic derangements. In the 1960s, Yudkin suggested that sugar (sucrose) was a major determinant of type II diabetes (then known as ‘maturity onset’ and later as ‘non-insulin dependent’ diabetes). The conclusions were based largely on highly selected, within country and cross country, comparisons (; ) later acknowledged to be totally inappropriate analyses (). At about the same time, Trowell, then working in Uganda, suggested that the low rates of diabetes in rural Africa were likely to result from a protective effect of large intakes of dietary fibre found in the minimally processed or unprocessed carbohydrate, which provided a high proportion of total dietary energy in such societies (). Although it was not possible to know the extent to which these observations implied true causation or protection or simply represented confounding, they stimulated much subsequent epidemiological and experimental research. A number of limitations apply to all prospective studies that have examined the association between foods and nutrients and the risk of various diseases. The issues that are potentially relevant to dietary carbohydrate have been considered in the previous section on cardiovascular disease, and they apply equally when relating various carbohydrates to risk of developing diabetes. Recent prospective studies provide some insight. In the Nurses' Health Study, there was no association between total intake of grains and type II diabetes. However, wholegrain consumption appeared to be protective. When comparing the highest and lowest quintiles of intake, age and energy adjusted relative risk was 0.62 (95% CI: 0.53, 0.71). Further adjustment for other risk factors did not appreciably alter this risk estimate (). A virtually identical risk reduction was observed among men participating in the Health Professionals Study (). A relative risk of 0.63 was reported in association with three or more servings per day of wholegrains. In the Iowa Women's Health Study, postmenopausal women in the upper quintile of wholegrain consumption (more than 33 servings per week) were 20% less likely to develop type II diabetes than those in the lowest quintile (fewer than 13 servings per week) (). Wholegrains have also been shown to be protective against type II diabetes in African-Americans (), Finns () and Iranians (). Cereal fibre, as distinct from fibre derived from other sources, appears to be associated with a protective dose–response effect that is present after controlling for a range of potentially confounding factors. In the Nurses' Health Study, multivariate relative risks for quintiles 1–5 were 1.0, 0.85, 0.87, 0.82 and 0.64, respectively (). The role of wholegrains and dietary fibre in diabetes has been reviewed in detail in . In the Nurses’ Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, a statistically significant relative risk of about 1.4 was observed when comparing diabetes rates in the highest and lowest quintiles of dietary glycaemic load, after adjusting for potentially confounding factors (, ). A high dietary glycaemic index was also found to be associated with an increased risk of type II diabetes in the Melbourne Collaboration Cohort Study (). Rapidly digested starches and sugars, especially glucose, contribute to the glycaemic load of the diet, and thus such observations provide some evidence for a promotive role of these carbohydrates in type II diabetes. However, no association was found between sucrose intake and risk of diabetes during a 6-year follow-up of the Nurses’ Health Study (). , reporting the findings from the Iowa Women's Health Study, found no relationship between type II diabetes and either glycaemic index or glycaemic load. However, dietary glucose and fructose (but not sucrose) were associated with increased risk. Women who developed gestational diabetes in the Nurses’ Health Study had lower intakes of dietary fibre and higher dietary glycaemic load than those who did not (). No prospective studies have examined the relationship between dietary carbohydrate and insulin resistance, considered to be the underlying abnormality in most cases of type II diabetes. However, two large cross-sectional studies, using validated food frequency questionnaires to assess nutrient intake and either the frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test or homoeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance, found that intake of dietary fibre was inversely associated with the probability of having insulin resistance (; ). In the Insulin Resistance Atheroscelerosis Study (), it was possible to demonstrate that fibre was associated with increased insulin sensitivity even after adjustment for body mass index. Interestingly, neither study found any relationship between insulin sensitivity and glycaemic index or glycaemic load. While diets rich in wholegrains and dietary fibre may protect against diabetes and pre-diabetic states by virtue of their potential to promote satiety and weight loss in those who are overweight or obese (excess adiposity being the major determinant of these metabolic abnormalities), the epidemiological data do provide evidence for a protective effect independent of that on fat mass. The data do not permit distinction among different grains nor the extent to which structure of the grain or its constituents explain the protective effect. Several studies suggest that diets with a relatively low glycaemic index or glycaemic load are protective against disorders of carbohydrate metabolism, but the data are insufficient to establish with certainty the extent to which this is independent of other attributes of carbohydrates. Most studies that have compared the effects of carbohydrates and fats and the effects of different carbohydrates have been undertaken in people with established diabetes; however, some information is available concerning people with insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome. Insulin resistance and its associated dyslipidaemia (high triglyceride, low HDL) have been shown to be more marked on a high carbohydrate diet when compared with a diet rich in monounsaturated fatty acids. However, while such studies may distinguish between sugars and polysaccharides, they often do not distinguish between starches, many of which are rapidly digested and absorbed, and NSPs (). A study by clearly demonstrates the importance of doing so. In a controlled 6-week study, overweight hyperinsulinaemic adults consumed diets providing 55% energy from carbohydrate and 30% from fat. Carbohydrates were derived from predominantly wholegrain or refined grain cereals, with dietary fibre content of the wholegrain diet 28 g compared with 17 g on the refined grain diet. Dietary fibre was predominantly from cereal sources. Total carbohydrate and fat and fat sources were virtually identical on the two diets. Insulin sensitivity measured by a euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic clamp was appreciably improved on the wholegrain compared with the refined grain diet. Fasting insulins and area under the 2-h insulin curve were lower, despite body weight not being significantly different on the two diets. Rye bread () and purified cereal fibre () have been shown to improve insulin sensitivity in overweight and obese women. Analysis of a subgroup of individuals within the CARMEN Study, who were diagnosed with the metabolic syndrome, showed that the reduction in body weight and improvement in metabolic indices seen when simple carbohydrate (sugars) were replaced with complex ones were more striking in people with this disorder than in the general population (). Studies by , have compared different nutritional approaches in overweight insulin-resistant women. Although a low carbohydrate high fat diet resulted in initial weight loss and improvement in the metabolic derangements associated with insulin resistance, the improvement was not sustained. A diet relatively high in protein and unsaturated fat sources and with moderate amounts of fibre-rich carbohydrate, and one low in total fat and relatively high in fibre-rich carbohydrate produced sustained weight loss and improvement in a range of metabolic measurements over a period of a year. Thus, while weight loss in those who are overweight or obese is the cornerstone of management aimed at improving insulin sensitivity, it appears that this can be achieved by diets relatively high or relatively low in carbohydrates, provided the carbohydrate sources are wholegrain and rich in dietary fibre. Other studies that have compared the effects of diets of varying amounts of carbohydrate have generated broadly similar results (). The fact that fructose, compared with glucose, is preferentially metabolized to lipid in the liver and that fructose consumption induces insulin resistance, impaired glucose tolerance, hyperinsulinaemia, hypertriglyceridaemia and hypertension in animal models has led to the suggestion that fructose, sucrose or high fructose corn syrup may have uniquely untoward effects compared with other carbohydrates in humans when fed in the context of energy balance. However, while these sugars may contribute to increasing the risk of overweight and obesity and thus to the clinical and metabolic disorders (), the evidence regarding fructose remains limited and conflicting, and no conclusions can be drawn (; ). A large number of studies have been undertaken to determine the extent to which total quantity and nature of dietary carbohydrate influence glycaemic control, insulin resistance and cardiovascular risk factors in people with type II diabetes. While such studies apply principally to diabetes management, it seems reasonable to assume that the data also have some relevance to disease prevention. A meta-analysis of nine studies has been undertaken to compare the effects of high carbohydrate and high monounsaturated fatty acid diets. The overall results provide evidence of higher fasting triglycerides and VLDL cholesterol, slightly lower HDL cholesterol, slightly higher glucose, but not glycated haemoglobin on the high carbohydrate diets, typically providing 55–60% total energy from carbohydrate (). There was considerable variation in the results of the individual studies, partly due to the fact that they were all relatively underpowered and also because the severity of diabetes may influence response to dietary carbohydrate. However, equally important is the fact that the nature of dietary carbohydrate was not clearly specified. It appears that a range of ‘complex carbohydrates’ provided a substantial proportion of total carbohydrate on the high carbohydrate diets. It seems that there may have been a lack of appreciation regarding the different effects of starches and NSPs and indeed the different effects of NSPs from different sources. This is surprising, given that in the late 1980s, it had been clearly shown that high carbohydrate diets were only associated with beneficial effects in terms of glycaemic control and blood lipids when carbohydrate was derived principally from foods rich in soluble forms of dietary fibre, notably pulses, legumes and intact fruits and vegetables (; ; ; ). Higher intakes of cereal (insoluble) fibre were associated with less marked or no benefit in glucose or lipid levels (, ; ). The beneficial effects of soluble forms of dietary fibre derived from fruits and vegetables appear to have been rediscovered more recently in randomized crossover studies in type II diabetes (). Dietary fibre has also been shown to be of benefit in type I diabetes (). Cross-sectional epidemiological data, based on the EURODIAB Complications Study, which included over 2000 patients in 31 European centres, showed an inverse association between dietary fibre intake of HbA and LDL cholesterol (in men only) and a positive association with HDL cholesterol in men and women (). An RCT (parallel design) in type I patients continued for 6 months, confirmed the potential for around 40 g/day dietary fibre (half of the soluble type from legumes, fruits and vegetables) to improve glycaemic control (). Some studies have shown improved glycaemic control when soluble fibres have been fed as supplements to patients with diabetes. However, evidence-based nutritional guidelines of the Nutrition Study Group of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes offer no recommendations regarding supplements of functional foods providing increased dietary fibre. Long-term clinical trials are deemed necessary before recommendations can be considered (). In the 1980s, several RCT with crossover designs demonstrated no adverse effects on glycaemic control, lipids and lipoproteins when diets containing small amounts of sucrose (usually around 50 g) were compared under eucaloric conditions with virtually sucrose-free diets in type I and type II diabetes (; ; ). While there is thus clear evidence for the acceptability of moderate intakes of sucrose for most people with diabetes, there are few data from which to derive acceptable upper limits. For those who are overweight or obese or are markedly insulin resistant, fairly severe restriction may be appropriate. For all others, moderate intakes of free sugars (up to 50 g/day) are acceptable, provided that free sugars do not exceed 10% total energy. There are suggestions that sugar in beverages increases body weight to a greater extent than the same amount of sugar in the solid form (). A number of randomized trials have examined the extent to which diets with a low glycaemic index can improve glycaemic control and cardiovascular risk factors. Several meta-analyses have been published (; ) and the results are broadly comparable. For example, Opperman reported a reduction in HbA of 0.27 (95% confidence intervals: −0.5 to −0.03) when comparing high and low glycaemic index diets. This issue was examined in a Cochrane Systematic Review, which suggested some evidence of an effect of low GI diets compared with high GI diets after 12 weeks. Pooled analysis of studies with a parallel design demonstrated mean HbA levels 0.45% less than the high GI diets (95% confidence intervals: −0.82 to −0.09, =0.02). It is of importance to note that the low GI foods utilized in most of the studies were plant based (for example peas, lentils, beans, pasta, barley, parboiled rice, oats and cereals) as were the high GI foods (potatoes, wheatmeal and white bread and high GI breakfast cereals). The studies did not generally include many of the now widely available manufactured and functional foods, which are not necessarily predominantly plant based. Two RCTs involving people with impaired glucose tolerance consuming ‘western’ diets have examined the extent to which progression of impaired glucose tolerance to type II diabetes can be reduced by intensive lifestyle modification (; ). In both the Finnish and US intervention studies, advice regarding frequent consumption of wholegrain products, vegetables and fruits has been a pivotal component of the advice to achieve weight loss. Other components included recommendations to use monounsaturated oils, soft margarines and low fat meat and milk products, as well as to increase physical activity of moderate intensity. These interventions achieved a nearly 60% reduction of progression from impaired glucose tolerance to type II diabetes. While it is impossible to accurately disentangle the separate contributions of the different components of the intervention package, and weight loss was clearly the major determinant of risk reduction, increased intake of dietary fibre appeared to be independently associated with reduced risk of progression (). A similar study has been conducted in India (). Dietary carbohydrate and diabetes: recommendations The Joint WHO/FAO Expert Consultation on Diet, Nutrition and the Prevention of Chronic Disease () describes the protective effect of NSP as ‘probable’. However, an explanatory note indicates that the level of evidence is graded as ‘probable’ rather than ‘convincing’ because of the apparent discrepancy between the experimental studies, in which it appears that soluble forms of NSP exert benefit in terms of glycaemic control, lipids and lipoproteins, and the prospective cohort studies, which suggest that cereal-derived insoluble forms are protective. The evidence regarding low glycaemic index foods as protective is graded as ‘possible’. The evidence table (Table 9, p 77 TRS 916) leads to the disease-specific recommendation regarding intakes of NSP, which quite appropriately disregards a clear distinction between soluble and insoluble forms and suggests that adequate intakes of NSP or dietary fibre can be achieved through regular consumption of wholegrain cereals, legumes, fruits and vegetables. There is no clear evidence on which to base precise quantities although a minimum intake of 20 g of NSP is recommended. These recommendations appear to be compatible with this update of the relevant literature with two caveats: There appears to be a reasonable body of evidence to suggest a protective effect of wholegrains. The apparently different effects of soluble and insoluble forms of NSP or dietary fibre may result from difficulty in accurately distinguishing between the two forms. Similar approaches to those suggested for reducing disease risk have been recommended for the management of diabetes. The European evidence-based nutritional approaches () to the treatment of diabetes indicate that a wide range of intakes of total carbohydrate (45–60% total energy) is acceptable, provided a high proportion of carbohydrate energy is derived from vegetables, legumes, fruits and wholegrain cereals. This should provide the recommended intake of total dietary fibre (more than 40 g/day or 20 g/1000 kcal/day), about half of which should be soluble. Cereal-based foods should whenever possible be wholegrain and high in fibre. Daily consumption of at least five servings of fibre-rich vegetables or fruits and at least four servings of legumes per week help to provide the minimum requirements for fibre. While a choice anywhere within this range is acceptable for most people, it is acknowledged that some, especially those with marked hypertriglyceridaemia and/or severe insulin resistance, may respond more appropriately to an intake at the lower end of the recommended range. Use of carbohydrate-containing foods with a low glycaemic index is encouraged. While a moderate amount of sugar is acceptable in the context of energy balance, those who are overweight should substantially restrict sugar-containing energy-dense foods. Sugar-containing beverages, while not energy dense, promote overweight and obesity and are best avoided. Finally, it is important to emphasize that the beneficial effects of certain carbohydrate-containing foods have been based principally on the consumption of conventional foods. Evidence for the benefit of manufactured and functional foods containing added dietary fibre or other components of wholegrains, fruits, vegetables and legumes is limited. This applies also to foods with a low glycaemic index. Some foods now marketed as having a low glycaemic index are high in fat and sugar and therefore may not be suitable for people with diabetes, especially those who are overweight. The paper describing the European recommendations () provides a detailed list of references justifying the conclusions summarized here. Nutritional attributes that are likely to protect against diabetes and cardiovascular diseases are remarkably similar as are the principles of nutritional management for those who already have established disease. In summary, they are as follows: A wide range of intakes of carbohydrate containing foods is acceptable. Nature of carbohydrate rather than quantity is principally what matters. Intact fruits, vegetables, legumes and wholegrains are excellent sources of carbohydrate likely to be rich in NSP or dietary fibre and other potentially cardioprotective components. There is no good evidence of benefit when NSP or other components of wholegrains, fruits, vegetables and legumes are added to functional and manufactured foods. Low glycaemic index foods may confer benefits in terms of lowering total cholesterol and improving glycaemic control in people with diabetes. However, it is not clear whether these benefits are independent of the effects of dietary fibre or the fact that low glycaemic index foods tend to have intact plant cell walls. Furthermore, it is uncertain whether functional and manufactured foods with a low glycaemic index confer the same long-term benefits as low glycaemic index predominantly plant-based foods. A low dietary glycaemic load may reduce the risk of type II diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The same caveats as those described above for the therapeutic role of low GI foods apply. Limitations to the use of the glycaemic index and glycaemic load concepts in the clinical setting are further described in the accompanying paper in this series.

3c958072-7fe5-42f1-bce1-4af3a9f644d8,"In the U.S. alone, 20.8 million people have diabetes -- and about a third don't even know it. Find out some information you just may need. Publications International, Ltd. Odds are that you know someone with , possibly even someone who has to take each day to manage the disease. Diabetes is a growing health problem in the United States and has risen about six-fold since 1950, now affecting approximately 20.8 million Americans. About one-third of those 20.8 million do not know that they have the disease. Diabetes-related health care costs total nearly $100 billion per year and are increasing. Diabetes contributes to over 200,000 deaths each year. To understand diabetes, you first need to know about how your body uses a hormone called to handle glucose, a simple that is its main source of energy. In diabetes, something goes wrong in your body so that you do not produce insulin or are not sensitive to it. Therefore, your body produces high levels of blood glucose, which act on many organs to produce the symptoms of the disease. In this article, we will examine this serious disease. We will look at how your body handles glucose. We'll find out what insulin is and what it does, how the lack of insulin or insulin-insensitivity affects your body functions to produce the symptoms of diabetes, how the disease is currently treated and what future treatments are in store for diabetics. The pancreas has many islets that contain insulin-producing beta cells and glucagon-producing alpha cells. Since diabetes is a disease that affects your body's ability to use glucose, let's start by looking at what glucose is and how your body controls it. is a simple that provides energy to all of the in your body. The cells take in glucose from the blood and break it down for energy (some cells, like brain cells and red blood cells, rely solely on glucose for fuel). The glucose in the blood comes from the that you eat. When you eat food, glucose gets absorbed from your intestines and distributed by the bloodstream to all of the cells in your body. Your body tries to keep a constant supply of glucose for your cells by maintaining a constant glucose concentration in your blood -- otherwise, your cells would have more than enough glucose right after a meal and starve in between meals and overnight. So, when you have an oversupply of glucose, your body stores the excess in the liver and by making , long chains of glucose. When glucose is in short supply, your body mobilizes glucose from stored glycogen and/or stimulates you to eat food. The key is to maintain a constant blood-glucose level. To maintain a constant blood-glucose level, your body relies on two hormones produced in the that have opposite actions: and . Insulin and glucagon have opposite effects on liver and other tissues for controlling blood-glucose level is made and secreted by the of the , small islands of endocrine cells in the pancreas. Insulin is a protein hormone that contains 51 . Insulin is required by almost all of the body's , but its major targets are liver cells, and . For these cells, insulin does the following: Stimulates liver and muscle cells to store glucose in glycogen Stimulates to form fats from fatty acids and glycerol Stimulates liver and muscle cells to make proteins from Inhibits the liver and cells from making glucose from intermediate compounds of metabolic pathways () As such, insulin stores nutrients right after a meal by reducing the concentrations of glucose, and amino acids in the bloodstream. So, what happens when you do not eat? In times of fasting, your pancreas releases glucagon so that your body can produce glucose. is another protein hormone that is made and secreted by the of the pancreatic islets. Glucagon acts on the same cells as insulin, but has the opposite effects: Stimulates the liver and muscles to break down stored glycogen () and release the glucose Stimulates gluconeogenesis in the liver and kidneys In contrast to insulin, glucagon mobilizes glucose from stores inside your body and increases the concentrations of glucose in the bloodstream -- otherwise, your blood glucose would fall to dangerously low levels. So how does your body know when to secrete glucagon or insulin? Normally, the levels of insulin and glucagon are counter-balanced in the bloodstream. For example, just after you eat a meal, your body is ready to receive the glucose, fatty acids and amino acids absorbed from the food. The presence of these substances in the intestine stimulates the pancreatic beta cells to release insulin into the blood and inhibit the pancreatic alpha cells from secreting glucagon. The levels of insulin in the blood begin to rise and act on cells (particularly liver, fat and muscle) to absorb the incoming molecules of glucose, fatty acids and amino acids. This action of insulin prevents the blood-glucose concentration (as well as the concentrations of fatty acids and amino acids) from substantially increasing in the bloodstream. In this way, your body maintains a steady blood-glucose concentration in particular. In contrast, when you are between meals or sleeping, your body is essentially starving. Your cells need supplies of glucose from the blood in order to keep going. During these times, slight drops in blood-sugar levels stimulate glucagon secretion from the pancreatic alpha cells and inhibit insulin secretion from the beta cells. Blood-glucagon levels rise. Glucagon acts on liver, muscle and kidney tissue to mobilize glucose from glycogen or to make glucose that gets released into the blood. This action prevents the blood-glucose concentration from falling drastically. As you can see, the interplay between insulin and glucagon secretions throughout the day help to keep your blood-glucose concentration constant, staying at about 90 mg per 100 ml of blood (5 millimolar). At very high concentrations, generally above the maximum levels found in the body, glucagon can act on to break down fats into fatty acids and glycerol, releasing the fatty acids into the bloodstream. However, this is a pharmacological effect, not a physiological one. Now that you know how your body handles glucose with insulin and glucagon, you are ready to understand diabetes. Diabetes is classified into three types: Type 1, Type 2 and gestational diabetes. (also called or ) is caused by a lack of insulin. This type is found in five percent to 10 percent of diabetics and usually occurs in children or adolescents. Type 1 diabetics have an abnormal glucose-tolerance test and little or no insulin in their blood. In Type 1 diabetics, the beta cells of the pancreatic islets are destroyed, possibly by the person's own , genetic or environmental factors. (also called or ) occurs when the body does not respond or can't use its own insulin (). Type 2 occurs in 90 percent to 95 percent of diabetics and usually occurs in adults over the age of 40, most often between the ages of 50 and 60. Type 2 diabetics have an abnormal glucose-tolerance test and higher than normal levels of insulin in their blood. In Type 2 diabetics, the insulin resistance is linked to obesity, but we do not know exactly how this occurs. Some studies suggest that the number of insulin receptors on liver, fat and muscle cells is reduced, while others suggest that the intracellular pathways activated by insulin in these cells are altered. can occur in some and is similar to Type 2 diabetes. Gestational diabetics have an abnormal glucose-tolerance test and slightly higher levels of insulin. During , several hormones partially block the actions of insulin, thereby making the woman less sensitive to her own insulin. She develops a diabetes that can be managed by special diets and/or supplemental injections of insulin. It usually goes away after the baby is delivered. Regardless of the type of diabetes, diabetics exhibit several (but not necessarily all) of the following symptoms: (hands, feet) These symptoms can be understood when we see how insulin deficiency or insulin resistance affects the body's physiology. The name ""diabetes mellitus"" means ""."" It stems from ancient times, when physicians would taste a patient's urine as a part of diagnosis. A Glucose Tolerance Test is a diagnostic test for diabetes. After fasting overnight, you are given a concentrated sugar solution (50 to 100 grams of glucose) to drink, and your blood is sampled periodically over the next several hours to test its glucose levels. Normally, blood glucose does not rise very much and returns to normal within two to three hours. In a diabetic, the blood glucose is usually higher after fasting, rises more after the glucose solution and takes from four to six hours to come down. The high blood glucose in diabetes produces glucose in the urine and frequent urination through effects on the kidneys. Now that you know the symptoms of diabetes -- high blood glucose, excessive hunger and thirst, frequent urination -- let's look at what happens to your body during diabetes. For the purposes of this discussion, let's suppose that you have undiagnosed, and therefore unmanaged, diabetes. Now, let's see how the or affects your body to produce the clinical symptoms and signs of diabetes: Your lack of insulin or insulin resistance directly causes high blood-glucose levels during fasting and after a meal (reduced glucose tolerance). Because your body either does not produce or does not respond to insulin, your cells do not absorb glucose from your bloodstream, which causes you to have high blood-glucose levels. Because your cells have no glucose coming into them from your blood, your body ""thinks"" that it is starving. Your pancreatic alpha cells secrete glucagon, and glucagon levels in your blood rise. Glucagon acts on your liver and to breakdown stored glycogen and release glucose into the blood. Glucagon also act on your liver and to produce and release glucose by gluconeogenesis. Both of these actions of glucagon further raise your blood-glucose levels. High blood glucose causes . High blood-glucose levels increase the amount of glucose filtered by your kidneys. The amount of glucose filtered exceeds the amount that your kidneys can reabsorb. The excess glucose gets lost into the urine and can be detected by glucose test strips (see for details on filtration and reabsorption). High blood glucose causes you to . High blood glucose increases the amount of glucose filtered by your kidneys. Because the filtered load of glucose in your kidneys exceeds the amount that they can reabsorb, glucose remains inside the . The glucose in the tubule retains water, which increases urine flow through the tubule. The increased urine flow causes you to urinate frequently. The lack of insulin or insulin resistance acts on many organs to produce a variety of effects. The high blood glucose and increased urine flow make you . High blood-glucose levels increase the osmotic pressure of your blood and directly stimulate the thirst receptors in your . Your increased urine flow causes you to lose body sodium, which also stimulates your thirst receptors. You are . It's not clear exactly what stimulates your brain's hunger centers, possibly the lack of insulin or high glucagon levels. You lose weight despite the fact that you are eating more frequently. The lack of insulin or insulin-resistance directly stimulates the breakdown of fats in and proteins in , leading to weight loss. Metabolism of fatty acids leads to the production of acidic ketones in the blood (), which can lead to , the smell of acetone on your breath, irregularities in your and central-nervous-system depression, which leads to coma. You feel because your cells cannot absorb glucose, leaving them with nothing to burn for energy. Your because your high blood-glucose levels cause poor blood circulation. High blood glucose increases the osmotic pressure of your blood. The increased osmotic pressure draws water from your tissues, causing them to become dehydrated. The water in your blood gets lost by the kidneys as urine, which decreases your blood volume. The decreased blood volume makes your blood thicker (higher concentration of red blood cells), with a consistency like molasses, and more resistant to flow (poor circulation). Your poor blood circulation causes , changes in vision, slow-healing wounds and frequent infections. High blood glucose or lack of insulin may also depress the immune system. Ultimately, these can lead to gangrene in the limbs and blindness. Fortunately, these consequences can be managed by correcting your high blood glucose through diet, exercise and medications, as we'll discuss next. To monitor blood glucose, there are a number of commercial blood-glucose monitors. Each one involves reacting a test strip with a drop of blood (finger prick). The glucose in the blood reacts chemically with an on the test strip called . The product of the reaction, , combines with another chemical to make the strip turn blue. The device measures the degree of color change to determine and display the concentration of glucose in the blood sample. As of now, there is no cure for diabetes; however, the disease can be treated and managed successfully. The key to treating diabetes is to closely monitor and manage your blood-glucose levels through exercise, diet and medications. The exact treatment regime depends on the type of diabetes. If you have Type 1 diabetes, you lack insulin and must administer it several times each day. Insulin injections are usually timed around meals to cope with the glucose load from digestion. You must monitor your blood-glucose levels several times a day and adjust the amounts of insulin that you inject accordingly. This keeps your blood-glucose concentration from fluctuating wildly. There are some implantable insulin infusion pumps that allow you to press a button and infuse insulin. If you inject too much insulin, you can drive your blood-glucose level well below normal (). This can cause you to feel light-headed and shaky because your brain cells are not receiving enough glucose (mild episodes can be relieved by eating a candy bar or drinking juice). If your blood glucose goes really low, you can lapse into a coma (), which can be life-threatening. In addition to insulin injections, you have to watch your diet to keep track of the carbohydrate and fat contents, and you must exercise frequently. This treatment continues for the rest of your life. If you have Type 2 diabetes, you can usually manage it by reducing your body weight through dieting and . You may have to monitor your blood glucose either daily or just when you visit your doctor. Depending on the severity of your diabetes, you may have to take medication to aid in controlling your blood glucose. Most of the medicines for Type 2 diabetes are oral medications, and their actions fall into the following categories: Stimulating the pancreas to release more insulin to help reduce blood glucose Interfering with the absorption of glucose by the intestine, thereby preventing glucose from entering the bloodstream Supplementing insulin directly in the bloodstream through injections Like a Type 1 diabetic, a Type 2 diabetic is on this treatment for the rest of his or her life. There are a number of alternative treatments for diabetes. These alternative treatments are not widely accepted, mainly due to lack of scientific research on their effectiveness or lack of scientific consensus. Such treatments include: - This is an Eastern medical treatment whereby needles are inserted at various centers in the body to release natural painkillers, which may help in managing painful nerve damage in diabetes. - This psychological technique involves using meditation, relaxation and stress-reduction methods to manage and relieve pain. - Additional chromium in your diet may help your body make a glucose-tolerance factor that helps improve insulin action. However, the scientific information on chromium supplementation in diabetes is insufficient, and no consensus exists. - Diabetics tend to be deficient in magnesium, which can worsen the complications of diabetes, especially Type 2. The exact nature of the relationship between magnesium and diabetes is still under research, and no consensus has been reached. - Vanadium may normalize blood glucose in Type 1 and 2 diabetic animals, but there is not enough information available for humans. This area is currently under research. As with any medical treatment, you should discuss treatment options with your physician. For more information on alternative treatments, see the NIDDK bulletin . One of the most promising developments for future, perhaps permanent, treatments for Type 1 diabetes is . In this technique, islets are removed from the pancreas of a deceased donor and injected through a thin tube (catheter) into the liver of a diabetic patient. After some time, the islet cells attach to new blood vessels and begin releasing insulin. Although early studies have shown some success, rejection of the donor's tissue is a major problem. Research continues in this field because of its great potential to treat diabetes. To learn more about diabetes and related topics, check out the links on the next page.

300d21c8-6ae6-49d4-a393-72dba673a2fc,"Monday, 6 January 2020 In a new study from researchers from UCLA have discovered the process which may explain how develops. The study helps to explain the mechanism by which pancreatic cells secrete high levels of insulin during the early stages of diabetes. A central question in diabetes research is why cells of the pancreas, known as beta cells, initially over-secrete . The prevailing theory was that the body may be in the process of becoming “deaf” to insulin, so beta cells secrete more to compensate. But isolated beta cells still over-secrete insulin, which exposes a gap in that theory. In the new study, researchers set out to understand what other mechanism beyond insulin resistance (that is, the body becoming “deaf” to insulin) and high glucose levels might explain why diabetes develops. The scientists found that a pathway independent of glucose, but sensitive to fatty acids, appears to drive insulin secretion in the early stages of diabetes. The research team, led by Orian Shirihai, a professor of endocrinology and pharmacology at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, used pre-diabetic mice to study the mechanisms by which insulin may be secreted in the absence of glucose. The team found that in beta cells from obese, pre-diabetic animals, a protein known as Cyclophilin D, or CypD, induced a phenomenon known as “proton leak,” and that this leak promoted insulin secretion in the absence of elevated glucose. The mechanism was dependent on fatty acids, which are normally incapable of stimulating insulin secretion in healthy animals. Further, obese mice who lacked the gene for CypD did not secrete excess insulin. The team confirmed the same process was taking place in isolated human pancreas cells: In the presence of fatty acids at levels that would be typical in obese humans, the cells secreted insulin in the absence of elevated glucose. The results suggest new ways to prevent the development of insulin resistance and to treat diabetes, including halting its progression by blocking the proton leak in the beta cell. The study was published in the journal Diabetes.

A cluster of interrelated conditions that greatly increases the risk of developing and heart disease. Metabolic syndrome is commonly characterized by , high blood pressure, obesity, abnormalities in blood levels of lipids (such as and ), increased blood clotting, and a tendency toward . Other conditions that may be associated with the syndrome include (brown or black velvety patches on the back of the neck or elsewhere), hyperuricemia (high blood levels of uric acid), and, in women, . Metabolic syndrome is also known under a variety of other names, sometimes reflecting slight differences in definition. Among these names are insulin resistance syndrome, dysmetabolic syndrome X, cardiovascular metabolic syndrome, and Reaven syndrome (after Stanford University researcher Gerald Reavan, who provided a description of the syndrome in 1988). Some authorities believe that insulin resistance is the primary problem that leads to the other conditions involved in the syndrome. Simply stated, insulin resistance is a condition in which insulin doesn’t work as well as it should. One of insulin’s jobs is to allow glucose in the blood to enter the cells of the body, where it can be used for energy. In people who are insulin resistant, more and more insulin is required to make this happen. Another of insulin’s jobs is to signal the liver to secrete less glucose into the bloodstream. In many insulin-resistant individuals, the liver may continue to secrete a lot of glucose into the bloodstream despite the presence of lots of insulin. Up to one-third of American adults are estimated to have some degree of insulin resistance. Insulin resistance may lead to hyperinsulinemia, or too much insulin in the bloodstream. As the body becomes less and less efficient at using insulin, the pancreas must secrete more and more insulin to keep blood glucose levels in the normal range. Some scientists think that insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia, independent of their effects on blood sugar levels, can promote heart disease through insulin’s effects on blood vessel walls and the blood’s tendency to clot. Other components of metabolic syndrome that increase the risk of heart disease are high blood pressure, obesity, and blood lipid abnormalities, such as increased triglyceride levels, decreased levels of “good” high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and increased levels of small low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol particles. The syndrome was a major concern of treatment guidelines issued in 2005 by the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP). The NCEP was established by the US National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute to help lower the toll in illness and death caused by heart disease. According to the NCEP, metabolic syndrome raises the risk of heart disease as much as cigarette smoking does. A person should be regarded as having metabolic syndrome, say the guidelines, if any three of the following risk factors are present: Abdominal obesity (defined as a waist circumference of over 40 inches in men and over 35 inches in women) Low HDL-cholesterol level (less than 40 mg/dl in men and less than 50 mg/dl in women) The NCEP guidelines give priority to treating the root causes of the metabolic syndrome that are susceptible to change — namely, excessive weight and physical inactivity. (Genetic factors that contribute to the syndrome cannot be reversed.) Lifestyle measures such as diet control and exercising can often reduce insulin resistance and other conditions associated with the syndrome. In some cases drug treatment of specific conditions is recommended to reduce the risk of heart disease. The guidelines accordingly advise treating abnormal blood levels of lipids with lipid-altering drugs, high blood pressure with antihypertensive drugs, and blood clotting with aspirin.

046fe4e7-1c90-4d8b-8865-3ead649c20fc,"Weight loss cuts risk of chronic health conditions Weight loss cuts risk of chronic health conditions Monday, 7 September 2020 Losing weight improves overall health and slashes the risk of developing several chronic health conditions. A major study of more than half a million overweight British adults found that losing weight has a series of significant health benefits. Researchers found that losing 13 percent of your body weight cuts the chance of developing by 42 per cent. It also reduces the chance of going on to develop high blood pressure or sleep apnoea, where your breathing stops and starts as you sleep, by one quarter. People who lost weight also reduced their risk of getting hip and knee arthritis and high cholesterol by one fifth. The huge benefits were seen even when people remained obese, with a body mass index (BMI) over 30, after losing weight. The study, presented at the , was based on GP surgery data for 550,000 UK adults with an average age of 51 gathered over eight years. Experts said the findings were a ‘wake-up call’ that proves the benefits of even modest weight loss in preventing devastating diseases. Britain has one of the highest obesity rates in Western Europe, with two in three adults overweight or obese. Professor Jason Halford, president elect of the European Association for the Study of Obesity which runs the online conference, said: ‘We ignore obesity at our peril. ‘Weight management is clearly one of the best ways to control chronic conditions including . ‘This study shows the importance of investing in prevention to help people lose weight now, rather than waiting for them to develop severe complications ten years down the line.’ The researchers, led by Novo Nordisk, weighed participants four years after their initial measurements were taken, by which time 60,000 had lost at least 10 percent of their body weight. The average weight loss in this group was 13 percent of body weight. Many were still obese, but had lost enough weight for it to have a drastic impact on their health. Scientists compared the risk of developing six obesity-related conditions in the two groups. Study author Dr Christiane Haase said: ‘The difference in the risk of these conditions is striking and indicates that people with obesity could markedly reduce their disease risk through intentional weight loss.’ The research also looked at the impact on heart attack risk, but found no significant reduction. Professor Nick Finer of Novo Nordisk said: ‘Health policy has been much happier to treat diabetes when it develops rather than the obesity which causes it to develop. ‘That is completely illogical. Now we have evidence that if you lose weight you can prevent these diseases – which are expensive to treat – from developing. ‘It should be a wake-up call to healthcare providers and policymakers.’ Professor Finer said of the study’s findings: ‘This is a major health gain that has the potential to add years to your life. We know that obesity is a serious chronic disease, if you have a BMI of 35 or above you are probably losing about seven years of life expectancy.’ Tracy Parker, from the British Heart Foundation, said: ‘To make the healthy choice the easy choice, the Government must urgently put in place the evidence-based measures outlined in its recent obesity strategy, especially a 9pm watershed on TV and online junk food adverts and mandatory calorie labelling.’ Dr Lucy Chambers of Diabetes UK said: ‘We know losing weight isn’t easy, which is why getting support is important. ‘We need Government to urgently review provision of weight management services and take action to address the barriers to accessing them.’ New CSIRO weight loss tool set to motivate Australians to achieve their New Year’s resolutions Switch the type of walking in your routine to stay motivated and active.

952757d0-d15d-4763-b671-35f9afcb53d8,"Insulin and Insulin Resistance — The Ultimate Guide Insulin is an important hormone that controls many bodily processes. However, problems with this hormone are at the heart of many modern health conditions. Insulin resistance, in which your cells stop responding to insulin, is incredibly common. In fact, over 32.2% of the U.S. population may have this condition (). Depending on the diagnostic criteria, this number may rise to 44% in women with obesity and over 80% in some patient groups. About 33% of children and teenagers with obesity may have insulin resistance as well (, , ). Even so, simple lifestyle measures can dramatically improve this condition. This article explains all you need to know about insulin and insulin resistance. Its main role is to regulate the amount of nutrients circulating in your bloodstream. Although insulin is mostly implicated in blood sugar management, it also affects fat and protein metabolism. When you eat a meal that contains , the amount of blood sugar in your bloodstream increases. The cells in your pancreas sense this increase and release insulin into your blood. Insulin then travels around your bloodstream, telling your cells to pick up sugar from your blood. This process results in reduced blood sugar levels. Especially high blood sugar can have toxic effects, causing severe harm and potentially leading to death if untreated. However, cells sometimes stop responding to insulin correctly. This is called insulin resistance. Under this condition, your pancreas produces even more insulin to lower your blood sugar levels. This leads to high insulin levels in your blood, termed hyperinsulinemia. Over time, your cells may become increasingly resistant to insulin, resulting in a rise in both insulin and blood sugar levels. Eventually, your pancreas may become damaged, leading to decreased insulin production. After blood sugar levels exceed a certain threshold, you may be diagnosed with . Insulin resistance is the main cause of this common disease that affects about 9% of people worldwide (). Insulin resistance and insulin sensitivity are two sides of the same coin. If you have insulin resistance, you have . Conversely, if you are sensitive to insulin, you have low insulin resistance. While insulin resistance is harmful to your health, insulin sensitivity is beneficial. Insulin resistance occurs when your cells stop responding to the hormone insulin. This causes higher insulin and blood sugar levels, potentially leading to type 2 diabetes. One is believed to be increased levels of fat in your blood. Numerous studies show that high amounts of free fatty acids in your blood cause cells to stop responding properly to insulin (, , , , , ). The main cause of elevated free fatty acids is eating too many and carrying excess body fat. In fact, overeating, , and obesity are all strongly associated with insulin resistance (, , , ). Visceral fat, the dangerous belly fat that accumulates around your organs, may release many free fatty acids into your blood, as well as inflammatory hormones that drive insulin resistance (, ). Although this condition is more common among those with excess weight, people with low or normal weight are also susceptible (). Other potential causes of insulin resistance include: High intake (from added , not fruit) has been linked to insulin resistance in both rats and humans (, , ). Increased oxidative stress and inflammation in your body may lead to this condition (, ). Physical activity increases insulin sensitivity, while inactivity causes insulin resistance (, ). Evidence suggests that a disruption in the bacterial environment can cause inflammation that exacerbates insulin resistance and other metabolic problems (). What’s more, various genetic and social factors may be contributors. Black, Hispanic, and Asian peoples are at particularly high risk (, , ). The main causes of insulin resistance may be overeating and increased body fat, especially in the belly area. Other factors include high sugar intake, inflammation, inactivity, and genetics. Your health practitioner can use several methods to determine if you’re insulin resistant. For example, high fasting insulin levels are strong indicators of this condition. A fairly accurate test called HOMA-IR estimates insulin resistance from your blood sugar and insulin levels. There are also ways to measure blood sugar control more directly, such as an oral glucose-tolerance test — but this takes several hours. Your risk of insulin resistance increases greatly if you have excess weight or obesity, especially if you have large amounts of . A skin condition called acanthosis nigricans, which involves dark spots on your skin, can likewise indicate insulin resistance. Having low HDL (good) cholesterol levels and high blood are two other markers strongly associated with this condition (). High insulin and blood sugar levels are key symptoms of insulin resistance. Other symptoms include excess belly fat, high blood triglycerides, and low HDL (good) cholesterol levels. Insulin resistance is a hallmark of two very common conditions — metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. Metabolic syndrome is a group of risk factors associated with type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and other problems. It’s sometimes called insulin resistance syndrome, as it’s closely linked to this condition (, ). Its symptoms include high blood triglycerides, blood pressure, belly fat, and blood sugar, as well as low HDL (good) cholesterol levels (). You may be able to prevent metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes by stopping the development of insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is linked to metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes, which are among the world’s biggest health problems. Insulin resistance is strongly associated with heart disease, which is the leading cause of death across the globe (). In fact, people with insulin resistance or metabolic syndrome have up to a 93% greater risk of (). Many other illnesses, including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), Alzheimer’s disease, and , are linked to insulin resistance as well (, , , ).

Include nuts and fatty fish. These fats may reduce insulin resistance, as well as lower blood triglycerides (, ). may enhance insulin sensitivity and reduce blood sugar. Magnesium supplements may be helpful, too (, ). Some evidence suggests that poor sleep causes insulin resistance, so should help (). Try to manage your stress levels if you easily get overwhelmed. Meditation may be particularly helpful (, ). High levels of iron in your blood are linked to insulin resistance. For men and postmenopausal women, donating blood may improve insulin sensitivity (, , ). Following may improve insulin sensitivity (). Most of the habits on this list also happen to be associated with good health, a long life, and protection against disease. That said, it’s best to consult your health practitioner about your options, as various medical treatments can be effective as well. Insulin resistance may be reduced or even reversed with simple lifestyle measures, such as exercise, healthy eating, and stress management. Notably, may fight metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes — and this is partly mediated by reduced insulin resistance (, , , , ). However, when carb intake is very low, such as on a , your body may induce an insulin-resistant state to spare blood sugar for your brain. This is termed physiological insulin resistance and is not harmful (). Low-carb diets reduce the harmful insulin resistance linked to metabolic disease, though they may induce a harmless type of insulin resistance that spares blood sugar for your brain. Insulin resistance may be one of the key drivers of many — if not most — of today’s chronic diseases.

Medical Editor: Insulin is a hormone that is produced by the beta cells found in the pancreas. Insulin is an important hormone that has many actions within the body including those involved in metabolism (control) of carbohydrates (sugars and starches), (), and proteins. When insulin resistance develops, tissues in the body – particularly muscle and fat tissues- do not respond appropriately to insulin. In fact, more insulin is needed to elicit the same response from these tissues. As a result, higher levels of insulin are needed in order for insulin to continue to exert its physiologic effect. There are many causes of insulin resistance, including a strong association with genetics (an inherited component). In addition, insulin resistance is often associated with the following conditions: Aside from the well known association of insulin resistance with the , abdominal obesity, elevated , and ; there are several other medical conditions that are associated with insulin resistance specifically.

High levels of male hormones in women, which are produced by the ovaries, can been seen in insulin resistance and may play a role in PCOS as described above. The high levels of insulin seen in insulin resistance causes the abnormal ovarian hormone production of testosterone and other hormones. There may be growth effects in insulin resistance due to the high levels of circulating insulin that may be present. While insulin's effects on glucose metabolism may be impaired, its effects on other mechanisms may be intact (or at least less impaired). Insulin can exert effects on growth, through a mediator known as insulin- like growth factor -1. Individuals may have actual linear growth in height and a noticeable coarsening of features. The increased incidence of skin tags mentioned above may be due to this mechanism as well. An individual should consider being evaluated for insulin resistance if they: are with a body mass index (BMI) more than 25, are a man with a waist measurement of more than 40 inches or a woman with a waist more than 35 inches, are Latino, African American, Native American, or Asian American, have close blood-related family members with , , or arteriosclerosis, have , high , low or arteriosclerosis (for example, have other components of the metabolic syndrome), A physician can identify individuals who are likely to have insulin resistance with a detailed patient history, physical examination, and laboratory testing. In general clinical practice, glucose levels in conjunction with fasting insulin levels provide the physician with information as to whether insulin resistance is present, or not present, in patients without . A firm diagnosis cannot be made simply based on this, since the lab techniques for measuring insulin can vary, and there is no absolute value used for the definition. However, an insulin level above the upper quartile in the fasting state in someone without diabetes is considered abnormal. In addition, an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) can be used to detect insulin resistance and is more sensitive for detecting milder/earlier disease. It involves drinking a known amount of simple and measuring blood glucose and insulin levels at baseline as well as one and two (and sometimes three) hours after drinking. Lifestyle changes are important in the treatment of insulin resistance, namely, reducing and carbohydrate intake. Medical treatment includes a number of different medications to complement lifestyle changes. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle is the cornerstone to managing insulin resistance, and lifestyle change begins at home. By altering the , particularly the carbohydrates in the diet, the body can decrease the amount of insulin released by the pancreas. Carbohydrates are absorbed into the body after they are broken up into their component sugars. Some carbohydrates are broken up and absorbed faster than others and are referred to as having a high glycemic index. These carbohydrates increase the blood glucose level more rapidly and require the secretion of more insulin to control the level of glucose in the blood. Several studies have shown that and (without ) increase the rate at which glucose in the blood is taken up by muscle cells as a result of improved sensitivity of the cells to insulin. Medical treatment can be used as an adjunct to lifestyle modification and should be discussed as an option with the patient's physician. () is a medication used to treat diabetes. It has two mechanisms of action that help to control blood glucose levels. It prevents the liver from releasing glucose into the blood, and it increases the sensitivity of muscle and fat cells to insulin so that they remove more glucose from the blood. Because of these actions, metformin effectively reduces blood insulin levels. Metformin is a reasonably safe medication when used as indicated. Although there are gastrointestinal side effects with metformin, the drug usually is well-tolerated. Interestingly, a study known as the DPP study evaluated at the effects of metformin in addition to diet and on the in insulin resistance. Metformin reduced the development of diabetes by 31%. () is another medication that can be used for treatment of insulin resistance. It works in the to slow the absorption of sugars, and this effect can reduce the need for insulin after meals. The Study to Prevent Mellitus trial (also known as the STOP NIDDM Trial), treated individuals with insulin resistance with acarbose and found that that acarbose reduced the development of diabetes by 25%. Other medications in a class of drugs called thiazolidinediones, for example, (), (), also increase sensitivity to insulin. At this time, however, these medications are not routinely used, in part because of liver toxicity that requires monitoring of blood liver tests. Avandia, however, has been associated with an increased risk of heart attack and , and experts have debated the severity of these concerns since the risk was first reported. On September 23, 2010, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced that it will significantly restrict the use of the diabetes drug rosiglitazone (Avandia) to patients with type 2 diabetes who cannot control their diabetes on other medications such as pioglitazone (Actos). These new restrictions are in response to data that suggest an elevated risk of cardiovascular events, such as heart attack and , in patients treated with Avandia. Individuals with insulin resistance should follow-up with their physician on a routine basis to assure optimal lifestyle changes, and to monitor any side effects of medications prescribed. While there is a significant genetic component to the development of insulin resistance, many things can be done to prevent its onset and progression. Lifestyle changes (for example, diet and ) clearly are important, and education about these changes needs to be directed to groups at risk for diabetes. is on the rise in the United States as well as other countries, and changes need to be made in school cafeterias and in the food choices offered to children and teens at home. Medications have been shown to delay the progression of insulin resistance to overt type 2 diabetes. To date, no study has shown the ability to prevent metabolic syndrome in a high-risk population. It is only in recent years that insulin resistance has been gaining importance both its own right and as a contributor to the metabolic syndrome. It now appears that intervention can delay the onset of overt diabetes. With lifestyle modification and medication if needed, those with insulin resistance can have some control over their disease progression. Insulin resistance and pre-diabetes usually have no symptoms. People may have one or both conditions for several years without noticing anything. People with a severe form of insulin resistance may have dark patches of skin, usually on the back of the neck. Sometimes people have a dark ring around their neck. Other possible sites for dark patches include elbows, knees, knuckles, and armpits. This condition is called acanthosis nigricans.

But most Australians don't think diabetes is serious, don't know if they are at risk, and don't think they'll get it. Diabetes is too serious to ignore. This is the hard-hitting message behind the image of a leg amputation – one of the most dreadful human costs of diabetes. When Anna Moresby was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes in 1940, she received the grim prediction that she wouldn’t live to see her 30th birthday. But Anna has defied all odds and is now the first Victorian female to reach the amazing milestone of living with diabetes for 80 years.In this spirit, Diabetes Victoria is launching a new awareness campaign with the theme ‘80 reasons to celebrate’ for National Diabetes Week 2020 (from Sunday 12 to Saturday 18 July), honouring Anna Moresby’s remarkable achievement of living with diabetes for 80 years.

But what a lot of people don’t realise is that type 2 diabetes is largely preventable. For decades, we’ve been told to wear seatbelts and helmets to reduce fatalities on our roads, and while out on the water we are required to wear a lifejacket.  But when it comes to type 2 diabetes we’re missing the mark.    View the campaign website 2011: 'Diabetes: Don't be blind to the risks' campaign for National Diabetes Week Diabetes Australia and Vision 2020 have joined forces for a National Diabetes Week campaign.

The diabetes epidemic is growing by a staggering 275 new cases every day and we have 1 million Australians registered on the National Diabetes Services Scheme.

But most Australians don't think diabetes is serious, don't know if they are at risk, and don't think they'll get it. Diabetes is too serious to ignore. This is the hard-hitting message behind the image of a leg amputation – one of the most dreadful human costs of diabetes.

As is true with many medical conditions, genetics and the environment both play important roles in the development of the metabolic syndrome. Genetic factors influence each individual component of the syndrome, and the syndrome itself. A family history that includes , , and early greatly increases the chance that an individual will develop the metabolic syndrome. Environmental issues such as low activity level, sedentary lifestyle, and progressive weight gain also contribute significantly to the risk of developing the metabolic syndrome. Obesity is likely the greatest risk factor for metabolic syndrome; however other risk factors of concern include: Symptoms depend on which components of the syndrome are present. typically produces no symptoms but may present with blurred vision and . Insulin resistance may be associated with difficulty losing weight and a sense of (feeling of ). In its extreme, metabolic syndrome can present with symptoms related to or . When Should I Seek Medical Care for Metabolic Syndrome? If you have any of the risk factors associated with metabolic syndrome, or if you are at risk for any of the components of metabolic syndrome, you should discuss this with your health care practitioner. Similarly, if you have a strong family history of , , early cardiac death, obesity and/or , you should seek medical advice. What Are the Exams and Tests for Metabolic Syndrome? A detailed history and physical examination should be performed. Each individual component of the syndrome should be evaluated distinctly. All of the following exams or tests may be warranted: assessment by fasting , insulin level, and oral glucose tolerance testing Cardiac risk factors can be assessed to estimate cardiovascular risk. These may include lipid levels, electrocardiograms, testing, angiograms, and more detailed assessments if necessary. Metabolic syndrome increases a person's risk of heart disease and diabetes. Treatment for metabolic syndrome ranges from changes in diet and lifestyle to adminstering -lowering and medications. Goals are to lower blood pressure and control body weight. Lifestyle modification is the preferred treatment of metabolic syndrome. Weight reduction usually requires a specifically tailored multifaceted program for the patient that includes diet and . Medications may be useful in some instances. As noted above, most people who have metabolic syndrome are overweight and lead a sedentary lifestyle. A detailed discussion of therapeutic diets and the pros and cons of each diet is beyond the scope of this article. However, one diet that is palatable and easily sustained and has shown benefit is the . The Mediterranean diet is rich in olive oil (a ""good fat"") and contains a reasonable and sustainable amount of protein and carbohydrates. Some studies have suggested that when compared to a low fat diet, people on the Mediterranean diet have had a greater decrease in body weight, greater improvements in and levels, and improvement in other markers of heart disease; all of which are important in evaluating and treating metabolic syndrome. A regular and consistent program is also an important lifestyle modification that can be accomplished at home or a gym. Thirty minutes of exercise five days a week is a reasonable start, providing there are no medical contraindications to exercise. (It is prudent to consult your physician prior to starting any exercise program.) Lowering blood pressure and cholesterol levels, along with increasing insulin sensitivity, are beneficial effects of a regular consistent exercise program, regardless of whether is achieved. Thus, exercise in still a helpful tool in treating metabolic syndrome. What Is the Medical Treatment for Metabolic Syndrome? Medical management should be aimed at targeting the components of metabolic syndrome that are present. If a patient with metabolic syndrome has already had a , their LDL (""bad"") cholesterol should be reduced to a level below 70mg/dl. Lifestyle modifications and medications may both be necessary to achieve this desired reduction. A person with diabetes has a heart attack risk equivalent to that of someone who has already a heart attack, and should be treated the same as a patient who has had a heart attack. What remains controversial is whether metabolic syndrome should be considered sufficient to raise the risk to this degree. If a patient has metabolic syndrome, a detailed discussion about therapy to reduce blood lipid levels is necessary between the patient and the doctor, as each individual case is unique. Goals for lowering blood pressure are generally set lower than 130/80. In addition to lowering blood pressure, some blood pressure medications have other effects on the body. For example, ACE inhibitors (a class of blood pressure drugs) has been found to reduce the levels of insulin resistance and thus may slow the development of . This is an important consideration when discussing the choice of blood pressure drugs for a patient with metabolic syndrome. While a healthy body weight should also be a goal of treatment, it is important to remember that a reduction in weight can have a dramatic benefit on lowering blood pressure and cholesterol levels and increasing insulin sensitivity. What Medications Are Used to Treat Metabolic Syndrome? Medications should be tailored to target the specific components of the metabolic syndrome that are present in the patient. Cholesterol-lowering drug classes include and fibrates. Blood pressure medications of various classes can be used, with consideration of coexisting diseases or conditions. may be considered to reduce cardiac risk, along with such as fish oils. (), usually used to treat type 2 diabetes, also has been found to help prevent the onset of diabetes in people with metabolic syndrome. Many patients who have insulin resistance associated with metabolic syndrome opt for metformin therapy. However, there are currently no established guidelines on treating metabolic syndrome patients with metformin if they do not have overt diabetes. Routine follow-up is recommended for patients with metabolic syndrome, both to address the treatment of the components present, as well as to monitor for the development of heart disease or associated problems. Prevention of metabolic syndrome in its entirety may not be possible in all cases, given the genetic contribution. However, there are ways to prevent worsening of the individual components. A consistent exercise routine: , bicycling, swimming, , etc. Find an exercise buddy if you can't seem to be consistent with the routine. Take a walk during your work break, even if it is just around the building. Evaluate what you feed your children. Are they eating healthy as well? is rising dramatically in the United States. Urge children to go outside and play to get some exercise. It all adds up. Preventing metabolic syndrome really means having a healthy sustainable lifestyle. While these treatment options can be addressed at a doctor's office, implementation really has to occur in the real world. In addition to medications, an active attempt to choose healthier foods and exercising regularly is necessary. With sincere effort, we can alter the course of the syndrome in a positive way. Metabolic syndrome is a group of risk factors that come together in a single individual. Specifically, metabolic syndrome is a cluster of the following: high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high cholesterol levels, and belly fat - all of which increase the risk of heart disease and diabetes. Obviously, having any one of these risk factors isn't good. But when they're combined, they set the stage for grave problems. These risk factors double your risk of blood vessel disease and heart disease, which can lead to heart attacks and strokes. These risk factors increase your risk of diabetes by 5 times.

Michael Ozner, MD, explains how this diet works to help you live a longer and healthier life. Scientifically reviewed by: Dr. Gary Gonzalez, MD, on January 2021. Q: I have been following the Miami Mediterranean diet to reduce my risk of heart disease. I read somewhere that this diet may be helpful for those with high blood sugar and diabetes. Can you tell me more about this? A: I’m glad to hear that you’re following the healthy Miami Mediterranean diet. In my practice, I’ve found that patients who adopt the diet, along with lifestyle changes such as exercise and stress reduction, are healthier and happier. Studies have long proven that a Mediterranean-type diet reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease, and it also has been linked to protection against some cancers. But now there’s more good news: a new study published in the British Medical Journal shows that eating a traditional Mediterranean diet regularly may reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes by as much as 83%!1 The results of this study are astonishing. Previous research has shown the benefits of a Mediterranean-type diet for reducing insulin resistance. But earlier studies were not as large as this new one which, for four-and-a-half years, followed 13,380 Spanish university graduates who had no history of diabetes. At the study’s conclusion, it was found that the participants who most strictly adhered to the diet had a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes. And from that large population, only 33 cases of type 2 diabetes were documented. How well one adheres to a Mediterranean-type diet appears to be the real key to successfully lowering the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, and even preventing it. In addition to closely monitoring the types of foods that study participants ate, researchers rated each person on how well they adhered to the diet. Those with the highest adherence to the diet reduced their risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 83% over those with the lowest adherence. And, according to the scale of 1 to 10 used to measure adherence, researchers found that a mere two-point increase on the adherence scale correlated to a 35% reduction in diabetes risk. Here’s an interesting fact: Among those with better adherence to the diet were people with the greatest number of risk factors for developing type 2 diabetes. These were people who were expected to have a higher incidence of the disease, yet they, too, showed lower risk. This suggests that a Mediterranean-type diet has substantial potential for type 2 diabetes prevention. The study’s findings are truly good news because diabetes is a major problem in the United States and worldwide. Type 2 diabetes has significantly increased in industrialized countries due to the toxic Western diet and lifestyle and the population’s expanding girth. According to the American Diabetes Association, nearly 24 million adults and children in the US have diabetes. The disease contributed to approximately 224,000 deaths in 2002—and that number could be low, as studies have shown that diabetes is generally under-reported on death certificates.2 Regularly consuming a Mediterranean-type diet can be a big step toward bringing this epidemic under control. Diabetes is also a major drain on the health care system in both dollars and resources. The costs of treating the disease itself and what it leads to—heart attacks, strokes, hospitalization—are staggering and can financially cripple or bankrupt families. We have a health care crisis in America and the diabetes epidemic is definitely a major contributor to it. I’m sure you’re wondering how the Mediterranean diet helps prevent and control diabetes. I’ll explain, but first I’ll discuss what diabetes is, what causes it, and why reducing the risk of developing the disease is so important. Understanding Diabetes Diabetes is a chronic, progressive disease in which insulin—a hormone that converts sugar, starches, and other foods into energy—is not properly produced or utilized in the body. Medically, it is defined as fasting blood sugar in excess of 125 mg/dL. There are several types of diabetes. Type 1, in which the body fails to produce insulin, is found mainly in childhood. The causes are theorized to be autoimmune or viral. Type 2 diabetes is the most common and is largely the result of lifestyle choices, primarily obesity, lack of exercise, and the consumption of unhealthy foods. It used to be called adult-onset diabetes, but now it is called type 2 diabetes, because unfortunately, adolescents are also getting the disease in increasing numbers. The third type is known as gestational diabetes, which women sometimes develop during pregnancy. Usually this type goes away after pregnancy; however, roughly 50% of women with gestational diabetes will develop type 2 diabetes within five years of giving birth. I’ll focus my discussion on type 2 diabetes, since it is the subject of this new study. What is the mechanism of type 2 diabetes? Digestion converts sugars in food into glucose, a form of sugar that is the body’s primary fuel. Insulin, which is a hormone produced and released by the beta cells of the pancreas, enables glucose to pass from the bloodstream into the body’s cells to be used for the body’s energy requirements. Unused glucose is stored in liver and muscle cells as glycogen. As glucose levels in the body decrease, glycogen converts back to glucose to be used as fuel when necessary. However, if insulin resistance develops, normal amounts of insulin no longer produce a normal insulin response. Glucose won’t be absorbed as well by the cells that need it, and it won’t be stored properly in the liver and muscles. The level of glucose in the blood remains high. The pancreas responds by trying to produce more insulin, but this can eventually overtax the beta cells, which can’t keep up with the process of producing more insulin to handle the excess glucose. The beta cells themselves can become dysfunctional, producing less insulin (insulin deficiency) while blood glucose levels continue to rise. This can eventually lead to beta cell apoptosis, or programmed cell death. Studies have shown that obesity and the highly processed American diet leads to a state of chronic low-grade inflammation. Inflammatory proteins interfere with insulin receptors, leading to insulin resistance. Obesity or lifestyle choices that increase inflammation in the body help create the conditions that favor the development of type 2 diabetes. Diabetes can cause serious, long-term complications such as kidney disease, neuropathy, and blindness. It also significantly increases the risk of death from cardiovascular disease, heart attack, and stroke. A major study published in 1998, the Finnish East West Trial, showed that if you have type 2 diabetes, you actually have the same risk of heart attack as someone who has already had a heart attack.3 That’s why diabetes is considered a coronary heart disease risk equivalent. Even worse, the risk of cardiovascular disease can even be raised by a pre-diabetes condition associated with insulin resistance called impaired fasting glucose.4 This is signaled by a blood sugar measurement greater than 100 mg/dL— generally 100-125 mg/dL—and it is a warning sign of the impending development of diabetes. Treatment for type 2 diabetes typically involves medication to lower blood sugar. There are many drugs available, including insulin and drugs that are costly and have side effects. One particular antidiabetic drug called rosiglitazone (Avandia®) has been in the news recently for increasing the risk of heart attack.5 Considering the complications and dangers of diabetes and the risks of some of the drug treatments, it truly is great news to learn that you can lower your risk of developing the disease by 83% in a completely natural way, without taking medication.1 I want to stress, however, that I’m not saying medications should not be used, as there are situations where medication is appropriate. But medication shouldn’t be used as a substitute for lifestyle changes. People can be their own worst enemy and want to use medication just so they can abuse lifestyle. They often reason that if they take insulin or pills, it’s a license to continue eating the wrong foods or to overeat. This is never the way to treat type 2 diabetes. The best use of medication is to take it in addition to making the proper lifestyle changes. The hope is that lifestyle changes will improve the condition enough so that one is no longer labeled as diabetic, so that it is possible to stop taking the medication. “A new study published in the British Medical Journal shows that eating a traditional Mediterranean diet regularly may reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes by as much as 83%!” How Does the Miami Mediterranean Diet Fight Diabetes? Adherence to a Mediterranean-type diet, along with exercise, is a proven approach to lowering your risk of developing type 2 diabetes. All you need is healthy food, a knife and fork, and a good pair of walking shoes. In my book, The Miami Mediterranean Diet, you can read all the specifics of a Mediterranean diet that consists of fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, olive oil, cold water fish, red wine, nuts, and beans. If you’ve been regularly following the diet, I’m sure you’ve made use of the book’s hundreds of delicious recipes and suggested meal plans that can decrease your risk of developing type 2 diabetes, as well as hypertension and cardiovascular disease. The Miami Mediterranean diet works in two ways to lower the risk of diabetes by: 1) including healthy foods that fight the causes of diabetes, and 2) eliminating toxic foods that increase the risks of the disease. The diet limits refined sugar, which clearly increases the risk of high blood glucose and diabetes. The worst player that is completely absent from the diet is high-fructose corn syrup, which increases inflammation in the body. Unfortunately, high-fructose corn syrup is now pervasive in the standard American diet. It is used as a preservative and to sweeten foods and drinks like sodas. The food industry has had a love affair with high-fructose corn syrup for decades because it is cheap and it allows foods to be preserved on the shelf. But we’ve paid a price for that, as high-fructose corn syrup increases inflammation in the body, as well as the amount of the lipoprotein called very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), which is a major transporter of triglycerides.6 When high-fructose corn syrup is consumed, blood sugar goes directly to the liver instead of to muscle and fat cells. The liver utilizes the sugar to produce triglycerides. There simply aren’t any health benefits to be gained from high-fructose corn syrup like there would be if you ate a piece of fresh fruit such as an apple. Many physicians, myself included, believe that the significant increase in high-fructose corn syrup in the American diet has greatly contributed to the epidemic of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.7,8 Red meat and trans fats are two more unhealthy culprits that you will not find in the Miami Mediterranean diet. Both can increase inflammation in the body. The Harvard Nurses’ Health Study showed that even a slight increase in the amount of dietary trans fat translated into a significant increase in the development of type 2 diabetes.9 Trans fats are the biggest food processing disaster in history. They’ve been banned in some countries for years, and only now are we waking up in this country to the point where trans fats are being banned in some areas. Foods included in the Miami Mediterranean diet fight inflammation and thus reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.10 Olive oil, particularly extra-virgin, cold-pressed olive oil, has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties and has been shown in several trials to protect against insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome. Indices of insulin resistance were significantly improved in people following a Mediterranean-type diet that included moderate consumption of olive oil and cold water fish. Cold water fish like salmon, sardines, and trout bring omega-3 fatty acids to the table, which exert anti-inflammatory effects. I regularly recommend moderate consumption of cold water fish or fish oil supplements for my patients who are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Red wine, consumed in moderation, and other components of the diet such as whole grains and fresh fruits and vegetables have all been shown in various studies to lower blood sugar and decrease insulin resistance. Weight management is an important component of a diabetes prevention program, because obesity contributes to the development of type 2 diabetes. Fat cells secrete inflammatory proteins that interfere with insulin receptors, leading to insulin resistance and pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction.11 A Mediterranean-type diet, coupled with a program of regular exercise, supports healthy weight loss and weight management. When you consider the lifestyle of people in the Mediterranean region, you see that they eat healthy foods, avoiding highly processed foods that pack on the pounds and are found too often in the American diet. They are active during the day, walking as a matter of routine, and doing other activities like working in the garden. So along with the diet, be sure to incorporate activity into your daily life. Walking is the easiest way to do this. And a good walk after a delicious Mediterranean-style meal is a perfect way to reduce the stresses in your life. Diabetes can be prevented and even reversed by following a Mediterranean-type diet and incorporating exercise into your lifestyle. I saw in my own practice that patients who followed these recommendations had less chance of developing type 2 diabetes. In fact, I have had patients with type 2 diabetes who went on the Miami Mediterranean diet and began a walking program see their blood sugar return to normal. Hippocrates said, “Let food be your medicine.” He was right all those years ago. By following the Miami Mediterranean diet, you are right on track for reducing your risk of both cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes.

Read how to control your blood sugar through diet modification, nutritional supplements, weight management, and physical exercise. Scientifically reviewed by: Dr. Gary Gonzalez, MD, on January 2021. Written By Lyle MacWilliam, BSc, MSc, FP. Almost everyone knows someone who has diabetes. An estimated 18.2 million Americans and 2 million Canadians, over 6% of each nation’s population, have been diagnosed with diabetes.1,2 Millions more have the disease and are unaware of it. The World Health Organization estimates that by 2025, the number of people with diabetes will reach 300 million—a staggering 122% increase in less than 30 years.3 At the dawn of the third millennium and 83 years after the discovery of insulin, “we are still grappling with the enormous complexity of a disease process in which almost every aspect of the body’s metabolism goes awry.”4 Diabetes is now recognized as the sixth leading cause of death and disability in the US. Its associated health care costs have spiked dramatically, more than doubling from $44 billion to $92 billion from 1997 to 2002. In Canada, diabetes treatment now consumes 15% of the national health care budget. Today, diabetes accounts for 28% of all new cases of kidney disease in Canada, and is a primary cause of adult blindness, non-trauma-related limb amputations, and major cardiovascular events.5 Source: National Diabetes Clearinghouse. The disease exhibits a strong ethnic bias: Native Americans, Hispanic-Latino Americans, and African-Americans show an increased prevalence compared to the non-Hispanic white population. Unknown in Canada’s aboriginal community until recently, type II diabetes has undergone exponential growth. Within the next two decades, 27% of Canada’s First Nations (native) peoples are expected to develop the disease.5 Epidemiological data from elsewhere mirror the North American situation. Within the next 30 years, diabetes is projected to soar by almost 50% in Great Britain, 72-78% in New Zealand and Australia, and a staggering 184% in Mexico.6 Diabetes is often misunderstood as a simple sugar imbalance that can be readily corrected through medical intervention. In truth, it is a complex metabolic disorder in which a confluence of social, behavioral, dietary, and lifestyle factors unmask an underlying genetic susceptibility. The disease has serious implications for vision, cardiovascular health, and kidney and neural functions. Its expression largely depends on lifestyle issues, including diet, weight management, and physical exercise—a multifaceted combination of factors that makes treatment complex and challenging. The Driver: Type II Diabetes The predominant form of diabetes is type II or non-insulin-dependent diabetes, a disease highly correlated with family history, physical inactivity, obesity, and ethnicity. Traditionally associated with middle age, the incidence of type II diabetes among younger adults and children is rising dramatically. More common in women, especially those with a history of gestational (pregnancy-related) diabetes, its prevalence in America has tripled in the last 30 years. While increasing across all age and ethnic groups, its ascendance among children and adolescents is most worrisome. Over 90% of diabetics are type II, and it is the rapid increase in this form of the disease that is propelling the global increase in all diabetes cases. While diabetes exhibits a strong hereditary component, its rate of increase is too great to be a consequence of increased gene frequency. Instead, evidence points toward the combined influences of lifestyle, dietary, and environmental factors.7 An Emerging Epidemic: Diabetes and Children Virtually unknown in children until recently, type II diabetes is now appearing with alarming regularity in overweight and sedentary young people. During the last three decades, the number of overweight children in the US has more than doubled. With this has come a dramatic rise in type II diabetes. In major US urban centers, the percentage of children with newly diagnosed type II diabetes has ballooned from less than 5% in 1994 to 30-50% in recent years.8 Obesity is a hallmark of the disease. A predisposition toward visceral obesity (deposition of abdominal fat) is associated with increased insulin resistance and contributes to its early onset.9 This may explain why 85% of American children who develop type II diabetes are overweight or obese at the time of diagnosis. According to Dr. Arlan Rosenbloom, chair of the American Diabetes Association Consensus Panel, “Type II diabetes in children is an emerging epidemic.” Insulin Resistance: the Silent Stalker Syndrome X is the dark force behind type II diabetes. Also known as metabolic syndrome, it is a preclinical stage of the disease, believed to affect up to 25% of North American adults. A constellation of metabolic changes that progress silently over a period of years, Syndrome X is characterized by increased resistance to insulin, the regulatory hormone that suppresses hepatic (liver) glucose output and removes excess glucose from the blood. Diagram of the homeostatic (insulin-glucagon) system. View enlarged image The onset of insulin resistance is characterized by a host of related symptoms, including: hypertension (high blood pressure) elevated blood triglycerides (fats) elevated LDL (“bad”) cholesterol reduced HDL (“good”) cholesterol accelerated hardening of the arteries proliferation of cells in the arterial walls development of abdominal obesity glycosylation (cross-linking of fats and proteins with glucose) hyperinsulinemia (high-blood insulin levels). The syndrome is particularly alarming in children and adolescents because the changes, which in adults are usually spread over a number of years, are compressed into a few short years in young teens.10 The longer a person has the disease, the greater the likelihood of developing long-term disabilities. Unfortunately, physicians are now seeing more young people prematurely develop these life-threatening complications. The prognosis is not encouraging: approximately one-third to one-half of those diagnosed with insulin resistance will develop diabetes. Of those, two-thirds will eventually die of cardiovascular complications. Compared to non-diabetics, adult diabetics are almost twice as likely to have asthma, three times more likely to have hypertension and heart disease, and four times more likely to suffer a stroke.11 Clearly, early detection of the disease is paramount. A Delicate Balance Insulin is produced by highly specialized beta cells in the pancreas, a lobular gland located behind the stomach. The hormone is secreted into the blood in response to elevated blood-sugar levels. Insulin helps the body utilize blood sugar by binding to specialized receptor sites on the cellular surfaces, much like a key fits into a lock. Insulin “unlocks” the receptor and glucose (a molecule too large to pass through) is transported into the cell. Once inside, glucose is used for cellular fuel, and any excess is stored as glycogen (a form of animal starch) or converted to glycerol for the formation of fat. When blood sugar levels are low, or during times of stress, liver glycogen stores are quickly converted back to glucose by the action of glucagon, another pancreatic hormone. Glucagon also encourages the breakdown of fat in adipose tissue to glycerol and fatty acids. The liver reconverts these to glucose, releasing it into the blood. Through this intricate balancing act, insulin and glucagon perform a central role in regulating the body’s blood-sugar level. Rising insulin resistance disrupts this balance when the normal levels of insulin no longer unlock the cellular “doors.” The beta cells of the pancreas, in a futile attempt to restore homeostasis, shift into “overdrive” and begin pumping out ever-increasing amounts of insulin. Chronically high levels of insulin further “desensitize” the cellular receptors, leading to even greater insulin resistance. A vicious and damaging cycle ensues—the genesis of type II diabetes. Photomicrograph of human pancreas magnified 125x. The Mechanism of Onset What defies explanation is what causes insulin resistance in the first place. We know that virtually everyone who develops type II diabetes starts with insulin resistance. We also know that the risk of developing type II diabetes is strongly correlated with central body obesity and the ectopic (abnormal) accumulation of fat. It appears that insulin resistance may not be determined so much by the amount of body fat as by where the fat is located.4 In fact, one of the best predictive markers for insulin resistance is excess body weight, in particular weight around the waist. McGarry presents a compelling case that the ectopic accumulation of fat in muscle and other peripheral tissues is intimately involved with the onset of insulin resistance and the gradual collapse of pancreatic beta cell function.4 Insulin sensitivity can fall dramatically without the appearance of diabetes, as long as the pancreatic beta cells compensate. It is their inevitable demise (possibly due to lipotoxicity) that leads to increased hyperglycemia, a further rise in blood lipids, and an ever-greater accumulation of fat in the muscle cell. Increasing hyperlipidemia (high blood lipids) in turn exacerbates insulin resistance and degrades liver function. According to McGarry, in the progression from being overweight to being obese, the liver becomes resistant to insulin and the hormone’s ability to suppress hepatic (liver) glucose production. “Under these conditions, the hyperinsulinemia turns the liver into a ‘fat-producing factory’ with all of its negative downstream effects.”4 Once established, these disturbances in lipid metabolism are devastating to blood sugar balance and weight management. Accel-eration of the cycle and eventual collapse of pancreatic insulin production herald the appearance of diabetes. The answer to how these metabolic derangements begin may lie in the “thrifty gene hypothesis,” which postulates the presence of a genetic factor designed to promote extra fat deposition.12 Speculation also suggests a defect in the leptin-signaling system, a metabolic pathway that appears to mediate fatty acid metabolism in muscle tissue and acts as a kind of “fuel gauge” to monitor cellular energy status.13 (Leptin, a chemical messenger produced by the adipose, or fat-storing, cells of the body, initiates the breakdown and oxidation of stored fat.)14 Still other research points to the possible development of functional resistance to the actions of the leptin hormone itself.15,16 Whatever the mechanism, a diminished capacity to oxidize fat appears to be a pre-eminent clinical marker for insulin resistance.17-19 This is supported by animal studies, which confirm that dietary lowering of muscle triglycerides improves insulin sensitivity and reverses diabetes.20,21 The fact that two of the most effective preventive programs for diabetes are diet and exercise lends credence to the argument that onset of the disease involves a profound disturbance in lipid dynamics. Assessing Your Risk for Diabetes The previous clinical definition of insulin resistance syndrome required evidence of insulin resistance. Disturbances in glucose metabolism, however, develop relatively late in the disease’s progression. Consequently, under the old definition, many people in the early stages of insulin resistance went undiagnosed. The new definition, developed recently by the US National Cholesterol Education Panel, incorporates five easily measured variables: abdominal obesity elevated fasting blood triglyceride levels low levels of HDL (“good”) cholesterol high fasting blood sugar levels high blood pressure. Under the new definition, a person with any three of these conditions is classified as having insulin resistance syndrome. To assess whether the new criteria could predict excess risk for heart disease and diabetes, researchers found that the risk of coronary heart disease—and, more strikingly, diabetes—rose as the number of metabolic abnormalities increased. Men with four to five features of the syndrome had almost four times the risk of coronary heart disease and 25 times the risk of diabetes compared to those with no abnormalities. The study also confirmed that C-reactive protein, an inflammatory marker, was significantly elevated in men with metabolic syndrome compared to those without metabolic syndrome.22 Current guidelines suggest that people are diabetic if their fasting glucose levels exceed 126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L). Levels over 109 mg/dL indicate a prediabetic state and levels below 109 are considered normal. While significantly improved from the previously used glucose tolerance test, these recommendations may still be too lenient. In October 2003, the American Diabetes Association further reduced the cut-off for impaired glucose tolerance from 109 to 100 mg/dL, meaning anyone with fasting glucose levels above 100 would be classified as prediabetic. More recently, the Life Extension Foundation has prescribed optimal fasting glucose levels of less than 86 mg/dL.23 This recommendation is based on clinical evidence that higher fasting levels can progressively and markedly increase cardiovascular risk.24 Lowering the bar on fasting glucose levels is a good thing, as it is estimated that up to one-half of diabetes sufferers have not been diagnosed.25 Screening for diabetes should begin at 45 years of age and should be repeated every three years in persons without risk factors and more frequently in individuals with risk factors.26 The Life Extension Foundation believes that high fasting blood levels of insulin (hyperinsulinemia) is the first indication of insulin resistance syndrome. Lifestyle Considerations Fortunately, insulin resistance and type II diabetes lend themselves to a holistic approach to disease management. Lifestyle modifications can have a remarkable impact on prevention and treatment. Controlling insulin resistance—not the high blood sugar levels caused by it—is the key to success. The Obesity Connection With a death toll second only to smoking, obesity claims the lives of nearly 300,000 Americans each year.27 According to the American Diabetes Association, “Obesity is now reaching epidemic proportions in the US and elsewhere.” From 1991 to 2001, obesity in America increased 74% while the prevalence of diabetes increased 61%. The tripling of type II diabetes incidence over the last 30 years owes much to this surge in obesity. A recent study by researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention investigated the links between obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, asthma, and arthritis. Compared to adults of a healthy weight, obese adults had twice the risk for high cholesterol, three times the risk for asthma, four times the risk for arthritis, and over six times the risk for hypertension.28 The strongest correlation was between obesity and diabetes: obese people exhibited over seven times the risk for diabetes compared with people of normal weight. The good news is that up to 90% of type II diabetes cases can be prevented with simple lifestyle changes, including diet, exercise, and smoking cessation.29 The Diabetes Prevention Program, a multi-center trial involving over 3,200 people with impaired glucose tolerance, was the first large-scale study to demonstrate conclusively that weight loss can effectively delay type II diabetes. Results showed that lifestyle intervention, consisting of calorie reduction and 30 minutes a day of mild exercise, reduced risk by 58%—almost double that conferred by the oral diabetes drug metformin (Glucophage®). The results were so convincing that the study was concluded earlier than planned. The authors surmise that up to 10 million Americans can sharply lower their risk of diabetes through simple attention to diet, exercise, and lifestyle modification.30 These findings are supported by the earlier work of Dr. Roy Walford, who demonstrated that caloric restriction aggressively lowers both fasting glucose and blood insulin levels.23 Growing evidence suggests that C-reactive protein may also play a role in the development of central body obesity and the onset of type II diabetes.31 Abdominal fat is a major source of this inflammatory agent, and the increased risk of atherosclerosis and insulin resistance associated with visceral obesity may well be a consequence of enhanced C-reactive protein secretion. The surest and safest way to remedy the situation is to lose weight. Women who completed a 12-week restricted-calorie diet lost an average of 17.4 pounds and reduced their C-reactive protein levels by 26%.32 One thing is certain: people who are overweight are already in a prediabetic state and need to take corrective action before the damage is done. Unfortunately, most diagnoses occur far too late in the game. The Value of Diet While opinions differ as to which ratio of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats is optimal in preventing and treating diabetes, it is safe to say that carbohydrates create insulin. As more carbohydrates are consumed, more insulin is produced. Today’s obesity and diabetes epidemics reflect that too many people are asking their bodies to run on the wrong grade of fuel—refined carbohydrates. In the 1980s, Americans consumed an average of 12 pounds of sugar each year; today, US per-capita sugar consumption is an astounding 150+ pounds per year.33 Stanford’s Dr. Gerald Reaven suggests that a diet consisting of 45% carbohydrates, 40% “good” fats, and 15% protein will benefit individuals with insulin resistance. According to Reaven, only when healthy fats replace carbohydrates will insulin levels drop and clusters of symptoms associated with insulin resistance abate.34 Unfortunately, the standard diabetic diet recommended by most physicians is very high in carbohydrates, which raises blood sugar, stimulates insulin production, and almost guarantees that the diabetic will be a patient for life. People need to pay attention not only to their total carbohydrate load, but also to the types of carbohydrates they eat. High-glycemic foods—such as white rice, white flour-based products, pasta, starchy vegetables, and many processed foods—are quickly converted to blood sugar when digested, causing insulin levels to spike. Conversely, the carbohydrates found in low-glycemic foods, such as asparagus, broccoli, cabbage, green beans, and other low-starch vegetables and fruits, are converted slowly to blood sugar and create a more gradual rise in blood insulin levels. Avoiding “white foods” is a simple recipe that can help you avoid trouble. Fats and Fiber While total fat intake does not appear to influence the risk of diabetes, consuming trans-saturated fats (trans fats), the hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated oils so ubiquitous in processed and fast foods, can greatly increase your risk for diabetes. A recent study showed that a minuscule 2% increase in calories from trans-fatty acids raised the risk of diabetes in women by 39%; conversely, a 5% increase in calories from polyunsaturated (good) fats reduced the risk for diabetes by 37%.35 If nothing else, simply replacing trans-fats in the diet with polyunsaturated fats will reduce the risk of diabetes dramatically. Dietary fats that are considered to be beneficial include extra virgin olive oil, fish oil, almond oil and almond butter, avocados, nuts, and seed oils such as sesame, pumpkin, sunflower, and flax. Eating a diet rich in soluble and insoluble fiber improves insulin sensitivity and reduces circulating insulin levels. Fiber impedes gastric emptying and the passage of food through the gut, slows the breakdown of high-glycemic starchy foods, and delays glucose uptake into the blood. In a recent study reported in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers conclude that a high-fiber diet significantly improves glycemic control, decreases insulin levels, and lowers plasma lipid concentrations in as little as six weeks.36 Exercise Is Essential Exercise improves cardiovascular function and the body’s ability to metabolize glucose. Weight loss through exercise and diet correlates to a return to normal levels of insulin resistance and may be the single most effective approach to treating insulin resistance and reducing the risk of diabetes.37 Conditioned muscles are more responsive to insulin and blood sugar balance than non-conditioned muscles,33 possibly due to an increase in the number of insulin receptors on the muscle cell. Physical exercise burns calories, and as energy expenditure is increased, the incidence of diabetes is found to decrease. Moreover, this protective effect appears to be most pronounced in individuals who are at greatest risk for developing the disease.38 Physically fit people also secrete less insulin. Results from the Nurses’ and Physicians’ Health Studies, conducted in the early 1990s, reveal that insulin response is more attenuated in physically fit individuals than in people who are less fit.39,40 Researchers recently demonstrated that when individuals are introduced to a regular exercise program, they experience a striking decrease in their risk of developing diabetes.41 In fact, regular exercise, when combined with weight loss, can reduce the insulin requirements of type II diabetics by up to 100%.42,43 A low-glycemic, reduced-calorie diet with healthy fats and fiber, along with regular exercise, is a safe and effective means to prevent and treat diabetes, as well as to shed excess weight. The Role of Supplements Beyond a healthy diet, considerable evidence demonstrates the efficacy of daily nutritional supplementation as a way to prevent and treat diabetes. The following dietary supplements have been found to be particularly beneficial: Alpha-lipoic acid enhances the breakdown of glucose through intervention at several points along the central metabolic pathway. Supplementation provides a significant boost in glucose disposal and insulin sensitivity.44 Biotin assists in the metabolism of fats, proteins, and carbohydrates, and directly influences blood glucose levels by enhancing glucokinase activity.45 (Glucokinase is an enzyme that controls the first step of glucose oxidation.) Supplementation at high levels significantly improves glucose control and reduces the risk of diabetic neuropathy.46 L-carnitine deficiency is common in diabetics and is associated with cataract formation and cardiomyopathy (weakening of the heart muscle). Supplementation improves insulin sensitivity, in-creases glucose storage, and optimizes carbohydrate metabolism.47 Carnitine also appears to protect against diabetic neuropathy by lowering sorbitol levels in nerve cells. Carnosine, an amino acid peptide, prevents cross-linking of glucose with proteins (glycation) and arrests the formation of advanced glycation end-products in the cell.48 Glycation accelerates the aging process and is problematic in diabetics. Carnosine also bolsters proteolytic (protein-destroying) pathways to dispose of damaged proteins created through glycation. Chromium is essential in modulating glucose metabolism and boosting glucose sensitivity.49 It enhances insulin-dependent transport of glucose into the cell, likely by facilitating the binding of insulin to the receptor site. Supplementation at 1000 micrograms per day has been found to markedly reduce insulin resistance.50 As over 90% of adults are deficient in chromium, daily supplementation is warranted. Coenzyme Q10, an important component of the cell’s central metabolic pathway, enhances cellular energy production and protects cells from damage by free radicals. Japanese researchers cite its ability to boost respiratory chain function in pancreatic beta cells and improve glycemic control.51 Magnesium lowers blood glucose, increases insulin sensitivity, reduces stress response (which promulgates diabetes), and assists in the maintenance of healthy beta cells.52 Low magnesium status is common among type II diabetics53 and is believed to disrupt insulin secretion and the hormone’s capacity to transport glucose. Supplementation has been found to increase the number and sensitivity of cellular insulin receptors50 and to mitigate carbohydrate intolerance.45 N-acetyl-L-cysteine protects pancreatic beta cells from oxidative damage. Free radicals flourish in fatty tissue and when circulating glucose levels are high (two conditions common in insulin resistance syndrome and diabetes). Supple-mentation with N-acetyl-L-cysteine lowers blood sugar levels, protects beta cells from glucose toxicity, and suppresses beta cell death.54 Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) lowers blood glucose, inhibits glycation,55 prevents the accumulation of sorbitol (which causes cataracts), and synergizes and replenishes other antioxidants. By reducing the level of C-reactive protein, ascorbic acid helps quench the inflammatory response in diabetics and lowers cardiovascular risk. Because vitamin C is the principal antagonist for the excessive free-radical activity observed in diabetes, its presence is critical.45 As most diabetics are deficient in this important nutrient, supplementation is essential. Vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol), a potent lipid-phase antioxidant, quenches lipid peroxidation, increases insulin sensitivity, and enhances glucose transport. High-dose vitamin E supplementation at 1200 milligrams per day has been found to reduce vascular inflammation and lower C-reactive protein levels.56 Vitamin K appears to play an important role in the regulation of blood sugar57 and the reduction of interleukin-6 (IL-6), an inflammatory marker for diabetes; however, people on anticoagulant drugs, such as Coumadin®, should not take vitamin K. Insulin resistance and diabetes can also be treated successfully with plant-based remedies indigenous to many native cultures. Several herbal remedies are remarkably effective and, unlike drug therapies, have few or no side effects. Hormone therapies, using testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), show considerable promise. For a detailed description of these complementary therapies, readers are encouraged to consult the protocols in the Life Extension Foundation’s Disease Prevention and Treatment book,58 as well as Michael Murray’s excellent treatise in his book, Healing Power of Herbs.59 References 1.

Scientifically reviewed by: Dr. Gary Gonzalez, MD, on January 2020. Written By JoAnn Knorr, MMS. Metformin (brand name ""Glucophage"") has been used in the treatment of type II diabetes for the past 40 years.1 This drug counteracts many of the underlying factors that result in the manifestation of this insidious disease. Metformin also produces helpful side benefits that can protect against the lethal complications of type II diabetes. Frequently prescribed anti-diabetic drugs fail to address the fundamental causes of type II diabetes and can induce serious side effects. Type II diabetes affects between 16 to 19 million Americans. About 75% of type II diabetics will die from a cardiovascular-related disease. Conventional doctors often prescribe drugs for the purpose of lowering blood sugar levels. These drugs do not adequately address the multiple underlying pathologies associated with the type II diabetic state. Type II diabetes is characterized by cellular insulin resistance. The result is excess accumulation of glucose in the bloodstream as cells become resistant to the effects of insulin. Type II diabetes is characterized by cellular insulin resistance. The result is excess accumulation of glucose in the bloodstream because cells become resistant to the effects of insulin and fail to take up glucose As the type II diabetic condition progresses, many people gain weight and develop more fat cells.2 Treating type II diabetes with insulin-enhancing therapy increases the risk of cardiovascular complications, induces weight gain, and fails to correct the underlying cause of the disease. Many type II diabetics produce too much insulin in a futile attempt to drive glucose into insulin-resistant cells. When doctors prescribe insulin-enhancing drugs to these type II diabetics, a temporary reduction of serum glucose may occur, but the long-term effects of this excess insulin can be devastating. An ideal anti-diabetic drug would enhance cellular insulin sensitivity, inhibit excess intestinal absorption of sugar, reduce excess liver production of glucose, promote weight loss and reduce cardiovascular risk factors. Metformin (Glucophage) is the one drug that does all of this and more. Metformin works by increasing the number of muscle and adipocyte (fat cell) insulin receptors and the attraction for the receptor. It does not increase insulin secretion, it only increases insulin sensitivity. Therefore, metformin is not associated with causing hypoglycemia. This activity reduces insulin levels by increasing the sensitivity of peripheral tissues to the effects of insulin by rejuvenating the response, and restoring glucose and insulin to younger physiological levels that may cause weight loss and most certainly a decrease in the body's total fat content.3-7 In a study published by the American Diabetes Association, metformin was found to decrease the fasting plasma glucose concentration by -60 to -70mg/dl in patients with non-insulin dependent type II diabetes.1 Metformin also reduced hemoglobin A1C levels, a blood measurement of glycosylation. One of the most devastating consequences of diabetes is protein degradation caused by the formation of advanced glycated end products. Reductions in serum hemoglobin A1C levels are a good indicator of consistent glucose control in the diabetic patient. Dr. Ward Dean is a specialist in anti-aging and life extension medicine, author of over a 100 articles on the biology of aging, and founder and Medical Director of the Center for Bio-Gerontology in Florida. He recommends taking 500 mg of metformin two or three times per day to all his patients over 40 who do not have kidney or liver problems, or a history of congestive heart failure.4,5 According to Dean, aging causes insulin resistance. Metformin increases hypothalamo-pituitary sensitivity that declines with age. As we get older, there is a loss of sensitivity of the hypothalamus and the peripheral tissues to the effects of insulin, which causes elevated blood insulin levels (hyperinsulinemia).4,5 A number of harmful and age-accelerating effects are associated with elevated blood insulin levels. These effects include: increased infections, microvascular complications like retinopathy (eye problems), nephropathy (kidney problems), neuropathies (nerve problems), hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, premature atherosclerosis and obesity, which eventually evolve into cardiovascular problems.1,3-5,8 Metformin and Type II Diabetes Life Extension® is a big advocate for the use of the drug metformin. Research shows that not only is it an effective drug for treating type-II diabetes, but it also has an extensive list of off-label benefits. Metformin treats type-II diabetes by addressing the underlying issue, which is insulin resistance. Conventional medical doctors have largely failed at properly treating type-II diabetics with drugs that target their insulin resistance. Instead, many doctors have treated patients by prescribing more insulin. By targeting insulin resistance and making insulin more sensitive (effective), metformin reduces risk of cancer, heart disease, polycystic ovarian syndrome and more. It may be the most underutilized drug due to its vast list of off-label benefits. Learn more about the research on metformin in this article. The cardiovascular system Patients with type II diabetes often present with a cluster of cardiovascular risk factors like visceral obesity, hypertension, high triglyceride and low high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels, and hypofibrinolysis, all of which form insulin resistance and potentially contribute to increased cardiovascular risk.8 In the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study, metformin was the only medication that reduced diabetes related deaths, heart attacks and strokes.1,8 In the Fontbonne and Associates BIGPRO 1 trial, the individuals with visceral obesity treated with metformin showed greater weight loss, a greater decrease in fasting insulin levels and a smaller increase in low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentrations than those who received placebo. A decrease in plasminogen activator inhibitor was most associated with the body weight loss in subjects.8,9 In the trial, the effects of metformin were most notable on the level of endothelial (artery lining) damage that showed a decrease. The microvascular complications of retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy improve due to metformin's ability to decrease damage to arterial lining.2 These small blood vessels are somewhat unblocked to provide healthier blood supply to vital tissues surrounding the eyes, kidneys and nerves.2 The potentially preventive effects of metformin on type II diabetes and evolving cardiovascular complications include a decrease in total cholesterol and low density cholesterol (LDL), free fatty acids, tissue plasminogen activator antigen and insulin levels when patients present with symptoms of hypertension, dyslipidemia, visceral obesity or hyperglycemia.8 In non-diabetic patients with hypertension, 3 placebo controlled trials were done. These trials showed that metformin significantly reduced fasting insulin or C-peptide levels, as well as total cholesterol, low density lipids cholesterol or apolipoprotein B levels, fasting free fatty acids and tissue plasminogen activator antigen levels. Metformin had a significant effect on lowering blood pressure and fasting triglyceride levels in one of these trials.8 Polycystic ovarian syndrome Metformin has been found to suppress the growth of some tumors and enhance the activity of anti-cancer drugs. Polycystic ovarian syndrome is characterized by irregular or absent menstrual periods, and elevated serum testosterone and androstenedione. These patients complain of abnormal bleeding, infertility, obesity, excess hair growth, hair loss and acne. Polycystic ovarian syndrome seems to have a genetic component in which those who are affected often have both male and female relatives with type II diabetes, obesity, elevated blood triglycerides or high blood pressure. They may also have female relatives with infertility, hirsutism or menstrual problems. For women in the reproductive age range, polycystic ovarian syndrome is a serious common cause of infertility because of the endocrine abnormalities that accompany elevated insulin levels. As women with polycystic ovarian syndrome maybe at greater risk for other medical conditions, testing is essential. They should be tested for blood lipids, diabetes and blood clotting factors that promote abnormal clotting. Metformin, at doses of 500 mg to 850 mg three times per day, has been shown to reverse these endocrine abnormalities. In women with polycystic ovarian syndrome, metformin reduced systolic blood pressure, hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance, and facilitated menstrual regulation and pregnancy.10,11 Cancer & cellular immunity Metformin has been found to suppress the growth of some tumors and enhance the activity of anti-cancer drugs. By giving the immune system a boost, metformin can improve cellular immunity. It has also been found to reduce the incidence of chemically induced cancer in rats.5,7 The way metformin improves cellular immunity is linked to its blood sugar lowering effect by improving receptor sensitivity and number. Bacteria, fungi and some viruses tend to feed on sugar. By diminishing their fuel supply, we diminish them. That is why diabetics and other individuals with endocrine abnormalities tend to be more prone to infections.2 Contraindications & side effects Metformin is not traditionally recommended for people who have a history of kidney or liver disease, or a history of congestive heart failure.* People with a history of alcohol abuse should also avoid taking the drug, as serious lactic acidosis can develop in these individuals. Long term use of metformin may cause malabsorption of vitamin B12.1,3-5,8 Because of the depletion of B12, supplementation is recommended.4-6 When a person begins to take metformin, they may experience some nausea and vomiting, stomach pain, bloating and diarrhea. The latter usually disappear once the person becomes accustomed to the drug.1,5 *Metformin use in close coordination and evaluation with a physician is still possible. Consult your healthcare provider to determine whether metformin use is recommended for you. Many helpful side benefits Metformin's multiple effects benefit individuals with a propensity to develop diabetes, cardiovascular problems, endocrine problems, retinopathies, nephropathies, cancer or decreased immunity, infections and weight gain.1-5,8 As with diabetes, metformin has been shown to cause a reduction in appetite, weight, and the body's total fat content. In associated heart disease conditions, there is plaque build-up that lines the arteries. This build-up of plaque can lead to atherosclerosis.8 Metformin reduces or lowers the chances of developing atherosclerosis and reduces the rate of pro-aging cross linkages of collagen, which plays a role in the scar tissue build-up that occurs during wound healing.4 Metformin has been shown to reduce the amount of supplemental insulin needed by type II diabetics who become insulin-dependent. They are able to take a lower insulin dose in conjunction with metformin without the risk of becoming hypoglycemic. For 40 years metformin has been used to control blood glucose levels in patients with type II diabetes. Physicians are recommending it to patients who are predisposed to diabetes for the prevention of developing the disease.8 Metformin prevents the acceleration of atherosclerosis and reduces the rate of pro-aging cross linking of collagen. With the cluster of cardiovascular problems associated with hyperinsulinemia, metformin has proven effective in lowering total cholesterol, low density lipids, free fatty acids, tissue plasminogen activator antigen and insulin levels when patients present with symptoms of hypertension dyslipidemia, visceral obesity or hyperglycemia. Metformin prevents the acceleration of atherosclerosis and reduces the rate of pro-aging cross linking of collagen. The microvascular complications of hyperinsulinemia are improved by metformin due to the arterial clearance in small blood vessels of the eyes, kidneys and nerves. There are other positive effects associated with metformin: decreased tumor growth and improved cellular immunity in individuals who are prone to chronic infections associated high blood sugar levels. In non diabetics, metformin reduced low density lipid, total cholesterol, free fatty acids, tissue plasminogen activator antigen, blood pressure and fasting triglyceride levels.1-5,8 Women suffering from polycystic ovary syndrome have been treated with metformin. Benefits include: lipid lowering effects, reduction in systolic blood pressure, hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance syndrome. Metformin has also been shown to aid in normal menstrual regulation and pregnancy.10,11 In conclusion, the scientific research points to metformin's multiple uses, with few drawbacks. Accordingly, the drug's numerous side benefits associated with the treatment and prevention of diabetes, as well as other disorders, appear to outweigh its limited side effects.
