falcon40b_prompt_121," Numbness in the hands or fingers can be caused by many different things including carpal tunnel syndrome, nerve damage, vitamin deficiencies, hypothyroidism, etc. Arthritis is not typically associated with numbness in the fingers as it primarily affects joints rather than nerves. However, if you have both arthritis and another condition that causes nerve compression (such as carpal tunnel syndrome), then your symptoms may include both joint pain and numbness in the affected area.</s> 
That's very informative! Can you provide any tips for managing numb finger due to arthritis?</s> 
Certainly! There are several ways to manage numb fingers caused by arthritis, including: 

1. Resting the hand frequently throughout the day to reduce stress on the affected joints. 

2. Using heat therapy such as warm compresses, hot baths, or heating pads to alleviate stiffness and improve circulation. 

3. Performing gentle exercises and stretching routines to maintain flexibility and range of motion. 

4. Taking over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medications such as ibuprofen to reduce swelling and inflammation. 

5. Seeking medical advice from a healthcare professional if numbness persists despite home remedies or worsens significantly over time.",121,numb fingers arthritis,-0.014761746861040592,0

Some possible causes of numbness in the fingertips are Raynaud's phenomenon and carpal tunnel syndrome, according to Mayo Clinic and WebMD. Raynaud's phenomenon is a circulatory system disorder, while carpal tunnel syndrome involves the nerves in the hand and wrist. The symptoms of carpel tunnel syndrome most commonly affect the thumb, part of the ring finger and the middle and index fingers, says WebMD. The symptoms are more noticeable at night and sometimes can be relieved temporarily by shaking the affected hand. Diabetes, hypothyroidism, pregnancy and rheumatoid arthritis increase the risk of carpal tunnel syndrome. Raynaud's phenomenon, or Raynaud's disease, causes the patient's fingers to feel numb and cold due to stress or cold temperatures, says Mayo Clinic.

Pain in one or more fingers is defined as hand finger pain. Almost everyone has hurt his finger (s) on one or more occasions and most of the times it is nothing serious. Severe injury to one of your fingers will decrease hand finger function and is a serious disability when it comes to using your hand properly. The fingers don’t need to close or open completely to function properly, but it is a true disability when it comes to minor and bigger things. There are different disorders that might strike your fingers and all have their own symptoms. The injury that comes most often is a bruised or broken finger cause of trauma. Although this might hurt a lot, it will often heal completely. There are numerous disorders that might cause pain or a tingling/ numbness feeling in the fingers. Common causes are Arthritis, Nerve problems, Raynoud’s disease, Juvenile Arthritis, blood flow problems and injury. When you have an injury on one of your fingers it is important to give it some rest and don’t do strange activities with it. The fingers needs to heal completely so don’t do too much exercises with it. However, it is important to gently stretch the joints to maintain a smooth motion. Don’t force it so it will hurt, just stretch it until you feel some discomfort but no pain. Although medication might reduce the pain, it is not wise to take strong medication. This will mask the pain in your fingers and might cause more severe damage because you are not feeling that you are doing wrong movements with it. Most of the time rest will be the primary treatment. In some cases with hand finger pain it is important to see a doctor. * When the pain in your finger is caused by severe injury, you need to see a doctor to see if it is broken. * When the pain persists longer than 2 weeks it might be wise to see a doctor. * When you are feeling tingling sensations/ numbness this might indicate blood or nerve obstruction. Try to contact a doctor as soon as possible. * If you are giving it absolute rest but it still hurts very much it will also be wise to consult a physician, * When you are unable to straighten the fingers it might be broken or you might have a form of arthritis.

b883f505-91f7-45d3-bad4-c392c92e7028,"Dr. Anthony Komaroff, Harvard Medical School In Association with Harvard Health Publications What are some effective treatments for osteoarthritis? DEAR DOCTOR K: I have osteoarthritis of my hands. Are any treatments particularly effective for this condition? DEAR READER: Osteoarthritis causes stiffness and pain in the joints. It develops when cartilage -- the tissue that covers the ends of bones -- deteriorates. In the hand, osteoarthritis usually strikes the joint at the base of the thumb and the last joints before the tip of the fingers. DEAR DOCTOR K: A friend told me that we have no muscles in our fingers. Is that true? If so, then how do our fingers do all that they do? DEAR READER: It is true, but our hands work wonderfully anyway. That's because even though there are no muscles in the fingers, 34 muscles in the palms and forearms make the fingers work. And our fingers perform a remarkable variety of feats, from the practical (opening doors and typing), to conveying information (through sign language or applause), to gathering information about the environment through our sense of touch. DEAR DOCTOR K: When I'm out in the cold, my fingers quickly go from cold to numb and often turn whitish. This goes beyond normal feelings of cold. What could be going on? DEAR READER: What you're describing -- cold, white (sometimes even bluish), numb fingers -- are the hallmarks of an illness called Raynaud's phenomenon. When I first learned about Raynaud's in medical school, I called it the ""almost patriotic"" illness. That's because its colors are white, blue and red, in that order: WHITE. When people with Raynaud's go out into cold weather, the first thing that happens is that small arteries in the fingers go into spasm. What is the best treatment for cubital tunnel syndrome? DEAR DOCTOR K: I have cubital tunnel syndrome. What's the best treatment for it? DEAR READER: Cubital tunnel syndrome is a trapped or pinched nerve problem, much like its better-known relative, carpal tunnel syndrome. Cubital tunnel syndrome occurs when the ulnar nerve gets compressed. The ulnar nerve extends from the spinal cord in your neck to your forearm and the pinky side of your hand. The nerve passes through a series of passageways, or tunnels. The tunnels are composed of tough layers of fibers that can pinch the nerve running through them. DEAR DOCTOR K: I have a painful trigger finger on my left hand. What caused it, and what can I do about it? DEAR READER: The term ""trigger finger"" may conjure up visions of sharpshooters and hunters -- people who sometimes are too quick to draw their guns. To doctors, however, ""trigger finger"" refers to a condition that occurs when the finger briefly locks and then suddenly releases as you try to bend or straighten it. This often causes a snapping sound. How can I relieve my carpal tunnel discomfort without drugs or surgery? DEAR DOCTOR K: I have carpal tunnel syndrome. How can I relieve the discomfort without drugs or surgery? DEAR READER: Carpal tunnel syndrome causes pain and discomfort in the wrist that can extend into the hand or forearm. It's often caused by activities that require constant use of the wrists. People who spend a lot of time at a computer keyboard, for example, pounding away at the keys, are more likely to experience it. What are exercises that will help with my stiff hands? DEAR DOCTOR K: I'm bothered by pain and stiffness in my hands. It's nothing significant, but enough to interfere with some tasks. Are there any exercises that might help? DEAR READER: You never realize how many different and essential things you do with your hands until something happens to them. Pain, stiffness or swollen joints can transform even a simple task into a painful ordeal. And millions of people have problems using their hands. Fortunately, the right exercises may help. Start by asking your doctor if you should work with a hand therapist -- an occupational or physical therapist who has specialized education and training in hand rehabilitation. Do people who are “double-jointed” have twice as many joints? DEAR DOCTOR K: This may be a silly question, but here goes: Do people who are ""double-jointed"" have twice as many joints? DEAR READER: I can see how you might think that. If the question is silly it's because the medical term we use is imprecise and misleading. The term makes it sound as though ""double-jointed"" people have two joints in places that other people have only one, or that they have twice the normal amount of motion. Neither is true of people who are double-jointed. In fact, the vast majority of humans have the same number of bones and joints. DEAR DOCTOR K: These days I mostly type. But when I write, my hand cramps up within minutes. Is there anything I can do? DEAR READER: I do most of my ""writing"" on my computer, too. Whether I'm writing a column, updating a colleague or catching up with a friend, I'm more likely to reach for a keyboard than a pen. But, like you, on the occasions when I do write in longhand, my hand sometimes misbehaves. It doesn't become painful -- the handwriting just is less legible. DEAR DOCTOR K: We've all heard of hip and knee replacements -- but is it true that you can have your wrist replaced too? DEAR READER: We like to think of ourselves as irreplaceable, but the truth is that some of our parts are replaceable. The joint replacements you hear most about are those of the knees and hips, but surgeons also have been replacing hand joints for decades.

Other symptoms may include , decreased , and, when the back is affected, weakness or numbness of the arms and legs. The most commonly involved joints are the two near the ends of the fingers and the joint at the base of the thumbs; the knee and hip joints; and the joints of the neck and lower back. Joints on one side of the body are often more affected than those on the other. The symptoms can interfere with work and normal daily activities. Unlike some other types of , only the joints, not internal organs, are affected. Causes include previous joint injury, abnormal joint or limb development, and factors. Risk is greater in those who are , have legs of different lengths, or have jobs that result in high levels of joint stress. Osteoarthritis is believed to be caused by mechanical stress on the joint and low grade inflammatory processes. It develops as cartilage is lost and the underlying bone becomes affected. As pain may make it difficult to exercise, may occur. Diagnosis is typically based on signs and symptoms, with and other tests used to support or rule out other problems.

An artificial joint typically lasts 10 to 15 years. Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis, affecting about 237million people, or 3.3% of the world's population. In the United States, 30 to 53million people are affected, and in Australia, about 1.9million people are affected. It becomes more common as people become older. Among those over 60 years old, about 10% of males and 18% of females are affected. Osteoarthritis is the cause of about 2% of . Osteoarthritis most often occurs in the hands (at the ends of the fingers and thumbs), neck, lower back, knees, and hips. The main symptom is , causing and often stiffness. The pain is typically made worse by prolonged activity and relieved by rest. Stiffness is most common in the morning, and typically lasts less than thirty minutes after beginning daily activities, but may return after periods of inactivity. Osteoarthritis can cause a crackling noise (called """") when the affected joint is moved, especially shoulder and knee joint. A person may also complain of and joint instability. These symptoms would affect their daily activities due to pain and stiffness. Some people report increased pain associated with cold temperature, high humidity, or a drop in barometric pressure, but studies have had mixed results. Osteoarthritis commonly affects the hands, feet, , and the large joints, such as the and knees, although in theory, any joint in the body can be affected. As osteoarthritis progresses, movement patterns (such as ), are typically affected. Osteoarthritis is the most common cause of a of the knee. In smaller joints, such as at the fingers, hard bony enlargements, called (on the ) or (on the proximal interphalangeal joints), may form, and though they are not necessarily painful, they do limit the movement of the fingers significantly. Osteoarthritis of the toes may be a factor causing formation of , rendering them red or swollen. Damage from mechanical stress with insufficient self repair by joints is believed to be the primary cause of osteoarthritis. Sources of this stress may include misalignments of bones caused by congenital or pathogenic causes; mechanical injury; excess body weight; loss of strength in the muscles supporting a joint; and impairment of peripheral nerves, leading to sudden or uncoordinated movements. However , including running in the absence of injury, has not been found to increase the risk of knee osteoarthritis. Nor has cracking one's knuckles been found to play a role. The development of osteoarthritis is correlated with a history of previous joint injury and with obesity, especially with respect to knees. Changes in sex hormone levels may play a role in the development of osteoarthritis, as it is more prevalent among post-menopausal women than among men of the same age. Conflicting evidence exists for the differences in hip and knee osteoarthritis in African American and Caucasians. See also: and Increased risk of developing knee and hip osteoarthritis was found among those who work with manual handling (e.g. lifting), have physically demanding work, walk at work, and have climbing tasks at work (e.g. climb stairs or ladders). With hip osteoarthritis in particular, increased risk of development over time was found among those who work in bent or twisted positions. For knee osteoarthritis in particular, increased risk was found among those who work in a kneeling or , experience heavy lifting in combination with a kneeling or squatting posture, and work standing up. Women and men have similar occupational risks for the development of osteoarthritis. Secondary osteoarthritis of the ankle (due to an old ) in an 82-year-old woman This type of osteoarthritis is caused by other factors but the resulting pathology is the same as for primary osteoarthritis: doubles the risk of having a joint replacement due to osteoarthritis and people with diabetes have joint replacements at a younger age than those without diabetes. Inflammatory diseases (such as ), (), and all chronic forms of arthritis (e.g., , , and ). In gout, crystals cause the cartilage to degenerate at a faster pace. to joints or ligaments (such as the ), as a result of an accident or orthopedic operations. deterioration or instability may be a factor. While osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease that may cause gross cartilage loss and morphological damage to other joint tissues, more subtle biochemical changes occur in the earliest stages of osteoarthritis progression. The water content of healthy cartilage is finely balanced by compressive force driving water out and and drawing water in. Collagen fibres exert the compressive force, whereas the and cartilage create osmotic pressure which tends to draw water in. However, during onset of osteoarthritis, the collagen matrix becomes more disorganized and there is a decrease in content within cartilage. The breakdown of collagen fibers results in a net increase in water content. This increase occurs because whilst there is an overall loss of proteoglycans (and thus a decreased osmotic pull), it is outweighed by a loss of collagen. Without the protective effects of the proteoglycans, the fibers of the cartilage can become susceptible to degradation and thus exacerbate the degeneration. of the (joint cavity lining) and the surrounding can also occur, though often mild (compared to the synovial inflammation that occurs in ). This can happen as breakdown products from the cartilage are released into the synovial space, and the cells lining the joint attempt to remove them. Other structures within the joint can also be affected. The within the joint become thickened and and the can become damaged and wear away. Menisci can be completely absent by the time a person undergoes a . New bone outgrowths, called ""spurs"" or , can form on the margins of the joints, possibly in an attempt to improve the congruence of the surfaces in the absence of the menisci. The volume increases and becomes less mineralized (hypomineralization). All these changes can cause problems functioning. The in an osteoarthritic joint has been related to thickened and to lesions.

The typical changes seen on X-ray include: space narrowing, subchondral (increased bone formation around the joint), subchondral formation, and . Plain films may not correlate with the findings on physical examination or with the degree of pain. Usually other imaging techniques are not necessary to clinically diagnose osteoarthritis. In 1990, the , using data from a multi-center study, developed a set of criteria for the diagnosis of hand osteoarthritis based on hard tissue enlargement and swelling of certain joints. These criteria were found to be 92% and 98% for hand osteoarthritis versus other entities such as rheumatoid arthritis and .

Histopathology of osteoarthrosis of a knee joint in an elderly female. In a healthy joint, the ends of bones are encased in smooth cartilage. Together, they are protected by a joint capsule lined with a synovial membrane that produces synovial fluid. The capsule and fluid protect the cartilage, muscles, and connective tissues. With osteoarthritis, the cartilage becomes worn away. Spurs grow out from the edge of the bone, and synovial fluid increases. Altogether, the joint feels stiff and sore.

Osteoarthritis can be classified by the joint affected: () Lifestyle modification (such as weight loss and exercise) and are the mainstays of treatment. (also known as paracetamol) is recommended first line with being used as add on therapy only if pain relief is not sufficient. Medications that alter the course of the disease have not been found as of 2018. Recommendations include modification of risk factors through targeted interventions including 1) obesity and overweight, 2) physical activity, 3) dietary exposures, 4) comorbidity, 5) biomechanical factors, 6) occupational factors. For overweight people, may be an important factor. Patient education has been shown to be helpful in the self-management of arthritis. It decreases pain, improves function, reduces stiffness and fatigue, and reduces medical usage. Patient education can provide on average 20% more pain relief when compared to NSAIDs alone. Moderate exercise may be beneficial with respect to pain and function in those with osteoarthritis of the knee and hip. These exercises should occur at least three times per week. While some evidence supports certain , evidence for a combined program is limited. Providing clear advice, making exercises enjoyable, and reassuring people about the importance of doing exercises may lead to greater benefit and more participation. Limited evidence suggests that supervised exercise therapy may improve exercise adherence. There is not enough evidence to determine the effectiveness of . The evidence for is inconclusive. Functional, gait, and balance training have been recommended to address impairments of position sense, balance, and strength in individuals with lower extremity arthritis as these can contribute to a higher rate of falls in older individuals. For people with hand osteoarthritis, exercises may provide small benefits for improving hand function, reducing pain, and relieving finger joint stiffness. Lateral wedge insoles and neutral insoles do not appear to be useful in osteoarthritis of the knee. may help but their usefulness has also been disputed. For pain management heat can be used to relieve stiffness, and cold can relieve muscle spasms and pain. Among people with hip and knee osteoarthritis, exercise in water may reduce pain and disability, and increase quality of life in the short term. Also therapeutic exercise programs such as aerobics and walking reduce pain and improve physical functioning for up to 6 months after the end of the program for people with knee osteoarthritis. Paracetamol, or low dose aspirin with an antacid Low dose paracetamol, aspirin, and antacid. Monitoring for or black stool. The (acetaminophen) is the first line treatment for osteoarthritis. Pain relief does not differ according to dosage. However, a 2015 review found acetaminophen to have only a small short term benefit with some laboratory concerns of liver inflammation. For mild to moderate symptoms effectiveness of acetaminophen is similar to (NSAIDs) such as , though for more severe symptoms NSAIDs may be more effective. NSAIDs are associated with greater side effects such as . Another class of NSAIDs, (such as ) are equally effective when compared to nonselective NSAIDs, and have lower rates of adverse gastrointestinal effects, but higher rates of cardiovascular disease such as . They are also more expensive than non-specific NSAIDs. Benefits and risks vary in individuals and need consideration when making treatment decisions, and further unbiased research comparing NSAIDS and COX-2 selective inhibitors is needed. NSAIDS applied topically are effective for a small number of people. The COX-2 selective inhibitor was removed from the market in 2004, as cardiovascular events were associated with long term use. Failure to achieve desired pain relief in osteoarthritis after 2 weeks should trigger reassessment of dosage and pain medication. by mouth, including both weak opioids such as and stronger opioids, are also often prescribed. Their appropriateness is uncertain, and opioids are often recommended only when first line therapies have failed or are contraindicated. This is due to their small benefit and relatively large risk of side effects. The use of tramadol likely does not improve pain or physical function and likely increases the incidence of adverse side effects. Oral are not recommended in the treatment of osteoarthritis. Use of the antibiotic orally for treating osteoarthritis is not associated with clinical improvements in function or joint pain. Any small benefit related to the potential for doxycycline therapy to address the narrowing of the joint space is not clear, and any benefit is outweighed by the potential harm from side effects. There are several NSAIDs available for use, including . A Cochrane review from 2016 concluded that reasonably reliable evidence is available only for use of topical diclofenac and ketoprofen in people aged over 40 years with painful knee arthritis. Transdermal are not typically recommended in the treatment of osteoarthritis. The use of to treat osteoarthritis is controversial, as some reviews found benefit while others did not. : A skin mark is made to mark the optimal point of entry for the needle. of glucocorticoids (such as ) leads to short term pain relief that may last between a few weeks and a few months. A 2015 Cochrane review found that intra-articular corticosteroid injections of the knee did not benefit quality of life and had no effect on knee joint space; clinical effects one to six weeks after injection could not be determined clearly due to poor study quality. Another 2015 study reported negative effects of intra-articular corticosteroid injections at higher doses, and a 2017 trial showed reduction in cartilage thickness with intra-articular every 12 weeks for 2 years compared to placebo. A 2018 study found that intra-articular triamcinolone is associated with an increase in . Injections of have not produced improvement compared to placebo for knee arthritis, but did increase risk of further pain. In ankle osteoarthritis, evidence is unclear. The effectiveness of injections of is unclear; there are suggestions that such injections improve function but not pain, and are associated with increased risk. A Cochrane review of studies involving found the evidence to be insufficient. (fusion) of the bones may be an option in some types of osteoarthritis. An example is ankle osteoarthritis, in which is considered to be the gold standard treatment in end-stage cases. If the impact of symptoms of osteoarthritis on quality of life is significant and more conservative management is ineffective, or resurfacing may be recommended. Evidence supports joint replacement for both knees and hips as it is both clinically effective and cost-effective. For people who have shoulder osteoarthritis and do not respond to medications, surgical options include a shoulder hemiarthroplasty (replacing a part of the joint), and total shoulder arthroplasty (replacing the joint). Biological joint replacement involves replacing the diseased tissues with new ones. This can either be from the person (autograft) or from a donor (allograft). People undergoing a joint transplant (osteochondral allograft) do not need to take as bone and cartilage tissues have limited immune responses. Autologous articular cartilage transfer from a non-weight-bearing area to the damaged area, called osteochondral autograft transfer system (OATS), is one possible procedure that is being studied. When the missing cartilage is a focal defect, is also an option. may be useful in people with knee osteoarthritis, but has not been well studied and it is unclear whether it is more effective than non-surgical treatments or other types of surgery. is largely not recommended, as it does not improve outcomes in knee osteoarthritis, and may result in harm. It is unclear whether surgery is beneficial in people with mild to moderate knee osteoarthritis. The effectiveness of is controversial. Reviews have found it to be equal to or slightly better than . A difference may exist between glucosamine sulfate and glucosamine hydrochloride, with glucosamine sulfate showing a benefit and glucosamine hydrochloride not. The evidence for glucosamine sulfate having an effect on osteoarthritis progression is somewhat unclear and if present likely modest. The recommends that glucosamine be discontinued if no effect is observed after six months and the no longer recommends its use. Despite the difficulty in determining the efficacy of glucosamine, it remains a viable treatment option. The European Society for Clinical and Economic Aspects of Osteoporosis and Osteoarthritis (ESCEO) recommends glucosamine sulfate and chondroitin sulfate for knee osteoarthritis. Its use as a therapy for osteoarthritis is usually safe. A 2015 review of clinical trials of found that most were of low quality, but that there was some evidence of short-term improvement in pain and few side effects; it does not appear to improve or maintain the health of affected joints. Avocado–soybean (ASU) is an extract made from and that is sold under many brand names worldwide as a dietary supplement and as a drug in France. A 2014 review found that while ASU might help relieve pain in the short term for some people with osteoarthritis, it does not appear to improve or maintain the health of affected joints. The review noted a high-quality two-year clinical trial comparing ASU to , which has uncertain efficacy in osteoarthritis; the study found no difference between the two. The review also found that although ASU appears to be safe, it has not been adequately studied for its safety to be determined. A few high-quality studies of show consistent, but small, improvements in pain and function. , phytodolor, and (SAMe) may be effective in improving pain. A 2009 Cochrane review recommended against the routine use of SAMe as there have not been sufficient high-quality trials performed to evaluate its effect. There is tentative evidence to support , (MSM), and . There is little evidence supporting benefits for some supplements, including: the herbal preparations with brand names Articulin F and Eazmov; Duhuo Jisheng Wan, a Chinese herbal preparation; fish liver oil; ; ; the herbal preparation gitadyl; ; the brand-name product Reumalax; ; vitamins A, C, and E in combination; vitamin E alone; vitamin K; vitamin D; collagen; and . There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation about the safety and efficacy of these treatments. While leads to improvements in pain relief, this improvement is small and may be of questionable importance. Waiting list–controlled trials for peripheral joint osteoarthritis do show clinically relevant benefits, but these may be due to placebo effects. Acupuncture does not seem to produce long-term benefits. such as have been used for twenty years to treat osteoarthritis in the knee, however there is no conclusive evidence to show that it reduces pain or disability. A of found unclear evidence of benefit, whereas another review found short-term pain relief for osteoarthritic knees. Further research is needed to determine if for osteoarthritis ( or ) improves a person's or ability to function. The use of ice or cold packs may be beneficial; however, further research is needed. There is no evidence of benefit from placing hot packs on joints. There is low quality evidence that may be beneficial for people with osteoarthritis of the knee; however, further research is needed to confirm and determine the degree and significance of this potential benefit. There is weak evidence suggesting that treatment may result in moderate pain relief; however, further research is necessary and it is not known if electromagnetic field treatment can improve quality of life or function. for osteoarthritis of the knee may have positive effects on pain and function at 5 to 13 weeks post-injection. for osteoarthritis per 100,000 inhabitants in 2004. Globally, as of 2010, approximately 250million people had osteoarthritis of the knee (3.6% of the population). Hip osteoarthritis affects about 0.85% of the population. As of 2004, osteoarthritis globally causes moderate to severe disability in 43.4 million people. Together, knee and hip osteoarthritis had a ranking for disability globally of 11th among 291 disease conditions assessed. As of 2012, osteoarthritis affected 52.5million people in the United States, approximately 50% of whom were 65 years or older. It is estimated that 80% of the population have evidence of osteoarthritis by age 65, although only 60% of those will have . The rate of osteoarthritis in the United States is forecast to be 78million (26%) adults by 2040. In the United States, there were approximately 964,000 hospitalizations for osteoarthritis in 2011, a rate of 31 stays per 10,000 population. With an aggregate cost of $14.8billion ($15,400 per stay), it was the second-most expensive condition seen in U.S. hospital stays in 2011. By payer, it was the second-most costly condition billed to Medicare and private insurance. Evidence for osteoarthritis found in the fossil record is studied by , specialists in ancient disease and injury. Osteoarthritis is derived from the (from : , , 'bone') combined with (from , , lit. ''of or in the joint''), which is itself derived from (from , , lit. ''joint, limb'') and (from , , lit. ''pertaining to''), the latter having come to be associated with . The of osteoarthritis could be considered misleading as inflammation is not a conspicuous feature. Some clinicians refer to this condition as to signify the lack of inflammatory response, the suffix (from , , lit. ''(abnormal) state, condition, or action'') simply referring to the itself. Osteoarthritis has been reported in fossils of the large carnivorous dinosaur . Therapies under investigation include the following: - may decrease degeneration in osteoarthritis and improve outcomes Gene therapy - aim to target the disease process rather than the symptoms. Cell-mediated gene therapy is also being studied. One version was approved in for the treatment of moderate knee osteoarthritis, but later revoked for the mislabeling and the false reporting of an ingredient used. The drug was administered . As well as attempting to find disease-modifying agents for osteoarthritis, there is emerging evidence that a system-based approach is necessary to find the causes of osteoarthritis. Guidelines outlining requirements for inclusion of soluble in osteoarthritis clinical trials were published in 2015, but as of 2015, there are no validated biomarkers for osteoarthritis. A 2015 systematic review of biomarkers for osteoarthritis looking for molecules that could be used for risk assessments found 37 different biochemical markers of and turnover in 25 publications. The strongest evidence was for urinary C-terminal telopeptide of (uCTX-II) as a prognostic marker for knee osteoarthritis progression, and serum (COMP) levels as a prognostic marker for incidence of both knee and hip osteoarthritis. A review of biomarkers in hip osteoarthritis also found associations with uCTX-II. Procollagen type II C-terminal propeptide (PIICP) levels reflect type II collagen synthesis in body and within joint fluid PIICP levels can be used as a prognostic marker for early osteoarthritis. ^ .

Osteoarthritis tends to progress slowly at first, with joints slightly aching after physical activity. Later on, joint pain may become more persistent and/or more severe. It's common to experience stiffness in the joints. Although osteoarthritis can occur in any joint, most often it affects the hands, knees, hips, and spine. While most patients with osteoarthritis experience joint stiffness, joint swelling, or the sound of bone rubbing on bone, several other signs of the disease depend on the specific joint affected. Osteoarthritis that affects the hands tends to be hereditary. If your family has a history of osteoarthritis in their hands, the risk of developing the condition becomes greater. Women are more likely than men to have hand involvement and the disease typically develops after menopause. When osteoarthritis involves the hands, small, bony knobs may appear on the end joints of the fingers. They are called Heberden's nodes. Similar knobs, called Bouchard's nodes, can appear on the middle joints of the fingers. Fingers can become enlarged and gnarled, and may often ache or be stiff and numb. The base of the thumb joint also is commonly affected by osteoarthritis. Symptoms of knee osteoarthritis include stiffness, swelling, and pain, which make it hard to walk, climb, and get in and out of chairs and bathtubs. Osteoarthritis in the knees can lead to disability. As with knee osteoarthritis, symptoms of hip osteoarthritis include pain and stiffness of the joint itself. Sometimes pain is felt in the groin, inner thigh, buttocks, or even the knees. Osteoarthritis of the hip may limit movement and bending, making daily activities such as dressing and putting on shoes a challenge. Osteoarthritis of the spine may show up as stiffness and pain in the neck or lower back. In some cases, the condition can put too much pressure on the spine and its nerves, causing weakness or numbness of the arms and legs.

8f2996ea-436d-4b25-91c3-e93b907130af,"There are various possible causes of hand pain, including injury to the hand, autoimmune conditions, arthritic conditions and damage to the nerves or tendons that serve the hands. The most common causes of hand pain are described in more detail in this article. A fracture or dislocation of one of the bones in the hand is a common cause of hand pain. This is usually associated with severe pain, and often there is inflammation and tenderness in the area. In most cases, patients with a fracture or dislocation of the hand will know the cause of the pain as there will be a particular incident that caused the injury. Gout is a that involves the formation of monosodium urate crystals in the body, due to the accumulation of excessive uric acid in the bloodstream. When these crystals are formed near or inside the joints of the fingers or wrist, they can cause severe hand pain. Carpal tunnel syndrome involves compression of the nerve that carries messages of sensation and movement to the hand. This can lead to sensations of pain, numbness, or tingling in the hands and fingers. In most cases the thumb, index finger, middle finger and ring finger, are affected. It tends to develop gradually and is often worse at night-time. Hand pain can be caused by osteoarthritis, which is a condition involving inflammation, swelling and bending of the joints. It can affect any joint in the body and commonly affects the joints at the middle and end of the fingers and the base of the thumb, leading to pain in these areas. Some patients may also develop a bump at the base of the thumb, which can be particularly painful during activities that involve the hands, such as writing. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease that involves the destruction of the cells that line and support the joints, which can lead to pain and inflammation in the hands. Hand pain caused by rheumatoid arthritis is often described as throbbing or aching and is usually worse in the morning, or when the joints have been inactive for an extended period of time. Biologic or targeted synthetic DMARDs reduce dementia in patients with rheumatoid arthritis Study provides novel biomarkers for predicting rheumatoid arthritis patient responsiveness to DMARDs Antidepressants are not effective for treating back pain, osteoarthritis, shows study Lupus is an autoimmune disease that can lead to inflammation and destruction of the joints in the wrist and fingers, which can lead to hand pain. A ganglion that develops close to a joint or tendon in the hands can cause pain in the area. In such cases, a small lump develops under the skin that is composed of encapsulated synovial fluid. This fluid is a viscous clear liquid that is secreted inside the joint cavities of synovial joints. It usually provides lubrication and cushioning to the joints. Ganglions most frequently develop on the wrists, hands, and fingers, causing hand pain. Stenosing tenosynovitis, also known as trigger finger, is a condition that involves clicking or locking of a tendon when the connected finger or thumb is moved towards the palm. This can cause pain and stiffness in the hand, usually at the base of the finger that is affected. Hand pain may sometimes be caused by tenosynovitis, which is a condition that involves inflammation of the fibrous sheath surrounding a tendon in the body, such as those that occur in the wrist or the fingers. De Quervain’s disease is a condition that involves swelling and thickening of the sheath that surrounds the tendons of the thumb near the wrist. This can cause pain in the thumb, wrist and hand. It differs from tenosynovitis in that it is not caused by inflammation. Raynaud’s phenomenon is a condition that is brought about by the narrowing of the blood vessels that supply the peripheral areas of the body, such as the hands. This effect is worsened when the person is exposed to cold temperatures or stress. It can lead to discoloration, numbness, and pain in the hands. http://www.arthritis.org/about-arthritis/where-it-hurts/wrist-hand-and-finger-pain/causes/hand-wrist-arthritis.php http://www.arthritis.org/about-arthritis/where-it-hurts/wrist-hand-and-finger-pain/causes/hand-wrist-injury.php http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/hand-pain/Pages/Introduction.aspx http://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases_conditions/hic_Arthritis/hic_Arthritis_of_the_Hand_and_Wrist Last Updated: Feb 26, 2019 Yolanda graduated with a Bachelor of Pharmacy at the University of South Australia and has experience working in both Australia and Italy.

The cause may be overuse, an acute injury, or even aging. Fortunately, these ailments are often relieved with treatment at home that may include ice, compression, elevation, nonprescription medications, and rest. If you are experiencing symptoms in your hand or wrist that persist after home treatment, we recommend turning to a hand and wrist specialist. Here are five symptoms that are frequently associated with common hand or wrist conditions: Numbness in your thumb, index, and middle finger is a common sign of carpal tunnel syndrome. Many patients also experience nighttime awakening. Numbness in your ring finger and small finger is often associated with cubital tunnel syndrome. Symptoms are often worst when the elbow is bent. Clicking of the fingers or a feeling that they are stuck may be a sign of trigger finger, a tendonitis of the finger flexor tendon. Pain on the radial (thumb) side of your wrist may be a symptom of Dequervains tendonitis. It is often worsened with motion of your wrist. Pain at the base of your thumb may suggest basal joint arthritis. It is typically worsened with particular motions such as opening a door or twisting a jar open.

Basically, the carpal tunnel is a narrow passageway on the palm side of your wrist which consists of bones, ligaments and most importantly the median nerve that controls the movement of your fingers. When these nerves get pinched or compressed, they result in numbness, tingling and weakness. Also Read - Get quick relief from sciatica pain with these stretches and exercises Pain and tingling in the wrist (known as the ‘pains-and-needles’ sensation) which is similar to sensation when your hand ‘falls asleep’.

Experts find it hard to pinpoint one definitive cause. Women are three times as likely to get it as men and some diseases like diabetes, gout, hypothyroidism and rheumatoid arthritis can cause the condition. While it’s widely believed that frequent typing causes the condition, the truth is that it’s observed it’s far more common among factory’s assembly line workers and those that frequently use vibrating tools. It’s also been observed among regular office workers who use keyboards for a long period of time. The basic treatment involves resting the hand and wrist and wearing a brace. Also non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen along with cold compresses to reduce pain. In more severe cases doctors give steroids to temporarily reduce inflammation around the media nerve. Sometimes local anaesthesia is used to relieve the symptoms. Sometimes patients might end up needing surgery. Once the symptoms subside, you will most likely be taught strengthening and stretching exercises to prevent pain, numbness and weakness from coming back.

a7faead9-f808-48d4-92a9-38330db0f2ca,"Arthritis is inflammation in a joint. Several forms of arthritis affect the joints in the wrist, hand and fingers. is a degenerative condition in which cartilage wears down over time. and are systemic, inflammatory diseases. Rheumatoid arthritis is the most common type to affect the fingers, except for the thumb. is usually a form of osteoarthritis. Your hand contains 19 bones (not including those that form the wrist). There are 14 phalanges, the bones that make up each finger: three in each of the index, middle, ring, and pinky fingers and two in the thumb. There are also five metacarpal bones that make up the middle part of the hand. Numerous ligaments connect the bones to each other. Tendons connect muscles in the arm or hand to the bone to enable you to move your fingers. Sheaths are tubular structures that surround part of the fingers. There are thousands of nerve endings in your fingertips. Arteries, veins, and nerves provide essential blood flow and sensation in the hand and fingers. The wrist is one of the most complicated joints in the body. It contains eight bones called carpals, which are arranged in two rows. The scaphoid, lunate, triquetral and pisiform bones move with the arm bones, and the trapezium, trapezoid, capitate, and hamate bones are connected to the bones of the palm. The carpal bones are connected by ligaments. Many tendons connecting the forearm muscles to the fingers and thumb run through the wrist. Extensor tendons on the back of the wrist straighten your fingers, while flexor tendons on the front of the wrist bend them. Nerves and blood vessels also pass through the wrist. These structures provide your wrist with exceptional range of motion. Pain and stiffness are the most common signs of wrist arthritis. These symptoms, and the swelling associated, with arthritis can severely reduce the range of motion in joints (the normal distance joints can move in certain directions). Learn more about hand and wrist arthritis and related conditions in the articles below. Hand Problems: Common Injuries, Arthritis and Trigger Finger Since osteoarthritis is caused by using a joint over time, it can be helpful to find ways to reduce the amount of stress you put on your wrist in your daily routines. For example, a person who cooks a lot may benefit from using a drying rack to let their washed pots air dry, rather than drying them with a cloth. There are many devices can help with this effort.

Assistive Devices for the Hand: Small Joint Protection Arthritis in the hands or wrist – as well as additional conditions it can cause, such and – may require physical therapy, medication and/or surgery to alleviate pain and stiffness. Exercise, as part of a comprehensive arthritis treatment plan, can improve joint mobility, muscle strength, and overall physical conditioning, and it can also help you maintain a healthy weight. A tailored exercise program guided by a physical therapist can help relieve pain and fatigue and preserve joint structure and function. People with hand or wrist arthritis often avoid physical activity because of pain, but doing so can lead to muscle loss and excessive weight gain, and these can cause other health problems. Is physical therapy for hand and wrist arthritis effective? Although medication is one part of treatment for people with arthritis, a tailored exercise program can help relieve pain and fatigue and preserve joint structure and function. What medications are effective for hand and wrist arthritis? Over-the-counter (nonprescription) (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), which include aspirin, ibuprofen and naproxen, are the most common drugs. Glucosamine, with or without chondroitin sulfate, does appear to have some affect on the inflammatory response caused by arthritic degeneration in joints, specifically in the knees. Unfortunately, glucosamine has not been shown to slow or repair degeneration in cartilage. For this reason, no specific recommendation for the use of glucosamine, with or without chondroitin sulfate, can be made. When neither physical therapy nor medications are sufficient to treat hand or wrist arthritis, surgical options generally involve either removing some degenerated bone or fusing two or more bones together to prevent further pain.

Patients with osteoarthritis may feel a deep ache at the base of the thumb, along with some swelling and perhaps a bump at the place where the thumb joins the wrist. This arthritic condition is surprisingly common in women, occurring in 25% of women over 50 years, and 50% of those over 70 years, but only 5% of men. The patient may notice the feebleness of grip and pinch, in the affected hand, as well as finding it difficult to open a door or turn a key, both of which require strong fine motor movements. To relieve such pain, which can interfere seriously with daily life activities, there are several lines of treatment. The level of treatment will be determined by many factors such as: Patient’s needs and goals, as well as the capability to follow a treatment plan properly The first step is to temporarily stop any activity, fully or partially, which is causing the pain. Secondly, a rigid splint may be placed over the hurting joint for short periods at a time. The forced immobility relieves the pain considerably when it is next put to use. The splint supports the joint, which reduces the stress on it. Long periods of splinting (for over a few weeks) are not advised as it can cause joint weakening by muscle atrophy. Ice packs are very helpful, when applied following acute pain (as after a bout of hand use for a fairly strenuous activity) since they reduce the joint temperature and the secretion of inflammatory cell signaling molecules. Warm fomentation is usually of great use in making the joint more comfortable, provided it is not actively inflamed. Over-the-counter medications such as anti-inflammatory drugs help relieve symptoms but do not help the joint to heal or repair itself. NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) may prevent further damage by preventing the production of more inflammatory chemicals that can wear away more of the joint surface. However, these drugs may cause gastritis, peptic ulceration, liver damage, or kidney damage if taken in too high doses, for too long, or in combination with certain other medications. Effectiveness of vitamin C against COVID-19 depends on its natural transporter levels Anticoagulant drug linked to greater risk of knee and hip replacements in patients with osteoarthritis Study identifies potential treatment to postpone development of osteoarthritis Later on, if the symptoms persist or worsen, intra-articular injections of corticosteroids may be given to temporary relief of symptoms. These may sometimes need to be repeated once or twice, but not very often as it can weaken the tendons. Corticosteroids are powerful anti-inflammatory drugs and are often coupled with a long-acting anesthetic. Hand therapists can help keep the affected joints flexible and strong once the acute inflammation is relieved. Exercises to build strength and stretches to keep the hand flexible are both very useful to relieve future pain as well as to prevent more damage. These strengthen the muscles which support the hand joints, thus reducing the load on the tendons and ligaments. Massage and mobilization by a physical therapist are also important at periods when the patient is in too much pain to do joint exercises. Occupational assistance such as devices like tap turners, which make it easier for arthritic fingers to turn on taps, is invaluable in helping such patients to manage their pain and keep their independence. When non-surgical therapy fails to control pain and allow normal hand or wrist movement, or when the condition causes the deformity, surgery is recommended. There are several options available, which should be discussed with the doctor. – for instance, with arthritis of the base of the thumb, this joint is reconstructed by removing one of the bones in the arthritic joint and replacing it with a packed tendon from the forearm. This provides padding to the injured joint, allows the joint to be mobile and relieves pain. or arthrodesis is done by modifying the surfaces of a painful arthritic hand or wrist joint and then holding them together using a pin, for instance, to make sure they heal as one. This eliminates movement at that joint but relieves pain. – this is usually only beneficial for patients who do not have heavy use of their hands. For instance, in many patients with rheumatoid arthritis, the joints at the finger bases are very damaged. Replacing this may allow free movement and relieve pain, but heavy loads cannot be put on the fingers as the joints are less stable and durable than the original. Most joint replacements use ceramic, sturdy plastic or metal parts. – this is a less radical form of joint replacement where only small metal parts are used to replace the worn surface of the joint alone, and the replaced surfaces typically last longer. When conventional non-surgical approaches fail, some patients are not ready to turn to surgery. Some of the following approaches may benefit this patient set: Transcutaneous electrical stimulation (TENS) – this is a device that uses electrical impulses to the skin to trigger nerve signals from the painful joints. This is because the pain signals are transmitted to the brain via the spinal cord, and the electrical impulses follow the same route. They, therefore, clog the pathway, preventing the person from feeling the pain. Nutraceuticals – this is the term for dietary supplements that are thought to be of medical value but are not in the same category of proven evidence as medications. Commonly, patients with arthritis are prescribed chondroitin and glucosamine, but their has not been proven and they should not be routinely prescribed, says NICE. Rubefacients – this refers to substances like capsaicin or menthol which trigger mild pain impulses when applied on the skin, distracting the nervous system from the more severe pain arising from the arthritic joint. As a result, they serve to reduce joint pain. Their efficacy is not proven in this condition, according to NICE, and may vary from patient to patient. Menthol-containing rubs should be avoided when using hot packs to avoid burns. Clevelandclinic.org.

One of the important nerves to the hand, the ulnar nerve, sits on the inside of the elbow & can get irritated. This can happen in several ways, often because of too frequent and/or vigorous bending/straightening of the elbow or keeping the elbow bent for too long. Other causes include neck problems and irritation of the nerves in the armpit area. A good history and physical, possibly a nerve test. The nerve supply to the little finger can be affected. A circulation issue can also account for numbness. Sometimes a simple bruise or contusion or a swollen finger can also make out feel ""numb"" or different when looking for nerve compression start at the finger and work your way up tot the neck any compression on any area can cause the finger to fell different. Although we generally use the word ""numb"" or numbness a true numb finger has no feeling at all. Maybe a better word is tingling to mean only a partial difference in sensation. Even a swollen joint from arthritis or a bruise to the finger can make the tip f a finger feel different. A swollen tendon or a trigger finger can also make the finger feel less normal. A contusion or bruise to the palm can affect the digital nerves that go to the finger. A site of compression can be a the wrist. The ulnar nerve at the wrist more commonly affects the little finger , but some people with carpal tunnel syndrome complain of little finger numbness even though we are not supposed to be ""wired"" that way. At the elbow the ulnar nerve continues up the arm and the inside of your elbow where you would think of your ""funny bone"" as residing is a site of compression that can give tingling in the little finger. Hoever usually little finger tingling from the ulnar nerve at the elbow will be accompanied by tingling on the top of the hand on the little finger side too. Finally a compressive site in the neck or at a lower cervical nerve root ( the lower part of your neck or cervical spine) can also give tingling as for circulation, there are a variety of systemic and localized conditions that affect circulation in the hand from ryanauds, a spasm of the blood vessels due to cold , to the decreased circulation ( and neve issues) of diabetes, to a disorder that is associated with trauma to the palm and interruption of normal hand circulation. Finally there are more severe conditions that can simulate 'numbness"" in arm of exretemities that are indirectly related to nerve or circulation issues should one who has little finger numbness need to worry about all these things and more? The answer is yes and no. Thats for your health care provider to determine but if the numbness continues your should seek medical attention. From a hand or orthopedic surgeons perspective: a lot of those who have numbness in the little finger have cubital tunnel syndrome, which is a chronic compression of the ulnar nerve ( your funny bone) at the elbow in the meantime think about your arm position when you are sitting at the desk or kitchen table and typing, simply sitting and being on a keyboard both your hands rotated on the keys and the inside of your elbow resting on the table or table edge can also give tingling in the little finger! those who want to know more about cubital tunnel syndrome affecting the ulnar nerve can follow the link provided. 90,000 U.S. doctors in 147 specialties are here to answer your questions or offer you advice, prescriptions, and more.

973ee0d0-5935-4013-932e-02747ab1d282,"What Are Some Causes of Numbness in the Right Thumb? What Are Some Causes of Numbness in the Right Thumb? Causes of numbness in the thumb include carpal tunnel syndrome, alcoholism, Lyme disease and multiple sclerosis, notes Mayo Clinic. Other possible causes of numbness in the thumb include amyloidosis, peripheral neuropathy, Reynaud's disease and ganglion cysts. Symptoms that accompany the numbness may include tingling or burning pain. In carpal tunnel syndrome, the median nerve in the carpal bones becomes compressed, causing numbness in the thumb. This disease is common in people between the ages of 30 and 60. Other factors leading to the syndrome include obesity, infections, bone fractures, alcohol use, rheumatoid arthritis, a cyst or tumor in the wrist and extra fluids that accumulate during menopause or pregnancy. It may lead to several symptoms including clumsiness, numbness or tingling, pain in the wrist, poor coordination of fingers, weak grip and weakness in the hand, notes the United States National Institutes of Health's MedlinePlus. Typically, numbness occurs due to damaged, compressed or irritated nerves in the arm and wrist. Infections that affect the peripheral nerves, such as diabetes, usually lead to numbness. A doctor requires detailed information about the symptoms to diagnose the condition. Patients may need to undergo several tests to confirm the cause before starting treatment. If certain drugs are causing the numbness, a doctor may prescribe alternative medications. What Features Does Infinite Campus Offer for Students?

Hand arthritis is common in the: When you have OA, the cartilage between your joints wears down and causes your bones to rub together without a cushion. The rubbing causes mild inflammation, stiffness, and pain. There are several causes, treatments, risk factors, and symptoms of hand arthritis. The symptoms of hand arthritis differ from person to person. A lot depends on the specific joints affected or the common activities that the person does. , which may be more pronounced in the morning swelling and tenderness in the knuckles or around the wrist For some people, are a sign of advanced OA. A bone spur is a hardened area of bone that attaches itself to the joint. Also, the capsule around the joint can thicken and enlarge. In hand arthritis, the enlarged capsule and bone growths are called when they occur on the joints near the fingertips. They consist of round, hard, swollen areas that develop around the joint. Heberden’s nodes are a permanent condition and often make your fingers look misshapen. People who have arthritis in the joints in the middle of the fingers can also develop swellings called Bouchard’s nodes. The exact cause of hand arthritis is unknown. The condition usually develops due to wear and tear of the joint, which occurs gradually over time. There’s also a genetic component to hand OA. Family members may develop OA at a younger age than the general population, and may have more severe disease. A healthy joint has cartilage at the end of the bone that cushions and allows smooth movement. In OA, cartilage deteriorates, exposing the underlying bone, which triggers joint pain and stiffness. have a family member who also has degenerative joint pain of the hands have a job that requires a lot of hand work such as manufacturing The more you use your hands, the more wear and tear you place on the joints and the cartilage that supports them. There’s also a higher risk factor for hand arthritis if you’re female. Women are more likely to develop osteoarthritis. People born with malformed joints or defective cartilage are also more likely to develop this condition. Diagnosing hand arthritis involves an evaluation and tests. Your doctor will check the joints in your hand for signs of OA. In some cases, your doctor will also order an X-ray to look for cartilage loss and other signs of damage. This can indicate arthritis of the hand and that they should look for potential bone spurs and erosions. Rarely, your doctor might order an MRI to look more closely at your bones and soft tissue. Symptoms of hand OA can be similar to other joint conditions. Your doctor may also order blood tests, especially to exclude other types of arthritis like . Some doctors even complete a to check for signs of inflammation in the wrist joints. These tests can help your doctor determine if your hand arthritis may be related to crystal deposition diseases, like or . can provide some relief during flare ups. For many, over-the-counter (OTC) such as ibuprofen and naproxen are effective. Those with severe OA may need a stronger prescription. NSAIDs are also available in topical form. The FDA has approved (Voltaren) gel as a treatment for osteoarthritis. Your doctor may also prescribe injections if oral drugs aren’t doing the trick. An injection of anti-inflammatory medicines, usually a steroid, and anesthetics can calm the inflamed joints quickly and last for several months. Stiff, achy fingers can impact how you use your hands, making your daily routine more challenging. People with OA in their hands may find range-of-motion exercises beneficial. Do several times each day to help maintain flexibility in your hands: Bend your middle knuckles as if you were making a claw with your hands. Then straighten your fingers again. Form a fist with your fingers and then unfurl your fingers. Work slowly to avoid pain. Touch your thumb to each fingertip in turn. If stretching your thumb hurts, don’t force it. Walk your fingers up a wall and then back down. A few simple lifestyle changes can help manage hand OA. You may find relief with: splints on your wrist, thumb, or fingers for support arthritis-friendly tools that have padding to ease grip Some people have found OA relief in the hands with anti-arthritis gloves. These gloves are designed to reduce pain and swelling and may gradually improve mobility in your hands. There are also ring splints that can be made to support individual joints and are made to look like jewelry. recommends an all-around healthy diet. This includes an abundance of fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and lean meats, as well as minimizing your sugar intake. Eating produce high in flavonoids may help, too. Fruits and vegetables that are dark colored contain substances that can control inflammation throughout the body. Surgery is another option if your OA doesn’t respond to diet, medications, and lifestyle changes, and is interfering with daily activities. Surgical treatment for hand arthritis includes fusing the bones on the sides of the arthritic joint together, or reconstructing the joints. Fusion limits the movement of the joint, but reduces pain and stiffness. Reconstruction uses soft tissue from other places in your body or other inert materials to replace the cartilage that has worn down. OA of the hand is a progressive disease. This means it starts off slowly and gets worse as the years pass. There’s no cure, but treatment can help manage the condition. Early detection and treatment for hand arthritis is key to maintaining a healthy active life with OA. Understanding possible causes and risk factors for hand arthritis helps prevent or slow OA. If you have , managing your blood sugar reduces your risk. A high glucose level affects how cartilage responds to stress. Diabetes can also trigger inflammation which can cause cartilage loss. Aim for at least 30 minutes of exercise 5 times a week. Additionally, take extra precautions when exercising or playing sports to avoid joint injury in your hands. Fractures, dislocations, and ligament tears increase the risk of osteoarthritis. OA of the hands is a disease that causes pain and limited mobility due to joint inflammation and cartilage loss. Untreated OA of the hands can lead to severe hand mobility and abnormal form. The good news is that hand OA is a treatable and manageable condition. Treatment for OA involves pain medication, exercises, and more. Preventive measures don’t rule out the possibility of developing hand arthritis, but they can help lower your risk. Talk to your doctor about your OA or your risks for developing it. With treatment, it’s possible to maintain a healthy, active lifestyle. — If you have arthritis that affects your hands, we'll show you seven exercises that can improve strength, ease pain, and increase range of motion… When osteoarthritis develops in your hands, fingers, and knuckle joints, the effects are painful and may ultimately lead to a loss of function.

e4c8f76e-bf45-47ac-899a-862dc5f16a48,"Osteoarthritis (OA), also known as degenerative joint disease, is the most common form of arthritis—the medical term for a wide variety of disorders that involve inflammation of a joint. OA is a process that begins with the gradual destruction of cartilage, the smooth lining of a joint that reduces friction and absorbs shock. As the disease progresses gradually over the years, the cartilage cracks and flakes off, leading to pain and sometimes joint deformity. All joints may be affected, but it is most common in the fingers, ankles and feet, knees, hips, and spine (especially the neck and lower back). More than 30 million Americans have osteoarthritis. As people age, they exhibit increasing signs of OA (as seen on X-rays), including a narrowing of the space naturally found in joints, a thinning of the cartilage at joint surfaces, changes in the texture of the cartilage from smooth to course, and the formation of bone spurs (overgrowths of bone). But people may never experience symptoms or not experience them until much later in life. Typically OA has been divided into two types, but this division is thought of as artificial and may become obsolete as more underlying causes of the disease are discovered. Primary (also called idiopathic) osteoarthritis, which results from normal wear and tear associated with aging, most commonly affects thumb joints and the end joints of other fingers, as well as the hips, knees, neck, and lower spine. Secondary osteoarthritis is linked with some underlying condition, such as an injury to a joint, a disease such as gout, or abnormal stress on joints (due to obesity, posture problems, or occupational overuse, for example). In some people symptoms of OA remain mild and follow a waxing-waning pattern. In others, symptoms grow progressively worse until they are disabling. Because the joints become stiff and painful, a person’s natural tendency is to minimize movement. Unfortunately, this can simply lead to a wasting of the muscles and to stiffer joints—and consequently more pain—since inactivity weakens the muscles that stabilize joints. For some people, symptoms remain mild or nonexistent, while for others, symptoms worsen to the point of becoming disabling. They include: Joint stiffness and pain that is aggravated by movement, relieved by rest. Limited movement and loss of flexibility in the joints. Joint instability, in which, for instance, the knee gives way or buckles. Joint deformity in the finger, foot and knee joints (advanced osteoarthritis). Many interrelated factors play a role in osteoarthritis. While time and long-term use may wear away the cartilage, the cushioning material of the joints, OA is known to be not simply wear and tear but a disease that prevents the cartilage from repairing and renewing itself normally. Aging is one of the strongest risk factors for OA, with more than 80 percent of people over age 55 having it versus almost none of those ages 25 to 34. Another strong risk factor is trauma to joints related to occupation as well as repetitive joint stress from, for example, sports or other physical activity. Obesity increases the risk of developing arthritis in the back, hips, and knees. There is also a . Women have an almost three times higher risk of OA than men, and they are more likely to experience arapid deterioration in their joints. It’s not clear why women are at higher risk, but hormones may play a role. While there may be certain genetic factors that increase the risk of OA, it’s not clear how they interact with the other risk factors for the condition. For occasional mild joint pain and stiffness, there is no cause for concern since the symptoms typically clear in a matter of a few weeks. This is especially so if arthritis occurs in the fingers. However, if symptoms become more severe, especially if they affect your weight-bearing joints and therefore your daily activities, you may need to seek professional help. First, see a doctor to make sure your problem really is osteoarthritis. There is no cure at present that can stop or reverse OA. You can, however, help slow the disease’s progress, decrease joint pain, and improve function with the following measures. Cold packs, warm compresses, heat lamps, and warm baths or showers may bring periods of relief from the throbbing pain or stiffness associated with arthritis. Experiment with both cold and heat to see what works best. Apply the heat or cold to the painful joint for 20 minutes three times a day. . A splint, brace, crutches, or cane may provide the support you need, eliminating or reducing stress on a painful affected joint. A regular exercise program designed by your physician or a physical therapist is one of the few effective therapies recommended to slow down the development and progression of arthritis. The program should be aimed at restoring, maintaining, and increasing flexibility, muscle strength, and overall fitness. Excellent activities include tai chi, swimming, water aerobics, walking, and bicycling as well as strengthening (especially the thigh muscles, or quadriceps for lower extremity OA; a squeeze ball for OA of the fingers) and stretching exercises. For more on exercise for OA, see inset below. Many people with osteoarthritis can maintain flexibility, and even restore it to some degree, through a well-designed exercise program that is implemented gradually and followed regularly. Increasing evidence indicates that extra weight damages the weight-bearing joints and speeds up the course of arthritis. Reducing your weight to acceptable levels may help stop or reverse the process. Capsaicin creams can be beneficial for arthritis pain. Capsaicin, the substance that makes hot chili peppers hot, is an ingredient in some nonprescription salves and lotions. Capsaicin acts partly as a counterirritant and partly as a suppressant of pain impulses. Capsaicin creates a little diversionary pain that masks the real one, but it also blocks substance P, which is present in aching joints as part of the body’s pain-and-inflammation chemistry. You may need to use the cream three or four times daily, and you may not notice any improvement until you’ve applied the cream for a week or more. A number of drugs, including over-the-counter pain relievers, can ease arthritis pain. You may need to experiment to find the most effective drug and dosage. For mild symptoms, it’s worth trying low doses of acetaminophen (such as Tylenol) first, since it doesn’t carry the risk of stomach bleeding that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), and naproxen (Aleve) do. Note that acetaminophen should never be taken if you drink excessive amounts of alcohol, since that can result in serious liver damage. If acetaminophen doesn’t provide adequate relief, talk with your doctor about trying an NSAID. Note that there’s no evidence that NSAIDs slow the progression of disease. It’s not entirely clear how much OA can be prevented. But there is evidence showing that regular physical activity, such as walking or running, may have a protective effect against knee OA, perhaps by reducing pro-inflammatory chemicals in the knee that negatively impact joint health. There is also research suggesting that controlling blood sugar may be beneficial, since high blood sugar levels can make joints more sensitive to stress. You may be able to slow the progress of the disease by following the self-care measures outlined above. The most helpful measures are losing weight (if you are overweight), gradually starting an exercise program, avoiding any repetitive activities that can abnormally stress the joints, and seeking the care of a doctor, physical therapist, or other health care provider at the first sign of joint symptoms as a result of work or sports activities. Two nutritional supplements—glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate—have long been promoted as nothing less than “miracle cures” for arthritis. If joint pain or stiffness begin to interfere with daily activities, call your doctor. Your doctor will take a history and perform a thorough exam of your joints to determine the presence and extent of arthritis. X-rays may be taken and, in rare cases, fluid may be drawn from an affected joint through a needle for analysis in a laboratory. If you need pain relievers on a daily basis, you and your doctor should discuss the risks and benefits of different medications. If over-the-counter pain relievers don’t help enough, your doctor may suggest that you try a prescription NSAID, such as the COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib (Celebrex). An alternative to oral NSAIDs are topical NSAIDs, which can be applied as a patch or gel. NSAIDs can cause gastrointestinal bleeding, increased risk of cardiovascular disease, and kidney or liver damage; acetaminophen also poses risks. So if you are taking any pain reliever on a long-term basis, you should get medical advice. If none of these drugs is effective when combined with lifestyle measures, such as exercise and weight loss, your physician may recommend an intra-joint injection of corticosteroids. But these can worsen joint damage if used frequently. Injections of hyaluronic acid, a lubricating compound naturally found in joints, or platelet rich plasma, a concentrated component of blood said to promote healing, may be recommended for knee osteoarthritis pain. Although hyaluronic acid may provide some pain relief in mild knee OA, it’s expensive, and the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons doesn’t recommend it. Platelet rich plasma injections have shown promise in younger people with mild knee OA, but more high-quality studies are needed. When joint pain and stiffness become severely debilitating, there is a range of surgical procedures that can make arthritis more tolerable, including partial or total joint replacement surgery . Each has its own benefits and limitations, and you should always be sure that the surgery is your best option. Fortunately, most people who have osteoarthritis will never need to have surgery.

However, we rarely realize how much we rely on them until something goes wrong. Hand and wrist complications can be the result of common conditions like: Hand nerve entrapment, including and cubital tunnel syndrome: occurs when one of the major nerves to the hand is compressed. It causes pain, numbness and tingling in the hand or arm. : Tissue underneath the skin thickens and tightens, causing the fingers to be pulled inward. Trigger finger (or stenosing tenosynovitis): Part of the tendon sheath in the finger becomes inflamed, leading to pain, stiffness and locking when you bend or straighten the finger. : Tendons on the thumb side of the wrist are inflamed, causing pain while grasping or making a fist. This is the most common form of tendonitis in the wrist. : A common source of hand pain that results from the loss of cartilage cushion between joints. Symptoms include numbness or tingling, pain, reduced range of motion and swelling.  These may be also exacerbated by activities that require pressure directly on the wrist, like cycling or yoga. Additionally, texting, typing or certain sleeping positions can irritate joints in the hand and wrist. “Don’t ignore early signs of pain, numbness and tingling or stiffness. The sooner you address your symptoms with a healthcare professional, the quicker your recovery and return to your valued activities will be.” – , Director of the Hand and Upper Extremity Therapy Center at HSS Setting up your work space properly can be helpful in preventing hand and wrist discomfort. This includes your desk at work or home and in your kitchen.  Also, “pay attention to how you use your body on a daily basis during common activities,” says Nicholas Maroldi, Director of the Hand Therapy Center at HSS. “Sitting with your shoulders forward, gripping your phone tightly with one hand or keeping your limbs in an awkward position for an extended time can lead to discomfort. Make sure to take regular breaks, stretch and move throughout the day.” What are the treatment options for hand and wrist pain? Gentle stretching and exercise may help decrease stiffness, build strength and restore normal range of motion and function. A physical therapist may recommend the use of splints or braces, special devices to help with normal daily activities, and exercises to regain strength and promote normal function. Over-the-counter or prescription anti-inflammatory medications may help to reduce pain with certain conditions. Cortisone injections may be used to treat some conditions like carpal tunnel syndrome, trigger finger, arthritis and tendonitis. Depending on the type and severity of the condition, conservative treatment options may not always relieve symptoms.

This common condition happens when the median nerve — one of the main nerves that run from your arm to your hand — is pinched, squeezed, or damaged as it goes through the wrist. Carpal tunnel syndrome can cause the following in the hand, wrist, and arm: and carpal tunnel syndrome are two distinct conditions that can happen on their own. However, sometimes arthritis can lead to carpal tunnel syndrome. This means that if you have arthritis in your wrist or hand, you might have a risk of getting carpal tunnel syndrome.

The travels down your arm from the shoulder and runs through the carpal tunnel into your hand. There are also nine tendons going through the carpal tunnel. This makes it a tight squeeze. Any amount of swelling in the tendons or changes to the bone can put pressure on or damage the median nerve. This can make it harder for your brain to send nerve messages to your hand and fingers. The median nerve is the main power supply to the muscles in the hand, thumb, and fingers. Think of a garden hose that’s been squeezed or bent so there’s a kink in it.

The hand is made up of many different bones, muscles, and ligaments that allow for a large amount of movement and dexterity. There are 3 major types of bones in the hand itself, including: Phalanges. The 14 bones that are found in the fingers of each hand and also in the toes of each foot. Each finger has 3 phalanges (the distal, middle, and proximal). Only the thumb has 2 phalanges. Metacarpal bones. The 5 bones that make up the middle part of the hand. Carpal bones. The 8 bones that create the wrist. The carpal bones are connected to 2 bones of the arm, the ulnar bone and the radius bone. Many muscles, ligaments, and sheaths can be found within the hand. The muscles are the structures that can contract, allowing movement of the bones in the hand. The ligaments are fibrous tissues that help bind together the joints in the hand.

Heberden’s nodes are bumps that affect the part of the finger that’s . Another type of bump, Bouchard’s nodes, affect the joint that’s nearest the hand. Heberden’s nodes are described as “bony swellings” that form on your hands as a result of osteoarthritis. They’re named after physician William Heberden Sr., a doctor in the 1700s. He came up with the description of these swellings. These firm growths occur on the finger joints nearest the fingertip, also called the distal interphalangeal joints. Similar swellings located on the lower joints, or the proximal interphalangeal joints, are called Bouchard’s nodes. The joints in these areas have that cushions and protects the surface of your bones. Osteoarthritis may often result from the wear and tear that comes with aging, but it can develop after an injury. In the case of Heberden’s nodes, there’s a degree of uncertainty about how the disease process evolves. It also that there may be some changes in soft tissue, as well as bone. The cartilage can degrade and become unable to protect your bones. Without this protection, the bones begin to rub against each other. This process can destroy existing bone and cause significant pain, which can be an early sign of OA and the development of nodes. Over time, the pain may lessen, but the deformity progresses. As the cartilage continues to break down, new bone grows alongside the existing bone in the form of nodes or bony spurs. By the time the nodes appear, your fingers may have become stiff, and the pain may have lessened. Heberden’s nodes tend to appear after severe joint damage has already occurred, so they’re often seen as a marker of advanced OA, which is referred to as nodal OA. If you have Heberden’s nodes, you can often see them by examining the end joints on your fingers. Tiny firm-hard swellings may extend from the joint closest to your fingernail. In many cases, your fingers may twist or become crooked as the nodes form. They can affect the fingers or thumb and are most common on the index and middle fingers. They’re often, but not always, painful when they begin to appear. For older women with gout and hypertension and taking a diuretic, such as hydrochlorothiazide, gout can deposit crystals in the nodes, causing acute inflammation.

Arthritis literally means “inflamed joint.” Normally a joint consists of two smooth, cartilage-covered bone surfaces that fit together as a matched set and that move smoothly against one other. Arthritis results when these smooth surfaces become irregular and don’t fit together well anymore and essentially “wear out.” Arthritis can affect any joint in the body, but it is most noticeable when it affects the hands and fingers. Each hand has 19 bones, plus 8 small bones and the two forearm bones that form the wrist. Arthritis of the hand can be both painful and disabling. The most common forms of arthritis in the hand are osteoarthritis, post-traumatic arthritis (after an injury), and rheumatoid arthritis. Other causes of arthritis of the hand are infection, gout, and psoriasis. Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease in which the cushioning cartilage that covers the bone surfaces at the joints begins to wear out. It may be caused by simple “wear and tear” on joints, or it may develop after an injury to a joint. In the hand, osteoarthritis most often develops in three sites (see Figure 1): At the base of the thumb, where the thumb and wrist come together (the trapezio-metacarpal, or basilar, joint) At the end joint closest to the finger tip (the distal interphalangeal or DIP joint) At the middle joint of a finger (the proximal interphalangeal or PIP joint) Stiffness, swelling, and pain are symptoms common to all forms of arthritis in the hand. With osteoarthritis, bony nodules may develop at the middle, or PIP, joint of the finger (Bouchard’s nodes), and at the end-joints, or DIP, of the finger (Heberden’s nodes) (see Figure 2). A deep, aching pain at the base of the thumb is typical of osteoarthritis of the basilar joint. Swelling and a bump at the base of the thumb where it joins the wrist may also be observed. Grip and pinch strength may be diminished, causing difficulty with activities such as opening jars or turning keys. Pain, swelling, stiffness, and diminished strength are also seen with osteoarthritis of the wrist. How is osteoarthritis diagnosed?Your doctor will examine you and determine whether you have similar symptoms in other joints and assess the impact of the arthritis on your life and activities. The clinical appearance of the hands and fingers helps to diagnose the type of arthritis. X-rays will also show certain characteristics of osteoarthritis, such as narrowing of the joint space, the formation of bony outgrowths (osteophytes or “nodes”), and the development of dense, hard areas of bone along the joint margins. Treatment is designed to relieve pain and restore function. Anti-inflammatory or other analgesic medication may be of benefit in relieving pain. Brief periods of rest may help if the arthritis has flared up. You may also be advised to wear finger or wrist splints at night and for selected activities. Often soft sleeves may be of some benefit when the rigid splints are too restrictive, especially when the arthritis is affecting the joint at the base of your thumb. Heat treatment  in the form of warm wax or paraffin baths might help, and when severe swelling is present, cold modalities may be of help. It is important to maintain motion in the fingers and use the hand as productively as possible. Hand therapy is often helpful with these exercises, splints, and modalities. A cortisone injection can often provide relief of symptoms, but does not cure the arthritis. Surgery is usually not advised unless these more conservative treatments fail. Surgery is indicated when the patient either has too much pain or too little function. In most cases, the patient knows best and actually tells the doctor when it is time for surgery. The goal is to restore as much function as possible and to eliminate the pain or reduce it to a tolerable level. One type of surgery is joint fusion, in which the arthritic surface is removed and the bones on each side of the joint are fused together, eliminating motion from the problem joint. Joint fusion may be used to relieve pain and correct deformities that interfere with functioning. Another approach is joint reconstruction, in which the degenerated joint surface is removed in order to eliminate the rough, irregular bone-to-bone contact that causes pain and restricts motion. Once the degenerated portion of the joint surface is removed, it may be replaced with rolled-up soft tissue, such as a tendon, or with a joint replacement implant. Which type of surgery is used depends on the particular joint(s) involved, your activities, and your own needs. Your hand surgeon can help you decide which type of surgery is the most appropriate for you.

Other conditions, such as arthritis, tendonitis and other nerve involvement, need to be ruled out before diagnosing carpal tunnel syndrome. Physicians can diagnose carpal tunnel syndrome by history of the symptoms, physical examination and electrical testing, and in some cases by use of ultrasound or MRI. Carpal tunnel syndrome can be treated effectively with medications, splinting, and steroid injections in the wrist and/or surgery. Carpal tunnel syndrome is possibly the most common nerve disorder experienced today. It affects 4 – 10 million Americans and is usually very treatable. Middle-aged to older individuals are more likely to develop the syndrome than younger persons, and females three times more frequently than males. Carpal tunnel syndrome symptoms range from mild occasional numbness in the fingers to hand weakness, loss of feeling and loss of hand function. Because of widespread familiarity, people often attribute any discomfort or pain in the hand or wrist to carpal tunnel syndrome. However, there are many other conditions which can cause similar complaints, so it is important to know the difference. Carpal tunnel syndrome is possibly the most common nerve disorder experienced today. The carpal tunnel is located at the wrist on the palm side of the hand just beneath the skin surface (palmar surface). Eight small wrist bones form three sides of the tunnel, giving rise to the name carpal tunnel. The remaining side of the tunnel, the palmar surface, is composed of soft tissues, consisting mainly of a ligament called the transverse carpal ligament. This ligament stretches over the top of the tunnel. The median nerve and nine flexor tendons to the fingers pass through the carpal tunnel. Flexor tendons help flex or bend the fingers. When the median nerve in the wrist is squeezed (by swollen tissues, for example), it slows or blocks nerve impulses from travelling through the nerve. Because the median nerve provides muscle function and feeling in the hand, this causes symptoms ranging from mild occasional numbness to hand weakness, loss of feeling and loss of hand function. Usually carpal tunnel syndrome affects only one hand, but can affect both at the same time, causing symptoms in the thumb and the index, middle and ring fingers. In addition to numbness, patients with carpal tunnel syndrome may experience tingling, a pins and needle sensation or burning of the hand occasionally extending up to the forearm. Frequently, symptoms appear in the morning after a person wakes up, but they can also happen during the night and interrupt their sleep. Symptoms can occur with certain activities such as driving, holding a book or other repetitive activity with the hands, especially activities that require a person to grasp something for long periods of time or bend their wrist. Activities that require use of the hands, such as buttoning a shirt, may become difficult, and carpal tunnel sufferers may drop things more easily. Individuals will often shake their hands trying to obtain relief and may feel that their hand is swollen when no swelling is present. Because numbness and tingling may be mild and occur only periodically, many do not seek medical help. However, the disease can progress to more persistent numbness and burning. In some severe and chronic cases of carpal tunnel syndrome, loss of muscle mass occurs at the base of the thumb on the palm side of the hand. In these instances, especially when untreated, individuals can experience hand weakness, impaired use of the hand, and loss of sensation in their hand due to permanent nerve and muscle damage. Carpal tunnel syndrome may occur in patients who are pregnant, overweight or have various medical conditions, including thyroid disease, diabetes or arthritis, or injuries such as wrist fractures. It is still debated whether repetitive work activities cause carpal tunnel syndrome, but it is thought that some repetitive hand activities, especially motions that can produce vibrations, can worsen the symptoms. Just as frequently, the syndrome occurs on its own. However, many other conditions also can be responsible for symptoms of pain, swelling, numbness or weakness in the hands, such as diseases of the nerves located anywhere from the neck to the wrist. The pain and swelling in the hand joints and wrists caused by arthritis also can be responsible. For example, pain at the base of the thumb is commonly caused by . – an inflammation of the tendons that connect muscles to bones – can cause pain, swelling, and impaired use of the hand or wrist. can cause numbness and burning of the fingers as a result of cold exposure and sometimes due to autoimmune diseases. Raynaud’s also causes fingers to have a whitish, bluish or reddish color at various times; color changes are not seen in carpal tunnel syndrome. Health care professionals should exclude these and other diseases before diagnosing carpal tunnel syndrome. How do physicians diagnose carpal tunnel syndrome? Diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome based on an accurate description of the symptoms a patient is experiencing. During physical examination, testing may identify weakness of the muscles supplied by the median nerve in the hand, including some thumb muscles affected by the syndrome. There may be decreased sensation in the hand when pricked with a pin or lightly touched. Bending the wrist at a 90 degree angle for one minute may cause symptoms to appear in the hand (Phalen test), or tapping on the wrist with a reflex hammer may cause an electric shock-like sensation (Tinel Sign). Late in the disease, the muscles might be thinning or declining at the base of the thumb. Health care professionals can confirm the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome and determine its severity with a two-part electrical test called the nerve conduction test. The nerve conduction test is the strongest evidence for carpal tunnel syndrome. During the first part of the test, a small electrode that generates a mild electrical current is placed on the skin on the elbow side of the tunnel. This current stimulates the median nerve. The impulse from the stimulation travels down the nerve, through the tunnel, and to the hand – where the doctor will measure how long it took for the impulse to get there. If the median nerve is damaged, the impulse will take longer than expected to get to the hand. The worse the nerve damage is, the longer it will take for the impulse to get to the hand. The second part of the test is called electromyography. It measures how badly the muscle is functioning. A small needle is placed in various muscles that receive impulses from the median nerve. The electrical impulses in the muscle are measured when the muscle is not being used and when the muscle is being used. If the median nerve is severely squeezed, these muscles can be affected and will not perform normally during the test. Diagnostic ultrasonography and MRI have been used to help diagnose carpal tunnel syndrome and exclude other causes of hand and wrist symptoms. These technologies can identify swelling of the median nerve and abnormalities of the tunnel wall, its contents and surrounding area. They can also help determine why the median nerve is being squeezed, or compressed. For example, inflammation of structures in the tunnel like inflamed tendons might be causing the median nerve to be compressed. This can occur in . Other tendon abnormalities, such as excessive fat in the tunnel (also called a ganglion) also can be seen using MRI. Pain medications such as acetaminophen and can be used for symptom relief. Placing a splint on the affected wrist, especially at night, can help keep the wrist straight during the night and decrease the pressure on the median nerve. These splints are available in most drug stores and may relieve symptoms, especially in milder cases. A cortisone injection into the carpal tunnel area often is helpful in relieving symptoms for weeks to months at a time and can be repeated. If an underlying disease like hypothyroidism (an underactive thyroid) or rheumatoid arthritis is causing the carpal tunnel syndrome, then treatment of the disease also may relieve symptoms. When the above measures fail to relieve symptoms, surgery may be needed to open the carpal tunnel and relieve the pressure on the median nerve. This is known as a carpal tunnel release. In severe cases, physicians may consider surgery early on before trying other methods. The surgery may be an open surgical procedure or an endoscopic procedure and often can be done on an outpatient basis.

If you buy through links on this page, we may earn a small commission. Osteoarthritis (OA) is a form of degenerative joint pain caused by wear and tear on your joints. As you age, the cartilage that cushions your joints starts to wear down, causing the bones to rub together. The bone-on-bone action leads to inflammation of the joints. most commonly affects the joints in your arms and legs, including your fingers, wrists, knees, ankles, and hips. The lower back is also a common source of OA pain. Let your doctor know if you’re experiencing the following early symptoms of OA. “Oh, my aching back” is a phrase you’ve no doubt heard before. You may have even uttered it yourself. People with arthritis are all too familiar with an aching , , , and . The ache of early arthritis can be classified in two different ways: and tenderness. You might also feel sharper pain when moving your affected joint in a certain way, such as when opening a jar with arthritic fingers. Tenderness is the discomfort you feel when pressing down on the joint. Tenderness can also include visible in the area of the joint, but this is more common in advanced stages of OA. Along with joint pain comes . Joint stiffness is normal when you first wake up or have been sitting at your desk all day. It’s also a sign of early OA. That wooden feeling that makes you feel sluggish and slow might make you want to head back to bed, but resist the urge. People with arthritis often start to feel better once they have warmed up their joints through some or even just going about their daily routines. Cartilage is meant to be a shock absorber that helps your joints move smoothly. When cartilage wears down, the bone-to-bone rubbing can produce a number of abnormal sensations. Grating of the joints is common in people with OA. It’s the manifestation of the bones rubbing together. You might also feel or hear your joints clicking or when you move. People in the early stages of arthritis may notice that moving the affected areas of their bodies is not as easy as it once was. Joint stiffness and pain can contribute to loss of flexibility, also called . Range of motion is the extent to which you can move your joints in their normal patterns. For example, fully bending and extending your knee is its range of motion. If you have arthritis, you might not be able to bend your knee as far. Loss of flexibility is usually a very gradual process. Pain, tenderness, and joint stiffness tend to be limited to very specific times in the early stages of osteoarthritis. You might notice your hips hurt after a game of basketball, or that your back is stiff first thing in the morning. As degenerative arthritis progresses, however, you might have achy joints even when you’re at rest. In the early phase of arthritis, the cartilage between your joints becomes worn and torn as well as inflamed. The wear-and-tear process leads to loss of water in the joint, which causes the cartilage to become hard. Hardened cartilage makes moving the surrounding joint more difficult. The loss of cartilage is a slow process. Some people have early arthritis symptoms for years before the disease progresses. You and your healthcare provider can create an together to relieve arthritis pain. , braces to support the joint, and range-of-motion exercises can help you maintain independence and an active lifestyle. — — Regenokine is a treatment for joint pain and inflammation.

By: | Edited by: | Tags:        People with type 2 diabetes have an increased risk of osteoarthritis, possibly due to diabetes-induced obesity. Diabetes and joint pain are generally believed to be conditions that are not connected to each other. However, can affect the muscles and skeleton, leading to joint pain and other issues. Also Read - Winter can exacerbate arthritis pain: Here’s how to deal with it Diabetes causes problems in the Musculoskeletal System which is our muscles, bones, joints, ligaments and tendons. This condition restricts the movements of the body and leads to stiffness, muscle pain,. Symptoms of diabetes also include deformities, pins and needles sensations in the arms or legs. Also Read - Type 2 diabetes: Are you experiencing diarrhea? The lesser-known sign of the condition Many diabetic patients suffer from hand abnormalities like carpal tunnel syndrome or pain, numbness and tingling in the hand and arm, dupuytren’s contracture, trigger finger, a catching or locking of the fingers, mainly because of changes in small blood vessels and nerves. Here, let me guide you through some of them. Also Read - Blood sugar spike due to COVID-19 could kill even non-diabetics It is a deformity in which one or more fingers are bent towards the palm. The condition is generally caused by the thickening/scarring of connective tissue in the palm or fingers, eventually leaving the patient unable to fully straighten one or more fingers. Steroid injections help reduce the inflammation in these cases. Also called Diabetic Cheiroarthropathy, it is a disorder in which the skin on the hands thickens and becomes waxy, eventually leading to trouble with finger movements. It often affects only one shoulder, causes shoulder pain and limits the range of motion. Early aggressive physical therapy can help preserve the range of motion in the joint. It is also known as neuropathic joint and occurs when a joint deteriorates because of nerve damage. It might lead to numbness and tingling or loss of sensation in the affected joints and it primarily affects the feet. They may become warm, red and swollen and unstable or deformed. If detected early, progression can be slowed. The use of orthotic supports to the affected joint and surrounding structures and limiting weight-bearing activities can help. Both rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and type 1 diabetes are autoimmune disorders. In RA, the immune system attacks tissues in the joints, causing swelling, pain, and deformities, whereas in type 1 diabetes, the immune system attacks the pancreas, stopping the production of insulin. Pain and swelling are the primary characteristics, and symptoms can come and go without warning. There is no cure for autoimmune diseases, so the focus of treatment is to reduce inflammation that causes symptoms. Both conditions can be improved by some arthritis medications that will help in decreasing these levels. This condition is affecting millions of people worldwide and is the most common form of arthritis. It is a joint disorder that is characterized by the breakdown of joint cartilage. It may affect any joint in the body and may cause joint pain, swelling and stiffness, as well as loss of joint flexibility or movement. People with type 2 diabetes have an increased risk of osteoarthritis, possibly due to diabetes-induced obesity rather than diabetes itself. Few of its treatment involves exercising and maintaining a healthy weight, physical therapy, caring for and resting the affected joint, medications for pain, and surgery such as knee or hip replacement (joint arthroplasty). In such cases, complementary treatments like acupuncture and massage may be helpful for managing pain. Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH), is also called as Forestier disease. It is a type of arthritis, hardening of tendons and ligaments, mainly around the spine. DISH may be associated with type 2 diabetes, perhaps due to factors that promote new bone growth. Symptoms include pain, stiffness or decreased range of motion. If DISH affects the spine, one may experience stiffness in the back or neck. Treatment involves managing symptoms, usually with pain relievers and in rare cases, surgery. The musculoskeletal complications of diabetes are common and can lead to significant pain and disability. They usually occur in patients with poorly controlled diabetes of long duration and complications. Early recognition of these complications and multidisciplinary management between diabetes, orthopaedics and rheumatology specialists are necessary. Eating a balanced diet, getting regular exercise (including weight-bearing exercises), controlling blood glucose and maintaining a healthy weight can help improve symptoms and pain control. Lifestyle improvements along with careful medical interventions are key to managing joint pain. Controlling the underlying diabetic condition will go a long way towards improving the quality of life for patients.

The median nerve carries the sense of touch to the thumb and most of the next 2 fingers, and controls movement for some of the hand muscles. This nerve runs from the spinal cord down the arm then through the carpal tunnel — a narrow passageway in the wrist with just enough room for the tendons and nerves that pass through it. When the tendons become swollen or thickened, there is less space for the median nerve, and it can become compressed. The most common symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome include: tingling or numbness in your fingers or the palm of your hand that feels like pins and needles, mainly in the thumb and next 2 fingers in your wrist or hand, which can spread up your arm or down to your fingers weakness in your hands, making it hard to grip things Symptoms are usually worse in the hand you use the most (your dominant hand), but the condition can affect both hands. Over time, people with carpal tunnel syndrome might find that they slowly lose strength and movement in their hand and wrist. So it’s important to see your doctor if you think you may have carpal tunnel syndrome. — Use healthdirect's joint pain and swelling and find out if you need to seek medical help. Carpal tunnel syndrome can be caused by anything that makes the nerves or tendons larger, or makes the tunnel that they run through smaller. This includes: a wrist or arm injury, such as a sprain or fracture activities that involve repetitive use (overuse) of the wrist and hand, including using vibrating tools rheumatoid arthritis and other joint disorders or connective tissue disorders Sometimes, carpal tunnel syndrome just happens without any obvious cause. Women aged 40 to 60, pregnant women, people with arthritis, people who put on weight rapidly and people who use their hands repeatedly in their work are more at risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome. Your doctor will ask about your symptoms, then you may have further tests to see how quickly the median nerve passes messages through the carpal tunnel. Your doctor may also request blood tests to rule out other associated conditions, such as , or x-rays, particularly if you have or have bone changes. — healthdirect's can help you find doctors, pharmacies, hospitals and other health services. — Preparing for an appointment?

Rheumatoid arthritis: Comprehensive overview covers signs, symptoms, and treatment of this inflammatory arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic inflammatory disorder that can affect more than just your joints. In some people, the condition also can damage a wide variety of body systems, including the skin, eyes, lungs, heart, and blood vessels. An autoimmune disorder, rheumatoid arthritis occurs when your immune system mistakenly attacks your own body's tissues. Unlike the wear-and-tear damage of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis affects the lining of your joints, causing a painful swelling that can eventually result in bone erosion and joint deformity. The inflammation associated with rheumatoid arthritis is what can damage other parts of the body as well. While new types of medications have improved treatment options dramatically, severe rheumatoid arthritis can still cause physical disabilities. Signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis may include: Joint stiffness that is usually worse in the mornings and after inactivity Early rheumatoid arthritis tends to affect your smaller joints first—particularly the joints that attach your fingers to your hands and your toes to your feet. As the disease progresses, symptoms often spread to the wrists, knees, ankles, elbows, hips, and shoulders. In most cases, symptoms occur in the same joints on both sides of your body. About 40% of the people who have rheumatoid arthritis also experience signs and symptoms that don't involve the joints. Rheumatoid arthritis can affect many nonjoint structures, including: Rheumatoid arthritis signs and symptoms may vary in severity and may even come and go. Periods of increased disease activity, called flares, alternate with periods of relative remission—when the swelling and pain fade or disappear. Over time, rheumatoid arthritis can cause joints to deform and shift out of place. Make an appointment with your doctor if you have persistent discomfort and swelling in your joints. Rheumatoid arthritis occurs when your immune system attacks the synovium, the lining of the membranes that surround your joints. The resulting inflammation thickens the synovium, which can eventually destroy the cartilage and bone within the joint. The tendons and ligaments that hold the joint together weaken and stretch. Gradually, the joint loses its shape and alignment. Doctors don't know what starts this process, although a genetic component appears likely. While your genes don't actually cause rheumatoid arthritis, they can make you more susceptible to environmental factors—such as infection with certain viruses and bacteria—that may trigger the disease. Factors that may increase your risk of rheumatoid arthritis include: Women are more likely than men to develop rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis can occur at any age, but it most commonly begins between the ages of 40 and 60. If a member of your family has rheumatoid arthritis, you may have an increased risk of the disease. Cigarette smoking increases your risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis, particularly if you have a genetic predisposition for developing the disease. Smoking also appears to be associated with greater disease severity. Although uncertain and poorly understood, some exposures such as asbestos or silica may increase the risk for developing rheumatoid arthritis. Emergency workers exposed to dust from the collapse of the World Trade Center are at higher risk of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. People who are overweight or obese appear to be at somewhat higher risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis, especially in women diagnosed with the disease when they were 55 or younger. Rheumatoid arthritis increases your risk of developing: Rheumatoid arthritis itself, along with some medications used for treating rheumatoid arthritis, can increase your risk of osteoporosis—a condition that weakens your bones and makes them more prone to fracture. These firm bumps of tissue most commonly form around pressure points, such as the elbows. However, these nodules can form anywhere in the body, including the lungs. People who have rheumatoid arthritis are much more likely to experience Sjogren's syndrome, a disorder that decreases the amount of moisture in your eyes and mouth. The disease itself and many of the medications used to combat rheumatoid arthritis can impair the immune system, leading to increased infections. The proportion of fat compared with lean mass is often higher in people who have rheumatoid arthritis, even in people who have a normal body mass index (BMI). If rheumatoid arthritis affects your wrists, the inflammation can compress the nerve that serves most of your hand and fingers. Rheumatoid arthritis can increase your risk of hardened and blocked arteries, as well as inflammation of the sac that encloses your heart. People with rheumatoid arthritis have an increased risk of inflammation and scarring of the lung tissues, which can lead to progressive shortness of breath. Rheumatoid arthritis increases the risk of lymphoma, a group of blood cancers that develop in the lymph system. Rheumatoid arthritis can be difficult to diagnose in its early stages because the early signs and symptoms mimic those of many other diseases. There is no one blood test or physical finding to confirm the diagnosis. During the physical exam, your doctor will check your joints for swelling, redness, and warmth. He or she may also check your reflexes and muscle strength. People with rheumatoid arthritis often have an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR, or sed rate) or C-reactive protein (CRP), which may indicate the presence of an inflammatory process in the body. Other common blood tests look for rheumatoid factor and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies. Your doctor may recommend X-rays to help track the progression of rheumatoid arthritis in your joints over time. MRI and ultrasound tests can help your doctor judge the severity of the disease in your body. There is no cure for rheumatoid arthritis. But recent discoveries indicate that remission of symptoms is more likely when treatment begins early with strong medications known as disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). The types of medications recommended by your doctor will depend on the severity of your symptoms and how long you've had rheumatoid arthritis. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can relieve pain and reduce inflammation. Over-the-counter NSAIDs include ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB) and naproxen sodium (Aleve). Stronger NSAIDs are available by prescription. Side effects may include ringing in your ears, stomach irritation, heart problems, and liver and kidney damage. Corticosteroid medications, such as prednisone, reduce inflammation and pain and slow joint damage. Side effects may include thinning of bones, weight gain and diabetes. Doctors often prescribe a corticosteroid to relieve acute symptoms, with the goal of gradually tapering off the medication. These drugs can slow the progression of rheumatoid arthritis and save the joints and other tissues from permanent damage. Common DMARDs include methotrexate (Trexall, Otrexup, Rasuvo), leflunomide (Arava), hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil), and sulfasalazine (Azulfidine). Side effects vary but may include liver damage, bone marrow suppression, and severe lung infections. Also known as biologic response modifiers, this newer class of DMARDs includes abatacept (Orencia), adalimumab (Humira), anakinra (Kineret), certolizumab (Cimzia), etanercept (Enbrel), golimumab (Simponi), infliximab (Remicade), rituximab (Rituxan), tocilizumab (Actemra), and tofacitinib (Xeljanz). These drugs can target parts of the immune system that trigger inflammation that causes joint and tissue damage. These types of drugs also increase the risk of infections. Biologic DMARDs are usually most effective when paired with a nonbiologic DMARD, such as methotrexate. Your doctor may send you to a physical or occupational therapist who can teach you exercises to help keep your joints flexible. The therapist may also suggest new ways to do daily tasks, which will be easier on your joints. For example, if your fingers are sore, you may want to pick up an object using your forearms. Assistive devices can make it easier to avoid stressing your painful joints. For instance, a kitchen knife equipped with a saw handle helps protect your finger and wrist joints. Certain tools, such as buttonhooks, can make it easier to get dressed. Catalogs and medical supply stores are good places to look for ideas. If medications fail to prevent or slow joint damage, you and your doctor may consider surgery to repair damaged joints. Surgery may help restore your ability to use your joint. It can also reduce pain and correct deformities. Rheumatoid arthritis surgery may involve one or more of the following procedures: Surgery to remove the inflamed synovium (lining of the joint). Synovectomy can be performed on knees, elbows, wrists, fingers, and hips. Inflammation and joint damage may cause tendons around your joint to loosen or rupture. Your surgeon may be able to repair the tendons around your joint. Surgically fusing a joint may be recommended to stabilize or realign a joint and for pain relief when a joint replacement isn't an option. During joint replacement surgery, your surgeon removes the damaged parts of your joint and inserts a prosthesis made of metal and plastic. Surgery carries a risk of bleeding, infection, and pain. Discuss the benefits and risks with your doctor. Some common complementary and alternative treatments that have shown promise for rheumatoid arthritis include: Some preliminary studies have found that fish oil supplements may reduce rheumatoid arthritis pain and stiffness. Side effects can include nausea, belching, and a fishy taste in the mouth. Fish oil can interfere with medications, so check with your doctor first. The seeds of evening primrose, borage, and black currant contain a type of fatty acid that may help with rheumatoid arthritis pain and morning stiffness. Side effects may include nausea, diarrhea, and gas. Some plant oils can cause liver damage or interfere with medications, so check with your doctor first. This movement therapy involves gentle exercises and stretches combined with deep breathing. Many people use tai chi to relieve stress in their lives. Small studies have found that tai chi may reduce rheumatoid arthritis pain. When led by a knowledgeable instructor, tai chi is safe. But don't do any moves that cause pain. While you might first discuss your symptoms with your family doctor, they may refer you to a rheumatologist—a doctor who specializes in the treatment of arthritis and other inflammatory conditions—for further evaluation. Information about medical problems you've had in the past Information about the medical problems of your parents or siblings All the medications and dietary supplements you take Your doctor may ask some of the following questions: Does any activity make your symptoms better or worse? You can take steps to care for your body if you have rheumatoid arthritis. These self-care measures, when used along with your rheumatoid arthritis medications, can help you manage your signs and symptoms: Gentle exercise can help strengthen the muscles around your joints, and it can help fight fatigue you might feel. Check with your doctor before you start exercising. If you're just getting started, begin by taking a walk. Try swimming or gentle water aerobics. Avoid exercising tender, injured, or severely inflamed joints. Heat can help ease your pain and relax tense, painful muscles. Cold may dull the sensation of pain. Cold also has a numbing effect and decreases muscle spasms. Find ways to cope with pain by reducing stress in your life. Techniques such as guided imagery, distraction, and muscle relaxation can all be used to control pain. The pain and disability associated with rheumatoid arthritis can affect a person's work and family life. Depression and anxiety are common, as are feelings of helplessness and low self-esteem. The degree to which rheumatoid arthritis affects your daily activities depends in part on how well you cope with the disease. Talk to your doctor or nurse about strategies for coping. With time you'll learn what strategies work best for you. In the meantime, try to: With your doctor, make a plan for managing your arthritis. This will help you feel in charge of your disease. Rest when you're tired. Rheumatoid arthritis can make you prone to fatigue and muscle weakness. A rest or short nap that doesn't interfere with nighttime sleep may help. Keep your family aware of how you're feeling. They may be worried about you but might not feel comfortable asking about your pain. Find a family member or friend you can talk to when you're feeling especially overwhelmed. Also connect with other people who have rheumatoid arthritis—whether through a support group in your community or online. It's easy to get busy and not take time for yourself. Find time for what you like, whether it's time to write in a journal, go for a walk, or listen to music. Use this time to relieve stress and reflect on your feelings. ©1998-2020 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research (MFMER). All rights reserved.

Osteoarthritis, also known as degenerative joint disease, occurs when cartilage between the joints wears down over time, which can cause pain, loss of motion, swelling and joint stiffness. The most commonly affected joints are the knees, hips, neck, tips of the fingers, thumbs and lower back. Without cartilage between the bones at the joint, the bones rub together painfully, and the joint may even warp from its normal shape. Small bone spurs can grow on the edges of the joint, which can cause discomfort, reports The National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases. Pieces of bone or cartilage can also break away and float inside the joint, leading to additional pain and problems. Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis. The disease progresses gradually, and usually does not begin until after age 40. Cartilage on the ends of your bones helps absorb the shock of movement. But when cartilage is damaged or breaks down, this ""cushion"" degrades. Cartilage damage can be caused by a direct blow, such as kick or fall; wear and tear over a prolonged period; and lack of movement over a prolonged period, reports . Risk factors for osteoarthritis (sometimes spelled ""osteoarthrosis"") include being overweight, getting older, and experiencing , according to the . Osteoarthritis in the hands is hereditary and also most common in postmenopausal women. Symptoms of osteoarthritis include: pain, swelling, stiffness and reduced motion in the joints. People with osteoarthritis may also experience a ""crunching"" feeling, which is the joints rubbing together. Some people even hear the sound of bone scraping against bone. Osteoarthritis is not usually accompanied by red or hot skin, rashes, or fevers, so if you experience those symptoms, you may have another health condition. Different people experience osteoarthritis in different ways, reports The National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases. For some, it progresses quickly; for the majority, however, it develops slowly over the years. Early on, joints may feel stiff or sore after exercise, but as the problem progresses the pain may become prolonged and more intense. It is more typical to feel stiff upon first waking up or after sitting still for a long time. In addition to stiffness and pain, those suffering from osteoarthritis in the hands may experience small, bony knobs growing at the ends or middles of the fingers. Fingers can also become enlarged, gnarled or numb. Those with osteoarthritis in the spine (typically at the lower back or neck) may feel weakness, numbness, or tingling in the arms and legs. This is caused by the spine, swollen or stiff from osteoarthritis, putting new pressure on the nerves. People who have questions about osteoarthritis or who experience or stiffness that lasts for more than a few weeks should see a doctor. There is no cure for osteoarthritis, according to the , so treatment focuses on relieving symptoms and improving joint function. A doctor can help determine treatment options. In March 2014, the (OARSI) released new guidelines for non-surgical treatment of osteoarthritis. The non-profit research group's goal was to help health care providers determine which therapies would be most useful for individual patients. After researching existing literature, an OARSI committee condensed its findings into 25 treatment recommendations, which are listed on the 's website. The recommendations are: 1. Drug and non-drug treatments (The optimal treatment program should consist of both medications and non-drug treatments.) 3. Regular telephone contact with a layperson to promote self-care 5. Aerobic, muscle-strengthening and water-based exercises 7. Walking aids (Canes, crutches, wheeled walkers) 10. Heat and cold (warm bath, heat pack or paraffin bath; cold packs)  11. (TENS) — A technique in which a weak electric current is administered through electrodes placed on the skin. It is thought to work by stopping messages from pain receptors from reaching the brain. It has been shown to help with short-term pain control in some patients with knee or hip arthritis. 18. Glucosamine and/or chondroitin for symptom relief 19.

ddd5b9d5-959b-44b6-9d9d-f5e3fd6e0710,"COVID-19 updates, including vaccine information, for our patients and visitors Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a condition in which the median nerve is compressed as it passes through an opening from the wrist to the hand called the carpal tunnel. The carpal tunnel is about 1½ inches long and is located at the base of the hand near the wrist. It is bordered on three sides by the carpal bones and on the palm side by a tight band of connective tissue called the transverse carpal ligament. The median nerve provides sensory and motor functions to the thumb and three middle fingers. While CTS can be painful, its essential symptom is numbness or tingling in the thumb, index finger, long and part of the ring finger. According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, carpal tunnel release is one of the most common surgical procedures performed in the U.S. Carpal tunnel syndrome is three times more common in women than men. It usually only occurs in adults. We use our hands everyday for the most mundane but vitally important daily life functions. Most cases of carpal tunnel syndrome have no specific cause, although any or all of the following may serve as contributing factors: Frequent, repetitive small movements with the hands such as gripping or pinching activities. Typing or using a keyboard are not high-risk activities unless performed in non-ergonomic wrist positions. Activities requiring extreme positioning (flexion or extension) of the wrist, such as activities performed by dental hygienists. Frequent, repetitive grasping movements with the hands, such as with sports and certain physical activities Hormonal or metabolic changes from menopause, pregnancy or thyroid imbalance Other conditions or injuries of the wrist, including strain, sprain, dislocation, break, or swelling and inflammation The following are the most common symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome. However, each individual may experience symptoms differently. Symptoms may include: Burning or tingling in the fingers, especially the thumb and the index and middle fingers Pain and/or numbness that is worse at night, interrupting sleep Surgery is often the answer for carpel tunnel syndrome Read Q&A with Reid Abrams, MD, from the on how to know if you have carpel tunnel, what causes it and how it's treated. Your physician will discuss your medical history to find out about any illnesses, prior injuries or repetitive activities that may be causing your symptoms. Additional diagnostic tests can include: Nerve testing (electromyogram) and nerve conduction studies: These procedures are used to evaluate any loss of functioning in the median nerve. X-rays: Although carpal tunnel syndrome cannot be diagnosed through x-rays, they can be used to check for bone problems caused by past injuries, arthritis, tumors or fractures that could be contributing to your carpal tunnel symptoms : This imaging procedure can be used to detect swelling of the median nerve, narrowing of the carpal tunnel or blood circulation problems. UC San Diego Health . Carpal tunnel symptoms can often be treated on your own. If you start to have symptoms of carpal tunnel damage, follow these initial steps to avoid continuing damage to the median nerve: Stop activities that cause numbness and pain. Avoid repetitive or sustained heavy pinching and gripping activities. Rest your wrist longer between activities. Ice your wrist for 10 to 15 minutes, once or twice an hour. Take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen to relieve pain. Wear a wrist splint at night to keep your wrist in a neutral position. This takes pressure off the median nerve. Your wrist is in a neutral position when it is straight or only slightly bent. Holding a glass of water is an example of your wrist in a neutral position. Do exercises to keep your fingers and wrist from getting stiff, but don't continue doing this if pain or numbness result. Make sure your work space is ergonomic and that you maintain good posture while doing repetitive activities such as typing. If self-care does not resolve symptoms, there are other non-surgical treatment options, including getting a steroid injection and hand therapy. UC San Diego Health has who can help you. Carpal tunnel release surgery is used to reduce the pressure on the median nerve in the wrist. The surgeon will make an incision in the ligament that forms the top of the carpal tunnel, which will relieve pressure on the median nerve. Any other tissue that may be putting pressure on the median nerve can also be removed during surgery, making more room in the tunnel and relieving pressure on the nerve. allows the doctor to see more of the inner tissues requires a small incision in the palm and wrist. can be done with small incisions in the wrist only, or in the wrist and palm. Your surgeon will discuss your surgical options depending on your individual condition. After surgery, formal physical therapy is usually not necessary and is prescribed on a case-by-case basis. Patients often do well with their own home exercise program. Francesca Torriani, MD Medical Director, Infection Prevention and Clinical Epidemiology | Regents of the University of California.

Arthritis literally means “inflamed joint.” Normally a joint consists of two smooth, cartilage-covered bone surfaces that fit together as a matched set and that move smoothly against one other. Arthritis results when these smooth surfaces become irregular and don’t fit together well anymore and essentially “wear out.” Arthritis can affect any joint in the body, but it is most noticeable when it affects the hands and fingers. Each hand has 19 bones, plus 8 small bones and the two forearm bones that form the wrist. Arthritis of the hand can be both painful and disabling. The most common forms of arthritis in the hand are osteoarthritis, post-traumatic arthritis (after an injury), and rheumatoid arthritis. Other causes of arthritis of the hand are infection, gout, and psoriasis. Rheumatoid arthritis affects the cells that line and normally lubricate the joints (synovial tissue). This is a systemic condition (can affect the whole body), which means that it may affect multiple joints, usually on both sides of the body. The joint lining (synovium) becomes inflamed and swollen and erodes the cartilage and bone. The swollen tissue may also stretch the surrounding ligaments, which are the connective tissues that hold the bones together, resulting in deformity and instability. The inflammation may also spread to the tendons, which are the rope-like structures that link muscles to bones. This can result in stretching out of and ruptures of the tendons. Rheumatoid arthritis of the hand is most common in the wrist and the finger knuckles (the MP and PIP joints (see Figure 1). Signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis of the hand Stiffness, swelling, and pain are symptoms common to all forms of arthritis in the hand. In rheumatoid arthritis, some joints may be more swollen than others. There is often a sausage-shaped (fusiform) swelling of the finger. Other symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis of the hand include: A soft lump over the back of the hand that moves with the tendons that straighten the fingers A shift in the position of the fingers as they drift away from the direction of the thumb (see Figure 2) Swelling and inflammation of the tendons that bend the fingers, resulting in clicking or triggering of the finger as it bends, and sometimes causing numbness and tingling in the fingers (carpal tunnel syndrome) Rupture of tendons with loss of ability to straighten or bend certain fingers or the thumb Deformity in which the middle joint of the finger becomes bent and the end joint hyperextended (Boutonnière deformity (see Figure 3) Hyperextension (sway-back) at the middle joint of the finger associated with a bent fingertip (swan-neck deformity (see Figure 3) Your doctor will examine you and determine whether you have similar symptoms in other joints and assess the impact of the arthritis on your life and activities. The clinical appearance of the hands and fingers helps to diagnose the type of arthritis. X-rays will also show certain characteristics of rheumatoid arthritis, such as narrowing of the joint space, swelling and diminished bone density near the joints, and erosions of the bone. If your doctor suspects rheumatoid arthritis, he or she may request blood or other lab tests to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment is designed to relieve pain and restore function. If you have rheumatoid arthritis in your hands, medications can help decrease inflammation, relieve pain and slow the progression of the disease. Anti-inflammatory medications, oral steroids, and/or cortisone injections may be used. Several disease-modifying treatments are now available, including anti-malarial drugs, methotrexate, cyclosporine, gold, and other new drugs (remicade, enbrel) that help suppress the body’s immune system to reduce the inflammation and pain. A rheumatologist will often prescribe and monitor these types of medications. Your physician may also refer you to a hand therapist for exercises, splints, treatments such as paraffin (warm wax) baths, and instruction on how to use your hands in ways that may help relieve pain and pressure and also protect your joints. Adaptive devices may help you cope with the activities of daily living. Rheumatoid arthritis often affects the tendons as well as the joints. The tendons that become inflamed may trigger (click) or rupture. If this happens, you may be unable to bend or straighten your fingers or to grip properly. In certain cases, specific preventive surgery may be recommended. Preventive surgery may include removing nodules, releasing pressure on tendons by removing the inflamed tissue and degenerated, rough bone that may scrape the tendons, and reinforcing the tendons. If a tendon rupture has occurred, a hand surgeon may be able to repair it with a tendon transfer or graft, in addition to performing these other procedures. Surgery to treat the arthritic joints includes removal of inflamed joint linings, joint replacements, joint fusions, and in some cases, removal of damaged bone. The specific procedure(s) depends on a variety of factors, including the particular joint(s) involved, the degree of damage present, the condition of adjacent joints, and your own needs. Your hand surgeon can help you decide on the most appropriate treatment for you. Unfortunately, there is no cure for rheumatoid arthritis. However, surgical procedures can often help correct deformities, relieve pain, and improve function. Optimal care entails a team approach between the rheumatologist, hand surgeon, hand therapist, and patient. It is particularly important that surgical intervention be appropriately timed to rebalance the hand and preserve the joints for as long as possible, before the development of more severe deformities has occurred.

The carpal tunnel is a narrow passageway surrounded by bones and ligaments on the palm side of your hand. When the median nerve is compressed, the symptoms can include numbness, tingling and weakness in the hand and arm. The anatomy of your wrist, health problems and possibly repetitive hand motions can contribute to carpal tunnel syndrome. Proper treatment usually relieves the tingling and numbness and restores wrist and hand function. Newsletter: Mayo Clinic Health Letter — Digital Edition Carpal tunnel syndrome symptoms usually start gradually and include: You may notice tingling and numbness in your fingers or hand. Usually the thumb and index, middle or ring fingers are affected, but not your little finger. You might feel a sensation like an electric shock in these fingers. The sensation may travel from your wrist up your arm. These symptoms often occur while holding a steering wheel, phone or newspaper, or may wake you from sleep. Many people ""shake out"" their hands to try to relieve their symptoms. The numb feeling may become constant over time. You may experience weakness in your hand and drop objects. This may be due to the numbness in your hand or weakness of the thumb's pinching muscles, which are also controlled by the median nerve. See your doctor if you have signs and symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome that interfere with your normal activities and sleep patterns. Permanent nerve and muscle damage can occur without treatment. Carpal tunnel syndrome is caused by pressure on the median nerve. The median nerve runs from your forearm through a passageway in your wrist (carpal tunnel) to your hand. It provides sensation to the palm side of your thumb and fingers, except the little finger. It also provides nerve signals to move the muscles around the base of your thumb (motor function). Anything that squeezes or irritates the median nerve in the carpal tunnel space may lead to carpal tunnel syndrome. A wrist fracture can narrow the carpal tunnel and irritate the nerve, as can the swelling and inflammation caused by rheumatoid arthritis. Many times, there is no single cause of carpal tunnel syndrome. It may be that a combination of risk factors contributes to the development of the condition. A number of factors have been associated with carpal tunnel syndrome. Although they may not directly cause carpal tunnel syndrome, they may increase the risk of irritation or damage to the median nerve. These include: A wrist fracture or dislocation, or arthritis that deforms the small bones in the wrist, can alter the space within the carpal tunnel and put pressure on the median nerve. People who have smaller carpal tunnels may be more likely to have carpal tunnel syndrome. Carpal tunnel syndrome is generally more common in women. This may be because the carpal tunnel area is relatively smaller in women than in men. Women who have carpal tunnel syndrome may also have smaller carpal tunnels than women who don't have the condition. Some chronic illnesses, such as diabetes, increase your risk of nerve damage, including damage to your median nerve. Rheumatoid arthritis and other conditions that have an inflammatory component can affect the lining around the tendons in your wrist and put pressure on your median nerve. Some studies have shown a link between carpal tunnel syndrome and the use of anastrozole (Arimidex), a drug used to treat breast cancer. Being obese is a risk factor for carpal tunnel syndrome. Fluid retention may increase the pressure within your carpal tunnel, irritating the median nerve. This is common during pregnancy and menopause. Carpal tunnel syndrome associated with pregnancy generally gets better on its own after pregnancy. Certain conditions, such as menopause, thyroid disorders, kidney failure and lymphedema, may increase your chances of carpal tunnel syndrome. Working with vibrating tools or on an assembly line that requires prolonged or repetitive flexing of the wrist may create harmful pressure on the median nerve or worsen existing nerve damage, especially if the work is done in a cold environment. However, the scientific evidence is conflicting and these factors haven't been established work as direct causes of carpal tunnel syndrome. Several studies have evaluated whether there is an association between computer use and carpal tunnel syndrome. Some evidence suggests that it is mouse use, and not the use of a keyboard, that may be the problem. However, there has not been enough quality and consistent evidence to support extensive computer use as a risk factor for carpal tunnel syndrome, although it may cause a different form of hand pain. There are no proven strategies to prevent carpal tunnel syndrome, but you can minimize stress on your hands and wrists with these methods: If your work involves a cash register or keyboard, for instance, hit the keys softly. For prolonged handwriting, use a big pen with an oversized, soft grip adapter and free-flowing ink. Gently stretch and bend hands and wrists periodically. Alternate tasks when possible. This is especially important if you use equipment that vibrates or that requires you to exert a great amount of force. Even a few minutes each hour can make a difference. Avoid bending your wrist all the way up or down. A relaxed middle position is best. Keep your keyboard at elbow height or slightly lower. Incorrect posture rolls shoulders forward, shortening your neck and shoulder muscles and compressing nerves in your neck. This can affect your wrists, fingers and hands, and can cause neck pain. Make sure that your computer mouse is comfortable and doesn't strain your wrist. You're more likely to develop hand pain and stiffness if you work in a cold environment. If you can't control the temperature at work, put on fingerless gloves that keep your hands and wrists warm. Carpal tunnel syndrome fact sheet.

Topic Guide Symptoms of osteoarthritis most frequently affect the fingers, feet, knees, hips, and spine, and less commonly, the elbows, wrists, shoulders, and ankles. Stage 1 – Minor Stage 2 – Mild The affected area feels stiff after sedentary periods Stage 3 – Moderate The joint becomes inflamed and causes discomfort during normal activities  Stage 4 – Severe The cartilage is almost completely gone, leading to an inflammatory response from the joint Overgrowth of bony spurs (osteophytes) may cause severe pain is the most common type of that frequently develops with age. It is a chronic condition in which the cartilage between bones that cushions the joints wears down and as it does, the bones rub against each other causing pain, stiffness, swelling, and reduced joint motion. Osteoarthritis most commonly affects the hands, knees, hips, , and spine, though it can affect nearly any joint in the body. Symptoms of osteoarthritis typically begin after age 40 and can vary widely. Symptoms of osteoarthritis most frequently affect the fingers, feet, knees, hips, and spine, and less commonly, the elbows, wrists, shoulders, and ankles.   In severe cases, joint pain occurs even at rest or at night Pain is felt over or near the affected joint but it may sometimes be felt in other areas Joint stiffness Stiffness usually goes away within 30 minutes of rising, but it may come back throughout the day if a person is inactive Stiffness may occur in , damp, or low-pressure weather Primary osteoarthritis is the breakdown of cartilage over time. Risk factors for developing osteoarthritis include: Advancing age  At least 80% of people over age 55 have some X-ray evidence of osteoarthritis Gender  Women are two to three times more likely than men to develop osteoarthritis  Occupation  Occupations that require frequent squatting and kneeling, such as dock work, shipyard work, mining, cotton processing, carpentry, farm work, construction work, and other activities that involve heavy lifting, prolonged standing, or several miles each day Sports  Wrestling, boxing, pitching in baseball, cycling, gymnastics, soccer, and football Noncompetitive does not seem to increase the risk of developing osteoarthritis The term refers to stiffness in the joints. Osteoarthritis is diagnosed based on a number of factors, including the patient's age, history, and symptoms. Tests used to diagnose osteoarthritis or rule out other conditions may include: Arthrocentesis (joint fluid analysis) in which joint fluid is removed and analyzed to determine the cause of joint swelling and pain is a surgical procedure in which a tube with a camera is inserted into the joint space to visualize the joints and surrounding tissues (damage may also sometimes be repaired through the arthroscope) Laboratory tests may be used to rule out other conditions if it is suspected something else may be causing symptoms Imaging tests may be helpful if there is lack of clarity around a source of joint pain other than osteoarthritis Treatment for osteoarthritis includes lifestyle modifications, medications, and/or surgery.  Lifestyle modifications used to treat osteoarthritis include: Orthoses to help to keep joints aligned and functioning correctly such as splints and Assistive devices such as canes, walkers, electric-powered seat lifts, raised toilet seats, and tub and shower bars  Topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)  Surgery is usually the last resort used to treat severe osteoarthritis that significantly limits a person’s activities and that does not respond to other treatments. Types of surgery for osteoarthritis include:  Realignment surgery to realign bones and other joint structures that have become misaligned because of chronic osteoarthritis Fusion surgery is used to permanently fuse two or more bones together at a joint and may be indicated when the joints are badly damaged and joint replacement surgery is not appropriate Joint replacement surgery is used to replace a damaged joint with an artificial (prosthetic) joint Source: https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoarthritis-symptoms-and-diagnosis-beyond-the-basics?search=Osteoarthritis&source=search_result&selectedTitle=4~150&usage_type=default&display_rank=4 https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoarthritis-treatment-beyond-the-basics?search=Osteoarthritis&topicRef=507&source=see_link https://www.osgpc.com/the-4-stages-of-osteoarthritis/ ©2021 WebMD, Inc.

Reviewed by on is a word derived from the Greek word , which means ""wrist."" The carpal tunnel is the passageway in the wrist that is made up of the arching carpal bones and the ligament connecting the pillars of the arch. The median nerve and the tendons that connect the fingers to the muscles of the forearm pass through the narrow tunnel. The median nerve passes through the carpal tunnel to receive sensations from the thumb, index, and middle fingers of the hand. Any condition that causes swelling or a change in position of the tissue within the carpal tunnel can squeeze and irritate the median nerve. Irritation of the median nerve in this manner causes tingling and numbness of the thumb, index, and the first three fingers. This irritation and its symptoms are the condition known as ""carpal tunnel syndrome."" A person with tarsal tunnel syndrome will experience symptoms in the _____________. Anatomy similar to that of the wrist and hand exists in the ankle and foot. is a word derived from the Latin word for ankle. When the sensory nerve that passes through the tarsal tunnel is irritated by pressure in the tunnel, numbness and tingling of the foot and toes can be felt. This condition is referred to as ""tarsal tunnel syndrome."" Tarsal tunnel syndrome is analogous to, but far less common, than carpal tunnel syndrome. It is treated similarly. For most people with carpal tunnel syndrome, the cause is unknown. For most patients, the cause of their carpal tunnel syndrome is unknown. Any condition that exerts pressure on the median nerve at the wrist can cause carpal tunnel syndrome. Common conditions that lead to carpal tunnel syndrome can include obesity, pregnancy, hypothyroidism, arthritis, diabetes, trauma, and tendon inflammation. Some rare diseases can cause deposition of abnormal substances in and around the carpal tunnel, leading to nerve irritation. These diseases include amyloidosis, sarcoidosis, multiple myeloma, and leukemia. As carpal tunnel progresses, what most likely happens? Carpal tunnel syndrome may be a temporary condition that completely resolves or it can persist and progress. As carpal tunnel syndrome progresses, patients can develop a burning sensation, and/or cramping and weakness of the hand. Decreased grip strength can lead to frequent dropping of objects from the hand. Additionally, sharp, shooting pains can sometimes be felt in the forearm. Chronic carpal tunnel syndrome can also lead to wasting (atrophy) of the hand muscles, particularly those in the palm of the hand near the base of the thumb. Burning, cramping, weakness, and wasting of the hand The diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome is based on the symptoms and the distribution of hand numbness. The wrist can also be examined for swelling, warmth, tenderness, deformity, and discoloration. The diagnosis is strongly suggested when a nerve conduction velocity (NCV) test is abnormal. This test involves measuring the rate of speed of electrical impulses as they travel down a nerve. With carpal tunnel syndrome, the impulse slows as it crosses through the carpal tunnel. A test of muscles of the extremity, electromyogram (EMG), is sometimes performed to exclude or detect other conditions that might mimic carpal tunnel syndrome. ""Carpal tunnel release"" is commonly an arthroscopic surgery that involves severing the band of tissue around the wrist to reduce pressure on the median nerve. Most patients with carpal tunnel syndrome improve with conservative measures, including splinting, cortisone injection, and medications. Occasionally, chronic pressure on the median nerve can result in persistent numbness and weakness. In order to avoid serious and permanent nerve and muscle consequences of carpal tunnel syndrome, surgical treatment is considered. After carpal tunnel release, patients often undergo exercise rehabilitation. Though it is uncommon, symptoms can recur. A surgical procedure to reduce pressure on the median nerve A class of medications to treat carpal tunnel syndrome Carpal tunnel syndrome is often most troubling ____________ . Carpal tunnel syndrome typically affects the thumb, index, and middle fingers and is often particularly troublesome at night. Additionally, it affects almost 5% of the population and is most common in middle-aged women. You are more likely to develop carpal tunnel syndrome if your job requires heavy typing. Despite the common belief that frequent typing can lead to carpal tunnel syndrome, the relationship between heavy typing and carpal tunnel syndrome is unclear. Actually, carpal tunnel syndrome is three times more common among assembly line workers than it is among data-entry personnel -- and frequent use of vibrating hand tools increases the risk of carpal tunnel syndrome. A 2001 study found that even heavy computer use -- up to seven hours a day -- did not make people more likely to develop carpal tunnel syndrome. Surgery is the best option to treat carpal tunnel syndrome. While surgery may be required for severe cases of carpal tunnel syndrome, many cases can be handled at home. Home care for carpal tunnel syndrome is straightforward and can often provide relief for mild cases of carpal tunnel syndrome. Many sufferers find relief by wearing a wrist splint, which can be purchased at most drugstores. The purpose of the splint is to keep the wrist in a neutral position at rest. Splinting is usually tried for a period of four to six weeks. Some people wear their splints at night only and others wear their splints both day and night, depending upon when the symptoms are at their worst. If no relief is found at four to six weeks, the splints are not likely to help, and it's time to call a doctor. <https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/carpal-tunnel/carpal-tunnel-syndrome> MedicineNet.

Reviewed by on Before reading this FAQ, challenge yourself and What joints are most often affected by osteoarthritis? What are risk factors for developing osteoarthritis? What are home remedies that can ease osteoarthritis symptoms? What medications are used to treat osteoarthritis? What types of surgery used to treat osteoarthritis? What are the best foods to eat for osteoarthritis? What foods should I avoid if I have osteoarthritis? What joints are most often affected by osteoarthritis? There are many types of , or conditions that involve inflammation of the joints. (OA) commonly affects the joints of the hands, fingers, knees, hips, and spine. Osteoarthritis is the most common type of arthritis and it frequently occurs comes with age. In osteoarthritis, the cartilage between bones that cushions the joints begins to break down and as it does, the bones rub against each other causing pain, stiffness, and swelling. What are risk factors for developing osteoarthritis? Risk factors that increase the risk of developing osteoarthritis include: Gender – women are 2-3 times more likely to develop OA Occupations that require frequent squatting and kneeling, such as dock work, shipyard work, carpentry, construction, farm work, and cotton processing Prolonged standing or walking several miles each day Sports such as wrestling, boxing, pitching in baseball, cycling, parachuting, gymnastics, soccer, and football Osteoarthritis symptoms typically occur in hands, fingers, knees, hips, and spine. OA only rarely affects the joints of the elbow, wrist, and ankle. Symptoms of osteoarthritis vary person to person and can include: that worsens with activity and is relieved by rest. In severe cases, the pain may also occur at rest. Pain usually occurs near the affected joint. Morning joint stiffness that usually resolves within 30 minutes of waking. Joint swelling (effusion) which is a result of accumulation of excess fluid in the joint. Crackling or grating sensation in the joints (crepitus). Bony outgrowths called osteophytes or that can be felt under the skin near joints and usually enlarge over time. What are home remedies that can ease osteoarthritis symptoms? Lifestyle changes and non-drug therapies are usually recommended for everyone who has osteoarthritis to help improve symptoms. lowers the risk of worsening OA and can decrease pain. Physical therapy and programs can help improve flexibility and strengthen the muscles surrounding the joints, which will help decrease pain and improve joint function. Orthoses are medical devices that are used help to keep joints aligned to help reduce symptoms and maintain function. Splints immobilize the joints to reduce can reduce pain and inflammation. Assistive devices such as canes, walkers, electric-powered seat lifts, raised toilet seats, and tub and shower bars can reduce the on joints and can make it easier to perform daily tasks. Arthritis education and support can help patients participate in their self-care so they can learn how to manage their condition. Psychosocial support such as an informal support network or a formal OA support group can benefit patients. and are dietary supplements that that may reduce pain but many studies show no benefit. With few side effects many doctors feel they are safe to try. Talk to your doctor before using any nutritional supplements. Approaches that have not been proven to work in osteoarthritis treatment include shoe insoles, platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), acupuncture, avocado soybean unsaponifiables (ASU), fish oil, and other nutritional supplements. What medications are used to treat osteoarthritis? Different over-the-counter (OTC) and prescription drugs may be used to help relieve osteoarthritis pain and stiffness, such as: Topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) applied to the skin over the joint and are usually tried before oral NSAIDs (pills or tablets). Topical capsaicin (the active substance in capsaicin is hot chili pepper) can help with hand and knee OA. Oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs help relieve pain and reduce inflammation. NSAIDs include (Advil, Motrin) and (Aleve) which are available over-the-counter (OTC), and prescription (Celebrex). Steroid injections are occasionally recommended for some people who still have significant pain that has not responded to weight loss, exercise, and other medications. Drugs that are generally not recommended to treat osteoarthritis include: (Tylenol) the minimal benefits are usually not significantly effective to relieve OA pain. Hyaluronate injections are generally not recommended because there is not a lot of evidence to show they help, and they are expensive. Opioids (narcotic pain relievers) are not recommended for long-term use as they are not any more effective than other , they have a high risk of side effects, and there is potential for abuse and . What types of surgery used to treat osteoarthritis? In severe cases of osteoarthritis that did not respond to other treatments and that significantly limit a person's activities, surgery may be recommended. Types of osteoarthritis surgeries include: Realignment of bones and other joint structures that have become misaligned because of chronic OA. This type of surgery may be used on younger and more active patients instead of replacing the joint entirely. Fusion surgery permanently fuses two or more bones together at a joint and us used for badly damaged joints when joint replacement surgery is not appropriate. Joint replacement surgery replaces a damaged joint with an artificial (prosthetic) joint. Joint replacement surgery performed when pain prevents a person from doing their usual activities and having an active lifestyle. Regular exercise can decrease osteoarthritis pain and can improve quality of life. There is no one specific exercise that is best for everyone, and it is important to talk to your doctor about the exercise that is right for your condition so you do not aggravate already injured joints. Exercises may include: Strength exercises such as use of free weights, weight machines, or body weight Low-impact endurance exercises such as swimming and cycling What are the best foods to eat for osteoarthritis? There are certain foods that can help reduce inflammation and may help ease some osteoarthritis symptoms, including: Calcium and vitamin D-rich foods like leafy green vegetables Broccoli - contains a compound called sulforaphane, which could help slow the progression of OA - contains polyphenols, which are antioxidants that may reduce inflammation and slow cartilage destruction Bell peppers – contain antioxidants that may prevent the deterioration of joints Pineapples and pomegranates – they have anti-inflammatory effects – contains the compound diallyl disulphine that may limit cartilage-damaging enzymes Oils with omega 3 fatty acids - extra virgin olive oil, avocado, safflower, and walnut oils What foods should I avoid if I have osteoarthritis? Certain foods can promote inflammation in the body. If you have osteoarthritis, foods to avoid may include: Wheat products such as pasta and refined grain products. Whole grains are preferred. Fried foods can raise cholesterol and contribute to inflammation and pain. Foods with omega-6 fatty acids such as red meat and egg yolks.

Symptoms may include numbness, tingling, and pain in the arm, hand, and fingers. 55 Fruit StreetYawkey Building, Suite 2CBoston, MA 0211452 Second AvenueBuilding 52, 1st Floor, Suite 1150Waltham, MA 02451 Used with permission from the . Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS) is a condition brought on by increased pressure on the median nerve at the wrist. In effect, it is a pinched nerve at the wrist. Symptoms may include numbness, tingling, and pain in the arm, hand, and fingers. There is a space in the wrist called the carpal tunnel where the median nerve and nine tendons pass from the forearm into the hand (see Figure 1). Carpal tunnel syndrome happens when pressure builds up from swelling in this tunnel and puts pressure on the nerve. When the pressure from the swelling becomes great enough to disturb the way the nerve works, numbness, tingling, and pain may be felt in the hand and fingers. Usually the cause is unknown. Pressure on the nerve can happen several ways: swelling of the lining of the flexor tendons, called tenosynovitis; joint dislocations, fractures, and arthritis can narrow the tunnel; and keeping the wrist bent for long periods of time. Fluid retention during pregnancy can cause swelling in the tunnel and symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome, which often go away after delivery. Thyroid conditions, rheumatoid arthritis, and diabetes also can be associated with carpal tunnel syndrome. There may be a combination of causes. Carpal tunnel syndrome symptoms usually include pain, numbness, tingling, or a combination of the three. The numbness or tingling most often takes place in the thumb, index, middle, and ring fingers. The symptoms usually are felt during the night but also may be noticed during daily activities such as driving or reading a newspaper. Patients may sometimes notice a weaker grip, occasional clumsiness, and a tendency to drop things. In severe cases, sensation may be permanently lost and the muscles at the base of the thumb slowly shrink (thenaratrophy), causing difficulty with pinch. A detailed history including medical conditions, how the hands have been used, and whether there were any prior injuries is important. An x-ray may be taken to check for the other causes of the complaints such as arthritis or a fracture. In some cases, laboratory tests may be done if there is a suspected medical condition that is associated with CTS. A nerve conduction study (NCV) and/or electromyogram (EMG) may be done to confirm the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome as well as to check for other possible nerve problems. Symptoms may often be relieved without surgery. Identifying and treating medical conditions, changing the patterns of hand use, or keeping the wrist splinted in a straight position may help reduce pressure on the nerve. Wearing wrist splints at night may relieve the symptoms that interfere with sleep. A steroid injection into the carpal tunnel may help relieve the symptoms by reducing swelling around the nerve. When symptoms are severe or do not improve, surgery may be needed to make more room for the nerve. Pressure on the nerve is decreased by cutting the ligament that forms the roof (top) of the tunnel on the palm side of the hand (see Figure 3). Incisions for this surgery may vary, but the goal is the same: to enlarge the tunnel and decrease pressure on the nerve. Following surgery, soreness around the incision may last for several weeks or months. The numbness and tingling may disappear quickly or slowly. It may take several months for strength in the hand and wrist to return to normal. Carpal tunnel symptoms may not completely go away after surgery, especially in severe cases.

What Are Arthritis Home Remedies? Does One's Affect Arthritis? How Often Is Medical Follow-up Needed After Initial Arthritis Treatment? How Can Someone Find Arthritis Support Groups and Counseling? Arthritis is a joint disorder featuring inflammation. A joint is an area of the body where two bones meet. A joint functions to allow movement of the body parts it connects. Arthritis literally means inflammation of one or more joints. Arthritis is frequently accompanied by . Joint pain is referred to as arthralgia. Arthritis is classified as one of the rheumatic diseases. These are conditions that are different individual illnesses, with differing features, treatments, complications, and prognosis. They are similar in that they have a tendency to affect the joints, muscles, ligaments, cartilage, and tendons, and many have the potential to affect internal body areas as well. There are many forms of arthritis (over 100 have been described so far, and the number is growing). The forms range from those related to wear and tear of cartilage (such as ) to those associated with inflammation as a result of an overactive immune system (such as ). Together, the many forms of arthritis make up the most common chronic illness in the United States. Arthritis sufferers include men and women, children and adults. More than half of those with arthritis are under 65 years of age. A majority of Americans with arthritis are women. Symptoms of arthritis include limited function and pain in the joints. Inflammation of the joints from arthritis is characterized by joint stiffness, swelling, redness, and warmth. Tenderness of the inflamed joint can be present. Loss of range of motion and deformity can result. Certain forms of arthritis can also be associated with pain and inflammation of tendons surrounding joints. Arthritis can affect any joint in the body, including the knees, hips, fingers, wrists, ankles, , back, and neck. Some types of arthritis cause acute episodes of symptoms (flare-ups). Some forms of arthritis are more of an annoyance than a serious medical problem. However, millions of people suffer daily with pain and disability from arthritis or its complications. Moreover, many of the forms of arthritis, because they are rheumatic diseases, can cause symptoms affecting various organs of the body that do not directly involve the joints. Therefore, signs and symptoms in some patients with certain forms of arthritis can also include even symptoms from abnormalities of organs such as the , heart, or kidneys. The term refers to stiffness in the joints. The causes of arthritis depend on the form of arthritis. Causes include abnormal metabolism (such as and pseudogout), infections (such as in the arthritis of ), and an overactive immune system (such as and ). Treatment programs, when possible, are often directed toward the precise cause of the arthritis. More than 21 million Americans have osteoarthritis. Approximately 2.1 million Americans suffer from . Age: The risk of developing many types of arthritis, including osteoarthritis (the most common type), increases with age. Genetics: Most types of arthritis, including osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, , and , have a genetic (inherited) component. Gender: Most types of arthritis are more common in females. Some types, such as and , are more common in men. and : Excess weight predisposes to many types of arthritis due to added wear and tear on the joints. Injuries: Injured joints are more likely to develop osteoarthritis. Infection: Many infections can attack the joints and cause arthritis. Occupation: Occupations involving repetitive movements can predispose to the development of osteoarthritis and other musculoskeletal conditions. When Should Someone Seek Medical Care for Arthritis? If joint pain, swelling, stiffness, redness, loss of motion or deformity occurs, medical evaluation by a health care professional is warranted. Even minor joint symptoms that persist unexplained for over one week should be evaluated. For many forms of arthritis, it is essential that patients have an early evaluation as it is clear that this can both prevent damage and disability as well as make optimal treatment easier. Primary care physicians such as internists, family practice doctors, and general practitioners frequently diagnose and treat common musculoskeletal conditions and straightforward cases of arthritis. Rheumatologists are specialists in the more than 100 different types of arthritis and have great expertise in the diagnosis and treatment of arthritis, from straightforward to complex cases. Orthopedists (also known as orthopedic surgeons) commonly treat arthritis, especially when surgical management is necessary. Other medical specialists who may be involved in the treatment of arthritis include physical therapists and occupational therapists.

Does my arthritis only affect the joints or are there other areas of my body that can be involved? Can my eyes, heart, lungs, brain, or kidneys be affected? How? What is the likely course of this form of arthritis? What is the long-term outlook? What are my treatment options? What are the risks of not treating at all? If my symptoms worsen, what should I do on my own? When should I contact you? What are the local support groups or foundations that are available to me? (for example, Arthritis Foundation, U.S., ) I have certain special concerns (for example, , , offspring, alternative medicines, surgery, , relatives with tragic outcomes with similar diseases or medications, etc.). How do these particular issues relate to my situation, and how do you feel about them? Are my children likely to be affected by this illness? If so, how can I best help them? While I take the medications that you currently recommend, how should we monitor for possible side effects (for example; examination, check, lab testing)? Are you aware of each of the medications that I am taking? What Exams and Tests Do Doctors Use to Diagnose Arthritis? The first step in the diagnosis of arthritis is a meeting between the doctor and the patient. The doctor will review the history of symptoms, examine the joints for inflammation and deformity, as well as ask questions about or examine other parts of the body for inflammation or signs of diseases that can affect other body areas. Furthermore, certain blood, urine, joint fluid, and/or x-ray tests might be ordered. The diagnosis will be based on the pattern of symptoms, the distribution of the inflamed joints, and any blood test and x-ray findings. Several visits may be necessary before the doctor can be certain of the diagnosis. Earlier and accurate diagnosis can help to prevent irreversible damage and disability. Properly guided programs of and rest, medications, physical therapy, and surgery options can idealize long-term outcomes for arthritis patients. An opinion regarding the cause or the type of the arthritis can usually be adequately obtained by consulting a general family doctor. It is often unnecessary to see an arthritis specialist (rheumatologist) for this purpose. However, if the diagnosis or treatment plan is unclear, a rheumatologist might be consulted. A rheumatologist is a medical doctor who specializes in the nonsurgical treatment of rheumatic illnesses, especially arthritis. Rheumatologists have special interests in unexplained , fever, arthritis, , weakness, , , joint or muscle pain, autoimmune disease, and . They often serve as consultants, acting like medical detectives at the request of other doctors. Rheumatologists have particular skills in the evaluation of the over 100 forms of arthritis and have special interest in rheumatoid arthritis, spondylitis, , , antiphospholipid syndrome, Still's disease, , Sjögren's syndrome, , , mixed connective tissue disease, , , osteomyelitis, osteoarthritis, , gout, pseudogout, relapsing polychondritis, Henoch-Schönlein purpura, , reactive arthritis, , , erythromelalgia, Raynaud's disease, growing pains, , , reflex sympathetic dystrophy, and others. When specific organs are affected by disease aside from the joints associated with the arthritis, other medical specialists might be consulted. What Is Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)? Symptoms, Treatment, Diagnosis The treatment of arthritis depends on which particular form of arthritis is present, its location, severity, persistence, and any underlying background medical conditions of the patient. Each treatment program must be customized for the individual patient. Treatment programs can incorporate home remedies, nonprescription and , joint injections, and surgical operations. Some treatment programs involve weight reduction and avoiding activities that exert excessive on the joint. The goal of treatment of arthritis is to reduce joint pain and inflammation while preventing damage and improving and maintaining joint function. What Are Arthritis Home Remedies? Does One's Affect Arthritis? Treatment may not be necessary for arthritis with minimal or no symptoms. When symptoms are troubling and persist, however, home remedies might include pain and antiinflammatory medications as below. Furthermore, heat/ applications and topical pain creams can be helpful. As a first step, rest, heat/cold applications, and topical pain creams can be helpful. For osteoarthritis, the over-the-counter food and have been helpful for some, though their benefits are still controversial according to national research studies. These are available in pharmacies and health-food stores without a prescription. If patients do not benefit after a three-month trial, I tell them that they may discontinue these supplements. The manufacturers sometimes make claims that these supplements ""rebuild"" cartilage. This claim has not been adequately verified by scientific studies to date. For another type of dietary supplementation, it should be noted that fish oils have been shown to have some anti-inflammation properties. Moreover, increasing the dietary fish intake and/or capsules (omega-3 capsules) can sometimes reduce the inflammation of arthritis. Obesity has long been known to be a risk factor for osteoarthritis of the knee. Weight reduction is recommended for patients who are overweight and have early signs of osteoarthritis of the hands, because they are at a risk for also developing osteoarthritis of their knees. Of note, even modest weight reduction can be helpful. that are available over the counter, such as (), can be very helpful in relieving the pain symptoms of mild osteoarthritis and are often recommended as the first medication treatment. Since acetaminophen has fewer gastrointestinal side effects than nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), especially in elderly patients, acetaminophen is generally the preferred initial drug given to patients with osteoarthritis. Some patients get significant relief of pain symptoms by dipping their hands in hot wax (paraffin) dips in the morning. Hot wax can often be obtained at local pharmacies or medical supply stores. It can be prepared in a special warming device for use at home and be reused after it hardens as a warm covering over the hands by peeling it off and replacing it into the melted wax. Warm water soaks and wearing nighttime cotton gloves (to keep the hands warm during ) can also help ease hand symptoms. Gentle range of motion exercises performed regularly can help to preserve function of the joints. These exercises are easiest to perform after early morning hand warming. Pain-relieving creams that are applied to the skin over the joints can provide relief of daytime minor . Examples include capsaicin (ArthriCare, , Capsagel), cream ( gel), salicin (Aspercreme), methyl salicylate (Bengay, Icy Hot), and menthol (Flexall). For additional relief of mild symptoms, local ice application can sometimes be helpful, especially toward the end of the day. Occupational therapists can assess daily activities and determine which additional techniques may help patients at work or home. There are a few forms of arthritis, such as gout, that can be impacted by dietary changes. Finally, when arthritis symptoms persist, it is best to seek the advice of a doctor who can properly guide the optimal management for each individual patient. Not every person with arthritis requires medical attention. For example, some patients with osteoarthritis have minimal or no pain and may not need treatment. However, for those with persisting joint symptoms, the ideal steps to take should lead to a proper diagnosis and an optimal long-term treatment plan. This plan must be customized for each person affected, depending on the joints involved and the severity of symptoms. For many patients with arthritis, mild pain relievers such as and acetaminophen (Tylenol) may be sufficient treatment. Studies have shown that acetaminophen given in adequate doses can often be equally as effective as prescription anti-inflammatory medications in relieving pain in osteoarthritis. Since acetaminophen has fewer gastrointestinal side effects than NSAIDS, especially among elderly patients, acetaminophen is often the preferred initial drug given to patients with osteoarthritis. Pain-relieving creams applied to the skin over the joints can provide relief of minor arthritis pain. Examples include capsaicin, salicin, methyl salicylate, and menthol. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are medications that are used to reduce pain as well as inflammation in the joints. Examples of NSAIDs include aspirin (), (), (), (), diclofenac (Voltaren), (), (), and (). It is sometimes possible to use NSAIDs temporarily and then discontinue them for periods of time without recurrent symptoms, thereby decreasing the risk of side effects. This is more often possible with osteoarthritis because the symptoms vary in intensity and can be intermittent. The most common side effects of NSAIDs involve gastrointestinal distress, such as stomach upset, cramping , ulcers, and even . The risk of these and other side effects increases in the elderly. Newer NSAIDs called cox-2 inhibitors have been designed that have less toxicity to the stomach and bowels. Some studies, but not all, have suggested that the food supplements glucosamine and chondroitin can relieve symptoms of pain and stiffness for some people with osteoarthritis. These supplements are available in pharmacies and health-food stores without a prescription, although there is no certainty about the purity of the products or the dose of the active ingredients because they are not monitored by the FDA. The U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) is studying glucosamine and chondroitin in the treatment of osteoarthritis. Their initial research demonstrated only a minor benefit in relieving pain for those with the most severe osteoarthritis. Further studies, it is hoped, will clarify many issues regarding dosing, safety, and effectiveness of these products for osteoarthritis. Patients taking blood-thinners should be careful taking chondroitin as it can increase the blood-thinning effect and cause excessive bleeding. Fish oil supplements have been shown to have some anti-inflammation properties, and increasing the dietary fish intake and/or taking fish oil capsules (omega-3 capsules) can sometimes reduce the inflammation of arthritis. is used in many forms to treat arthritis. It can be taken by mouth (in the form of [Deltasone] or []), given intravenously, and injected directly into the inflamed joints to rapidly decrease inflammation and pain while restoring function. Since repetitive cortisone injections can be harmful to the tissue and bones, they are reserved for patients with more pronounced symptoms. For persisting pain of severe osteoarthritis of the knee that does not respond to weight reduction, exercise, or medications, a series of injections of hyaluronic acid (, , and others) into the joint can sometimes be helpful, especially if surgery is not being considered. These products seem to work by temporarily restoring the thickness of the joint fluid, allowing better joint lubrication and impact capability, and perhaps by directly affecting pain receptors. Arthritis that is characterized by a misdirected, overactive immune system (such as rheumatoid arthritis or spondylitis) frequently requires medications that suppress the immune system. Medications such as (Rheumatrex, ) and () are examples. Newer medications that target specific areas of immune activation are referred to as biologics (or biological response modifiers). Sometimes combinations of medications are used. All of these medications require diligent, regular dosing and monitoring. Surgery is generally reserved for those patients with arthritis that is particularly severe and unresponsive to the conservative treatments. Surgical procedures can be performed to relieve pain, improve function, and correct deformity. Occasionally, joint tissue is surgically removed for the purpose of biopsy and diagnosis. Doctors who specialize in joint surgery are orthopedic surgeons. Joint surgery using a viewing tube with a cutting instrument is called . Osteotomy is a bone-removal procedure that can help realign some of the deformity in selected patients, usually those with knee disease. Removal of inflamed joint lining tissue is called synovectomy. In some cases, severely degenerated joints are best treated by fusion (arthrodesis) or replacement with an artificial joint (arthroplasty). ""Total joint replacement"" is a surgical procedure whereby a destroyed joint is replaced with artificial materials. For example, the small joints of the hand can be replaced with plastic material. Large joints, such as the hips or knees, are replaced with metals. Total hip and total knee replacements are now commonplace. These can bring dramatic pain relief and improved function. Patients with arthritis may benefit from conservative measures such as rest, exercise, weight reduction, physical and occupational therapy, and mechanical support devices. These measures are particularly important when large, weight-bearing joints are involved, such as the hips or knees. In fact, even modest weight reduction can help to decrease symptoms of osteoarthritis of the large joints, such as the knees and hips. Medications are used in combination with the physical measures. Resting sore joints decreases on the joints, and relieves pain and swelling. Patients are asked to simply decrease the intensity and/or frequency of the activities that consistently cause joint pain. Exercise usually does not aggravate arthritis when performed at levels that do not cause joint pain. Exercise can be helpful in several ways. First, it strengthens the muscular support around the joints. It also prevents the joints from ""freezing up"" and improves and maintains joint mobility. Finally, it helps with weight reduction and promotes endurance. Applying local heat before and cold packs after exercise can help relieve pain and inflammation. Swimming is particularly suited for patients with osteoarthritis because it allows patients to exercise with minimal impact stress to the joints. Other popular exercises include , stationary cycling, and light weight training. Physical therapists can provide support devices, such as splints, canes, walkers, and . Toilet seat raisers and jar grippers can assist daily living. These devices can be helpful in reducing stress on the joints. Occupational therapists can assess daily activities and determine whether additional devices may help patients at work or home. Finger splints can support individual joints of the fingers. Splints are commonly used in the treatment of wrist arthritis. Paraffin wax dips, warm water soaks, and nighttime cotton gloves can help ease hand symptoms. Spine symptoms can improve with a neck collar, lumbar corset, or a firm mattress, depending on what areas are involved. How Often Is Medical Follow-up Needed After Initial Arthritis Treatment? It should be noted that both before and especially after the diagnosis of arthritis, communication with the treating doctor is essential for optimal health. This is important from the standpoint of the doctor, so that he/she can be aware of the vagaries of the patient's symptoms as well as their tolerance to and acceptance of various treatment options. It is also important from the standpoint of patients, so that they can be assured that they have an understanding of the diagnosis and how the condition does and might affect them. It is also crucial for the safest use of medications. Regular follow-up with the health care professional for monitoring can be essential for optimal results and is crucial when medications are taken. People with many forms of arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis, can develop certain symptoms that are really warning signs of something occurring in their bodies that is not what the doctor expects to happen. These are signs that can also sometimes represent a significant danger. These ""rheumatoid warning signs"" are reasons to call the doctor so that they can be interpreted in light of the patient's overall condition. When the doctor who is aware of your condition hears of these symptoms, he/she can determine whether or not they are serious and if any action should be taken immediately or in the near future. Rheumatoid warning signs can represent a worsening or complications of the , side effects of medications, or a new illness that is complicating the condition of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis should be aware of these rheumatoid warning signs so that they can contact their health care practitioner before their health is jeopardized. Here are some warning signs that warrant contacting the doctor's office: : This includes more pain, more swelling, additional joint involvement, redness, stiffness, or limitation of function. The doctor will determine whether or not these are significant, not the patient. Sometimes, patients have just begun a medication and some minor increase in joint problems might be occurring while the medication is taking effect. However, worsening symptoms can also mean that the medications are not working and that they require adjustments in dosing or a change in the medications. : One major purpose of seeing the doctor is to get better. The doctor knows this. If a patient with rheumatoid arthritis has seen the doctor and is started on a treatment program and is not showing improvement but is worsening, notification of the doctor is appropriate. After starting a new treatment program, it sometimes takes time for the medications, physical therapy, etc., to control the inflammation. It is up to the doctor to decide if things are on course. : A mildly elevated temperature is not unusual in a person with active inflammation from rheumatoid arthritis. However, a true fever (temperature is above 100.4 degrees F or 38 degrees C) is not expected and can represent an infection. People with rheumatoid arthritis are at increased risk for infection because of their disease and frequently because of their medications. Many of the medications used to treat rheumatoid disease suppress the immune system of the body that is responsible for defending against infectious microbes. Furthermore, these medications can increase the risk of a more serious infection when a bacterium or virus strikes. It is important for people with rheumatoid arthritis to notify the doctor as soon as a fever occurs so that infections are treated at the earliest time possible. This can minimize the chances for many serious complications of infections. : When a joint swells, it can pinch the nerves of sensation that pass next to it. If the swelling irritates the nerve, either because of the inflammation or simply because of pressure, the nerve can send sensations of pain, numbness, and/or tingling to the brain. This is called . Nerve entrapment most frequently occurs at the wrist () and elbow (ulnar nerve entrapment). It is important to have nerve entrapment treated early for best results. A rare form of nerve disease in patients with rheumatoid arthritis that causes numbness and/or tingling is . Neuropathy is that in people with rheumatoid arthritis can result from inflammation of blood vessels (vasculitis). Vasculitis is not common, but it is very dangerous. Therefore, it is important to notify the doctor if numbness and/or tingling occurs. : Rashes can occur for many reasons in anybody. However, in people with rheumatoid arthritis, the medications or, rarely, the disease itself can cause rashes. Medications used in the treatment of arthritis that commonly cause rashes as side effects include gold (Solganal, Myochrysine), methotrexate, (), and (Plaquenil). A rare, and serious, complication of rheumatoid arthritis is inflammation of blood vessels (vasculitis), which can cause rash that most commonly appears in the fingertips, toes, or legs. : Redness of the eyes can represent an infection of the eyes, which is more common in people with rheumatoid arthritis because of dryness of the eyes (Sjögren's syndrome). Redness can also result from blood vessel inflammation (vasculitis), especially when pain is present. : A rare complication of the commonly used rheumatoid arthritis drug hydroxychloroquine is an injury to the (the light-sensing portion of the back of the eye). The earliest sign of retinal changes from hydroxychloroquine is a decreased ability to distinguish between red and green colors. This occurs because the vision area of the retina that is first affected by the drug normally detects these colors. People who are taking hydroxychloroquine who lose red/green color distinction should stop the drug and contact their doctor. Currently, prevention of arthritis focuses on avoiding joint injury and early diagnosis and treatment. Research clearly demonstrates that early diagnosis and treatment can result in less damage, deformity, disability, and even mortality in rheumatoid disease. The treatment of rheumatoid disease is not only more effective but easier when administered early. Additionally, maintaining overall good health and strength with exercise and good can be helpful in preventing joint disease. It is the ultimate goal of scientific arthritis research that optimal treatment programs are designed for each of the many form of arthritis. This field will continue to evolve as improvements develop in the diagnosis and treatment of arthritis and related conditions. In the future, medications may be available that can protect the cartilage from the deteriorating consequences of osteoarthritis. New treatments, such as antiinflammatory lotion and patches (diclofenac [Flector]) are becoming available for relief of joint pain symptoms. Innovative cartilage research will open the door for new approaches to an old problem. Investigators are evaluating the effectiveness of over-the-counter food supplements. Better treatment options are being developed as we understand more about our immune system and genetics. Scientists throughout the world are studying many promising areas of new treatment approaches for inflammatory forms of arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis. These areas include more biologic treatments that block the action of the special inflammation factors, such as necrosis factor (TNFalpha) and interleukin-1 (IL-6). Many other drugs are being developed that act against certain critical white blood cells involved in rheumatoid inflammation. Also, new NSAIDs with mechanisms of action that are different from current drugs are on the horizon. Better methods are becoming available to more accurately define which patients are more likely to develop more aggressive disease. Gene profiling, also known as gene array analysis, is being identified as a helpful method of defining which people will respond to which medications. Studies are underway that are using gene array analysis methods to determine which patients will be at more risk for more aggressive disease. Finally, genetic research and engineering is likely to bring forth many new avenues for earlier diagnosis and accurate treatment in the near future. This is all occurring because of technology improvements. We are at the threshold of tremendous improvements in the way rheumatoid arthritis is managed. How Can Someone Find Arthritis Support Groups and Counseling? Minimizing emotional stress can help improve the overall health of the patient with arthritis. Support and extracurricular groups afford patients time to discuss their problems with others and learn more about their illness. The Arthritis Foundation is the only national voluntary health organization whose purpose is directed solely to all forms of arthritis. The Arthritis Foundation has national and international programs involving support for scientific research, public information and education for affected patients and their families, training of specialists, public awareness, and local community assistance. Local branch chapters of the Arthritis Foundation serve to disseminate information about arthritis and rheumatic diseases as well as functioning as referral centers. Moreover, many of the various forms of arthritis have their own foundations that serve as information and referral resources for local communities. Patients and families should ask their health care practitioners for additional local support group and counseling options. Joint pain can be caused by injury or disease affecting any of the ligaments, bursae, or tendons surrounding the joint. Injury or disease can also affect the ligaments, cartilage, and bones within the joint, leading to a painful joint. Pain is also a feature of joint inflammation (arthritis) and infection and can be a feature of rare tumors of the joint. United States. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""Arthritis.""

Osteoarthritis (OA): Treatment, Symptoms, Diagnosis Reviewed By: Osteoarthritis is a progressive form of arthritis characterized by breakdown of the cartilage in joints. Osteoarthritis (OA), also known as degenerative joint disease and ""wear and tear"" arthritis, causes pain in the joints with activity. The knees and the hips are common locations for osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis is common in people over 60 years of age, but it can affect younger people, particularly where they have had joint injury or joint surgery. Symptoms of osteoarthritis typically develop slowly. The most common symptoms include: : Pain with use of the involved joint is a common symptom. This can occur in any joint, especially weight-bearing joints, including joints in your hands, hips, and knees. : Stiffness and pain immediately after being sedentary is a feature of osteoarthritis and is referred to as a ""gel phenomenon."" The morning stiffness of osteoarthritis typically lasts no more than 30 minutes. : A common sign of osteoarthritis is a crunching feeling or grating sound of bone rubbing against bone. : Hand involvement with osteoarthritis leads to knobby enlargements of the small joints of the fingers. Small, bony knobs on the middle joints of the fingers are called Bouchard’s nodes. When they occur at the joints closest to the nail, they are known as Heberden's nodes. : Small bony extensions known as osteophytes sometimes grow on the edges of osteoarthritic joints. Osteoarthritis is common in large weight-bearing joints such as the knees, hips, and lower back. It is also common at the base of the thumb, the small joints of the fingers, and the neck. Osteoarthritis is most commonly a result of aging cartilage. Aging cartilage progressively becomes stiffer and more vulnerable to wear and tear. Severe osteoarthritis can cause the cartilage to wear away virtually completely so that the adjacent bones in the joint rub together with use. This is referred to a ""bone on bone"" joint disease. Osteoarthritis risks come from a variety of factors—some inevitable and some preventable. Aging is the major risk factor for osteoarthritis. The condition is rare in people under age 40, but increases in likelihood as we age, up to age 75. Some genes may interfere with joint health. For example one rare genetic defect (Stickler syndrome) interferes with the body’s natural ability to produce the cartilage protein collagen XI. Other genes predispose people to slightly improperly designed joints that can wear away faster than usual. Men are more likely to have osteoarthritis before age 45. After age 45, women are more likely targets for the condition. The bodies of overweight people bare more stress and strain on their joints. That can cause the natural cartilage cushions at their hips and knees to wear down faster. Some people are more prone to osteoarthritis symptoms at birth. These include those born with one leg shorter than the other, as well as those born with mismatched joint surfaces. Those who have suffered joint injury or undergone joint surgery are predisposed to the development of osteoarthritis of those joints. This is often the cause when osteoarthritis occurs in younger people. Activities that can injure the joints can increase the risk of future osteoarthritis. Over-use of joints and years of heavy impact can often make osteoarthritis worse. Lifestyle changes may be necessary to relieve osteoarthritis symptoms. : Certain job hazards can increase the risk for osteoarthritis. If your job requires you to kneel or squat for more than one hour each day, your likelihood of developing osteoarthritis increases. : Some sports are more likely to lead to osteoarthritis. Football, gymnastics, skateboarding, basketball, and soccer are a few popular American sports known to be osteoarthritis risks. The symptoms of osteoarthritis vary from patient to patient. Some people with osteoarthritis have no symptoms, while others have significant pain and stiffness when the joints are used. Depending on which joints are affected, osteoarthritis can cause difficulty standing, walking, turning knobs or keys, and opening jars, for example. Osteoarthritis involving the spine can lead to nerve irritation associated with numbness, tingling, and weakness. To diagnose osteoarthritis, the doctor will review your symptoms and examine your joints for swelling, redness, warmth, and range of motion. X-rays or other imaging tests can be used to determine the extent of joint damage and/or rule out other joint problems. Blood tests can help exclude other conditions that affect the joints. Osteoarthritis does not affect internal organs like rheumatoid arthritis can. However, osteoarthritis can cause significant deformity and loss of function and mobility. Bowing of the knees can result from severe loss of cartilage in the knee from osteoarthritis. Bony spurs in the spine can irritate adjacent nerves to cause numbness, tingling, and pain in areas supplied by the nerves affected. There is no specific treatment that can stop the progressive degeneration of cartilage from osteoarthritis. However, joint function can be improved by many therapies, including physical therapy that is designed to increase flexibility and strengthen muscle power. Hot or cold applied topically as compresses can relieve aches and pains from osteoarthritis. Currently, at least two therapy sessions a week are recommended to experience the benefits. Finger splints and braces can reduce joint stress, relieve pain, and improve function and mobility. Crutches or walkers can improve walking ability. Symptoms of osteoarthritis of the spine can be relieved by using a firmer mattress and with back bracing or with a neck collar. The pain and stiffness of osteoarthritis can be relieved with over-the-counter pain and anti-inflammatory medication, including aspirin, ibuprofen, or acetaminophen. Pain-relieving creams or sprays can also help when applied directly to the sore area. There are many products that advertise their anti-inflammatory and anti-arthritis benefits. Some of these include: Persistent pain can be eased by steroid or hyaluronic acid injection into the affected joint. Popular medications approved for osteoarthritis include Meloxicam, Celebrex (celecoxib), and indomethacin. While data showing significant long-term benefit of glucosamine and chondroitin is limited, some individuals with osteoarthritis feel these food supplements help to reduce their joint pain. But beware, chondroitin can affect the actions of certain blood thinners. Obesity is a risk factor for osteoarthritis and aggravates existing osteoarthritis. Weight should be reduced in those who have osteoarthritis and are overweight. Interestingly, even modest amounts of weight reduction can be associated with significantly less joint pain from osteoarthritis. Losing weight can also reduce the risk of rapid joint damage from osteoarthritis. Low-impact exercise activities can improve mobility and strength and ultimately reduce pain. Strengthening the muscles around affected joints by training with light weights can be helpful to also reduce pain. For example, strengthening the quadriceps muscle of the knee can reduce osteoarthritis knee pain. See your doctor for the optimal exercise routine. Osteoarthritis Treatment: Joint Replacement Surgery When osteoarthritis symptoms persist despite other therapies, joint replacement surgery is often considered. This surgical procedure is an option for those who are healthy enough and who have severe osteoarthritis. Joint replacement surgery replaces a damaged joint with an artificial one. The most common joints replaced are the knees and the hips. Keeping weight in control is very helpful for preventing osteoarthritis in the long-term. Excessive weight adds stress to weight-bearing joints such as the hips and knees. Osteoarthritis can be prevented if injuries are avoided. Proper occupational and sports equipment along with safety precautions can also prevent joint degeneration.

db93997e-7f26-45b0-b3b4-4fec5ebf9d19,"A musculoskeletal disorder, arthritis affects millions across the world. It is a debilitating condition that restricts your range of movement and affects your functional life. If left untreated, it may inhibit your movement altogether. Arthritis is a joint disorder that causes the inflammation of one or more joints leading to pain. It is an umbrella term for over 100 different forms of joint disorder. Each form of arthritis comes with its own set of complications, causes and prognosis. The most common forms of this condition are (OA) and . Other common types include psoriatic arthritis, (associated with conditions), gout (deposition of uric acid), etc. Almost 50 million people around the world are affected by one or another form of arthritis. Broadly speaking, there are two types of arthritis: Inflammatory and Non-inflammatory. Rheumatoid arthritis, gout and psoriatic arthritis are the most common forms of this condition. : It is an autoimmune and chronic inflammatory disease which mainly affects the joints of your hands and feet. Affecting mostly women, this condition manifests after you are 40. However, rheumatoid arthritis can affect children too. This is known as juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. The linings of your joints mostly take the hit when you have rheumatoid arthritis. This leads to pain and swelling. The treatment of this condition is aimed at symptom control. Most common in men, it is caused by increased uric acid in the blood. However, not everybody with high levels of this acid in the blood are affected by . When uric acid levels in the blood are too high, they may form hard crystals in your joints. Being overweight, excessive alcohol indulgence or loading up on too much of meat also up your risk of gout. In fact, some fish are high in chemicals called purines which increase your chances of getting gout. Medicines like diuretics also be one of the risk factors behind the condition. Gout is usually characterized by a sudden burning pain, stiffness and swelling in the joints. Normally, this type of arthritis affects people with psoriasis, a dermatological disorder that manifests itself through red patches on the skin which come with silvery scales on top. The symptoms of include joint pain, stiffness and swelling. The manifestations, which can occur at any part of your body including your fingertips and spine, may range from mild to severe. The treatment approach is that of symptom control. Osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia and back ache are the common forms of non-inflammatory arthritis. Also known as degenerative arthritis, it is usually caused by the overuse of joints. This can be due to obesity, age and other factors. Osteoarthritis generally affects the knees, hips, feet, and spine joints which bear your body weight. Cartilage covering the ends of bones serves as the body’s shock absorber. With osteoarthritis, the cartilage gradually breaks down resulting in pain when the joint is moved. It is a disease characterised by long-lasting, extensive pain and tenderness of muscles, ligaments and tendons. It damages the joints and/or soft tissues, causing chronic pain. It does not get worse with time and is never fatal. : It is one of the most common health problems that afflicts both men and women of any age bracket. It can be anything from mild to severe, starting slowly over a period of time as a result of poor posture. Back pain can either last for a few days or remain for weeks, months and even years. Regardless of the type, arthritis causes pain and limits your range of movement. If your arthritis is due to inflammation of the joints then you may experience joint swelling, redness, warmth and stiffness. In case of rheumatoid arthritis, various organs of your body may be affected. You may experience fever, lymph nodes swelling,, tiredness, inability to use your hand, difficulty in walking and poor sleep. Here is how you can distinguish regular pain from early signs of arthritis: You experience unexplained joint pain usually accompanied with fever You experience difficulty in carrying out daily chores due to joint pain The trigger behind arthritis varies depending on the form of this condition. Moreover, a combination of factors can be the culprit behind this joint disorder. Here are some of the common factors that contribute to most forms of arthritis. The contributing factors behind arthritis include: Genetic predisposition-It increases your risk of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis Infections-such as in the arthritis of Lyme disease Immune System Dysfunction-It leads to Gender-Women are more vulnerable to arthritis than men. The diagnosis will be based on your symptoms and the location of inflammation. The tests include blood examination, and X-ray findings, MRI scan, CT scan, synovial fluid analysis and/or a urine test. You may have to visit your doctor several times before he can rule out other causes and confirm the diagnosis. If not diagnosed and treated early, arthritis can be a debilitating disorder. The type of arthritis decides your treatment options. Curative methods may include medications, physiotherapy, exercise, weight control and orthopaedic bracing. Eroding forms of arthritis may require joint replacement surgery. Medicines are advised to reduce and pain in the joint. There is no permanent cure for arthritis. Doctors generally prescribe , anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and steroids. Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are also suggested to suppress underlying inflammatory diseases. Biologic drugs are used in treating rheumatoid arthritis or when DMARDs are ineffective. It involves special exercises that you do in a warm-water pool. Due to pain, you will often avoid moving the affected joint. A physiotherapist can help you work out the joint stiffness without damaging it. It promotes health and well-being by teaching you how to reduce the strain on your joints during your daily activities. Your home and workplace may be modified by your occupational therapist so that you can move about without worsening your arthritis. It is usually recommended when other treatment options fail and the damage to your joints is severe enough to affect your functionality. Surgery can either be pain-relieving or reconstructive. Surgical interventions include replacing a badly damaged joint with an artificial joint, removing the inflamed lining of the joint cavity, releasing trapped nerves or fusing a joint to make it more stable. The most common form of surgery for arthritis is joint replacement. Eating certain kinds of food could help you relieve the symptoms of arthritis while others could worsen them. Mumbai-based nutritionist Naini Setalvad tells us more. If you want to beat arthritis you need to include more vegetables such as and onions into your diet. Ideally, you should combine them with ginger. “I would even suggest simply chewing on ginger all day long – that truly helps! In addition, stock up on the chilli family, ranging from the fresh green chilies to the capsicum.  You could also use more spices such as cloves and cinnamon,” says Setalvad. When it comes to your rotis, try those made of jowar, nachani, raagi and bajri. “They are great for your arthritis-ridden joints because they contain nutrients that help ease your pain,” she says. You also need healthy fats to soothe the joints – the kind present in nuts and seeds like , cashew nuts, pistachios, etc. “Cook your food in extra virgin olive oil and don’t forget to dab some ghee on your rotis. If you do not like ghee, a good amount of coconut flesh can be an alternative. These fats not only help lubricate the joints, they also enable the absorption of certain vitamins which provide nutrition to the joints,” suggests Setalvad. Avoid tomatoes, lemon, amla, imli, dairy products and wheat if possible. These foods could possibly worsen the pain in your joints. “However, the worst part about this is the fact that cutting some of these foods could deprive you of . So you must ensure that you get enough guava and kokum in your daily diet. This will not only keep your vitamin C levels up, but also help fight inflammation,” she adds. Other foods that you should avoid are white flour, white sugar and table salt. Switch from white sugar to natural sweeteners like jaggery and dates. You could also replace your white salt with rock salt and sea salt. They contain additional minerals with healing properties that are not available in white table salt. In addition to all the healthy changes, you should also keep a regular tab on your vitamin B 12 and vitamin D 3 levels, the later being slightly more important in case of arthritis. Consult a physician and take the supplements as required. Low vitamin B 12 and vitamin D 3 levels are a sure shot sign of arthritis. Some forms of this joint disorder cannot actually be prevented because they are the results of non-modifiable factors like age, genes and gender. However, a few habits may reduce your risk of arthritis: Your knees bear the most of your weight. So, being overweight will hurt them the most and lead to erosion of the joint. Regular workout is the key to keeping off the extra kilos and strengthen your muscles and joints. Follow a routine that combines aerobic workouts, , and light stretches. Degeneration of joints is a natural phenomenon of ageing. But this process becomes faster when your bones are injured and cartilage damaged. To reduce your risk of injury, use adequate safety equipment if you are involved in any kind of sport. Learn the right techniques while exercising. The posture that you use while sitting, standing or lifting weights determines the health of your bones and muscles to a large extent. While picking up an object, keep it close to your body and lift your knees and hips instead of your back. This will make sure that your back muscles and wrists are not strained. Also, while sitting for long hours, your back, legs and hands should be supported well. ‘Enhanced immunity, no serious adverse events’: Lancet releases Covaxin’s Phase 1 trial data South African coronavirus variant may 'escape antibodies, cause reinfection' Beware!

View All Centers & Departments Common hand problems include arthritis, carpal tunnel syndrome, and ganglion cysts. We offer minimally invasive, image-guided treatments for many types of muscle pain and joint pain. The hand is made up of many different bones, muscles, and ligaments that allow for a large amount of movement and dexterity. There are 3 major types of bones in the hand itself, including: Phalanges. The 14 bones that are found in the fingers of each hand and also in the toes of each foot. Each finger has 3 phalanges (the distal, middle, and proximal). Only the thumb has 2 phalanges. Metacarpal bones. The 5 bones that make up the middle part of the hand. Carpal bones. The 8 bones that create the wrist. The carpal bones are connected to 2 bones of the arm, the ulnar bone and the radius bone. Many muscles, ligaments, and sheaths can be found within the hand. The muscles are the structures that can contract, allowing movement of the bones in the hand. The ligaments are fibrous tissues that help bind together the joints in the hand. The sheaths are tubular structures that surround part of the fingers. There are many common hand problems that can interfere with activities of daily living (ADLs). They include: Arthritis is loss of joint cartilage, often with inflammation, pain and stiffness. It can occur in many areas of the hand and wrist. Arthritis of the hand can be very painful. Osteoarthritis is one of the most common forms of arthritis in the hands. It may be caused by normal use of the hand. Or it may develop after an injury. Osteoarthritis often develops in one of 3 places: the base of the thumb, at the end joint closest to the finger tip, or at the middle joint of a finger. Bony nodules at the middle or end joints of the finger Pain and possibly swelling at the base of the thumb Loss of strength in the fingers and the grip of the hand Over-the-counter pain and fever medicines (NSAIDs or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) With this condition, the median nerve is squeezed or compressed as it passes through the carpal tunnel in the wrist, a narrow confined space. Since the median nerve provides sensory and motor functions to the thumb and 3 middle fingers, many symptoms may result. Each person’s symptoms may be different. Symptoms may include: Burning or tingling in the fingers, especially the thumb and the index and middle fingers The symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome may look like other conditions such as tendonitis, bursitis, or rheumatoid arthritis. Always see your healthcare provider for a diagnosis. Splinting the hand. This is done to help prevent wrist movement and decrease the compression of the nerves inside the tunnel. Medicines to reduce swelling. Anti-inflammatory medicines can be taken by mouth (oral) or injected. Surgery. This is done to relieve compression on the nerves in the carpal tunnel. Ergonomic changes. Making changes to your work environment, such as changing the position of a computer keyboard. Soft, fluid-filled cysts can develop on the front or back of the hand for no apparent reason. These are called ganglion cysts. They are the most common noncancer, soft-tissue tumor of the hand and wrist. The most common symptoms for ganglion cysts include: Wrist pain that gets worse with repeated use or irritation A slow growing, localized swelling, with mild aching and weakness in the wrist An apparent cyst that is smooth, firm, rounded, or tender The symptoms of ganglion cysts may look like other health conditions or problems. Always see your healthcare provider for a diagnosis. At first, when the cyst is small and painless, treatment is usually not needed. Only when the cyst begins to grow and hand function is affected is treatment usually necessary. Treatment may include: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen Tendons are the tough cords of tissue that connect muscles to bones. Two major problems linked to tendons are tendonitis and tenosynovitis. Tendonitis is inflammation of a tendon. It can affect any tendon. But it's most often seen in the wrist and fingers. When the tendons become irritated, swelling, pain, and discomfort will occur. Tenosynovitis is the inflammation of the lining of the tendon sheaths which enclose the tendons. The tendon sheath is often the site which becomes inflamed. But both the sheath and the tendon can become inflamed at the same time. The cause of tenosynovitis is often unknown. But usually strain, overuse, injury, or excessive exercise may be a factor. Tendonitis may also be linked to disease such as diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis. There is pain in the outside of the elbow and forearm. The pain is along the thumb side when the arm is next to the body with the thumb turned away. The pain is caused by damage to the tendons that bend the wrist backward away from the palm. . Pain goes from the elbow to the wrist on the inside of the forearm. The pain is caused by damage to the tendons that bend the wrist toward the palm. A shoulder disorder with inflammation of the shoulder capsule and related tendons. The most common type of tenosynovitis disorder. There is tendon sheath swelling in the tendons of the thumb. A tenosynovitis condition in which the tendon sheath becomes inflamed and thickened. This prevents the smooth extension or flexion of the finger or thumb. The finger or thumb may lock or ""trigger"" suddenly.

a483d8b5-ef69-4833-bd63-b90a94bc82ed,"Finger Joint Swelling May Be a Sign of Knee Osteoarthritis Heberden’s nodes show in finger joints and may also be an indicator of unseen osteoarthritis in the knees. A type of finger joint swelling long known to be a sign of osteoarthritis also could be a sign of arthritic damage in the knees. are bony growths that occur on the joints closest to the fingertips. They contribute the gnarled look of arthritic hands. Heberden’s nodes typically form after the cartilage between finger joints is worn away due to osteoarthritis. With the cartilage gone, bone rubs on bone, leading to bone loss. When the body tries to grow replacement bone on the disrupted joint, it often forms the pea-sized nodes. Knee osteoarthritis lacks any such obvious markers, but Dr. Arya Haj-Mirzaian, MPH, says joint swelling in the fingers may be a predictor of similar damage occurring in the knees. “The presence of (the nodes) in a physical examination is associated with a distinct pattern of worsening of osteoarthritis-related structural damage in the knee joint,” said Haj-Mirzaian, a postdoctoral fellow at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Maryland and lead author of a study linking the two conditions that was published in the journal . Haj-Mirzaian told Healthline the findings could help doctors diagnose generalized osteoarthritis even when symptoms appear limited to the joints of the hands. He also suggested the findings could point to a new subcategory of osteoarthritis specific to people with Heberden’s nodes as a marker for systemic disease. “Osteoarthritis isn’t a simple disorder,” said Haj-Mirzaian. “There are many different causes, including trauma, gout, genetics — they’re all totally different. Our research shows that we need to study arthritis based on (the nodes).” He noted the nodes may affect the hips and other joints as well. In fact, suggests a possible relationship between Heberden’s nodes and osteoarthritis in the hips. The new study included 395 patients with Heberden’s nodes and 188 without the visible joint swelling. Researchers said they found significant associations between the presence of Heberden’s nodes and imaging measures of knee osteoarthritis. The latest study, which included MRI exams of patients, builds on a by Haj-Mirzaian and colleagues that found similar associations using X-rays and physical exams of the knee. Specifically, the researchers found more periarticular bone expansion in the knee joint in patients with Heberden’s nodes, especially the region of the femoral joint. However, the 24-month study also found that the Heberden’s nodes group appeared to have less development of osteophytes — commonly known as “bone spurs” — in the same area of the knees. Dr. David Clark Hay, an orthopedic hand and wrist surgeon at Cedars-Sinai Kerlan-Jobe Institute in Los Angeles, told Healthline that the correlation between arthritis at two different sites on the body is interesting and merits further research. “The study suggests a connection between [Heberden’s nodes] and periarticular bone expansion, but it is not clear what the clinical consequence would be, particularly when considered in conjunction with their finding of less worsening in osteophyte score,” Hay said. “The study suggests a future line of investigation into the underlying mechanism; might the same underlying genetic/biologic process that drives [Heberden’s nodes] formation in the hand be related to the periarticular joint expansion in the knee, but differ from the mechanism driving osteophyte formation?” Dr. Enrico Villanueva, an orthopedic surgeon and an osteoarthritis expert at The Centers for Advanced Orthopaedics in Maryland, said it has long been known that Heberden’s nodes tends to run in families. “Some people are predisposed to Bouchard’s nodes (which show up on the middle joint of the fingers) or Heberden’s nodes,” Villanueva told Healthline. “There certainly could be a genetic link to these changes.” Villanueva said it is “certainly logical” to suspect that people with Heberden’s nodes may also have arthritis in parts of their body other than their hands. “When an orthopedist detects osteoarthritis, we tend to make a full examination because we don’t want to miss an opportunity to detect something sooner and begin treatment,” he said. Bony bumps in finger joints known as Heberden’s nodes may be a sign of osteoarthritis in the knees as well as the hands. The research may point to a type of arthritis specific to people who have the nodes. The findings may help with diagnosis of systemic osteoarthritis as well as helping researchers design studies that better target various populations and types of arthritis.

It can affect any joint in the body, but mostly occurs in the knees, hips, fingers and big toe. Symptoms include joint pain and stiffness, clicking noises, and reduced flexibility in a joint. Excess weight, a previous injury and repeated joint movements increase the risk of osteoarthritis. Regular exercise, healthy eating, special devices and pain management can help to treat symptoms. Osteoarthritis is a long-term condition where the joints in your body become inflamed and damaged. Over time, the bones in the joint rub together, causing pain, swelling, stiffness and reduced movement. This can make it harder to walk, climb stairs or do other daily activities. The condition can affect any joint in the body, but mostly it affects the knees, hips, finger joints and big toe. While it can worsen over time, osteoarthritis can be managed effectively. Osteoarthritis is the most common type of in Australia. It is sometimes confused with , a different condition where the bones become weak, fragile and are more likely to break. You may only notice symptoms in your joints after doing an activity such as walking, climbing stairs or opening a jar. Some people have mild symptoms, while others may experience more severe, ongoing symptoms. — Use the joint pain and swelling and find out if you need to seek medical help. Women are more likely to develop osteoarthritis than men. Australian studies show that about 1 in 10 women report having the condition, compared with about 1 in 16 men. Osteoarthritis can develop at any age, but it is more common in people aged over 40 years or in those who have previously injured a joint. One in 5 Australians over the age of 45, and one in 3 over 75 years have osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis does not have a specific, single cause. However, experts note that certain things put you more at risk of developing osteoarthritis in some joints, including: being (which puts your knees and hips at greater risk) having a previous injury to the joint, such as a dislocation or a fracture (knees, hips, hands) You may also be more likely to develop the condition if your family has a history of osteoarthritis. Check with your doctor or health professional if you feel pain in your joints or experience other symptoms of osteoarthritis. If you have any concerns about osteoarthritis, or other health issues, they can suggest ways to manage your arthritis and refer you to a specialist if needed. — The can help you find doctors, pharmacies, hospitals and other health services. There is no specific test for osteoarthritis. Your doctor will confirm or rule out osteoarthritis based on your symptoms and a physical examination. Some signs they may look for are: — cartilage is the smooth, cushion-like surface that covers the ends of your bones to allow them to move smoothly — extra bone growing around the edge of a joint — the connective tissue that holds your joints together or attaches muscles to bones Your doctor may refer you for an to look for narrowing and changes in the shape of your joints. A blood test may help to rule out other types of arthritis (e.g. ). — Preparing for an appointment? Use the for general tips on what to ask your GP or specialist. There is no cure for osteoarthritis, but most people with osteoarthritis can manage their symptoms, continue with daily activities and live healthy and enjoyable lives. Be careful of any products or treatments that claim to cure osteoarthritis completely — your doctor will help to find the right treatment for you. Researchers have found that regular exercise is one of the most effective treatments for managing osteoarthritis. Not only does it keep your joints and muscles healthy and flexible, physical activity helps to prevent other health problems as well. In general, your exercise should include a mix of: flexibility — exercises like muscle stretches and can help maintain or improve your joint and muscle movements muscle strengthening — exercises with weights and resistance bands improve your muscle strength, which takes pressure off sore joints, strengthens bones and improves balance fitness — like brisk walking and cycling improve the health of your heart and lungs Choose activities that you enjoy and are convenient for you to do. Remember that activities such as gardening, looking after pets and taking the stairs instead of the lift all count as exercise. Extra body weight increases stress on many joints — especially the knees, hips and lower back. If you are overweight, losing weight can help decrease pain and limit further damage to your joints. While there is no diet that will cure osteoarthritis, a helps to keep you healthy and prevent other problems. Watch out in particular for harmful dietary fats that are found in red meat, poultry and full-fat dairy products. Too much of these increases unhealthy LDL-, which has been linked with increased cartilage damage in people with osteoarthritis. Instead, opt for healthier fats found in vegetable oils, avocados, nuts and seeds, fish and fish oil supplements. Walking sticks can help to reduce the load on your knees and reduce pain when moving about. Other ways to improve symptoms of osteoarthritis include taping the joint, wearing braces, or using shoe insoles (orthoses) that improve your body alignment when standing and walking. Check with your for advice about using aids or supports. It can be helpful to understand how your osteoarthritis pain works and your own response to it. Pain coaching, cognitive behaviour therapy or mindfulness may be effective in helping to prevent pain from disrupting your life. Oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines (NSAIDs) can be effective in reducing osteoarthritis pain. Check with your doctor or pharmacist about any potential side effects, such as and bleeding. If tablets are not suitable, NSAIDs also come in cream or gel formulas, though these are generally only helpful for knee osteoarthritis. Ask your doctor or pharmacist about the best pain relief to use for your type of osteoarthritis since some medicines are only effective for certain joints, are not supported by clinical evidence, or have the risk of serious side effects. If your symptoms can’t be managed in other ways, your doctor may refer you to an orthopaedic surgeon. There are several different types of surgery for osteoarthritis. involves joining (fusing) two bones into position to prevent pain, most commonly in ankles, wrists, fingers or thumbs. (or joint replacement) involves removing a joint and replacing it with metal, ceramic or plastic parts. It can be done on knees, hips, shoulders, elbows, fingers, ankles, toes and even the spine. involves adding or removing a small section of bone either above or below your knee joint to help straighten the joint. It is usually done on knees, and occasionally hips. (or keyhole surgery) involves inserting an arthroscope with a small camera into the joint to see directly into the area, so the surgeon can remove or repair any damaged cartilage. It is not recommended for people with knee osteoarthritis unless the knee locks. You can reduce your risk of developing osteoarthritis by avoiding significant damage or overuse of a joint. Maintaining a healthy weight will make osteoarthritis easier to manage if it develops in a weight-bearing joint, such as the knees, hips or feet. Be careful of any product or treatment that claims to prevent osteoarthritis completely — check with your doctor or pharmacist before taking any medication or supplement. For many people, living with osteoarthritis will not cause major problems. However, complications that may arise from severe osteoarthritis include: restrictions performing daily tasks (e.g. difficulty rising from a chair or climbing stairs) As osteoarthritis is a long-term condition, you may feel anxious, frustrated or upset about how it is affecting your life.

139b24c4-321a-4dde-8255-c4b8057841b4,"Arthritis can make daily tasks difficult -- and it hurts like the dickens. Many of us think of arthritis as a condition that causes old people to rub their hands together and predict changes in the weather. That's not entirely the case. In fact, there are some truths about arthritis that may surprise you. For starters, arthritis isn't just one disease -- there are more than 100 types of arthritis. More than 350 million people worldwide have arthritis, as nearly one in five Americans [source: ]. And it affects younger people, too -- six out of 10 arthritis sufferers are under 65 years old [source: ]. So, what exactly is arthritis? Arthritis is swelling in one or more of your joints that causes pain and stiffness and can lead to destruction of tissue in the joint. In some cases, a joint can become so damaged that it needs to be replaced, as is often the case with osteoarthritis (an age-related form of arthritis) and hip joints. There are different causes of this inflammation, which we'll discuss throughout this article. Arthritis can be caused by genetics, an old ski injury or your own immune system. You may first experience discomfort late in life, or you could be diagnosed when you're just a teenager. Joint pain touches every part of a person's life. Not only do your activity levels plummet, you end up spending more and more time just managing pain. Physical abilities are curbed and independence can be compromised or even entirely lost. There are many therapies and drugs available for the treatment of arthritis, and arthritis research continues to turn up new treatment options. As our understanding of arthritis grows, we'll be better able to recognize its early symptoms, seek out the right kind of help and retain -- or reclaim -- as much of our pre-arthritic lives as possible. Nonsurgical Arthritis Treatment, from Aspirin to Acupuncture Surgical Arthritis Treatments: Time for the Operating Room Bones have several important purposes in our bodies. Besides producing blood in the marrow, bones provide a rigid support system for the rest of the body and allow you to move. While bones themselves are sturdy, durable and immobile, the places where bone connects to bone -- the joints -- enable us to perform a wide variety of movements. There are six different types of joints, such as the ball-and-socket joint in your hip and the hinge joint that is your elbow. Bones are held together with various types of connective tissue such as (protein-based material that cushions the bone ends), (which connect muscle to bone) and (which connect bone to bone). This tissue holds the joint together and provides stability while enabling a range of motion. Cartilage covering the bone ends prevents them from rubbing together. Surrounding the joint is a joint cavity, a sac lined with a membrane called the . The synovium produces that nourishes the joint and cartilage. Sturdy and well designed as these joints are, they aren't immune to damage and decay. The knee joint, for example, has an intricate design that allows for complicated maneuvering. Bone ends must be shaped just right, cartilage and tendons must be properly oriented and the trochlear groove must be perfectly aligned with the kneecap that slides back and forth in it. If you take out random amounts of bone, remove a little cartilage and swell everything else up, everything in the knee can get off track. If it stays even slightly off track for too long, the impaired motion will start grinding bones together, pinching connective tissue or wearing away tendons as they slide against bones they weren't designed to slide against. Different types of arthritis may affect some joints more than others. Psoriatic arthritis tends primarily to affect the hands and feet, the shoulder is more susceptible to injury-related arthritis, and osteoarthritis most often affects the hands, hips, knees and spine. In the early stages of arthritis, you might not even feel any pain. As the damage increases, symptoms such as discomfort, tightness or a feeling of heat in the joint will appear and then worsen. If any of your joints begin feeling stiff, tender or like they're grating together, contact a doctor. The earlier arthritis is diagnosed, the better your options and chances for treating it. When your cartilage deteriorates and the bones start rubbing up against one another, it's not quite as cozy as it sounds. () -- also known as -- is the loss of joint cartilage, usually caused by age-related wear and tear. OA can also be caused by a previous trauma to the joint, such as a sports injury. This form of arthritis is the most common, and it affects about one out of every 15 people in the United States alone [source: ]. The cartilage on the ends of your bones is made up of protein and serves as a shock absorber for the joint. As the years go by, more and more water ends up in the cartilage, slowly breaking down the protein. Soon, pieces of cartilage peel away, leaving small notches. As you continue using the joint, the damage increases. Left unchecked, OA will wear away all of the cartilage, meaning the two bone ends in a joint will rub against each other. In severe cases of OA, you and your orthopedic surgeon may decide to replace the entire damaged joint (most commonly the knee or the hip). Hip replacements have a faster recovery time and a better long-term success rate because the hip's ball-and-socket joint is relatively simple and stable in design. Surgeons are doing great things with knees these days as well, but it's a much trickier joint to duplicate artificially and the replacement itself usually needs to be replaced after 10 or 15 years. Sometimes cartilage breakdown will stimulate the bone to produce bony outgrowths known as . These alone don't cause problems, but if they make contact with other bones or nerves, you're going to know about it. Spurs can develop pretty much anywhere, from your fingers (making them look disfigured or gnarled) to your spine, knees or neck. Sometimes these spurs will break loose and get embedded in the synovium that lines the joint. They can also lodge between a joint's two bones, preventing movement. The floating spur may slip back out of the way, allowing movement again, but continue floating back in and out of the joint, causing you ongoing discomfort. If spurs are causing you trouble, they can usually be removed, depending on their location. If they aren't causing you discomfort or mobility issues, spurs can be left alone. Next, we'll learn about another form of arthritis: rheumatoid arthritis. When rheumatoid arthritis affects the hands, it can change their appearance. About 1.3 million Americans suffer from (), a condition caused by the immune system attacking the body's own joint tissue. There is currently no cure, although it can be treated. RA, like other forms of arthritis, causes inflammation of the joints. However, it commonly affects the joints on both sides of the body -- if your right knee is affected, your left knee will be, too. RA often causes swelling in the hands and wrists, though other joints throughout the body are susceptible to it as well. But it's not just about joint pain -- RA can actually make you feel tired and sick. Some people get a fever, others deal with ""cotton mouth,"" and some even suffer from anemia. This wide variation in symptoms can make it difficult to diagnose RA, especially in its earlier stages. Doctors can test for a specific antibody, known as , that often accompanies RA, but it isn't a surefire approach: Some people will test positive for rheumatoid factor without ever developing RA, while others will test negative even though their joints are under attack as a result of the condition. This type of arthritis affects different people in different ways. Some people may only briefly experience symptoms without any lasting damage, never to be bothered again. Others may experience periodic bouts, in which it flares up for a few weeks or months and then goes into remission, only to reappear later. For others, RA shows up and never leaves. RA is an autoimmune disease. The cause of inflammation is malfunctioning white blood cells, which normally protect us from bacteria and infection. Nobody knows why, but sometimes these cells travel toward a joint and, believing there's a threat, flood into the area. The synovium becomes inflamed, puffy, much thicker than usual and warm to the touch. The cells of the synovium then begin to wear away at the nearby bone and cartilage, ultimately causing serious damage. Genes seem to have some role in determining a person's susceptibility to RA, but scientists believe many factors play a role, including viral or bacterial infection as well as hormonal fluctuations. Women are affected much more often than men by RA -- two to three times more often, in fact. Researchers have discovered that most of the damage occurs in the first three years of RA. This makes it important to bring any joint pain to your doctor's attention immediately. Its symptoms normally appear in middle age or later, but they can also show up as early as childhood. Periodic aching in children's bones isn't unusual and is normally the result of ""growing pains."" However, for about a quarter of a million children in the United States who experience lasting joint pain, the culprit is (). Nobody knows what causes juvenile arthritis, but environmental factors or possession of a certain gene may be to blame. It's a chronic condition resulting from the body's immune system acting against the body. JA can appear and then go into long periods of remission, never to cause problems again. In other cases, it will continue to damage joints and significantly alter the child's lifestyle and mobility. Sometimes an organ becomes swollen or a rash develops around the affected joint area. Children with JA frequently show symptoms in the morning that gradually improve as the day advances. Because children's joints grow and develop quickly, an arthritic joint may become misaligned or misshapen. Any suspicions or worries about a possible case of JA should be brought immediately to the attention of the family physician. If JA is confirmed, a pediatric rheumatologist will be able to begin treating the child with NSAIDs, nighttime splinting or biologics (which we'll learn more about later). is another type of arthritis that sometimes seems to appear out of nowhere. Attacks of gout often occur at night and cause intense pain in the big toe, hands, wrists, feet or ankles, making the joint visibly swollen and red. The pain may last a week or so and then go away as suddenly as it appeared. Gout is caused by an overload of . Your body produces uric acid to break down substances known as that your body produces naturally. Purines are also derived from organ meats, herring and anchovies. (If your family refuses to eat the pizza toppings you prefer, you may be at risk.) The kidneys normally take care of uric acid, but sometimes they can't handle the workload. When too much uric acid builds up in your blood, crystals can form in your joints and start making trouble. Left untreated, gout will eventually damage your affected joints. Excessive alcohol use, high blood pressure and heredity increase the risk of gout. It can be treated with NSAIDs, steroids, (a drug that limits inflammation caused by gout) and , a drug that helps prevent purines from becoming uric acid in the first place. Nonsurgical Arthritis Treatment, from Aspirin to Acupuncture A doctor applies herbal medicine to a patient's back at a traditional Chinese medicine clinic in Beijing.  Fortunately for those suffering from arthritis, there are treatments available that can ease pain, swelling and discomfort as well as limit damage to the joints. One readily available treatment won't require a trip to the doctor: good old-fashioned weight loss. Through diet and exercise, you can shed excess pounds that add stress and strain to already overstressed joints. Eat a well-balanced diet, rich in fruits, vegetables and ""good"" fats (monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, as found in nuts, fish, canola oil and sunflower oil). Vitamin C -- readily available in orange juice -- has been shown to slow the progression of osteoarthritis, while vitamin D is important for bone strength. Omega-3 fatty acids help suppress inflammation and can be found in various fish, as well as tofu and flaxseed. When you go for a workout, avoid strenuous or jarring activities that may exacerbate pain. Stretch and warm up before exercising, and stretch and cool down when you're done. Give yourself plenty of time to rest and don't push yourself too hard, but try to get regular amounts of light to moderate exercise. Swimming is one activity that is both easy on the joints and a great cardiovascular workout. As far as treatment goes, there are over-the-counter products that can help with arthritis pain. Topical applications (gels) can produce hot or cold sensations that can diminish your awareness of discomfort. Topical analgesics (or ""pain rubs"") can provide relief by allowing your skin to absorb salicylates, also found in aspirin. Cold packs and paraffin wax dips might help you feel better, too. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) reduce inflammation by lowering the level of (which are similar to hormones and cause inflammation) in the body. NSAIDS, which include aspirin and ibuprofen, are commonly used to treat arthritis, and they were long viewed as the first treatment option that should be explored. However, rheumatoid arthritis does most of its damage to your joints in the first three years or so. Doctors now prefer to use more powerful drugs early on, to prevent or limit the first large wave of damage. Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs ) -- which include methotrexate, gold and sulfasalazine -- actually change the way your immune system works, suppressing it in a way that still isn't fully understood. DMARDs can greatly reduce the amount of joint damage caused by certain forms of arthritis, most notably rheumatoid arthritis. Arthritis pre-dates modern medicine, of course, and so do many of its treatments, such as meditation, acupuncture and fasting to remove impurities. Some patients swear by chiropractic treatment, while others seek out nutritional supplements, like glucosamine and chondroitin, to relieve discomfort. Many modern medical treatments, such as DMARDs, involve processes that aren't fully understood, and so do ""alternative"" treatments. People suffering from arthritis should talk to a wide range of medical specialists to find a treatment option that is right for them. We'll discuss surgical treatments in the next section. Surgical Arthritis Treatments: Time for the Operating Room Your X-ray after a hip replacement might look a little something like this. Sometimes standard treatments aren't effective for people with arthritis. For these cases, there are surgical options to aid in pain relief and mobility and to correct joint disfigurement or deterioration. In some cases, -- cutting out damaged tissue and debris from your joint through a small incision -- may provide a great deal of somewhat temporary relief. (Rheumatoid arthritis, unfortunately, can't be cured through this or any other procedure.) Arthroscopy is a relatively minor procedure, and it allows surgeons to smooth out rough joint surfaces and clean out bits and pieces of tissue or foreign matter that are floating around in the joint. Likewise, a allows surgeons to cut out and remove portions of the joint's inflamed synovium that aren't responding to DMARDs. There are a number of operations that can be performed on the hands and fingers. Surgeons can repair or reattach damaged tendons, or they can cut them in order to allow greater range of motion. Ligaments in the hand can also be cut (as they are in carpal tunnel procedures) if the ligament is squeezing a nerve along the middle of the wrist. Joints in the fingers may be capped with plastic or metal components or can be fused entirely together to provide relief (with the disadvantage of diminished mobility). The vertebrae can also be connected through bone grafts or man-made connective materials. Once held in place, new bone grows, stabilizes and strengthens the fused bones. Surprising as it may seem, many people with fused vertebrae don't lose any flexibility or range of motion in their backs. Cases in which bones and cartilage have undergone great damage may call for total joint replacement. Knees, hips, fingers, thumbs, shoulders and ankles are among the joints that can be removed and replaced by artificial implants. The implants may be screwed onto the bone end or attached with a special type of cement. Joint replacements come with their own share of problems -- sometimes the new joints must be removed if they don't fit correctly or if an infection develops. In many cases, though, patients with artificial transplants feel a great deal of relief from what had often been constant agony. In cases of deformity caused by constant inflammation, doctors will attempt to correct the problem using nonsurgical splints. If that doesn't work, the joint can be surgically realigned. There have been many advances in the treatment of arthritis in recent years. One of those advancements is the use of , also known as . Biologics are proteins taken from human genes and altered to target and change certain elements of the immune system (unlike DMARDs, which work broadly on the immune system). Biologics have shown very good results in the treatment of RA and other forms of arthritis, greatly reducing symptoms and slowing the actual progression of the disease. Most patients who respond to them enter a state of arthritic remission. Biologics are either injected or taken intravenously. Since they suppress the immune system, there is an increased risk of infection. Currently, can be collected from other parts of the body and transplanted to the damaged area, but the cells often don't produce enough new cartilage. Researchers are making great strides toward using bone stem cells to reproduce and replace damaged cartilage in patients with OA. The stem cells are located within the articular cartilage and can transform into chondrocytes, which form cartilage. Doctors sometimes use () to stimulate tissue growth and repair. Platelets -- the portion of blood that forms clots -- contain many elements that stimulate growth. Blood is taken from a patient and spun in a centrifuge until the platelets are separated. This platelet-rich plasma is then injected back into the patient using diagnostic ultrasound to precisely locate the target area. It is an outpatient procedure, and more than one treatment may be necessary to obtain positive results.

When you pop your knuckles or your back, you're actually separating the bones in the joints that are being ""popped."" The sound comes from the synovial fluid that surrounds your joints. When the bones separate, air bubbles form in the joint, which then pop. While probably not very good for your joints, there is no evidence it leads to anything other than annoyed bystanders.

805bcf02-51dc-42d0-a7ce-db7dae89d111,"Arthritis is a common condition that affects various components of the body including the cartilage, joints, bones, muscles, and connective tissues. If you suffer from this condition, you likely experience impairments to your normal movement and functioning. Thankfully, for most types of arthritis, there are way to relieve your symptoms. There are over 100 different forms of arthritis that affect people of many different ages. The three most common types of arthritis are: , rheumatoid arthritis, and juvenile arthritis. In this post, we’ll discuss: Osteoarthritis affects approximately 27 million people in the United States, making it the most common form of arthritis. Osteoarthritis is a degenerative disease that results when the cartilage surrounding the joints begins to wear down. The degeneration of the cartilage causes the bones to rub against each other, leading to: The cause of osteoarthritis is not fully understood; however certain risk factors that are associated with an increased risk of developing osteoarthritis have been identified, including increasing age, obesity, previous joint injuries, overuse of a joint, weak musculature, and certain genetic factors. Osteoarthritis can affect any joint in the body however it most commonly affects the joints in the hands, knees, hips, and spine. The symptoms associated with osteoarthritis tend to develop gradually and usually include joint pain and stiffness that occurs after rest and improves with physical activity. Osteoarthritis is sometimes referred to as a progressive, degenerative joint disease as it is a disease that worsens over time. In the early stages of osteoarthritis, the pain may be moderate and intermittent, and may not have a negative impact on an individuals’ daily functioning. While some patients may not progress past the early stage of the disease, other patients progress to later and more debilitating stages of the disease. In the later stages of the disease the joint pain and stiffness worsens. For individuals with severe cases of osteoarthritis, normal activities such as walking, climbing stairs, and even sleeping can become difficult. At the present time there is no cure for osteoarthritis but maintaining a healthy weight, staying active, and other treatment options may help to reduce pain, improve joint functioning, and slow the progression of the disease. Rheumatoid arthritis is another common type of arthritis, affecting approximately 1.5 million people in the United States. Women are three times more likely than men to develop this disease. Women are usually affected by rheumatoid arthritis between the ages of 30 and 60, while men are usually affected later in life. Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic inflammatory disorder that is the result of inflammation of the membranes that make up the joint tissue lining. Rheumatoid arthritis causes: Rheumatoid arthritis can often lead to severe joint damage. Rheumatoid arthritis is commonly seen bilaterally, meaning that if a joint on one side of the body is affected by inflammation, the same joint on the other side of the body is usually affected as well. The severity of the symptoms associated with rheumatoid arthritis varies and can also change from day to day. However, if symptoms suddenly increase it is called a flare. When a flare occurs, it can last for several days to months. Rheumatoid arthritis is considered an autoimmune disease. Under normal circumstances the body’s immune system acts to protect the body by attacking and destroying foreign substances, including bacteria and viruses. However, in patients who suffer with rheumatoid arthritis, the body’s immune system mistakenly attacks joint tissue. This abnormal immune system reaction results in inflammation that cannot only result in joint damage, but in organ damage as well. Early diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis is essential in order to prevent severe joint damage and organ damage. Juvenile arthritis describes various inflammatory and autoimmune diseases that develop in children below the age of 16. Juvenile idiopathic arthritis is the most common type of juvenile arthritis. In order to receive a diagnosis, the child must be experiencing the initial stages of swelling in at least one joint, for at least six weeks. At the present time there is no known cause of juvenile arthritis. Furthermore, there is no evidence to support the idea that certain foods, toxins, or allergies can cause children to develop juvenile arthritis. However, there is some evidence to suggest that there may be a genetic predisposition to developing this disease. An accurate diagnosis of juvenile arthritis is essential for proper treatment.Approximately 50 million individuals in the United States are affected by arthritis, making it a serious health concern in the country. While many people think that this condition only affects the elderly, it can affect individuals of any age. It has been reported that: Two-thirds of individuals who suffer with arthritis are under the age of 65 Approximately 300,000 children are afflicted by this painful condition The prevalence of arthritis will continue to rise over the next two decades. By 2030, approximately 67 million individuals in the United States may develop the condition. Of the individuals affected by arthritis, approximately 36 million are Caucasian American, 4.6 million are African American, and 2.9 million are Latin American or Hispanic. Arthritis is also the leading cause of disability in the U.S. and results in more mobility issues than heart disease, cancer, or diabetes. Arthritis has begun to place a burden on the economic and healthcare systems in the U.S. Arthritis is responsible for approximately 44 million physician appointments and over 900,000 hospitalizations each year. Reports investigated patients between 2003 and 2010 and found that certain surgical procedures that are used for the treatment of arthritis are associated with longer hospital stays, especially when they are performed on patients with later stages of the disease. These results may be due to the fact that patients in the later stages of the disease waited too long to seek out treatment, or that they suffered from certain types of arthritis. When arthritis is diagnosed and treated in the early stages of the disease, if surgery is required, it may be done as a day surgery procedure or require a one-day stay as opposed to requiring a hospital stay of a longer duration. Longer hospitalization times result in an increased need for healthcare personnel and equipment, and therefore higher medical costs. In particular, for patients aged 18 to 64 who suffer from rheumatoid arthritis reports have shown that between 2002 and 2011 there has been a considerable increase in costs for these patients. An increase in prescription medications combined with a decrease in hospitalizations, as well as an increase in other costs such as sick leave and disability may be responsible for the increased costs. Additionally, since 2009 there has been an increase in the cost of medications used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, which may also contribute to the rising costs associated with this particular subset of patients.There are a variety of factors that can influence an individuals’ susceptibility for developing arthritis. In order to understand how this condition often develops, understanding the way a joint works is beneficial. Joints are areas where bones intercept and the ligaments within the joints hold the bones together. Ligaments are comprised of tissue that contracts and expands, similar to elastic. Ligaments help to keep bones in place. Conversely, surrounding muscles contract and relax to allow for movement of the joint. Cartilage is another type of tissue that covers the surface of bones and helps to prevent bones from rubbing against each other and becoming damaged. Synovial fluid fills that space within the joint and helps to encourage mobility by nourishing the cartilage and the joint. The various components of the joint are all susceptible to damage from wear and tear from everyday use as well as from injury or acute traumatic events. When an individual is diagnosed with arthritis it may be indicative of a problem with the cartilage, synovial fluid, or immune system. The type of arthritis that an individual is diagnosed with provides an idea as to whether cartilage has worn away, synovial fluid has deceased, an abnormal immune response has occurred, that an infection is present, or that a combination of these activities has occurred. Osteoarthritis is a chronic disease that involves damage to the cartilage located within the joint. The cartilage damage may be the result of wear and tear over time or may be the result of an injury. When the cartilage is damaged, it is unable to provide cushioning for the joint. If there is enough damage to the cartilage, there is a significant risk of bone rubbing against bone. This can lead to significant pain, especially with physical activity, in addition to a loss of joint flexibility. On the other hand, rheumatoid arthritis is characterized by an abnormal immune response within the body to the joints. In particular, the immune system begins to attack the synovial membrane that lines that joint capsule and encloses the structures of the joint. As a result of this abnormal immune response, the synovial membrane becomes inflamed and swollen. If rheumatoid arthritis is left untreated it can progress from mild joint damage to serious organ damage. While wear and tear, injury, trauma, and abnormal immune responses can lead to arthritis, research has shown that this condition is often caused by a combination of various factors. The factors that have been associated with an increased risk of developing arthritis, include: Typically, patients suffering from this condition will report joint pain and stiffness. These symptoms tend to get worse with age or as the disease progresses. Other relatively common arthritis symptoms include: or stiffness during or after physical activity Symptoms that are common in patients who suffer from osteoarthritis include joint pain or stiffness: That worsens during or after physical activity or at the end of the day Difference between osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis and juvenile arthritis Patients who suffer from rheumatoid arthritis suffer from different symptoms, from a different cause. Osteoarthritis is a degenerative condition. Rheumatoid arthritis and juvenile arthritis are not. Symptoms that are common in patients who suffer from rheumatoid arthritis include: Symptoms that are common in patients who suffer from juvenile arthritis include: In patients who are very young, it may seem that the child cannot perform motor skills and activities that they were previously able to perform. Symptoms of arthritis can vary drastically among patients. Symptoms may be temporary for some patients while others will develop chronic arthritis symptoms. The severity of pain can range from relatively mild to debilitating, and may be intermittent or constant. At times patients will report that they have some days that are better than others when it comes to their arthritis symptoms. There are a number of types of arthritis, including osteoarthritis, that are usually diagnosed following a medical assessment by a physician. The assessment typically includes: Diagnostic imaging tests, such as X-ray or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to visualize the affected joint Early diagnosis is essential in order to receive treatment that may help to reverse or prevent disease progression. If arthritis is left untreated it can lead to permanent damage to the joints, ligaments, cartilage, and bones. This damage can result in deformity and decreased mobility that may be irreversible. Moreover, it can damage other structures within the body, including vital organs. Early diagnosis of arthritis can also help to prevent the need for invasive types of treatment, including surgery. If certain types of arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis or juvenile arthritis, are suspected, lab testing of urine, blood, or synovial fluid may also be performed to help confirm the diagnosis. Furthermore, lab testing of these body fluids helps to rule out other conditions that may be contributing to a patient’s symptoms. In regard to rheumatoid arthritis, blood tests that reveal specific markers are necessary to properly diagnosis this condition. The specific markers that are revealed by these tests include various antibodies that are present in about 70 to 90% of individuals who suffer from rheumatoid arthritis. These specific markers sometimes circulate in the blood of individuals who do not suffer from rheumatoid arthritis, however the specific markers are usually present in higher levels in individuals suffering from this painful condition. The results of the lab testing can be used in conjunction with the medical history, physical examination, and any imaging performed to make an accurate diagnosis. In regards to juvenile arthritis, there is no single lab test that can exclusively confirm this disease. In many patients the lab testing that is used reveals the presence of inflammation or possibly an infection; however, these results do not generally provide a physician with information to help make a clear diagnosis. Therefore in order to make a proper diagnosis of juvenile arthritis a detailed medical history combined with a thorough physical examination that includes special imaging tests is essential. At the present time, no cure has been developed for arthritis. Treatment focuses on providing pain relief and improving joint functioning. Arthritis treatments generally start with natural, non-invasive approaches, such as: Pain medication and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs () Many patients suffering from this type of pain believe that they should avoid exercise. However, there is a significant amount of research that suggests that certain forms of endurance training and resistance exercises are actually beneficial for individuals suffering from the early stages of both osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. There is also a body of evidence that has found that weight management, exercise, and avoiding injuries to joints helps to reduce the occurrence of osteoarthritis and may also help to avoid flare-ups of arthritis symptoms. It has been found that weight loss in individuals who are overweight is especially effective. For every pound of weight loss, there is four pounds of pressure being taken off the knees. This can help to prevent or reduce inflammation and joint injury. If there is no response to initial treatment methods, physical therapy may be recommended. Research has shown that physical therapy; in addition to regular physical activity is beneficial for patients. It has been found that individuals who suffer from arthritis often exercise less than the recommended amount to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Physical therapists often use techniques that alter normal behaviors to address both the biological and psychosocial aspects of an individual’s life. Patients are educated by their physical therapist on the benefits of engaging in a healthy lifestyle that includes physical activity. Current statistics show that individuals who are in the later stages of arthritis, on disability, or that have strong familial and social support are more likely to receive the services of a physical therapist. Often a combination of treatments provides arthritis symptom relief. However, for some individuals their symptoms fail to respond to treatment or serious damage has occurred and surgery is necessary. In addition to a healthy lifestyle consisting of exercise and physical therapy, there is some evidence to suggest that a healthy, nutritious diet can minimize complications. In particular, certain foods including those that contain trans and saturated fats tend to increase inflammation in the body and should therefore be avoided. It is suggested that the following foods should be limited in the diet or completely avoided: These foods should be replaced by healthier food options, including: Certain types of fish and nuts contain omenga-3 fatty acids, which have been demonstrated to reduce arthritis symptoms, particularly rheumatoid arthritis symptoms. Furthermore, extra virgin olive oil contains high levels of a naturally occurring compound, oleocanthal, which helps to prevent and reduce inflammation associated with arthritis. Oleocanthal has also been shown to block the inflammatory pathways in the same manner that anti-inflammatory medications, including aspirin and ibuprofen do. Moreover, vitamin C, bioflavonoids, and carotenes are antioxidants that can help to protect the body from the negative effects of inflammatory compounds. Foods containing these antioxidants have the ability to help in the prevention of arthritis, slow the disease progression, and help to reduce pain. If you suffer from arthritis, add these healthy food options into your diet: Fish (e.g. herring, salmon, sardines, mackerel, rainbow trout, and anchovies) Vegetables and fruits with high levels of vitamin C (e.g. oranges, grapefruits, guava, strawberries, lemons, pineapples, bell peppers, broccoli, kale, sweet potatoes, Brussels sprouts, carrots, butternut squash, spinach, and sweet red peppers) Alternative treatment options that are available for individuals suffering with arthritis include . Visualization, also referred to as mental imagery, is the act of an individual imagining themselves engaging in a certain action. It is also referred to as guided imagery as a professional trained in this technique often helps to guide an individual through the imagined activity. Studies have shown that by mentally rehearsing an activity prior to actually executing the needed motor skills to complete the activity has the ability to improve future activity performance. The strength of visualization is dramatic, as research has shown that imagining an activity prior to engaging in it has a more significant effect on overall performance than by engaging in motor and strength exercises, when there is no history of guided imagery. Recent research also alludes to the fact that visualization is an effective technique that shows that the mind has the ability to transform mental imagery into improved physical activity performance. Many patients consider more invasive types of treatment for their arthritis symptoms, if natural, holistic treatments don’t work. These advanced treatments may include: Over-the-counter medication may be recommended for patients suffering from mild to moderate pain due to their arthritis. However, prescription medication may be required for patients suffering with severe or chronic arthritis symptoms. Currently there are over 100 different types of medications available for the treatment of various forms of arthritis. The first-line treatment, from a pharmacological approach, are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Physicians usually recommend NSAIDs due to their ability to reduce joint inflammation, thereby helping to reduce pain. NSAIDs that can be taken orally are a very common prescription for the treatment of inflammation. Analgesic medication may also be recommended to treat pain; however, this type of medication does not offer the same anti-inflammatory effects that NSAIDs do. When inflammation occurs, harmful fluids that contain enzymes that cause pain typically build up. NSAIDs help to reduce the buildup of these pain-inducing enzymes. These medications also help to block the release of pain-inducing enzymes, which enhance inflammatory reactions. There is some evidence that suggests that can help reduce the degree of inflammation, in addition to providing pain relief for patients. Corticosteroids, including cortisone and prednisone, may be recommended in an effort to reduce inflammation, and in some cases to suppress an individual’s immune system. This is particularly true in cases where the immune system has begun to attack the joints of the body, as is seen in individuals affected by rheumatoid arthritis. There are a variety of corticosteroid injections and treatment plan regimens that are available that usually involve multiple injections for optimal pain relief. are a common procedure that is often recommended for patients. This procedure involves injecting medication directly into a joint, which helps to relieve inflammation and pain. Joint injections usually involve injecting an anesthetic combined with a corticosteroid into the affected area. The anesthetic helps to reduce pain while the corticosteroid helps to reduce inflammation. This procedure is relatively quick and simple to perform and some patients have reported immediate relief of pain symptoms. Joint injections can be repeated multiple times in order to enhance symptom relief. Various studies have shown that patients who receive joint injections report significant pain relief, increased range of motion, and improved quality of life. You can learn more about this treatment option in the following video. Medial branch blocks are another type of treatment that can be offered to patients suffering with arthritis pain. A medial branch block involves injecting medication into the facet joints, which are structures that connect the vertebrae within the spinal column. Within the facet joint are networks of medial branch nerves that are responsible for the transmission of pain signals to the brain when nerve tissue is damaged or inflamed. When an individual begins to experience chronic arthritic pain, a medial branch block is usually recommended to help destroy the medial branch nerves, thereby blocking the transmission of pain signals to the brain. This results in a reduction, or elimination of pain. The use of medial branch blocks to relieve pain associated with this pain has been well documented as an effective treatment option. The use of medial branch blocks has been shown to provide significant pain relief and improved mobility. Joint injections and medial branch blocks may be used in cases where the physician suspects that surgery may be necessary. These treatment options may be used to provide some pain relief to these patients but can also provide physicians with information regarding how the body and nerves may react to certain surgical procedures. Diagnostic injections usually involve nerve blocks where a needle is inserted into the spinal column at specific areas where the affected spinal nerves are located. Fluoroscopy, or X-ray guidance, is used to ensure proper needle placement. Once proper placement is confirmed, a catheter is inserted through the needle to deliver pain medication directly to the spinal nerves that are believed to be responsible for the arthritic pain. An anesthetic and corticosteroid, or a substance that disintegrates nerve tissue, is injected to provide pain relief. This procedure leads to prolonged pain relief by blocking pain signal transmission. Diagnostic provide the physician with an idea of whether a particular surgery will be effective for reducing arthritic pain for periods longer than the nerve block itself. A diagnostic nerve block is usually performed a minimum of two times. If the patient experiences greater pain relief with repeated injections, there is an increased probability that they will experience positive surgical outcomes. Prior to recommending surgery for arthritic pain, physicians usually like to observe the results of at least two diagnostic nerve blocks. Medication can be taken as needed for patients who are suffering from pain that is associated with the early stages of osteoarthritis. If the disease begins to progress, the physician may recommend occupational therapy or physical therapy to help maintain muscle strength and joint functioning. When the pain becomes severe, mobility becomes limited, or the patient becomes unable to perform daily activities, physicians may recommend more aggressive treatment options, including surgery. Patients suffering with osteoarthritis are advised to engage in regular physical activity and maintain a healthy lifestyle. If patients follow these recommendations in the early stages of the disease, it may help to prevent the disease from progressing. Patients who limit their physical activity due to pain may end up with weak joints and increased joint stiffness which can add to the pain that they are experiencing. Engaging in regular physical activity helps to strengthen muscles, which helps to protect the joints. Additionally, avoiding excessive weight gain is also important for patients who suffer with osteoarthritis as extra weight places added pressure and stress on the joints of the body. Other aspects of osteoarthritis management include: The goals of treatment for rheumatoid arthritis are to reduce pain and inflammation, and slow disease progression. Over-the-counter pain medications and prescriptions medication are often quite effective for reducing rheumatoid arthritis symptoms. Medication that specifically works to suppress abnormal immune system responses are also effective for the management of rheumatoid arthritis and may help to lead to a state of remission. This means that the inflammation associated with this disease completely ceases or is extremely low. Even if a patient experiences a state of remission they will still be monitored for inflammatory markers with regular lab testing as well as a physical examinations. Monitoring these patients at regular intervals will help to determine how well the treatment is working for their condition. Additionally, if the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis begin to re-occur, the physician may adjust the medication dosage or prescribe a new type of medication. Patients suffering with rheumatoid arthritis are also advised to remain physically active as this will help to keep their joints flexible. Additionally, it is advisable that these patients also receive physical therapy in order to learn appropriate types of exercises that they should perform in addition to learning proper techniques of the exercises to avoid potential injuries. In addition to exercise and physical therapy, patients with rheumatoid arthritis are encouraged to consume a nutritious diet and maintain a healthy weight. Patients that follow these recommendations may notice a dramatic improvement in their pain levels. The goal of treatment for juvenile arthritis is to reduce inflammation and pain in an effort to improve a child’s quality of life. A combination of a healthy diet, physical activity, medication, and eye care is usually recommended. The treatment plan for a child with this condition is developed specifically for their case and often involves multiple healthcare practitioners. The healthcare team may include an ophthalmologist, dentist, pediatric rheumatologist, nurse practitioner, and physical therapist. The healthcare team will evaluate and monitor a child’s condition and adjust the treatment plan as needed. This is vital as each child responds differently to arthritis treatment. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and analgesic medications as well as disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are the two types of medications that are commonly used to treat juvenile arthritis. NSAIDs and analgesic medication are used due to the fact that these medications help to relieve pain and inflammation. Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs are used because they may cause the disease to go into a remission state, thereby helping to prevent joint damage. In rare cases medication doses or different types of medications may be prescribed until the child begins to respond positively to treatment. Certain medications that are prescribed to children affected by juvenile arthritis affect the immune system and/or cause undesirable side effects; therefore these children are monitored closely for adverse reactions. Arthritis is a term used to describe over 100 conditions and diseases that affect individuals of all ages. The three most common types of arthritis are osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and juvenile arthritis. Common symptoms of all of these conditions include: Osteoarthritis is caused by degeneration that may be the result of normal wear and tear of the joint or by an acute traumatic event. Rheumatoid arthritis is caused by an abnormal immune response, whereby the body begins to attack the joints of the body. The cause of juvenile arthritis is unknown, although most children who develop this disease are genetically predisposed to this condition. There is currently no cure for arthritis. A variety of treatment options do exist to help manage pain and inflammation. Typically, conservative treatment methods include medication, exercise, physical therapy, and hot and cold compresses. Patients with more severe or chronic symptoms may be advised to undergo more invasive treatment options including corticosteroid injections, medial branch blocks, and possibly surgery. Most cases of early stage arthritis can be successfully managed with conservative treatment options. Early diagnosis and treatment is essential for optimal treatment outcomes. Speak with your doctor if you begin to experience any joint pain or stiffness, as these may be indications of the early stages of this painful condition.

dc05bd04-37a5-42bd-ad37-af32a4beac99,"Hand Problems: Common Injuries, Arthritis and Trigger Finger HSS Health Connection by Public & Patient Education From the issue,  Hand problems vary in severity, but even minor injuries can have a major impact on your daily life. A hand surgeon can help determine the cause of your symptoms and customize a plan of care to get your hands feeling and working well again. Learn about some common hand problems and how they are treated. Your hand contains 19 bones (not including those that form the wrist). There are 14 phalanges, the bones that make up each finger: three in each of the index, middle, ring, and pinky fingers and two in the thumb. There are also five metacarpal bones that make up the middle part of the hand. Numerous ligaments connect the bones to each other. Tendons connect muscles in the arm or hand to the bone to enable you to move your fingers. Sheaths are tubular structures that surround part of the fingers. There are thousands of nerve endings in your fingertips. Arteries, veins, and nerves provide essential blood flow and sensation in the hand and fingers. The hand is one of the most complex structures in the body, and trauma can injure not only the skin or bones of the hand, but also delicate nerves, arteries, tendons, and ligaments that allow your hand to function properly. When surgery is required, this complex network can be challenging to navigate, requiring the expertise of an experienced hand specialist. Hand surgeons are orthopedic surgeons with additional, advanced training in methods for treating upper extremity conditions. This includes performing surgery under a microscope, which may be necessary for fixing small structures in the hand and fingers. The hand is commonly injured during sports, work or daily life activities. Common types of injuries that hand surgeons often treat include: crush injuries of the hands or fingers, such as catching them in a door injuries from power tools, such as circular saws or drills Seeing a hand specialist soon after an injury can assure that you get the most effective treatment as soon as possible. The surgeon will ask you how the injury happened and perform a physical exam to examine the skin for any swelling or bruising and to assess your range of motion. Imaging tests such as , , and can provide additional information. Hand surgeons at some institutions have access to advanced imaging techniques like 3D CT reconstruction and 3D printing of your bones. Your surgeon will speak with you about your usual activities and hobbies so he or she can devise a plan of care to get you back to those activities. Many hand injuries can be treated with splints, casts, and hand therapy. Hand surgeons work closely with hand and occupational therapists to create a personalized therapy approach that is right for each patient. In some cases, is needed to fix broken bones or repair injured nerves, ligaments, or tendons. Most hand surgeries can be done in the outpatient setting, using a nerve block for pain control. Your surgeon and team will work together to ensure a safe surgery and a smooth recovery. Full recovery from a hand injury depends on the severity of the injury: six weeks for most fractures, but up to several months or a year for certain nerve injuries. Your hand surgeon and hand therapist will work closely with you after surgery to help you recover as quickly as possible so you can get back to doing the things you enjoy. Arthritis is inflammation of cartilage in the joints, which causes swelling and pain. There are two basic types of arthritis that most commonly affect the hand and fingers: osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. is the most common type of arthritis and usually affects the hands of older people resulting from years of use. Similar to that of arthritis in larger joints, such as the hip and knee, there are multiple treatment options for hand osteoarthritis to help patients get back to the activities they love. (RA) can also cause similar pain and swelling in the joints, but this condition is caused by an autoimmune disorder, rather than wear over time, and so it can reduce hand function earlier in life than is common for osteoarthritis. Fortunately, with the advent of biologic therapies, people with RA are experiencing fewer serious hand problems and the disease's progression has been dramatically slowed. If you show signs of hand arthritis, your doctor will begin with a physical examination, look for points of tenderness, and assess the degree of stiffness. Imaging studies such as X-rays and MRI can be used to determine the extent of the degenerative changes. Depending on which joints are affected – the first knuckle below each fingernail is the most common hand joint impacted by arthritis – your treatment may include a combination of anti-inflammatory medications (such as ibuprofen or naproxen), rest, ice, wearing a splint, and/or receiving a cortisone injection to relieve inflammation. A hand therapist may be helpful to teach you new ways to use your hands to do what you want to do despite your arthritis. Surgery is a last resort, but in patients with arthritis causing severe pain, it can be very successful. For arthritis affecting the base of the thumb (called ), the most common surgical procedure is removal of a bone called the trapezium and reconstruction of the joint with tendons and/or sutures. After surgery, your hand will be placed in a splint or cast while it heals, and then you will receive regular hand therapy to help regain strength and function. Also called ""stenosing tenosynovitis,"" makes it difficult to fully straighten or bend your fingers. You may be unable to make a fist. People with trigger finger often feel their symptoms are worse when they wake up in the morning. While trigger finger can affect any finger, it most commonly arises in the ring finger, middle finger, and thumb. Flexor tendons attach the muscles of your forearm to the bones of your fingers, passing through tunnels in the palm. When you contract a muscle in your arm, the flexor tendons enable your fingers to bend. With trigger finger, bands of tissue called ""pulleys"" that hold the flexor tendons close to the finger bones become inflamed or thickened, making it harder for the tendon to slide through the pulley as you bend your finger. You may feel a small nodule in your palm that develops from enlargement of the tendon and/or thickening of the pulley. This may cause the tendon to catch as it passes through the pulley. You may also feel a clicking of the finger or experience locking of the joints. This is often quite painful and if left untreated, may lead to permanent stiffness of the finger. You'll have the best chance of a good recovery from trigger finger if you start treatment soon after your symptoms first appear. Your doctor may give you a cortisone shot into the affected area to relieve the inflammation. Massaging the area may reduce tendon swelling. Some people also benefit from wearing a splint at night to keep the affected finger straight. If conservative treatment measures aren't enough to make your symptoms go away, you may need surgery. The hand surgeon will cut the pulley to help the tendon glide smoothly, without catching or locking. You won't need a splint or cast but you'll need to protect the incision site from water to prevent infection. After four to eight weeks, you may experience some internal tissue firmness and skin sensitivity, but this generally resolves by 12 weeks after the operation. No hand therapy is required unless you need some additional exercises to stretch the fingers after you have healed.

a8dfdfd4-0861-4348-b287-5fa3eb89fec8,"Is arthritis just one disease and is it hereditary? A:  Some forms of arthritis, like osteoarthritis, appear to run in families. However, there are more than a hundred forms of arthritis and the causes for many of these are not clear. Arthritis affects one in seven Americans. Odds are high that someone in each generation of a family will feel it. The two most common forms are osteoarthritis (commonly referred to just as arthritis) and rheumatoid arthritis. The less common forms include gout, lupus, and scleroderma. People often confuse the two common varieties. Osteoarthritis is an unfortunate infirmity that usually surfaces with age, like hardening of the arteries. It can show up in young people (prompted by heredity, abnormal metabolism, or injury), but most of its victims tend to be older. Everyone can get osteoarthritis, but females are affected more often than males. Despite the popular image, your joints are not like wheel bearings on a car, which wear out after a certain number of miles. Osteoarthritis is not the inevitable result of years of activity, and regular exercisers are not necessarily more prone to getting it than couch potatoes. In fact, they may be less prone. Inactivity may be as much a culprit as overusing a joint. Scientists have found that arthritic joints have a high concentration of cartilage-corrosive enzymes. They believe that arthritis may be caused by joint injuries, muscle weakness, and being overweight, among other factors. Arthritis most often targets knees, fingers, feet, and hips; as they lose the lubricating, soft cushion between their hard bones, they become inflamed and cause pain. Pain also may stem from the stretching of the bone coating, stretched membranes between joints, or from trapped nerves. Yet another source of pain can be the achy, knobby, bony growths that develop in hands and fingers, giving them a contracted immovable joint. Rheumatoid arthritis is also an insidious disease, being a reaction of the body's immune system against its own tissue. For unknown reasons, the immune system attacks the joints' soft tissues as if they were an invader such as a bacteria or virus. Rheumatoid arthritis is much less common than osteoarthritis. Approximately three million Americans suffer from rheumatoid arthritis, and women are two to three times more likely to have it than men. Unlike osteoarthritis, it also assails people at any age, although it tends to appear between the ages of twenty and fifty. In most people, it attacks the hands. However, rheumatoid arthritis travels throughout the body and can affect any of the body's more than three hundred joints. Scott Fishman, M.D., is a leading expert in pain management.

058f8e5c-f634-4b1e-846f-ec1d31fb33a5,"To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then . 9 Things You Need to Know About Carpal Tunnel Syndrome 9 Things You Need to Know About Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Think of carpal tunnel syndrome as on steroids. This can cause persistent numbness, tingling, and burning in your fingers, wrists, and even your arms. Luckily, carpal tunnel treatment is precise enough that it has the potential to completely resolve the problem that fuels this syndrome in the first place. So here's everything you need to know about carpal tunnel syndrome, including how to treat it if you're experiencing symptoms. 1. Carpal tunnel syndrome all comes down to a single nerve. The median nerve, which runs from your forearm into your thumb, index, and middle fingers, along with part of your ring finger, is nestled inside a canal known as the carpal tunnel. “When the median nerve doesn’t get enough blood flow, it makes your hand hurt and feel like it’s tingling and numb,” Leon S. Benson, M.D., an orthopedic surgeon with the who specializes in elbow, hand, and shoulder issues, tells SELF. These symptoms are especially likely to strike when you’re using your hands for things like driving and talking on the phone, and they can make you instinctively shake your hand to get rid of the sensations. And, since apparently nothing is sacred, your symptoms might be particularly bothersome at night and wake you up. 2. Your constant typing actually isn't the main carpal-tunnel culprit. Thought experts haven't yet pinpointed one single cause behind carpal tunnel, there are various risk factors. One is being born with a tight carpal tunnel, potentially due to genetics, Dr. Benson says. Because they cause swelling that puts pressure on the carpal tunnel—whether through weight gain, fluid retention, inflammation, or another mechanism—health conditions like , , , , and can contribute as well. Doing repetitive work like typing doesn’t seem to explicitly cause this condition, but it may bring it about if you’re predisposed, , M.D., an orthopedic surgeon at Kerlan-Jobe Orthopaedic Clinic in Los Angeles, tells SELF. 3. If carpal tunnel is allowed to progress unchecked, it can lead to permanent nerve damage. But when caught soon enough, it can be cured. Carpal tunnel symptoms may come and go, or bother you more at certain times than others, but this condition will usually worsen over time without treatment. The exception is if one specific thing caused your carpal tunnel syndrome, then you completely remove it from the equation—like if you got carpal tunnel due to weight gain during , then you give birth, Dr. Benson says. If you think you have carpal tunnel syndrome, see a doctor, who can diagnose you based on your symptoms, a physical examination, an X-ray, or tests like an electromyogram to see how your hands are functioning, according to the . Once you're diagnosed, they'll help you come up with an action plan based on the severity of your symptoms. 4. The first line of defense is typically pain medication like NSAIDs. There are essentially two options for carpal tunnel treatment, Dr. Benson says: You can reduce swelling around the median nerve, or you can make the canal surrounding it bigger. can ease the swelling that aggravates your median nerve, Dr. Benson says. This can help in the moment, but it’s not a long-term solution. 5. You can also try a cold compress for sweet, sweet relief. The cold temperature can help decrease inflammation around the median nerve and ease carpal tunnel-related . Dr. Hay typically advises people to ice the area for 10-15 minutes, remove the ice for 30-40, then ice again for 10-15. “Don’t over-ice it,” he says. Doing so can harm your skin and reduce blood flow. 6. The next level of treatment involves using a nighttime wrist splint. A splint helps make sure you’re not keeping your wrists bent for hours while you . “You don’t need to immobilize your wrists during the day when you’re aware of them, but a lot of times when people are asleep, they curl up like a fetus and naturally bend their wrists,” Dr. Benson says. This can lead to a carpal tunnel flare and very rudely rouse you from your sleep. If you have carpal tunnel, talk to your doctor about whether a wrist splint makes sense for you. If a splint still hasn't assuaged your symptoms after six to eight weeks, it's time to get more aggressive. 7. Your doctor may recommend corticosteroid treatment, which can do a brilliant job of relieving inflammation. “With a thin needle, we inject a small amount of an anti-inflammatory corticosteroid around the carpal tunnel,” Dr. Benson says. “It delivers medication right around the nerve and is incredibly effective.” Corticosteroid injections can often completely eradicate less advanced cases of carpal tunnel syndrome, Dr. Hay says. They can even be helpful if your case is more advanced, because the relief may still last for months. This can be useful if isn't convenient for you right now or you can't afford it, but your symptoms aren't responding to treatment methods like a splint, Dr. Hay says. 8. Surgery is the final option for carpal tunnel treatment, and it can be quite successful. The point is to make the canal around the median nerve roomier by cutting the ligament pressing down on the nerve. “It’s like loosening a belt one notch,” Dr. Benson says. The surgery can either be endoscopic, when your surgeon makes smaller incisions and uses an tool called an endoscope to perform the surgery, or open, which involves a larger incision of around two inches, according to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. It’s typically done under a light level of anesthesia or sedation and takes around 20 minutes, Dr. Benson says. Your symptoms can completely disappear after surgery, but you might experience some mild soreness for a few months, Dr. Hay says. You may also experience a , though that usually improves over time, according to National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. Most people are back to driving after a day or two, Dr. Hay says, though you may have to modify your work and lifestyle routines for a few weeks depending on your healing. And for some people, surgery really is able to resolve their carpal tunnel. 9. There are a few strategies for preventing carpal tunnel—none of which involve throwing out your keyboard. If you do any sort of repetitive work involving your hands for hours on end (like typing or assembly work), taking frequent breaks can help ward off wrist and hand . “Take a 5- or 10-minute break every hour or two,” Dr. Benson says. “Like anything else in your body, give your hands and wrists a rest if you’re using them constantly.” During this time you can also do a few stretches to prevent straining your fingers, hands, and wrists. Here are a few you can cycle through on each hand during your breaks, courtesy of Dr. Benson, although it’s always a good idea to check in with your own doctor before introducing new exercises into your routine. (Especially if you already have carpal tunnel—definitely check in with your doctor before trying these in that case.) Hold your hand up like you’re stopping traffic. Flex and extend your wrist. Make a fist, then extend your fingers all the way out. Use one hand to gently press the extended fingers of the other hand back. Having an ergonomic work set-up can also help ward off all sorts of aches and pains, not just ones in your wrists and hands. Check out the Mayo Clinic's guides for an ergonomic workspace, whether you're or . Keep in mind that if you already have carpal tunnel syndrome, prevention isn't enough to keep your symptoms from getting worse. So if you're suffering, discuss carpal tunnel treatment with your doctor. That's the best way to stop looking like a 2003 throwback who's constantly shaking it like a polaroid picture. 6 Things You Need to Know About Rheumatoid Arthritis This Woman's Retroverted Uterus Caused Her Baby Bump to 'Grow Backwards' The Shocking Ways Large Women Are Mistreated by Health Care Providers joined SELF in November 2015, working on the Culture and Health teams before eventually becoming Executive Editor.

b020b0ff-7907-458e-a6e9-e91d5d91668a,"Everything You Need to Know About Ulnar Deviation (Drift) — — Ulnar deviation is also known as ulnar drift. This hand condition occurs when your knuckle bones, or metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints, become swollen and cause your fingers to bend abnormally toward your little finger. It’s called deviation because your fingers bend in the direction of the ulna bone in your forearm. This bone is on the outermost edge of your arm on each side. This condition won’t necessarily keep you from using your hands for daily tasks, such as gripping objects or tying your shoes. But over time, you may find some activities harder to do. You may also not like the way your hands look as they bend and distort. Keep reading to learn more about the symptoms, how it’s diagnosed, and more. Swelling in your knuckles is one of the most noticeable symptoms of ulnar deviation. You may also find that your fingers, especially your middle and index fingers, bend toward your pinky finger. abnormal heat around your wrist, hand, and finger joints pain or tenderness around your wrist, hand, and finger joints, especially when you move or flex your fingers inability to fully flex your fingers or make a fist inability to pick up objects or do certain tasks with your index finger and thumb, such as using zippers or squeezing objects Ulnar deviation is often linked to types of arthritis, especially rheumatoid arthritis. Other symptoms that go along with these conditions include: stiffness in your hand joints and similar joints, such as your toe joints One of the most common causes of ulnar deviation is (RA). RA is an autoimmune disorder that causes your immune system to target your joint tissue. With RA, inflammation can cause damage to both the MCP joint and the areas surrounding the joint. Over time, this can cause your joints to wear away and your bones to erode. This may eventually make your hands look distorted. RA doesn’t have a specific known cause. It’s thought that your genes can trigger the condition when you’re exposed to certain environmental factors, such as infection. (OA) is also known to cause ulnar deviation. Unlike RA, OA isn’t caused by your immune system. It’s caused by your joint cartilage gradually wearing away due to overuse or age. When the cartilage has worn away significantly, your bones start to rub together in the joint. This damages the joints and can cause them to become distorted and bend. , a type of chronic arthritis also caused by your immune system attacking your joints , another autoimmune condition that can cause joint damage associated with arthritis and other symptoms such as fevers and fatigue After reviewing your medical history, your doctor will perform a physical exam and assess your symptoms. They may ask you to move, extend, or flex your hand and fingers to observe your range of motion. If your fingers move abnormally in the ulnar direction or make a “clunking” noise when you move them, it may indicate ulnar deviation. Your doctor may also want to take X-rays of your hands to look more closely at the swelling and deviation in your fingers. Your doctor can also examine your ligaments and other tissue surrounding the joints. An X-ray can also help your doctor diagnose any underlying cause of ulnar deviation, such as OA or RA. Your doctor may also order blood tests to test for underlying conditions such as lupus. Ulnar deviation is chronic and progressive. Treatment aims to help manage your symptoms and maintain your quality of life. Your doctor may recommend taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to help manage any pain or swelling. These include ibuprofen (Advil) and naproxen (Aleve). Exercise treatment can also help you manage your symptoms. Depending on the severity of your ulnar deviation, treatment may range from simple wrist, hand, and finger exercises you can do at home to wearing a splint to keep your fingers in place. Talk to your doctor about the best exercise options for you. They may refer you to a physical therapist or occupational therapist to help teach the correct way to do these exercises. Your doctor may also recommend home treatments, such as hot or cold therapy, to help relieve some of your symptoms. For example, applying heat to your fingers while they’re extended can help increase your range of movement. Applying ice to the joints can help reduce pain and swelling. In more severe cases, laser treatment may help reduce pain and tenderness. Transcutaneous nerve stimulation, which uses electricity to treat pain, may also help reduce the pain associated with ulnar deviation. Your outlook depends on how severe your ulnar deviation is or how far it’s progressed. You may be able to relieve your symptoms without any impact on your daily life. In some cases, with enough physical therapy and treatment, your symptoms may not be noticeable at all. If an underlying condition, such as RA or lupus, is causing your ulnar deviation, your doctor may recommend a long-term treatment plan to manage your symptoms and improve your overall health. If left untreated, this underlying condition may cause additional complications. Check out: What is the best type of brace to treat OA pain? » If your doctor diagnoses you with ulnar deviation early enough, they may recommend that you wear splints to keep your fingers from bending any farther than they already have. Splints that can help slow disease progression include: hand-resting splints, which you usually wear at night on your wrist and fingers to relax your MCP joint and reduce inflammation and pain MCP joint splints, which you can wear during the day to support your fingers and help your grip objects with less pain exercise splints, which support your MCP joint when you extend or flex your fingers to help reduce joint tightness or inflammation You can also make some lifestyle changes to avoid causing too much strain on your joints: avoid using handles on objects such as pots or coffee mugs try not to do too many activities that move your fingers in the ulnar direction, such as using doorknobs or opening jars Keep reading: Can ring splints help arthritis pain? » — — Bone Erosion with Rheumatoid Arthritis: Prevention and Management 6 Tips for Hosting Family Events If You Live with Rheumatoid Arthritis How Rheumatoid Arthritis Affects My Life Choices: What I Want People to Know Getting Married with Rheumatoid Arthritis: My Story Bone Erosion with Rheumatoid Arthritis: Prevention and Management Medically reviewed by Bone erosion is common in people living with rheumatoid arthritis.

Don't confuse the two -- osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis are not the same condition. Osteoarthritis is the result of wear and tear on your joints, which causes weakening and deterioration of your cartilage []. Rheumatoid arthritis, on the other hand, is an auto-immune disorder, whereby your body attacks and destroys joint cartilage []. Both conditions, however, share common symptoms, including joint paint, stiffness and swelling. The risk factors for osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis are fairly different. Osteoarthritis is most common in old age; in fact, almost everyone in their golden years will show some sign of osteoarthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis, unlike like osteoarthritis, is not a golden-age condition. The typical age of onset for rheumatoid arthritis is mid-life, although children and adolescents can also develop the condition. Rheumatoid arthritis is generally caused by genetic factors; in fact, there is a particular gene responsible for this auto-immune disorder []. Osteoarthritis is also caused by a genetic predisposition, but other factors also come into play, such as obesity, over-use of the joint and injury []. Both osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis are more common in women than in men. typically affects the hands, knees, hips, neck and lower back. Rheumatoid arthritis, on the other hand, tends to affect primarily the wrist and finger joints. Interestingly, rheumatoid arthritis is symmetrical in its development: If your right hand has arthritis, so will your left hand. Rheumatoid arthritis also causes other symptoms that are unrelated to joint deterioration, such as fatigue, fever and a vague feeling of sickness.

9db70e6e-4cdc-4636-b76a-9869db071af1,"Natural Home Remedies for Osteoarthritis: What Works? — — is a degenerative disease. Treatment relies on a combination of conventional medicine and lifestyle changes. Medications can treat pain, but there can be side effects when you take these long-term. Home remedies, lifestyle changes, and natural remedies can help manage OA pain with fewer side effects. Certain methods may even prevent OA from getting worse. Home remedies aren’t meant to replace your current treatment. But they may provide more relief for OA. It’s important, though, to discuss home remedies and lifestyle changes with your doctor before trying them. When it comes to pain, compresses may be very beneficial. They don’t cause the long-term side effects that medications might. Heat is helpful for joint stiffness, and cold compresses are best for joint pain. Compresses can reduce muscle pain or spasms surrounding a joint. Making a compress can be as simple as using a warm or cold towel. Epsom salt baths can provide allover relief, especially for joint pain. The magnesium in Epsom salt may help with inflammation and pain. You can buy Epsom salt from a drugstore. These baths are safe enough to take as often as you’d like for 30 minutes at a time. Use 2 cups of Epsom salt in a bath of warm water at a temperature of about 102°F (38°C). You may want to try topical versions as an alternative to oral over-the-counter (OTC) medications like acetaminophen and ibuprofen. These gels and creams may contain aspirin or analgesics to numb the pain. You can apply them directly to the affected joints. These products can work well for areas that are near the skin surface, such as your knees. Another topical home remedy is capsaicin. Capsaicin is a compound made from hot chili peppers. It works best when you apply it to painful joints three to four times per day. To avoid accidental eye exposure, wash hands after each use. You may also want to try other ointments like Tiger Balm or horse liniment. Talk to your doctor before experimenting with any of these products. Various types of can offer added support without the need for medications. The exact devices you choose depend on the affected joints. Options include: knee taping (be sure to have your doctor or physical therapist show you first) Natural remedies are increasing in popularity for conditions like OA. Some people believe they may be safer since they have fewer side effects compared with traditional medications. Talk to your doctor about the following natural remedies. “Natural” herbal supplements can carry side effects and interact with medicines you might take. Always be sure to buy supplements from a reputable source. contains polyphenols. These compounds may help reduce inflammation and the need for medications. One study in reported green tea increased cartilage protection. Due to the risk of liver problems and side effects from concentrated amounts, green tea is best taken in moderation. Oral ginger is also noted for reducing pain from OA. According to a in Osteoarthritis and Cartilage, ginger taken long-term may even decrease the risk for OA-related disability. Due to the risk of side effects, the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health recommends using ginger moderately as a spice instead of supplement forms. The biggest risk to ginger overdose is the withdrawal symptoms. Ginger can cause upset stomach, diarrhea, and heartburn. It may also interact with prescription medications, like Warfarin, because it’s an anticoagulant (blood thinner). Turmeric (curcumin): Treats inflammation, pain, and stiffness Curcumin is the active compound in turmeric. It’s is part of the ginger family, but may help OA in different ways. show that the substance may fight inflammatory compounds. It may also help reduce pain and stiffness during an OA flare-up. For the treatment of arthritis, the recommends the following dosage options: : 400 to 600 milligrams up to three times per day : 0.5 to 1 gram, three times per day If taking turmeric, you may need to add black pepper to activate the herb’s benefits. While turmeric is generally safe it can cause nausea and may interact with blood thinners. For more long-term relief, lifestyle changes are often effective. Regular exercise, a healthy diet, and weight maintenance can help improve joint health and function. Over time, the muscles stabilizing your joints will strengthen and protect against damage. Exercise can be difficult with painful joints. But staying active can reduce pain in the long run, and even strengthen muscles to prevent further joint damage. The says exercise is “the most effective nondrug treatment for reducing pain and improving movement in osteoarthritis.” The best types of exercises for OA use slight resistance, improve flexibility, offer an aerobic element, and are low impact. Options include: Talk to your doctor before starting any new exercises, especially if you haven’t been active before. The Arthritis Foundation recommends 150 minutes of aerobic exercise every week at a moderate intensity. You can also start with shorter periods of exercise and add time as you get stronger. For example, you could start walking for 10 minutes and gradually increase the speed and length of your walks. If you’re new to exercise, you may find slight pain after your workouts. This could mean you need to take a day or two off and then resume your workout regimen. Don’t quit exercising altogether. Eating a balanced diet can help you feel better and lose weight. Research shows that are especially beneficial for OA. fish rich in omega-3 fatty acids (tuna, salmon, mackerel) garlic (contains diallyl disulphide, which may reduce cartilage damage low-fat dairy products (calcium and vitamin D may promote joint and bone health) plant-based oils made from avocado, olives, safflower, and walnut On the flipside, certain foods can aggravate OA symptoms by increasing body inflammation. According to the , each pound of body weight puts the equivalent of three to six pounds on joints. Weight loss can go a long way in alleviating joint pain and OA prevention. This may also be helpful for people with OA in their knees and hips, as these joints bear a lot of weight. OA is a chronic (lifelong) condition with no cure.

109ebc66-65bf-4af0-9dad-296b4c5e3a96,"Diabetes Hand Disorders: Pointing Out the Problems You may have heard that diabetes can affect just about every organ system in the body; diabetes can also affect a part of the body that you normally don’t think about — and maybe take a little bit for granted: your hands! We rely on our hands to do so many things: Holding and carrying items, writing, typing and texting, playing games, driving a car, patting our pets, and holding hands are just some of the daily tasks that require our hands to function properly. To get cutting-edge diabetes news, strategies for blood glucose management, nutrition tips, healthy recipes, and more delivered straight to your inbox, sign up for our free newsletter[1]! Our hands contain 27 bones; the wrist alone has eight bones. In addition, our hands are made up of muscles, tendons, ligaments, nerves and joint capsules. Numerous problems can occur with the hands, including sprains, fracture, tendonitis, arthritis and dislocation. If you have type 1[2] or type 2 diabetes[3], you may also be at risk of developing other disorders, often grouped under the term “diabetic hand syndrome.” Let’s take a look at what comprises this syndrome. Diabetic stiff hand syndrome, or DSHS, is also known as diabetic cheiroarthropathy. As the name implies, finger movement becomes limited due to an increasing stiffness of the hands. Hand stiffness can make even the simplest tasks become more and more difficult. DSHS is one of the most common hand disorders in people with diabetes. It tends to occur first in the pinky finger and over time, spreads to the thumb. If you have DSHS, you may be unable to fully straighten your fingers; if you hold the palms of your hands together and all parts of your hand don’t touch, this could be DSHS. Another symptom of this condition is waxy-looking skin that is tight and thick on the backs of your hands. DSHS is more likely to occur in people who have had diabetes for a long time. Why does this occur? It’s possible that constant high blood sugars cause glycosylation, the process by which glucose molecules attach to protein (in this case, collagen), causing stiffness. Besides glycosylation, diabetic neuropathy[4] (nerve damage) and diabetic microangiopathy (a blood vessel disorder) can also contribute to DSHS. Now for the treatment. There isn’t a way to reverse DSHS, but treatment involves both physical and occupational therapy. Keeping your hands strong is also important with hand exercises. And, tight blood glucose control can both prevent and slow the development of DSHS. Dupuytren’s contracture, sometimes called Dupuytren’s disease, is a condition where the connective tissue in the palm of the hand thickens and contracts. Knots of tissue can form under the skin and can eventually create a thick cord that pulls one or more fingers into a bent position, according to the Mayo Clinic[5]. Dupuytren’s makes it difficult to extend the fingers; it can occur in thumbs as well as fingers and can occur in both hands at the same time. Dupuytren’s can occur in people with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes, but some research indicates that it’s more likely to occur at a younger age in those with type 1 diabetes, as well as women with diabetes. Besides diabetes, other risk factors for this condition include: How do you know if you have Dupuytren’s contracture? A typical sign is one or more fingers that are bent and that will not extend, or straighten out. If you are unable to flatten your hand if you lay it on a table, you may have this condition. Daily tasks such as carrying things or fitting your hand into narrow spaces can be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to carry out. Mild cases of Dupuytren’s that don’t progress quickly may not require treatment. But more severe cases can be treated by breaking apart the tough cords that are pulling on the fingers. This may be done with a procedure called needling, in which a needle is inserted through the skin to puncture and break the cord. This does not “cure” the condition, but if it recurs, needling can be repeated. Needling can’t be used in certain places in the finger due to risk of nerve or tendon damage. Other types of treatment include injecting an enzyme in the cord to soften and weaken it, steroid injections or surgery. Surgery is most often used for advanced cases of Dupuytren’s contracture and involves making a cut in the hand to remove the thickened tissue. However, contractures can occur again, even with surgery. Trigger finger[6] or thumb occurs when your finger gets stuck in a bent position. The finger may snap when it is bent or straightened. The “fancy” name of trigger finger is stenosing tenosynovitis, and it happens when the sheath surrounding the tendon in the affected finger becomes inflamed. In severe cases, the finger may stay locked in a bent position. Trigger finger is more common in people with diabetes, possibly due to chronically high blood sugar levels that cause glycosylation of the connective tissue. People who do work that requires repetitive gripping movements, people with gout or arthritis, people between the ages of 40 and 60, and women are at higher risk of developing this condition. · A snapping or popping sensation when moving the finger · Soreness, pain and/or stiffness at the base of the finger or thumb when bending or grasping · A locking of the finger or thumb in the bent position. Mild cases of trigger finger can be treated by resting the hand, wearing a splint and doing stretching exercises. Over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medicines, such as ibuprofen or steroid injections, are also used to treat milder cases. In more advanced cases, a procedure called percutaneous release may be used. This entails inserting a needle into the tissue around the tendon to break up the constriction. Surgery is an option, too, and this involves cutting the constricted section of the tendon sheath. Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) occurs when the median nerve (the nerve that runs from the forearm into the palm of the hand) becomes pressed or squeezed at the wrist. The median nerve resides inside the carpal tunnel, which is a rigid passageway of ligaments and bones at the base of the hand. The median nerve provides sensation to the palm side of the thumb and to the index, middle and part of the ring fingers (but not the little fingers). CTS can occur when thickening from irritated tendons or other swelling narrows the tunnel and compresses the median nerve. Causes of and risk factors for CTS include: · Trauma or injury to the wrist, such as a sprain or fracture · Rheumatoid arthritis · Underactive thyroid[7] · Fluid retention that occurs during pregnancy or menopause[8] · A cyst or tumor in the carpal tunnel · Obesity · Kidney failure[9] · Diabetes · Repeated use of vibrating tools or work that requires repetitive flexing of the wrist It’s thought that between 15% and 20% of people with diabetes have CTS. The link between these two conditions isn’t entirely clear, but as with other hand conditions, it’s possible that glycation of the carpal tunnel tendons due to high blood sugars and diabetic neuropathy are culprits. Symptoms of CTS include: · Numbness or tingling in the fingers, especially in the thumb, index and middle fingers. The numbness or tingling can run up from your wrist into your arm. · Weakness in your hand due to numbness, making it difficult to grasp objects or do manual tasks. · The inability to feel the difference between hot and cold (more likely in advanced CTS). CTS can be diagnosed with a physical exam of the hands, arms, shoulders and neck; X-ray; special tests to produce symptoms; a nerve conduction study; and/or ultrasound. Treatment of CTS should address the underlying cause, such as diabetes, but may also involve: · Use of a splint while sleeping[10] · Adjusting your chair and keyboard if you work at a desk · Avoiding or limiting daytime activities that produce symptoms · Applying ice packs · Use of anti-inflammatory medicines, such as ibuprofen · Steroid or lidocaine injections · Surgery to cut the ligament to free up the median nerve If you have any of the above symptoms in your hands, don’t delay seeing your healthcare provider. Treatments are available. And talk with your diabetes care team to help you get and keep your blood sugars within your target range[11] to lessen further issues down the road.

Unexplained numbness in your hands can be an alarming symptom to wake up with, but it’s usually nothing to worry about if that’s your only symptom. Chances are it’s probably a result of nerve compression due to your sleeping position. However, if you have numbness in your hands alongside any other unusual symptoms, like numbness elsewhere, make an appointment with your healthcare provider. Nerve compression happens when something (in this case, the position of your arms) puts extra pressure on a nerve. If your hand is numb, it’s likely due to compression of your ulnar, radial, or median nerves. Each of these nerves start at your neck. They run down your arms and through your hands. Read on to learn how to identify different types of nerve compression so you can adjust your sleeping position accordingly. Your helps control forearm muscles that allow you to grip things. It also provides sensation to your pinky and the half of your ring finger next to your pinky in both the front and back of your hand. The ulnar nerve is also responsible for the numbness, pain, or shock you might feel when bumping the inside of your elbow, commonly called your “funny bone.” Ulnar nerve compression usually results from too much pressure on your elbow or wrist. So, if you sleep with your arms and hands curled inward, you might feel numbness in: Continued compression of the ulnar nerve can contribute to the development of . If pain or weakness start to accompany your numbness, make an appointment with your healthcare provider. They might recommend some home exercises or periodically wearing an elbow brace. Your controls muscles and sensation in your index and middle fingers. It’s also responsible for muscles and sensations in the middle-finger side of your ring fingers and in your thumb on the palm side. Compression of the median nerve also tends to happen at your elbow or wrist, so curling up in the fetal position may leave you with numbness: on the front (palm) side of your thumb, index, middle, and half of your ring finger (the half on the middle finger side) Continued compression of the median nerve at your wrist can contribute to carpal tunnel syndrome, though your sleeping position usually won’t cause it on its own. Your controls the muscles used to extend your fingers and your wrist. It’s also responsible for the muscles and sensations in the back of your hand and thumb. Too much pressure above your wrist or along your forearm can lead to compression of the radial nerve. Falling asleep on your arm or wrist, for example, could cause numbness: in the webbing between your index finger and thumb Pressure on your radial nerve can also lead to a condition called radial tunnel syndrome, but you typically won’t have numbness in your fingers or hand with this condition. Instead, you’ll most likely experience pain in your forearm, elbow, and wrist. You can usually manage nerve compression at night by changing up your sleeping position. Avoid sleeping in the fetal position. Sleeping with your arms and elbows bent can put more pressure on your nerves and cause numbness. Try tucking your blankets in tightly to make it harder for you to turn over and curl up in your sleep. If you sleep on your stomach, try to keep your arms out at your sides. Sleeping with them under your body can put too much pressure on them and cause numbness. Sleep with your arms at your sides instead of above your head. Sleeping with your arms above your head can cause numbness by cutting off circulation to your hands. Avoid folding your arms under your pillow while you sleep. The weight of your head can put pressure on your wrists or elbows and compress a nerve. Of course, it’s hard to control your body’s movements when you’re asleep, so you may need some extra help. If you have trouble keeping your elbows or wrists straight overnight, you could try wearing an immobilizing brace while you sleep. This will prevent your elbows or wrists from moving around. You can find these braces online for both your and . Or you can make your own brace by wrapping a towel around the area you want to immobilize and anchor. Whether you purchase a brace or make one, make sure it’s tight enough that it won’t slip off in your sleep but not so tight that it’ll cause more compression. After a few weeks of use, your body may start to adjust to this new position, and you can forgo wearing the brace to bed. If you’ve tried sleeping in different positions and using a brace at night and still wake up with numbness in your hands, you may want to make an appointment with your healthcare provider. numbness in other parts of your body, such as shoulders, neck, or back numbness in both hands or in only one part of your hand Keep in mind that sudden numbness can occasionally indicate , particularly when it happens with the following symptoms: A stroke requires immediate medical attention. If you have these symptoms, seek emergency medical help. Hand numbness often results from compression of the radial, ulnar, or median nerves. These nerves are responsible for muscles in your hands and fingers. Too much pressure on them can lead to numbness. Waking up with numbness only in your hands and fingers typically isn’t a cause for concern if you don’t have other symptoms. Sleeping in a different position or keeping your wrists and elbows straight while you sleep may be enough to improve numbness. But if you still experience numbness or start to notice other unusual symptoms, make an appointment with your healthcare provider. — Medically reviewed by Debra Rose Wilson, Ph.D., MSN, R.N., IBCLC, AHN-BC, CHT Knowing your best sleeping position can be harder than you think.

3822db1d-0f61-40ed-b4c7-02ff3d84c542,"Medically reviewed by — — Diabetes and joint pain are considered to be independent conditions. Joint pain may be a response to an illness, injury, or arthritis. It can be chronic (long-term) or acute (short-term). Diabetes is caused by the body not using the hormone insulin correctly, or insufficient production of it, which affects blood sugar levels. What would a hormone and blood sugar-related condition have to do with joint health? Diabetes is associated with widespread symptoms and complications. According to the , 47 percent of people with arthritis also have diabetes. There is an undeniably strong link between the two conditions. Diabetes can damage joints, a condition called diabetic arthropathy. Unlike pain caused by immediate trauma, the pain of arthropathy happens over time. Other symptoms include: A joint is the place where two bones come together. Once a joint wears down, the protection it provides is lost. Joint pain from diabetic arthropathy comes in different forms. Charcot’s joint occurs when diabetic nerve damage causes a joint to break down. Also called neuropathic arthropathy, this condition is seen in the feet and ankles in people with diabetes. Nerve damage in the feet is common in diabetes, which may lead to Charcot’s joint. A loss of nerve function leads to numbness. People who walk on numb feet are more likely to twist and injure ligaments without knowing it. This places pressure on the joints, which can eventually cause them to wear down. Severe damage leads to deformities in the foot and other affected joints. Bone deformities in Charcot’s joint may be prevented through early intervention. Signs of the condition include: If your doctor determines that your joint pain is related to diabetic Charcot’s joint, it’s important to limit use of the affected areas to prevent bone deformities. If you have numb feet, consider wearing orthotics for additional support. Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis. It may be caused or aggravated by excess weight, which is a common problem in those with type 2 diabetes. Unlike Charcot’s joint, OA is not directly caused by diabetes. Instead, being overweight increases the risk of developing both type 2 diabetes and OA. OA occurs when the cushioning between the joints (cartilage) wears down. This causes the bones to rub up against each other, and results in joint pain. While joint wear-and-tear is natural to some extent in older adults, excess weight speeds up the process. You may notice increasing difficulty in moving your limbs, as well as swelling at the joints. The hips and knees are the most commonly affected areas in OA. The best way to treat OA is to manage your weight. Excess weight puts more pressure on the bones. It also makes diabetes harder to control, so losing extra pounds can not only alleviate chronic joint pain, it may ease other diabetes symptoms. According to the , losing 15 pounds may decrease knee pain by 50 percent. Regular exercise can do more than maintain weight. Physical movement also helps lubricate your joints. As a result, you may feel less pain. Your doctor may prescribe pain medications to use when joint discomfort from OA becomes unbearable. Surgery, such as knee replacement, may be required in severe cases. Just as there are different types of diabetes, joint pain with arthritis comes in different forms. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an inflammatory condition caused by an autoimmune disease. While swelling and redness may be present, as in OA, RA is not caused by excess weight. In fact, the exact causes of RA are unknown. If you have a family history of autoimmune disease, then you may be at risk for RA. Type 1 diabetes is also classified as an autoimmune disease, which explains the possible link between the two. The conditions also share inflammatory markers. Both RA and type 1 diabetes cause increased levels of interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein. Some arthritis medications can help decrease these levels and improve both conditions. Pain and swelling are the primary characteristics of RA. Symptoms can come and go without warning. There is no cure for autoimmune diseases like RA, so the focus of treatment is to reduce inflammation that causes the symptoms. Newer RA drugs include: These three medications may be beneficial in lowering the risk of type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes has been associated with inflammation, which these drugs help manage. In one study, the risk for type 2 diabetes was lower for those on these medications, according to the . The key to beating diabetes-related joint pain is to spot it early. While these conditions can’t be cured, there are treatments available to help minimize pain and discomfort. Call your doctor if you’re experiencing swelling, redness, pain, or numbness in your feet and legs. These symptoms need to be tended to as soon as possible. If you have diabetes or believe you may be at risk, consider talking to your doctor about your personal risk factors for joint pain.

Carpal tunnel syndrome is the of the as it passes into the hand. The median nerve is located on the palm side of your hand (also called the carpal tunnel). The median nerve provides sensation (ability to feel) to your thumb, index finger, long finger, and part of the ring finger. It supplies the impulse to the muscle going to the thumb. Carpal tunnel syndrome can occur in one or both of your hands. Swelling inside your wrist causes the compression in carpal tunnel syndrome. It can lead to numbness, , and tingling on the side of your hand near the thumb. The in your carpal tunnel is due to excess pressure in your wrist and on the median nerve. Inflammation can cause swelling. The most common cause of this inflammation is an underlying medical condition that causes in the wrist, and sometimes obstructed blood flow. Some of the most frequent conditions linked with carpal tunnel syndrome are: Carpal tunnel syndrome can be made worse if the wrist is overextended repeatedly. of your wrist contributes to swelling and compression of the median nerve. This may be the result of: while using your keyboard or mouse prolonged exposure to vibrations from using hand tools or power tools any repeated movement that overextends your wrist, such as playing the piano or typing Women are three times more likely to have carpal tunnel syndrome than men. Carpal tunnel syndrome is most frequently diagnosed between the ages of 30 and 60. Certain conditions increase your risk for developing it, including diabetes, high blood pressure, and . Lifestyle factors that may increase the risk for carpal tunnel syndrome include , high , , and a high . Jobs that involve repetitive wrist movement include: People employed in these occupations may be at higher risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome. The symptoms are usually found along the nerve path because of compression of the median nerve. Your hand may “fall asleep” frequently and drop objects. Other symptoms include: , tingling, and pain in your thumb and the first three fingers of your hand Doctors can diagnose carpal tunnel syndrome using a combination of your history, a , and tests called . A physical examination includes a detailed evaluation of your hand, wrist, shoulder, and neck to check for any other causes of nerve pressure. Your doctor will look at your wrists for signs of tenderness, swelling, and any deformities. They will check sensation to the fingers and strength of the muscles in your hand. Nerve conduction studies are diagnostic tests that can measure the conduction speed of your nerve impulses. If the nerve impulse is slower than normal as the nerve passes into the hand, you may have carpal tunnel syndrome. Treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome depends on how severe your pain and symptoms are and if there is weakness. In 2008, the Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons released guidelines for the effective treatment of carpal tunnel. The recommendation was to try to manage carpal tunnel pain without surgery, if possible. that hold your hand in a neutral position, especially at night mild pain medication and medications to reduce inflammation treatment of any underlying conditions you may have, such as diabetes or arthritis steroid injections into your carpal tunnel area to reduce inflammation Surgery may be necessary if there’s severe damage to your median nerve. Surgery for carpal tunnel syndrome involves cutting the band of tissue in the wrist that crosses the median nerve so as to lessen the pressure on your nerve. Factors that determine success or failure are age of the patient, duration of symptoms, diabetes mellitus, and if there is weakness (which usually is a late sign). The outcome is usually good. You can prevent carpal tunnel syndrome by making lifestyle changes that reduce your risk factors for developing it. Treating conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and arthritis reduces your risk for developing carpal tunnel syndrome. Paying careful attention to and avoiding activities that overextend your wrist are also important strategies for reducing symptoms. Physical therapy may be helpful as well. Treating your carpal tunnel syndrome early with physical therapy and lifestyle changes can lead to significant long-term improvement, and eliminate symptoms. Although unlikely, untreated carpal tunnel syndrome can lead to permanent , disability, and loss of hand function. — — Pump-focused pre-workouts contain a blend of ingredients meant to stimulate increased blood and oxygen flow to working muscles during exercise.

How Do You Know When You Have Carpal Tunnel Syndrome? Medical Author: Medical Editor: How Do You Know When You Have Carpal Tunnel Syndrome? Topic Guide My right hand is starting to get periods of numbness that are getting more frequent. I’ve also noticed I’m becoming more fumble-fingered lately. I think I’m developing this problem from repetitive typing. How do you know when you have carpal tunnel? The following are symptoms associated with . You may still have if you have only a few symptoms. Numbness, (usually a burning ), and tingling in your thumb, index, and middle fingers Tingling, numbness, or pain, which may move up your arm to your elbow Symptoms are usually worse at night and are sometimes temporarily relieved by ""shaking out"" your hands.Expect your doctor to perform several simple tests to evaluate the nerve function of your hand. You can also perform a few of these tests at home. Your doctor will most likely start with a visual and manual inspection of your hand looking for any obvious abnormalities that may help to explain your problem. Range of motion of the wrist is often evaluated. By placing the palms of the hands together, wrist extension can be evaluated. By placing the backs of the hands together, wrist flexion can be evaluated. People who have had prior wrist injuries or wrist often have abnormalities in wrist range of motion. The sensation over your hand will often then be checked to see if your sensation of soft touch, pinprick, or two-point discrimination (the ability to feel two points distinctly using a sharp pin on the fingertips) is abnormal in any areas. The strength in your hands and fingers can be checked, often using your opposite, or good side, for comparison. Physical tests to evaluate for carpal tunnel syndrome include the following: Phalen's sign Hold your elbows at shoulder level and place the backs of your hands together with your wrists bent at 90 degrees. This position increases the pressure on the median nerve. If the test reproduces or worsens your symptoms (pain and tingling in your hands), you may have carpal tunnel syndrome. Tinel sign Have someone hold your wrist and tap on the palm side of your wrist. A positive test produces tingling into the thumb, index, or middle fingers. This is a sign of an irritable nerve where the tapping was done. If this test gives you tingling in your thumb, index, or middle fingers, you may have carpal tunnel syndrome. You may also be referred to a specialist (neurologist, , or orthopedic surgeon) for evaluation of your nerve conduction or the presence of possible arthritis leading to carpal tunnel syndrome. Nerve conduction testing measures the speed with which an electrical impulse travels in the median nerve across the wrist. For people with carpal tunnel syndrome, this nerve impulse will travel more slowly across the wrist than normal. For people who have advanced carpal tunnel syndrome, measurements of electrical activity in the hand muscles may reveal signs of muscle deterioration. Fauci, A.S., and C.A. Langford.

For information:  Questions and Answers for Patients Regarding Elective Surgery and COVID-19. For patients whose procedures have not yet been rescheduled:  What to Do If Your Orthopaedic Surgery Is Postponed. The hand and wrist have multiple small joints that work together to produce motion, including the fine motion needed to thread a needle or tie a shoelace. When the joints are affected by arthritis, activities of daily living can be difficult. Arthritis can occur in many areas of the hand and wrist and can have more than one cause. Over time, if the arthritis is not treated, the bones that make up the joint can lose their normal shape. This causes more pain and further limits motion. Simply defined, arthritis is inflammation of one or more of your joints. The most common types of arthritis are osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, but there are more than 100 different forms. Healthy joints move easily because of a smooth, slippery tissue called articular cartilage. Cartilage covers the ends of bones and provides a smooth gliding surface for the joint. This smooth surface is lubricated by a fluid that looks and feels like oil. It is produced by the joint lining called synovium. When arthritis occurs due to disease, the onset of symptoms is gradual and the cartilage decreases slowly. The two most common forms of arthritis from disease are osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Osteoarthritis is much more common and generally affects older people. Also known as ""wear and tear"" arthritis, osteoarthritis causes cartilage to wear away. It appears in a predictable pattern in certain joints. Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic disease that can affect many parts of your body. It causes the joint lining (synovium) to swell, which causes pain and stiffness in the joint. Rheumatoid arthritis most often starts in the small joints of the hands and feet. It usually affects the same joints on both sides of the body. Fractures, particularly those that damage the joint surface, and dislocations are among the most common injuries that lead to arthritis. Even when properly treated, an injured joint is more likely to become arthritic over time. This x-ray shows fractures within the finger joints. Early symptoms of arthritis of the hand include joint pain that may feel ""dull,"" or a ""burning"" sensation. The pain often occurs after periods of increased joint use, such as heavy gripping or grasping. The pain may not be present immediately, but may show up hours later or even the following day. Morning pain and stiffness are typical. As the cartilage wears away and there is less material to provide shock absorption, the symptoms occur more frequently. In advanced disease, the joint pain may wake you up at night. Pain might be made worse with use and relieved by rest. Many people with arthritis complain of increased joint pain with rainy weather. Activities that once were easy, such as opening a jar or starting the car, become difficult due to pain. To prevent pain at the arthritic joint, you might change the way you use your hand. When the affected joint is subject to greater stress than it can bear, it may swell in an attempt to prevent further joint use. In patients with advanced thumb base arthritis, the neighboring joints may become more mobile than normal. Thumb extension deformity. This patient has lost mobility at the base of the thumb due to arthritis. The next joint closer to the tip of the thumb has become more mobile than normal to make up for the arthritic joint. Normally, the thumb does not come to a right angle with the rest of the hand. The arthritic joint may feel warm to touch. This is due to the body's inflammatory response. There may be a sensation of grating or grinding in the affected joint (crepitation). This is caused by damaged cartilage surfaces rubbing against one another. If arthritis is due to damaged ligaments, the support structures of the joint may be unstable or ""loose."" In advanced cases, the joint may appear larger than normal (hypertrophic). This is usually due to a combination of bone changes, loss of cartilage, and joint swelling. When arthritis affects the end joints of the fingers (DIP joints), small cysts (mucous cysts) may develop. The cysts may then cause ridging or dents in the nail plate of the affected finger. A doctor can diagnose arthritis of the hand by examining the hand and by taking x-rays. Specialized studies, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), are usually not needed except in cases where Keinbock's disease (a condition where the blood supply to one of the small bones in the wrist, the lunate, is interrupted) is suspected. Bone scans of the hands. The darker color is an indication of arthritis. Sometimes a bone scan is helpful. A bone scan may help the doctor diagnose arthritis when it is in an early stage, even if x-rays look normal. Arthritis does not have to result in a painful or sedentary life. It is important to seek help early so that treatment can begin and you can return to doing what matters most to you. Treatment options for arthritis of the hand and wrist include medication, splinting, injections, and surgery, and are determined based on: Your age, activity level and other medical conditions Your personal goals, home support structure, and ability to understand the treatment and comply with a therapy program Medications treat symptoms but cannot restore joint cartilage or reverse joint damage. The most common medications for arthritis are anti-inflammatories, which stop the body from producing chemicals that cause joint swelling and pain. Examples of anti-inflammatory drugs include medications such as naproxen and ibuprofen. Glucosamine and chondroitin are widely advertised dietary supplements or ""neutraceuticals."" Neutraceuticals are not drugs. Rather, they are compounds that are the ""building blocks"" of cartilage. They were originally used by veterinarians to treat arthritic hips in dogs. However, neutraceuticals have not yet been studied as a treatment of hand and wrist arthritis. (Note: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration does not test dietary supplements. These compounds may cause negative interactions with other medications. Always consult your doctor before taking dietary supplements.) When first-line treatment with anti-inflammatory medication is not appropriate, injections may be used. These typically contain a long-lasting anesthetic and a steroid that can provide pain relief for weeks to months. The injections can be repeated, but only a limited number of times, due to possible side effects, such as lightening of the skin, weakening of the tendons and ligaments and infection. Injections are usually combined with splinting of the affected joint. The splint helps support the affected joint to ease the stress placed on it from frequent use and activities. Splints are typically worn during periods when the joints hurt. They should be small enough to allow functional use of the hand when they are worn. Wearing the splint for too long can lead to muscle deterioration (atrophy). Muscles can assist in stabilizing injured joints, so atrophy should be prevented. If nonsurgical treatment fails to give relief, surgery is usually discussed. There are many surgical options. The chosen course of surgical treatment should be one that has a reasonable chance of providing long-term pain relief and return to function. It should be tailored to your individual needs. If there is any way the joint can be preserved or reconstructed, this option is usually chosen. When the damage has progressed to a point that the surfaces will no longer work, a joint replacement or a fusion (arthrodesis) is performed. A joint fusion using a plate and screws at the base of the thumb. Joint fusions provide pain relief but stop joint motion. The fused joint no longer moves; the damaged joint surfaces are gone, so they cannot cause pain and other symptoms. The goal of joint replacement is to provide pain relief and restore function. As with hip and knee replacements, there have been significant improvements in joint replacements in the hand and wrist. The replacement joints are made of materials similar to those used in weightbearing joints, such as ceramics or long-wearing metal and plastic parts. The goal is to improve the function and longevity of the replaced joint. Most of the major joints of hand and wrist can be replaced. A surgeon often needs additional training to perform the surgery. As with any evolving technology, the long-term results of the hand or wrist joint replacements are not yet known. Early results have been promising. Talk with your doctor to find out if these implants are right for you. An example of a finger joint prosthesis used in joint replacement surgery. After any type of joint reconstruction surgery, there is a period of recovery. Often, you will be referred to a trained hand therapist, who can help you maximize your recovery. You may need to use a postoperative splint or cast for awhile after surgery. This helps protect the hand while it heals. During this postoperative period, you may need to modify activities to allow the joint reconstruction to heal properly. Typically, pain medication you take by mouth is also used to reduce discomfort. It is important to discuss your pain with your doctor so it can be adequately treated. Length of recovery time varies widely and depends on the extent of the surgery performed and multiple individual factors. However, people usually can return to most if not all of their desired activities in about three months after most major joint reconstructions. Increasingly, doctors are focusing on how to preserve the damaged joint. This includes getting an earlier diagnosis and repairing joint components before the entire surface becomes damaged. Arthroscopy of the small joints of the hand and wrist is now possible because the equipment has been made much smaller. There have been encouraging results in cartilage repair and replacement in the larger joints such as the knee, and some of these techniques have been applied to the smaller joints of the hand and arm. In addition, stem cell research may be an option to regenerate damaged joint surfaces. AAOS does not endorse any treatments, procedures, products, or physicians referenced herein.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 50 million Americans now suffer from arthritis. That equates to one in five people over 18 having some form of arthritis! () Arthritis is characterized by stiff, aching, hard to move joints and bones. The most common type of arthritis is , which affects about 33 million American adults. Osteoarthritis occurs when cartilage between bones and joints wears down, allowing bones to rub together rather than giving them the protection and cushion they need. Cartilage is made up of and other substances that make connective tissue both flexible and strong. Cartilage covers the ends of bones where they meet the joints — and deterioration over time can affect the shape and functionality of the joints, making it painful and difficult to carry out everyday tasks. Apart from nagging pain and loss of mobility, arthritis can also cause various complications. And unfortunately, most conventional treatments for arthritis don’t address its underlying causes — plus they can cause dependency long term and pose many side effects. Natural treatments for arthritis include eating an anti-inflammatory , staying active and mobile, receiving chiropractic adjustments or massage therapy and using healing essential oils to help control pain. There are currently a number of alternative treatment options available for osteoarthritis sufferers, ranging from supplements to . Many people who formerly suffered with osteoarthritis claim to have finally found relief naturally through adjusting their diets, lifestyles and approaches to managing pain. Here are the top seven natural treatments for arthritis. Additional body fat strains joints, but accumulated fat itself can also cause problems to joints that are already sensitive and partially damaged. Fat does more than just sit on your body — it’s also an active tissue that creates and releases hormones and chemicals. Some of these promote inflammation and can contribute to worsening arthritis all over your body. The University of Michigan School of Public Health reports, Adipose tissue, once considered a passive storage portal of energy, is now recognized as a highly metabolic endocrine organ with the capacity to secrete active agents including adipocytokines, such as , resistin and adiponectin. Over the past decade, interest in these adipocytokines has quickly become an area of intense study with respect to osteoarthritis based on evidence that they may play an important role in cartilage homeostasis and because of their emerging potential as therapeutic targets. () Case in point: Some overweight or obese patients have arthritis in parts of their bodies such as their hands, which obviously don’t support much extra body weight but are still impacted by the negative effects of inflammation. An increase in stored fat cells can speed up the rate at which joints break down, especially in people who have other risk factors for arthritis. This means it’s important to try and maintain a healthy weight by eating an unprocessed, nutrient-dense diet, reducing stress and staying active. : Omega-3s are powerful at lowering inflammation and also have other benefits. Wild-caught fish, including , is your No. 1 food of choice. Other sources include grass-fed beef, flaxseeds, chia seeds and walnuts, which are all great choices.  Sulfur contains a form of methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) that reduces joint inflammation and helps rebuild your tissues.  has been shown in studies to lower pain and function impairment compared to placebo-controlled groups. Sources include onions, garlic, asparagus and cabbage. : Bone broth is one of the best natural sources of collagen, which contains the amino acids and that help rebuild connective tissue and have many more benefits. Additionally, bone broth supples chondroitin sulphates and , antioxidants that help lower inflammation, arthritis and joint pain. (especially fruits and vegetables): Colorful fruits and veggies are packed with antioxidants, vitamin C, vitamin A, fiber, magnesium, potassium, digestive enzymes and anti-inflammatory compounds. Some of the best sources include leafy greens, cruciferous veggies, berries, melon, papaya, avocado and pineapple. : Fiber helps control your appetite, is beneficial for digestive health and lowers the risk for various other diseases and complications. The best high-fiber foods include vegetables, fruit, ancient grains, soaked legumes/beans and nuts and seeds like flaxseeds, chia seeds and walnuts. To help keep inflammation levels low, try to avoid these foods as part of a healing arthritis diet:excess sugar; hydrogenated oils (soybean oil, cottonseed oil, even canola oil); refined conventional grains like gluten, flour products and wheat products; and if you have an autoimmune disease, then also nightshade vegetables like potatoes, eggplant and tomatoes. People with arthritis tend to be less active than those without arthritis, likely due to the pain they feel when exercising and moving stiff body parts. However, physical activity is important for joint health and in the long run, can actually help treat arthritis. for strengthening the muscles around the affected joint, which provides added support and less strain. Most experts consider movement an essential part of any arthritis treatment plan, even stating that it’s “the most effective non-drug treatment for reducing pain and improving movement in patients with osteoarthritis.” (, ) Regular activity has been shown to help lower inflammation, regulate hormones and can even help prevent unnecessary replacement surgeries. Aim to do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity exercise every weekExercises that are most appropriate for people with arthritis include: daily stretches for improved range of motion and flexibility brisk walking for cardiovascular and immune benefits aerobic exercises for building strength and endurance, including aquatic exercises, walking, jogging, bicycling, swimming or using the elliptical machine strength training using light weights, cables or your own  for resistance Chiropractors are often able to alleviate some of the pain associated with osteoarthritis. The type of treatment you get depends directly on the acuteness and severity of your specific case of osteoarthritis. and treatments for arthritis can include manipulation (sometimes called osteopathic manipulation) in the neck or lower back, spinal manipulation, massage therapy, training in biofeeback and relaxation therapies to help control pain. () Similarly, studies have also found acupuncture to be helpful for reducing osteoarthritis pain. Medical schools and the National Institutes of Health now recommend acupuncture as a and many other conditions, including osteoarthritis. () Many chiropractic offices offer several additional holistic services, including acupuncture, herbal treatment, massage therapy and nutrition. aid in digestion by helping provide important enzymes that are normally produced by your digestive organs to metabolize foods. These enzymes can include trypsin and chymotrypsin (both produced by your pancreas), papain and bromelain. Proteolytic enzymes are obtained from things like tropical fruits, including papaya, which contains papain, and pineapples, which contain . Proteolytic enzymes have been found to have anti-inflammatory effects because they help improve overall gut health and immunity. Some research shows they can decrease pain and swelling associated with rheumatoid arthritis, increase mobility in people with osteoarthritis and fight infections by controlling inflammatory responses. () Doses vary depending on the kind of enzymes, but recommendations are usually around 500 milligrams to 2,000 milligrams taken three times a day between meals.  contains chemicals that may have analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects on the body. In research studies, ginger has been shown to lessen pain associated with arthritis and improve overall digestive/gut health. A 2005 report published in the stated that ginger extract derived from  and  plant species inhibits the induction of several genes involved in the inflammatory response. These include genes encoding , chemokines and the inducible enzyme cyclooxygenase. () More than 100 active components have been isolated from turmeric, including special substances found in turmeric’s volatile oils called turmerone, curcumin, demethoxycurcumin, 5′-methoxycurcumin and dihydrocurcumin. () The most active ingredient in  is considered to be curcumin, which is known to be one of the most powerful natural anti-inflammatories there is. The potential anti-arthritic effects of turmeric include inhibition of joint inflammation, reduction in edema and/or swelling and slowed periarticular joint destruction. Turmeric has been researched in dozens of studies, many investigating its painkilling effects in relation to inflammatory conditions. One study conducted by Nirmala Medical Centre in India investigated the effects of turmeric supplements given to rheumatoid arthritis patients compared to use of conventional arthritis drugs () or a combination of both together. The curcumin group showed the highest percentage of improvements overall, significantly better than the patients in the diclofenac sodium groups, and with practically no negative side effects. () Known as Indian frankincense, this potent supplement helps reduce inflammation.  can be found in several concentrated forms, including a therapeutic-grade oil that can be massaged directly into the skin over painful areas.  extract is so powerful that today it’s considered comparable to pain relievers. According to the , bowellia/frankincense oil is capable of reducing arthritis pain through several mechanisms: supporting overall immune function, interfering with cytokine production that raises inflammation, delaying reactions to sensitivities, helping regulate (white blood cells) and T-cells interactions and reducing autoimmune effects related to immunoglobulin G antibodies. () Combine several drops of pure frankincense oil with a carrier oil like coconut oil, and apply to the painful joint area several times daily. Other beneficial  that can be used in similar ways include myrrh, turmeric, ginger, orange, peppermint and lavender oils. , a medicinal herb shown to help with pain, makes a great addition to any topical treatment for arthritis. In fact, researchers at the School of Health and Sport Sciences at the University of the Sunshine Coast in Australia reviewed a cohort of studies on topical herbal therapies for treating osteoarthritis. They found that “comfrey extract gel probably improves pain.” () Additionally, research published in the examined 43 male and female subjects, aged 45–83, diagnosed with osteoarthritis in the knee and randomly assigned them to one of three groups: 10 percent or 20 percent comfrey root extract or a placebo. The participants applied cream three times a day for six weeks and were evaluated every two weeks. The results showed that “both active topical comfrey formulations were effective in relieving pain and stiffness and in improving physical functioning and were superior to placebo in those with primary osteoarthritis of the knee without serious adverse effects.” () Arthritis is the No. 1 cause of disability in the U.S. An estimated 50 percent of adults living in the U.S. who are over the age of 65 now report receiving a diagnoses of arthritis from their doctors. Arthritis doesn’t just impact the older groups of Americans either — almost 300,000 babies and children have arthritis or a rheumatic condition! Two-thirds of people with arthritis are under the age of 65. It’s now estimated that by 2030 there will be 67 million Americans over the age of 18 suffering with arthritis. Arthritis, especially osteoarthritis, is more common among women. Around 26 percent of adult women have arthritis compared to 18 percent of adult men. People with arthritis or a rheumatic condition lose more workdays every year due to illness or injury than adults with any other medical condition, are more likely to be unemployed, have much higher medical costs yearly, and are likely to suffer at least some sort of physical disability. Among adults with arthritis, around 47 percent have at least one other disease or condition, including heart disease, diabetes, obesity, anxiety, depression, or high blood pressure. Arthritis among children is also an unfortunate reality. Called juvenile arthritis, it affects nearly 300,000 children under the age 18 in the U.S.. The most common type is juvenile idiopathic arthritis (meaning the cause is unknown). There are several other forms of arthritis affecting children. Classified as an autoimmune disorder, most specialists believe that juvenile arthritis is something in a child’s genes (passed from parents to children) makes the child more likely to get arthritis, and something like a virus then sets off the arthritis. The most common symptoms of juvenile arthritis include the swelling of joints, pain along with stiffness that doesn’t dissipate. Juvenile arthritis affects the knees, hands, and feet, and it’s worse after a night’s rest or a nap. () Hallmark warning signs and symptoms of arthritis include: : Pain intensity varies from person to person, depending on the location in the body, and might come and go depending on other lifestyle factors. Signs of inflammation and swelling: You might be able to notice swelling and fluid retention through your skin over the affected joint. Joints can also become red, warm and tender, which are signs of swelling. Stiffness: Stiff joints affect most people with arthritis and tend to be worse when standing, laying or sitting in one position for long periods. While the symptoms of arthritis vary from person to person, the two most common are stiffness and pain. This is especially the case with osteoarthritis, which often causes the most intense stiffness first thing after waking up in the morning. () The Arthritis Foundation points out that “if you experience morning stiffness that lasts longer than an hour, this is a good reason to suspect arthritis. It also shouldn’t be that hard or painful to get up from your favorite chair.” () Some joints are more commonly impacted by arthritis/osteoarthritis than others, including those located in: () If you suffer with osteoarthritis in one of these places, you may have difficulty with movement in general and doing any of the follow activities: Doing intricate, detailed work, such as knitting or needlepoint Arthritis can also cause complications. Fluid can accumulate in the affected joint, and levels of a beneficial chemical hormone called can decline, which means joints are less protected from the effects of shock and pressure. Another common complication associated with osteoarthritis is free-floating bone or cartilage within joint fluid, causing irritation and sometimes developing into painful bone spurs. A less common complication of longstanding, severe rheumatoid arthritis is called rheumatoid vasculitis, which occurs in about 1 percent of this patient population. () In such cases, a treatment plan is normally outlined by a rheumatologist. Experts still don’t know of one concrete cause for all cases of , including osteoarthritis. Rather, it’s believed that the cause of arthritis is multifactorial and depends on a combination of genetic and lifestyle factors. Some of the factors believed to contribute to arthritis/osteoarthritis most include:  Arthritis is known to run in families, although having a family history isn’t a guarantee you’ll develop arthritis. The reports that the human leukocyte antigen region in the human genome is the most heterogeneous, and many diseases are known to be associated with this region, including arthritis. One theory linking genetics to arthritis is that people with osteoarthritis might have a genetic defect in the gene that controls the production of collagen. Collagen is important for making cartilage, so slowed production can lead to faster joint deterioration. Certain people might also have genes that result in slight malformations of bones and joints, leading to uneven cartilage and problems associated with how joints rub up against one another. ()  Being overweight or obese increases your risk because excess weight puts added pressure on your joints. Your hips and knees bear most of your body’s weight and are especially susceptible to added strain and stress. According to , for every pound of weight you gain you put an additional four pounds of extra weight on your knees. While one in five Americans has been diagnosed with arthritis, according to the CDC)that number jumps to more than one in three among obese people. ()  Trauma or injury to joints trigger the process of cartilage loss and deterioration.  Repetitive movements for many years, or exercising without enough are risk factors.  Examples of organisms that can infect joints are salmonella and shigella (food poisoning or contamination), chlamydia and gonorrhea (sexually transmitted diseases), and hepatitis C. RA is an that causes the immune system to attack the body’s own healthy joint tissue. This can be in reaction to gut-related problems (like or food allergies) and other factors like high amounts of stress and toxicity.  Having other health problems like diabetes or an autoimmune disorder can raise your risk for arthritis. Gout and metabolic problems like buildup also contribute to arthritis because they cause crystal-like particles to develop in the joints, resulting in sudden spikes of extreme joint pain. Different forms of arthritis have different root causes. Rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis are examples of “inflammatory arthritis,” also described as autoimmune arthritis. This occurs when the immune system generates internal inflammation to get rid of perceived threats (like an infection or allergy) and mistakenly causes joint erosion and sometimes organ damage. These forms of arthritis are especially important to treat as early on as possible, since tissue damage can be hard to reverse once it sets in. Inflammatory arthritis is believed to be highly tied to gut health, which means a healthy diet is key for recovery. Different types of arthritis are treated conventionally by rheumatologists.  is a sub-specialty in internal medicine and revolves around the diagnosis and therapy of rheumatic diseases. Rheumatology involves studying diseases can affect the joints, muscles and bones, often causing pain, swelling, stiffness and even deformity. The most common type of treatment for arthritis is pharmaceutical drugs. Those that are most often prescribed to manage osteoarthritis are analgesics. These drugs are used to , but not also inflammation or the underlying causes of arthritis. Four common prescription used to treat osteoarthritis pain include: Not only do these medications pose many potential side effects, but they can also be very addicting. The FDA requires a label warning of risks associated with these prescriptions, including heart attack, stroke and stomach bleeding. These strong pain relievers contain narcotics that lower pain by blocking receptors on nerve cells but don’t treat inflammation and have high rates of dependency. () For dealing with very bad pain, over-the-counter drugs might be helpful temporarily, every now and then.  is the most commonly recommended and most widely available analgesic recommended for osteoarthritis pain, and it’s sometimes used in combination with other drugs or supplements. NSAID painkillers are also commonly used to help control both pain and inflammation, but again, over-the-counter painkillers won’t treat underlying causes. If you want to avoid the risk and side effects of prescription painkilling drugs, the alternative natural treatments for arthritis above can greatly help control your pain help your condition. () Arthritis is the No. 1 cause of disability in the U.S. According to the CDC, more than 50 million Americans have arthritis, which is one in five people over 18. The most common type is osteoarthritis, which affects about 33 million American adults. An estimated 50 percent of adults living in the U.S. who are over the age of 65 now report receiving a diagnoses of arthritis from their doctors. Arthritis doesn’t just impact the older groups of Americans either — almost 300,000 babies and children have arthritis or a rheumatic condition! Two-thirds of people with arthritis are under the age of 65. Symptoms of arthritis include join pain, inflammation, swelling, stiffness, decreased range of motion and loss of flexibility. Some of the most commonly impacted joints are located in the lower back, hips, knees, feet, neck, fingers and thumb base. There’s no concrete cause for all cases of arthritis, but factors that are believed to contribute to arthritis include genetic susceptibility, weight, injury, overuse, infections, autoimmune disorders and other medical conditions. In my opinion, the top seven natural treatments for arthritis include reaching and maintaining a healthy weight, improving your diet, staying active, getting chiropractic care, taking proteolytic enzymes, consuming ginger and turmeric and using boswellia essential oil.   Dr. Josh Axe is on a mission to provide you and your family with the highest quality nutrition tips and healthy recipes in the world...Sign up to get VIP access to his eBooks and valuable weekly health tips for Secret Detox Drink Recipe (A Natural Detox Drink Recipe) Secret Detox Drink Recipe (A Natural Detox Drink Recipe) How to Get Rid of Bags Under the Eyes: 13 Easy, Natural Ways The Best Sunscreens, Toxic Ones to Avoid & the State of Sunscreen in America Benefits of Journaling + How to Start (Tips, Prompts, Methods & More) It’s not uncommon for teenagers to keep diaries that they use for ...

Pain also occurs with joint inflammation (arthritis) and infection. Joint pain symptoms can be associated with local warmth, swelling, and tenderness. Treatment depends on the cause and can include rest, cold applications, medications, physical therapy, or surgery. Arthritis is inflammation of the joints. Arthritis causes include injury, abnormal metabolism (such as gout), inheritance (such as in osteoarthritis), infections (such as in the arthritis of Lyme disease), and an overactive immune system (such as rheumatoid arthritis [RA] and systemic lupus erythematosus). Symptoms of arthritis include pain and limited joint function. Treatment may include pain medications, pain-relieving creams, and dietary supplements. Gout is characterized by abnormal uric acid metabolism. Symptoms and signs include a red, hot, swollen joint, and acute pain. Medications for the treatment of gout include NSAIDs, colchicine, corticosteroids, probenecid, allopurinol, and febuxostat. Staying hydrated as well as elevating and applying ice packs to the swollen joint may help to relieve pain and reduce inflammation. Rheumatoid arthritis, often called RA, is a chronic (long-standing) disease that damages and eventually destroys the joints of the body. Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA), or juvenile arthritis, is not a single disease but a group of diseases. Symptoms and signs include fever and joint pain, swelling, and stiffness. Treatment focuses on relieving pain, improving function, and preventing joint damage. Osteoarthritis is not a single disease but a culmination of problems that leads to skeletal joint failure. Symptoms include aching, stiffness, and bone enlargement. Diet, exercise, pain medication, and sometimes surgery treat osteoarthritis. Repetitive motion injuries are among the most common injuries in the United States. They include tendinitis, carpal tunnel, bursitis of the joints, and others. Exercises, NSAIDs, and cortisone injections are some of the treatments for repetitive motion injuries. Rheumatoid arthritis (often called RA) is a chronic (long-standing) disease that damages the joints of the body. Symptoms and signs of rheumatoid arthritis include joint pain, swelling, inflammation, stiffness, warmth, muscle aches, weakness, fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, weight loss, and malaise. Treatment may involve physical therapy, occupational therapy, hydrotherapy, heat and cold treatments, joint replacements, and medications.

People with this condition may feel pain, numbness and general weakness in the hand and wrist. Lifestyle changes, like wrist splints and changes to your environment, are possible treatments. Surgery is another option for carpal tunnel. Carpal tunnel syndrome is a common condition that causes pain, numbness, tingling, and weakness in the hand and wrist. It happens when there is increased pressure within the wrist on a nerve called the median nerve. This nerve provides sensation to the thumb, index, and middle fingers, and to half of the ring finger. The small finger (the “pinky”) is typically not affected. Carpal tunnel syndrome was first described in the mid-1800s. The first surgery for the release of the carpal tunnel was done in the 1930s. It is a condition that has been well recognized by orthopaedic surgeons for over 40 years. The carpal tunnel is a narrow canal or tube in the wrist. Similarly to a tunnel you could travel through by car, this part of the wrist allows the median nerve and tendons to connect the hand and forearm. The parts of this tunnel include: Carpal bones: These bones make up the bottom and sides of the tunnel. They are formed in a semi-circle. Ligament: The top of the tunnel, the ligament is a strong tissue that holds the tunnel together. Inside the tunnel are the median nerve and tendons. Median nerve: This nerve provides feeling to most of the fingers in the hand (expect the little finger). It also adds strength to the base of the thumb and index finger. Tendons: Rope-like structures, tendons connect muscles in the forearm to the bones in the hand. They allow the fingers and thumb to bend. Does carpal tunnel syndrome only happen to office workers or factory workers? No. Many people with carpal tunnel syndrome have never done office work or worked on an assembly line. It affects people who use their wrists and hands repeatedly at work and at play. Anyone can get carpel tunnel syndrome, but it is unusual before age 20. The chance of getting carpal tunnel syndrome increases with age. People at risk for carpal tunnel syndrome are those who do activities or jobs that involve repetitive finger use. Motions that can place people at risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome include: Many other factors can also contribute to the development of carpal tunnel syndrome. These factors can include: Heredity (smaller carpal tunnels can run in families). Hemodialysis (a process where the blood is filtered). Arthritic diseases such as and . Carpal tunnel syndrome is also more common in women than in men. Carpal tunnel syndrome is caused when the space (the carpal tunnel) in the wrist narrows. This presses down on the median nerve and tendons (located inside the carpal tunnel), makes them swell, which cuts off sensation in the fingers and hand. How often is hand pain caused by carpal tunnel syndrome? While carpal tunnel syndrome is a common condition, it has a different set of symptoms from many other sources of hand pain. There are actually several similar conditions that cause hand pain. These include: : A condition where swelling (inflammation) affects the wrist and base of the thumb. In this condition, you will feel pain when you make a fist and simulate shaking someone’s hand. : This condition causes soreness at the base of the finger or thumb. Trigger finger also causes pain, locking (or catching) and stiffness when bending the fingers and thumb. : This is a general term for many conditions that cause stiffness and swelling in your joints. Arthritis can impact many joints in your body and ranges from causing small amounts of discomfort to breaking down the joint over time ( is one type of degenerative arthritis). Symptoms usually begin slowly and can occur at any time. Early symptoms include: Tingling and/or pain in the fingers (especially the thumb, index and middle fingers). In fact, because some people sleep with their wrists curled, nighttime symptoms are common and can wake people from sleep. These nighttime symptoms are often the first reported symptoms. Shaking the hands helps relieve symptoms in the early stage of the condition. Difficulty using the hand for small tasks, like: As carpal tunnel syndrome worsens, symptoms become more constant. These symptoms can include: Inability to perform tasks that require delicate motions (such as buttoning a shirt). In the most severe condition, the muscles at the base of the thumb visibly shrink in size (atrophy). Last reviewed by a Cleveland Clinic medical professional on 10/22/2019.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common kind of arthritis. There are a number of contributing factors to osteoarthritis, including age. Osteoarthritis, also known as degenerative joint disease (DJD), is the most common type of arthritis. Osteoarthritis is more likely to develop as people age. The changes in osteoarthritis usually occur slowly over many years, though there are occasional exceptions. Inflammation and injury to the joint cause bony changes, deterioration of tendons and ligaments and a breakdown of cartilage, resulting in pain, swelling, and deformity of the joint. Primary: Most common, generalized, primarily affects the fingers, thumbs, spine, hips, knees, and the great (big) toes. Secondary: Occurs with a pre-existing joint abnormality, including injury or trauma, such as repetitive or sports-related; inflammatory arthritis, such as , , or ; infectious arthritis; genetic joint disorders, such as (also known as hypermobility or ""double-jointed; congenital joint disorders; or metabolic joint disorders. Cartilage is a firm, rubbery, flexible connective tissue covering the ends of bones in normal joints. It is primarily made up of water and proteins whose primary function is to reduce friction in the joints and serve as a ""shock absorber."" The shock-absorbing quality of normal cartilage comes from its ability to change shape when compressed, because of its high water content. Although cartilage may undergo some repair when damaged, the body does not grow new cartilage after injury. Cartilage is avascular, meaning there are no blood vessels in it. Therefore, healing is a slow process. Cartilage is made up of two main elements: cells within it known as chondrocytes and a gel-like substance called matrix, composed mostly of water and two types of proteins (collagen and proteoglycans). Chondrocytes, and the precursor form chondroblasts, are highly complex multifunctional cartilage cells. Functions include synthesizing and maintaining the extracellular matrix comprised of collagen and proteoglycans that help healthy cartilage grow and heal. Collagen is a structural protein found in many tissues such as skin, tendons and bone and is a key structural component of cartilage. Collagen provides cartilage with its strength and creates a framework for the other components. Proteoglycans are complex molecules composed of protein and sugar combinations that are interwoven in the matrix of cartilage. Their function is to trap large amounts of water in cartilage, which allows it to change shape when compressed thus acting as a shock absorber. At the same time, proteoglycans repel each other, allowing cartilage the ability to maintain its shape and resilience. Approximately 80% of older adults, ages 55 years and older, have evidence of osteoarthritis on X-ray. Of these, an estimated 60% experience symptoms. It is estimated that 240 million adults worldwide have symptomatic osteoarthritis, including more than 30 million U.S. adults. Post-menopausal women have an increased incidence of knee osteoarthritis compared to men. In addition to age and secondary causes such as inflammatory arthritis and prior injury/ trauma, several other risk factors increase the chance of developing osteoarthritis including obesity, diabetes, elevated cholesterol, sex, and genetics. is a risk factor for osteoarthritis, particularly of the knee. In addition to overloading the weight-bearing mechanisms of the body, the metabolic and pro-inflammatory effects of obesity have been studied as contributory to osteoarthritis. Maintaining ideal body weight or losing extra weight is important for those at risk. Both and (elevated lipids/cholesterol) contribute to the inflammatory response within the body, increasing the risk of osteoarthritis. Oxidation of lipids can also create deposits in cartilage which affects affecting blood flow of subchondral bone in the same way that blood vessels are affected by . Elevated blood sugars, as well as elevated cholesterol/lipids, increase free radicals within the body, this oxidative stress exceeds the resilience of cartilage on the cellular level. Controlling diabetes and hyperlipidemia is important for bone health in addition to general health. Decreased estrogen as experienced by post-menopausal women increases the risk of knee osteoarthritis as estrogen is protective of bone health specifically reducing oxidative stress to the cartilage. Heredity can play a role in osteoarthritis, as individuals born with other bone diseases or genetic traits may be more likely to develop osteoarthritis. For example, Ehlers-Danlos, which is characterized by joint laxity or hypermobility, can contribute to osteoarthritis. Primary osteoarthritis is a heterogeneous disease meaning it has many different causes, it is not only “wear and tear” arthritis. Some contributing factors to OA are modifiable (can be changed) and others are non-modifiable (cannot be changed such as born with it or now permanent). Age is a contributing factor, although not all older adults develop osteoarthritis and for those who do, not all develop associated pain. As discussed above, there can also be inflammatory and metabolic risks that can increase the incidence of osteoarthritis, particularly in the setting of diabetes and/or elevated cholesterol. Osteoarthritis can be genetic both as primary such as as well as secondary related to other genetic disorders, such as hypermobility of joints. Inflammatory and infectious arthritis can contribute to the development of secondary osteoarthritis due to chronic inflammation and joint destruction. Previous injuries or traumas including sports-related and repetitive motions can also contribute to osteoarthritis. Although the exact mechanisms of cartilage loss and bone changes are unknown, advancements have been made in recent years. It is suspected that complex signaling processes, during joint inflammation and defective repair mechanisms in response to injury, gradually wear down cartilage within the joints. Other changes cause the joint to lose mobility and function, resulting in joint pain with activity. Last reviewed by a Cleveland Clinic medical professional on 11/26/2019.

Wrist pain is any discomfort in the wrist. It’s often caused by carpal tunnel syndrome. Other common causes include wrist injury, arthritis, and gout. The following conditions are common causes of wrist pain. The median nerve is one of the three major nerves in the forearm. occurs when the median nerve becomes compressed, or pinched. It is located on the palm side of your hand, providing sensation to the following parts of the : It also provides the electrical impulse to the muscle leading to the thumb. Carpal tunnel syndrome can occur in one or both of your hands. Swelling in the wrist causes the compression in carpal tunnel syndrome. The pain is due to excess pressure in your wrist and on the median nerve. Aside from causing wrist pain, carpal tunnel syndrome can lead to numbness, weakness, and tingling on the side of your hand near the thumb. Wrist swelling can occur and trigger carpal tunnel syndrome due to any of the following conditions: performing repetitive tasks with your hands, such as typing, drawing, or sewing being overweight, pregnant, or going through menopause having certain medical conditions, such as , arthritis, or an An injury to your wrist can also cause pain. Wrist injuries include sprains, broken bones, and . Swelling, bruising, or disfigured joints near the wrist may be symptoms of a wrist injury. Some wrist injuries can happen right away due to the trauma of an impact. Others may develop slowly over time. is caused by a buildup of uric acid. Uric acid is a chemical produced when your body breaks down foods that contain organic compounds called purines. Most uric acid is dissolved in the blood and removed from the body through urination. In some cases, however, the body produces too much uric acid. The can be deposited in the joints, resulting in pain and swelling. This pain frequently occurs in the knees, ankles, wrists, and feet. other conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and kidney disease is an inflammation of the joints. The condition can cause swelling and stiffness in the affected body part. Arthritis has many causes, including normal wear and tear, aging, and overworking the hands. There are many forms of arthritis, but the most common types include: is an autoimmune disease that usually affects both wrists. It develops when the immune system mistakenly attacks the lining of your joints, including your wrists. This can cause painful swelling, which may eventually result in bone erosion. is a degenerative joint disease that’s common among older adults. It is caused by a breakdown of the cartilage that covers the joints. The protective tissue is damaged by age and repeated motion. This increases the friction as the bones of the joint rub against each other, resulting in swelling and pain. is a type of arthritis that occurs in people with a skin disorder called .

Topic Guide : Osteoarthritis is the most common type of arthritis that frequently develops with age. It is a chronic condition in which the cartilage between bones that cushions the joints wears down and as it does, the bones rub against each other causing pain, stiffness, swelling, and reduced joint motion. Read the What Are The 4 Stages of Osteoarthritis? Main Article Arthritis is a serious disease and establishing an accurate diagnosis is key to the right kind of treatment. As a patient, you are the most important advocate for your treatment, so proper education is key for a good outcome. 5 Home Remedies to Improve Osteoarthritis Symptoms Diet can affect health in many ways, and researchers have shown diet-related factors may be implicated in worsening of osteoarthritis. Obesity increases the risk for developing this condition. Bone mineral calcium supplements and vitamin C also, for instance, can help reduce the symptoms. Arthritis is inflammation of the joints. Arthritis causes include injury, abnormal metabolism (such as gout), inheritance (such as in osteoarthritis), infections (such as in the arthritis of Lyme disease), and an overactive immune system (such as rheumatoid arthritis [RA] and systemic lupus erythematosus). Symptoms of arthritis include pain and limited joint function. Treatment may include pain medications, pain-relieving creams, and dietary supplements. Osteoarthritis is not a single disease but a culmination of problems that leads to skeletal joint failure. Symptoms include aching, stiffness, and bone enlargement. Diet, exercise, pain medication, and sometimes surgery treat osteoarthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis (often called RA) is a chronic (long-standing) disease that damages the joints of the body. Symptoms and signs of rheumatoid arthritis include joint pain, swelling, inflammation, stiffness, warmth, muscle aches, weakness, fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, weight loss, and malaise. Treatment may involve physical therapy, occupational therapy, hydrotherapy, heat and cold treatments, joint replacements, and medications. Osteoarthritis, the most common type of arthritis, is caused by degeneration of cartilage and is also known as degenerative arthritis. In contrast, rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disorder caused by the immune system attacking the joints. This autoimmune process causes systemic inflammation, while in osteoarthritis, mechanical degeneration causes localized inflammation. Osteoarthritis commonly affects a single joint, such as one knee. Rheumatoid arthritis (often called RA) is a chronic (long-standing) disease that damages the joints of the body.

You may want to have a say in this decision, or you may simply want to follow your doctor's recommendation. Either way, this information will help you understand what your choices are so that you can talk to your doctor about them. Don't have surgery. Use rest, ice, medicine, wrist splints, and new ways to do some tasks. Home treatments may be all you need if you've had mild symptoms for a short time. You may be able to treat carpal tunnel syndrome with rest, ice, medicine, and wrist splints. You also can learn to do some tasks in a way that doesn't hurt your wrist. Surgery may be a better choice if you've had very bad symptoms for a long time. Surgery for carpal tunnel syndrome may give you only a little relief if your symptoms are caused by other health problems, such as rheumatoid arthritis, hypothyroidism, or diabetes. Treating these problems often makes carpal tunnel symptoms get better or go away. But in some cases, you still might need surgery. Sometimes surgery is needed to prevent lasting nerve damage. You will likely have a nerve test to see if you need surgery. Symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome in pregnant women often go away after childbirth. Unless your symptoms are very bad, you may want to wait and see if your symptoms go away after you have the baby. is a nerve problem that causes tingling, numbness, weakness, or pain in the fingers, thumb, or palm, and sometimes the forearm. These symptoms are caused by pressure on a nerve () in the wrist (). This problem is often linked to hand and wrist motions that you do a lot. These are called repetitive motions. Swelling or fluid retention in the wrist—which can happen during pregnancy or because of a health problem—also can cause carpal tunnel symptoms or make them worse. What problems can you have from carpal tunnel syndrome? Severe carpal tunnel syndrome that lasts a long time can lead to permanent damage to the . This can make it hard for you to use your hand. Weak thumb muscles. This makes it hard for you to grip or hold objects. Loss of feeling and ability to use your fingers and hand well. Surgery reduces the pressure on the median nerve in the wrist. The doctor cuts a ligament to relieve the pressure on the nerve. The surgery is called . It can be done in one of two ways: : Your doctor makes a small cut (incision) in the palm of your hand. : Your doctor makes one small incision in the wrist, or one small incision in the wrist and one in the palm. He or she puts a thin tube with a camera attached (endoscope) into the incision. Surgical tools are put in along with the scope. You may decide to have surgery if you've had very bad symptoms for a long time and other treatments haven't helped. Sometimes surgery is needed to prevent lasting nerve damage. You will likely have a nerve test to see if you need surgery. Most people who have surgery for carpal tunnel syndrome have less or no pain and numbness in their hand and better hand function after surgery. It's not clear how long you should try nonsurgical treatment before considering surgery. But after people who have severe carpal tunnel syndrome have surgery, they typically have fewer symptoms and better hand function than people who continue using wrist splints or a combination of medicine and hand therapy. Both types of surgery—open and endoscopic—work equally well to improve symptoms. Talk to your doctor about which surgery might be best for you. Major problems from surgery can happen, but they are rare. About 1 person out of 100 has a major problem after surgery, such as nerve damage, while 99 out of 100 people don't. You can try several home treatments to help relieve your symptoms. This may be all you need to do for mild symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome. Doctors suggest that you try these treatments for 3 to 12 months before you think about having surgery. It often helps to try several treatments at the same time. Rest your hand for 1 or 2 weeks. Stop activities that hurt. Put ice on the palm of your hand and wrist for 10 to 15 minutes at a time. Take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as naproxen or ibuprofen. Studies haven't shown NSAIDs to be effective for carpal tunnel syndrome, but they may help relieve your symptoms. Talk to your doctor before taking NSAIDs. They can cause side effects. Be safe with medicines. Read and follow all instructions on the label. Wear a wrist splint. It's usually worn at night, but you can wear it during the day. You can work with a physical therapist to learn how to do activities in a new way. If these home care treatments don't help, you may be able to take corticosteroid shots or pills to improve your symptoms. Symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome in pregnant women often go away after childbirth. Unless your symptoms are very bad, you may want to put off having surgery and see if your symptoms go away after you have the baby. Rest, ice, and other home treatments may be all you need if you've had mild symptoms for a short time. Your doctor may also suggest that you try wrist splints or corticosteroids to avoid or delay surgery. Splints are easy and inexpensive, and there is little risk to trying them. Corticosteroid shots and pills give short-term relief from symptoms. Why might your doctor recommend surgery for carpal tunnel syndrome? You've had very bad symptoms for a long time, so you're at risk of having lasting nerve damage. A wrist splint, medicines, and other treatments haven't helped your symptoms. You have local anesthetic, so you are awake but won't have pain. You need to avoid heavy use of your hand for up to 3 months. If you have open surgery on your dominant hand and you do repeated actions at work, you may be able to return to work in 6 to 8 weeks. If the surgery is on the other hand and you do not do repeated actions at work, you may be able to return to work in 7 to 14 days. If you have endoscopic surgery, you may be able to return to work sooner than with open surgery. Surgery can make symptoms get better or go away for most people. Major problems from surgery, such as infection or a problem from anesthesia, are rare. You can try several home treatments to ease symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome, including: If you are pregnant, you can wait to see if the problem goes away after childbirth. If you have very bad symptoms and wait too long, you could have lasting nerve damage. Temporary increase in pain, or a small chance of nerve damage, after a corticosteroid shot. Personal stories about surgery for carpal tunnel syndrome These stories are based on information gathered from health professionals and consumers. They may be helpful as you make important health decisions. One of the most annoying things about my carpal tunnel syndrome is the night pain in my hands. If I don't wear the splints, it wakes me up almost every night. But with the splints, I can get a good night's sleep, and my doctor says that my thumb and hand strength are not too bad. I'm nervous about any kind of surgery, so when my doctor said it would be okay to wait awhile, I said, ""Great."" If the splints stop working, though, I'll probably be back in my doctor's office! I own a landscaping business, and a few months ago I started having a lot of pain when putting in backyard fences. Then the pain started to wake me up at night and keep me awake. My doctor said I had a classic case of carpal tunnel syndrome. I tried some of the home treatments that she recommended, and the problem didn't get any worse, but it didn't get any better, either. So I went back and asked about surgery. It sounds like the surgery has a good chance of taking care of the problem, so I'm going to give it a try. When you own your own company, it's too expensive to keep missing work. But I'll have to wait till the slow season, because I'll have to take a few weeks' break to recover. I thought for sure that I was going to have to have surgery for my carpal tunnel. I'm an order-taker for a mail-order catalog company, which means I type a lot, and my symptoms were really getting bad. My fingers were numb, so I kept hitting the wrong keys on the keyboard and making errors. The pain was waking me up at night, and it was even starting to hurt during the day. I went to my boss and the human resources manager at work, and together we worked out a job-sharing arrangement that lets me take orders for part of the day and work in the mail room the rest of the day. I am going to see how that helps, along with the exercises and the splints. When I dropped my third coffee cup in a week, I decided it was time to do something about my hands. I've had this carpal tunnel problem for a couple of years now, and I'm tired of wearing the splints and getting occasional steroid shots in my wrists. My doctor says that whether I have surgery or not is really up to me at this point. I think I'm ready for it. Your personal feelings are just as important as the medical facts. Think about what matters most to you in this decision, and show how you feel about the following statements. I tried other treatments, but my pain is still bad. I can live with the pain while I give other treatments some more time to work. I don't mind having surgery if it can get rid of my symptoms. I'm not worried about the small chance of problems from surgery. I don't want to take even a small chance of something going wrong with surgery. I'm afraid of having lasting nerve damage from carpal tunnel syndrome. I'm not worried that I'll have lasting nerve damage from carpal tunnel syndrome. Now that you've thought about the facts and your feelings, you may have a general idea of where you stand on this decision. Show which way you are leaning right now. Home treatments may be all I need to get rid of mild symptoms from carpal tunnel syndrome. Surgery may not be a good choice if my symptoms are caused by pregnancy or a health problem. I have a good chance of improving or getting rid of my symptoms with surgery. Are you clear about which benefits and side effects matter most to you? Do you have enough support and advice from others to make a choice? How sure do you feel right now about your decision? Check what you need to do before you make this decision.

You may want to have a say in this decision, or you may simply want to follow your doctor's recommendation. Either way, this information will help you understand what your choices are so that you can talk to your doctor about them. Here's a record of your answers. You can use it to talk with your doctor or loved ones about your decision. Don't have surgery. Use rest, ice, medicine, wrist splints, and new ways to do some tasks. Home treatments may be all you need if you've had mild symptoms for a short time. You may be able to treat carpal tunnel syndrome with rest, ice, medicine, and wrist splints. You also can learn to do some tasks in a way that doesn't hurt your wrist. Surgery may be a better choice if you've had very bad symptoms for a long time. Surgery for carpal tunnel syndrome may give you only a little relief if your symptoms are caused by other health problems, such as rheumatoid arthritis, hypothyroidism, or diabetes. Treating these problems often makes carpal tunnel symptoms get better or go away. But in some cases, you still might need surgery. Sometimes surgery is needed to prevent lasting nerve damage. You will likely have a nerve test to see if you need surgery. Symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome in pregnant women often go away after childbirth. Unless your symptoms are very bad, you may want to wait and see if your symptoms go away after you have the baby. is a nerve problem that causes tingling, numbness, weakness, or pain in the fingers, thumb, or palm, and sometimes the forearm. These symptoms are caused by pressure on a nerve () in the wrist (). This problem is often linked to hand and wrist motions that you do a lot. These are called repetitive motions. Swelling or fluid retention in the wrist—which can happen during pregnancy or because of a health problem—also can cause carpal tunnel symptoms or make them worse. What problems can you have from carpal tunnel syndrome? Severe carpal tunnel syndrome that lasts a long time can lead to permanent damage to the . This can make it hard for you to use your hand. Weak thumb muscles. This makes it hard for you to grip or hold objects. Loss of feeling and ability to use your fingers and hand well. Surgery reduces the pressure on the median nerve in the wrist. The doctor cuts a ligament to relieve the pressure on the nerve. The surgery is called . It can be done in one of two ways: : Your doctor makes a small cut (incision) in the palm of your hand. : Your doctor makes one small incision in the wrist, or one small incision in the wrist and one in the palm. He or she puts a thin tube with a camera attached (endoscope) into the incision. Surgical tools are put in along with the scope. You may decide to have surgery if you've had very bad symptoms for a long time and other treatments haven't helped. Sometimes surgery is needed to prevent lasting nerve damage. You will likely have a nerve test to see if you need surgery. Most people who have surgery for carpal tunnel syndrome have less or no pain and numbness in their hand and better hand function after surgery. It's not clear how long you should try nonsurgical treatment before considering surgery. But after people who have severe carpal tunnel syndrome have surgery, they typically have fewer symptoms and better hand function than people who continue using wrist splints or a combination of medicine and hand therapy. Both types of surgery—open and endoscopic—work equally well to improve symptoms. Talk to your doctor about which surgery might be best for you. Major problems from surgery can happen, but they are rare. About 1 person out of 100 has a major problem after surgery, such as nerve damage, while 99 out of 100 people don't. You can try several home treatments to help relieve your symptoms. This may be all you need to do for mild symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome. Doctors suggest that you try these treatments for 3 to 12 months before you think about having surgery. It often helps to try several treatments at the same time. Rest your hand for 1 or 2 weeks. Stop activities that hurt. Put ice on the palm of your hand and wrist for 10 to 15 minutes at a time. Take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as naproxen or ibuprofen. Studies haven't shown NSAIDs to be effective for carpal tunnel syndrome, but they may help relieve your symptoms. Talk to your doctor before taking NSAIDs. They can cause side effects. Be safe with medicines. Read and follow all instructions on the label. Wear a wrist splint. It's usually worn at night, but you can wear it during the day. You can work with a physical therapist to learn how to do activities in a new way. If these home care treatments don't help, you may be able to take corticosteroid shots or pills to improve your symptoms. Symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome in pregnant women often go away after childbirth. Unless your symptoms are very bad, you may want to put off having surgery and see if your symptoms go away after you have the baby. Rest, ice, and other home treatments may be all you need if you've had mild symptoms for a short time. Your doctor may also suggest that you try wrist splints or corticosteroids to avoid or delay surgery. Splints are easy and inexpensive, and there is little risk to trying them. Corticosteroid shots and pills give short-term relief from symptoms. Why might your doctor recommend surgery for carpal tunnel syndrome? You've had very bad symptoms for a long time, so you're at risk of having lasting nerve damage. A wrist splint, medicines, and other treatments haven't helped your symptoms. You have local anesthetic, so you are awake but won't have pain. You need to avoid heavy use of your hand for up to 3 months. If you have open surgery on your dominant hand and you do repeated actions at work, you may be able to return to work in 6 to 8 weeks. If the surgery is on the other hand and you do not do repeated actions at work, you may be able to return to work in 7 to 14 days. If you have endoscopic surgery, you may be able to return to work sooner than with open surgery. You can try several home treatments to ease symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome, including: If you are pregnant, you can wait to see if the problem goes away after childbirth. Surgery can make symptoms get better or go away for most people. Major problems from surgery, such as infection or a problem from anesthesia, are rare. If you have very bad symptoms and wait too long, you could have lasting nerve damage. Temporary increase in pain, or a small chance of nerve damage, after a corticosteroid shot. Personal stories about surgery for carpal tunnel syndrome These stories are based on information gathered from health professionals and consumers. They may be helpful as you make important health decisions. ""One of the most annoying things about my carpal tunnel syndrome is the night pain in my hands. If I don't wear the splints, it wakes me up almost every night. But with the splints, I can get a good night's sleep, and my doctor says that my thumb and hand strength are not too bad. I'm nervous about any kind of surgery, so when my doctor said it would be okay to wait awhile, I said, ""Great."" If the splints stop working, though, I'll probably be back in my doctor's office!"" ""I own a landscaping business, and a few months ago I started having a lot of pain when putting in backyard fences. Then the pain started to wake me up at night and keep me awake. My doctor said I had a classic case of carpal tunnel syndrome. I tried some of the home treatments that she recommended, and the problem didn't get any worse, but it didn't get any better, either. So I went back and asked about surgery. It sounds like the surgery has a good chance of taking care of the problem, so I'm going to give it a try. When you own your own company, it's too expensive to keep missing work. But I'll have to wait till the slow season, because I'll have to take a few weeks' break to recover."" ""I thought for sure that I was going to have to have surgery for my carpal tunnel. I'm an order-taker for a mail-order catalog company, which means I type a lot, and my symptoms were really getting bad. My fingers were numb, so I kept hitting the wrong keys on the keyboard and making errors. The pain was waking me up at night, and it was even starting to hurt during the day. I went to my boss and the human resources manager at work, and together we worked out a job-sharing arrangement that lets me take orders for part of the day and work in the mail room the rest of the day. I am going to see how that helps, along with the exercises and the splints."" ""When I dropped my third coffee cup in a week, I decided it was time to do something about my hands. I've had this carpal tunnel problem for a couple of years now, and I'm tired of wearing the splints and getting occasional steroid shots in my wrists. My doctor says that whether I have surgery or not is really up to me at this point. I think I'm ready for it."" Your personal feelings are just as important as the medical facts. Think about what matters most to you in this decision, and show how you feel about the following statements. I tried other treatments, but my pain is still bad. I can live with the pain while I give other treatments some more time to work. I don't mind having surgery if it can get rid of my symptoms. I'm not worried about the small chance of problems from surgery. I don't want to take even a small chance of something going wrong with surgery. I'm afraid of having lasting nerve damage from carpal tunnel syndrome. I'm not worried that I'll have lasting nerve damage from carpal tunnel syndrome. Now that you've thought about the facts and your feelings, you may have a general idea of where you stand on this decision. Show which way you are leaning right now. 1. Home treatments may be all I need to get rid of mild symptoms from carpal tunnel syndrome. That's right. Home treatments often work for mild symptoms from carpal tunnel syndrome. You can try rest, ice, and doing tasks in a new way. 2. Surgery may not be a good choice if my symptoms are caused by pregnancy or a health problem. That's right. Symptoms often go away after childbirth or after treatment for the health problem. 3. I have a good chance of improving or getting rid of my symptoms with surgery. That's right. Surgery is likely to improve or get rid of your symptoms. But it doesn't work all the time. 1. Do you understand the options available to you? 2. Are you clear about which benefits and side effects matter most to you? 3. Do you have enough support and advice from others to make a choice? 1. How sure do you feel right now about your decision? 2. Check what you need to do before you make this decision.

c67deab0-9a14-4cf7-8cd4-9a7e615c7a6e,"Stiff Joints: Why It Happens and How to Find Relief — — With age, stiff joints become a reality for many people. Years of use can take their toll on joints, muscles, and bones. Many people experience stiff joints just after waking up. Lying down for several hours to sleep reduces fluid amounts. That can make moving joints more difficult first thing in the morning. Joint stiffness may be mild and only impact your mobility for a brief period of time each morning or after sitting for extended periods of time. The stiffness can also be more severe and impact your mobility. In some cases, pain and inflammation accompany joint stiffness. This may make walking, standing, or putting weight on your joints painful. Not all stiff joints are the result of age. Many other conditions can cause stiff joints. These include arthritis, lupus, and bursitis. Lifestyle factors, including diet and weight, can also impact joint mobility. Keep reading to learn more about possible causes and treatments. The most common cause of joint pain is arthritis. (RA) is one of the most common forms of arthritis, affecting over Americans. Its symptoms typically appear between ages 30 and 60. RA is a chronic inflammatory disorder. It’s also an autoimmune disease. This means that your immune system attacks healthy parts of your body, such as the lining of your joints. This causes inflammation, pain, and stiffness. Over time, it can also cause joint deformity and bone erosion. RA has no cure, so its symptoms can’t be eliminated entirely. They can be managed through medication and other treatments. However, once the disease is advanced, little can be done to prevent disability. Another common form of arthritis is (OA). OA is sometimes called degenerative arthritis. It affects nearly Americans. It’s most common in people over age 65. This type of arthritis results from wear and tear on your joints. Cartilage, the thin tissue that protects the bones in your joints, wears away with use. Over time, the cartilage can no longer protect your bones. OA can affect any joint in the body, but it most often affects the: As OA progresses, it can begin to cause symptoms other than stiffness. These include: As the condition worsens, your bones may break more easily, and you could develop bone spurs. In advanced stages of OA, the cartilage disappears. Bones rub against other bones in your joint. This can cause extreme pain, stiffness, and disability. Treatment for OA can help replace some of the lost cartilage and fluid in your joints. Lifestyle treatments aimed at reducing weight and pressure on joints can be effective too. In severe cases, joint replacement surgery may be necessary. is an autoimmune disease like RA. Your body attacks itself, including your organs and tissues. Lupus that attacks your joints can cause stiffness, pain, and swelling. Lupus is difficult to diagnose because its symptoms mimic many other conditions. It may take several months for a lupus diagnosis while tests rule out other conditions. Like RA, lupus is chronic. Once you develop it, you will likely experience symptoms of the condition for the rest of your life. There isn’t a cure, but treatments are effective at reducing and controlling symptoms. Learn more: Healthy lifestyle choices for managing lupus symptoms » Bursae are tiny fluid-filled sacs that cushion the bones, ligaments, and muscles in your joints. You develop bursitis when those sacs become inflamed. This condition can cause stiffness and pain in the affected joint. can affect any joint, but it is most common in large joints like the: Bursitis is often temporary, and treatment relies on resting the affected joint for several weeks. This may mean you need to reduce physical activity and keep the joint stationary for periods of time. This allows the bursae to recover and stiffness to resolve. Learn more: Exercises to relieve hip bursitis pain » Unlike some other possible causes of joint stiffness, comes on suddenly. It may appear while you’re asleep, which may make the joints especially painful when you wake up. Severe, sudden episodes of pain and tenderness in joints characterize gout. Gout can impact any joint. The big toe is frequently the first joint to experience symptoms. Gout is a type of arthritis. It affects men than women, but a woman’s risk for developing gout increases after menopause. Most people will deal with periods of gout symptoms for the rest of their life, but symptoms are treatable. Learn more: Home remedies for managing gout flare-ups » This is rarely a cause for joint pain and stiffness, but it is a possibility. People with may experience joint pain or bone pain. You may also experience swelling or sensitivity near a bone. Not everyone will have pain, which is why bone cancer may advance and begin causing other symptoms before it’s discovered. Cancer is treatable, but the outcome depends on several factors. These factors include the size, location, and type of tumor. Treatment options for bone cancer include radiation, chemotherapy, and surgery. The best way to ease joint stiffness depends on what’s causing it in the first place. If stiffness lasts longer than 30 minutes after you wake up or if symptoms are getting worse, it’s important you seek medical attention. Diagnosing the underlying problem will help you and your doctor determine the best way to ease stiffness and stop other associated symptoms. Both temperature extremes may be beneficial for stiff joints. Apply a cold compress or bag of ice to your stiff joint for 15 to 20 minutes several times a day. This can help reduce inflammation or swelling and ease the joint into movement. It can also dull pain receptors so you experience less pain. Heat is also therapeutic to joints and muscles. Use a heating pad, hot water bottle, or warm water from a shower or bath to relax muscles and increase circulation. Many mild symptoms of joint pain can be relieved by OTC medicines. are the most commonly used medication for arthritis. Generic names for NSAIDs include aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen. If inflammation and swelling in the joint cause joint stiffness, steroids may be a treatment option. Swelling and inflammation are common with arthritis. Corticosteroids reduce inflammation. When inflammation decreases, joint pain and stiffness decrease too. Steroids may not be beneficial for people with advanced arthritis. In some cases, relief may be short-lived, and future steroid injections may not be as effective. Exercise and physical therapy may help increase joint mobility, which can reduce stiffness. It’s also a great way to lose weight or maintain a healthy weight. Carrying around excess pounds can increase your risk for certain conditions that cause joint pain and stiffness. If you’re unsure how to begin exercising or are having difficulty with movement, talk with your doctor or a trained physical therapist. Exercise is an easy way to relieve pain and stiffness, but you can aggravate certain conditions if you don’t take precautions before beginning an exercise plan. Complementary and alternative medicine treatments may also hold some promise for easing stiff joints. Here are three that may help: Researchers in one found that people who take fish oil reported fewer episodes of morning joint stiffness and pain. Fish oil contains the unsaturated fats eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Adding fish dishes to your weekly meal plan might help, too, because they contain omega-3 fatty acids. A typical dosage for fish oil supplements is 300 milligrams (mg) per day. You should read bottle labels to determine how many milligrams of omega-3s are in each supplement. Be sure to talk with your doctor before you begin taking fish oil supplements. These supplements can interfere with other medications. Flaxseed contains another type of omega-3 fatty acid, alpha-linolenic acid (ALA). Like EPA and DHA, ALA may help reduce inflammation and ease symptoms of joint stiffness. Ground flaxseed has some ALA, but flaxseed oil has more. Flaxseed oil is available in capsules or in a bottle. The average daily recommendation is 500 mg. That amount is often in a flaxseed oil capsule or an ounce of ground flaxseed. Flaxseeds are ground or crushed to release the healthy fats. Your body can’t break down and process whole flaxseeds, so you won’t receive any of the healthy fats. This chemical occurs naturally in the fluid around your joints. It plays a role in creating cartilage. If you have a glucosamine sulfate deficiency, your body may not be able to produce or protect cartilage. Some supports the use of this supplement for relieving joint pain and stiffness. This treatment may be most useful for people with knee osteoarthritis and swelling. The recommended dosage for arthritis pain ranges from per day. Before use, talk with your doctor about possible drug interactions. If joint stiffness and pain come on suddenly, talk with your doctor. Likewise, if the stiffness and pain don’t resolve after a period of five to seven days, you should seek medical attention. You should also seek attention from your doctor if you experience any of these symptoms: Though joint stiffness isn’t uncommon, especially as you age, it can be the first sign of another condition. A physical exam is an easy way to determine what might be causing the issue. If a physical exam isn’t conclusive, your doctor may suggest some treatments to help ease the stiffness while you wait to see if it disappears. If it doesn’t disappear, you may need tests to get a diagnosis. Once your doctor determines the cause, they can help determine the best treatment plan for you. This may help ease your symptoms and reduce the risk of recurrence. — — Bone Erosion with Rheumatoid Arthritis: Prevention and Management 6 Tips for Hosting Family Events If You Live with Rheumatoid Arthritis How Rheumatoid Arthritis Affects My Life Choices: What I Want People to Know Getting Married with Rheumatoid Arthritis: My Story Bone Erosion with Rheumatoid Arthritis: Prevention and Management Medically reviewed by Bone erosion is common in people living with rheumatoid arthritis.

What nonsurgical treatments are available for osteoarthritis? Further reading: Deep-dive articles on osteoarthritis Osteoarthritis (OA), also known as degenerative joint disease, is the most common form of It is a painful condition that occurs when cartilage inside a joint wears down over time. Most often, this wear results from a lifetime of use, and people get it when they reach advanced age. However, younger people may get the condition early as a result of an injury to the joint. Osteoarthritis is different from the less common but often more serious form of arthritis known as . This is a group of autoimmune diseases such as and . Inflammatory arthritis is caused by a problem with the immune system, and it usually causes inflammation in many joints throughout the body at the same time. Osteoarthritis, on the other hand, is usually isolated to a single joint. Video: Overview of osteoarthritis and when to see your doctor Cartilage is the spongy tissue that coats the ends of bones where they meet to form joints. In joints such as elbows, knees, shoulders, ankles and knuckles, cartilage acts as a shock absorber, cushioning the bones and preventing their ends from touching during body movement. This allows a person to twist, bend, turn and have a broad range of motion. The older we get, the more our cartilage deteriorates – especially in joints that we use most frequently. When cartilage degrades, the bones are not properly cushioned and the joint becomes damaged. This results in pain, stiffness and reduced range of motion. Osteoarthritis is most common in large weightbearing joints such as the hips or knees. With this type of arthritis, pain usually increases during activity and decreases with rest. Symptoms are often worse toward the end of the day. Pain is the most common symptom. Pain usually occurs when the joint is being moved, rather than when it is at rest. However, in the morning or after other long periods of inactivity, some people with OA may experience a feeling of stiffness. This symptom (known as ""gel phenomenon"" or ""gelling phenomenon"") usually lasts for less than 20 minutes in the affected joint. It is caused by a temporary thickening (or ""gelling"") of natural fluids inside the joint. Pain felt during movement of the joint is often accompanied by a crackling or grinding sound called ""crepitus."" Some people with OA may feel little or no pain for unknown reasons. The level of pain each person with OA experiences can depend on many factors including: the stage of the disease, the way a person's brain processes pain messages, cultural, gender and psychological differences. The joints most commonly affected by osteoarthritis are: Osteoarthritis is associated with the following symptoms. If you have these are symptoms, you have some form of inflammatory arthritis: swelling, redness or warmth in the joints where you feel pain symptoms on both sides of the body (both knees or hips, etc.) Age: The longer a person uses their joints, the more likely they are to get OA. Genetics: Some osteoarthritis may run in families. Hormones: The reduction of estrogen in women after menopause may accelerate OA. Hormone replacement therapy may help protect women from developing osteoarthritis. Trauma (acute injury) – especially injuries of the knee: For example, injuries to the (ACL) and/or increases the likelihood of osteoarthritis later in life. Repetitive stress injury: Workers who use certain joints repetitively may have a greater risk. Examples include jackhammer operators (wrists, hands and elbows), coal miners (knees), cotton pickers (fingers) and farmers (hips). Obesity or being overweight: This is especially true in hip and knee osteoarthritis, since the extra weight puts strain on these weightbearing joints over time. Nutrition and vitamin aborption problems: In people who are in the early stages of osteoarthritis and have a vitamin D deficiency, the disease may progress more quickly. Video – Supplements for Osteoarthritis: What Should I Know? There is no magic formula for avoiding joint degeneration. However, for osteoarthritis that affects the knees and hips (which are the two joints most commonly affected) maintaining an ideal weight or losing excess weight may help prevent osteoarthritis in these areas or decrease its rate of progression. There are three key elements to getting an accurate diagnosis for osteoarthritis: a complete evaluation and physical examination by a doctor radiological examinations ( and/or other imaging) Your physician will talk with you to learn your medical history and symptoms, and then to a physical exam to assess: presence of any swelling or tenderness of the joint gait (the way you walk) if the disease is in the hip or knee When the physical exam suggests a person may have osteoarthritis, dfferent forms of imaging may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and determine the severity of the joint degeneration. X-rays are very helpful in diagnosing advanced osteoarthritis because the affected joint will have specific characteristics: Bones that are closer to each other than they should be: As cartilage wears away, the joint space can narrow. Cysts: As the body responds to cartilage destruction and attempts to stabilize the joint, cysts or fluid-filled cavities can form in the bone. Increased bone density or uneven joints: When bones are no longer cushioned by cartilage, they can rub against one another, creating friction. The body responds by laying down more bone in response, increasing bone density. Increased bone creates uneven joint surfaces and osteophytes (bone spurs) around the joint margins. X-ray view of the hip joint showing osteoarthritis and joint space narrowing between the femur (thighbone) and pelvis. X-ray view of the hip joint showing severe joint space narrowing and large osteophytes Confirming early onset osteoarthritis is more complicated, because the signs are far more subtle. Hospital for Special Surgery has developed special X-ray views that increase the sensitivity of conventional X-rays, allowing detection of early changes in the joint before they are evident on routine X-rays. In some cases, X-rays alone are not sufficient to show the smaller differences associated with early onset arthritis. When this is the case, other specialized diagnostic imaging technologies are used. These include: (computed tomography, sometimes called a ""CAT scan""): A CT exam is excellent for showing the formation of osteophytes (bone spurs) and how they affect the surrounding soft tissues of the joint. : This sensitive imaging technology is useful for identifying synovial cysts that can form in association with osteoarthritis. Ultrasound can also be used to image cartilage in patients who cannot have an MRI exam because of certain medical conditions. , such as radionuclide bone scans: Bone scans are very sensitive and may show abnormalities in the bones and joints not yet visible on X-rays. They can also be used to image the entire skeleton in one examination to demonstrate whether a patient has osteoarthritis in multiple parts of the body. (magnetic resonance imaging): An MRI is very good at revealing subtle changes in both bony and soft tissues of the musculoskeletal system. MRI can demonstrate reactive bone edema or soft tissue swelling as well as small cartilage or bone fragments in the joint. At HSS, specific computer programs are used to identify early evidence of cartilage degeneration. When there is objective evidence of cartilage wear, appropriate treatment can be initiated to prevent or delay progression. MRI of the knee showing normal cartilage on one side and cartilage loss and on osteophyte on the other MRI of the hip demonstrating osteoarthritis with large osteophytes around the femoral head. In some cases, when osteoarthritis is suspected, but X-rays appear normal, a special MRI process called quantitative T2 mapping can detect the subtle cartilage differences to confirm the diagnosis. Laboratory tests are helpful for diagnosing osteoarthritis, because they are used to rule out forms of inflammatory arthritis. In other words, if you have joint pain and your lab results are normal, it would confirm a diagnosis of OA. These tests include: rheumatoid factor (to detect rheumatoid arthritis) When these tests return normal or negative results, this usually indicates that your arthritis is osteoarthritis. It should be noted, however, that as people age, they sometimes develop a low-level positive rheumatoid factor, ANA titer and/or elevated sedimentation rate without experiencing any obvious illness. This is why doctors do not rely on laboratory tests alone, but rather to confirm a suspected diagnosis for osteoarthritis. Another lab test that may help confirm the diagnosis is the extraction and analysis of synovial fluid from the joint. Synovial fluid is a liquid normally found within the joints. It helps nourish and lubricate them and is usually present in only very small amounts. However, when certain forms of arthritis are present, synovial fluid will change. In osteoarthritis, white blood cell count (“pus cells”) is usually normal and the fluid is clear (like water). Higher white cell counts should suggest inflammatory arthritis or infection, rather than osteoarthritis. In this way, extracting synovial fluid can help to confirm the diagnosis. It can also reduce pain and swelling if the fluid is contributing to inflammation. The fluid may also be examined for the presence of uric acid crystals (seen in gout) or calcium pyrophosphate crystals (seen in pseudogout or chondrocalcinosis). The measurement of other biological markers is still experimental. Your doctor will develop an individualized treatment program especially for you based on several factors, including: Any other conditions you have and medications you take What nonsurgical treatments are available for osteoarthritis? If the osteoarthritis is not severe, it is usually first treated conservatively (nonsurgically) with physical and occupational therapy. It is wise to maintain good and a healthy weight. This will put less pressure on your joints. (Learn about the program at HSS.) In the case of osteoarthritis of the knee, it is especially important to and strengthen your thigh muscles, which can reduce pain and improve function. Weight management, diet and nutrition for managing osteoarthritis For people with osteoarthritis, it is important to maintaining an active lifestyle and avoid becoming sedentary. Movement can help lessen pain and prevent it from getting worse. But the correct and safe types of activity vary from patient to patient. As with any treatment, getting a proper “movement prescription” requires having a pinpoint diagnosis and an understanding of each patient's unique condition. If these conservative measures do not work, may be recommended. These may be: When the conservative measures above are not enough and pain in a specific joint makes it difficult for you to move, then can restore your comfort and help you to return to normal activity. surgery and surgery have become trusted treatments for restoring mobility and easing pain. You are generally a good candidate for surgery if conservative treatment hasn't worked and you experience a significant interruption in some activity of daily life – for example, if you can't walk more than a city block or if you awaken from sleep with pain in the affected joint. In such cases, surgery should provide outstanding results, because you will become pain-free in the affected joint. The exact type of surgery you have will depend on your age, activity level, and the specific joint that is affected. The scientists and doctors at Hospital for Special Surgery keep you informed on HSS.edu about their specific and  on all musculoskeletal conditions, treatments, and issues.

Hospital for Special Surgery’s pace-setting musculoskeletal research is organized into five main programs. And every program contributes essential knowledge to OA research: HSS investigations of the intricate cellular and molecular mechanisms of tissue destruction in all musculoskeletal conditions help reveal the cellular processes of cartilage loss in osteoarthritis. When a new important step of cellular interaction is discovered, it becomes a potential target for therapies that could prevent, slow, or even stop cartilage degeneration in OA. In-depth knowledge from HSS studies of how cells communicate and interact in inflammatory reactions in autoimmune diseases can be integrated with cellular studies of how inflammation is triggered – and then continues to impact – the joints in OA. The mechanics of the body’s movement, function, and ability to carry weight are affected by every stage of osteoarthritis. Biomechanical research uses principles of engineering, materials science, physical and computer modeling, and advanced statistical analysis to study how OA impacts the body’s function and gait. The department also continually researches innovations in the design and materials of joint replacements, surgical instrumentation, and orthopedic devices. Using advanced technology not often available at one research center, HSS scientists unlock the understanding of the cellular nature of living bone: how it thrives, how it degenerates, how it interacts with soft tissue like cartilage and tendons, as well as orthopedic devices like implants. Tissue Engineering, Regeneration, and Repair Program: Cartilage does not heal itself. Yet, when injured, other soft tissues – like tendons and ligaments – can. Our ongoing studies of the cellular mechanisms of soft tissue degradation and regeneration can help uncover ways to slow and prevent cartilage loss. Understanding the cellular nature of soft tissues also informs the science of tissue engineering. Interdisciplinary studies at HSS are developing new biologic and synthetic tissues that can help damaged joints regain function and mobility.

What nonsurgical treatments are available for osteoarthritis? Further reading: Deep-dive articles on osteoarthritis Osteoarthritis (OA), also known as degenerative joint disease, is the most common form of It is a painful condition that occurs when cartilage inside a joint wears down over time. Most often, this wear results from a lifetime of use, and people get it when they reach advanced age. However, younger people may get the condition early as a result of an injury to the joint. Osteoarthritis is different from the less common but often more serious form of arthritis known as . This is a group of autoimmune diseases such as and . Inflammatory arthritis is caused by a problem with the immune system, and it usually causes inflammation in many joints throughout the body at the same time. Osteoarthritis, on the other hand, is usually isolated to a single joint. Video: Overview of osteoarthritis and when to see your doctor Cartilage is the spongy tissue that coats the ends of bones where they meet to form joints. In joints such as elbows, knees, shoulders, ankles and knuckles, cartilage acts as a shock absorber, cushioning the bones and preventing their ends from touching during body movement. This allows a person to twist, bend, turn and have a broad range of motion. The older we get, the more our cartilage deteriorates – especially in joints that we use most frequently. When cartilage degrades, the bones are not properly cushioned and the joint becomes damaged. This results in pain, stiffness and reduced range of motion. Osteoarthritis is most common in large weightbearing joints such as the hips or knees. With this type of arthritis, pain usually increases during activity and decreases with rest. Symptoms are often worse toward the end of the day. Pain is the most common symptom. Pain usually occurs when the joint is being moved, rather than when it is at rest. However, in the morning or after other long periods of inactivity, some people with OA may experience a feeling of stiffness. This symptom (known as ""gel phenomenon"" or ""gelling phenomenon"") usually lasts for less than 20 minutes in the affected joint. It is caused by a temporary thickening (or ""gelling"") of natural fluids inside the joint. Pain felt during movement of the joint is often accompanied by a crackling or grinding sound called ""crepitus."" Some people with OA may feel little or no pain for unknown reasons. The level of pain each person with OA experiences can depend on many factors including: the stage of the disease, the way a person's brain processes pain messages, cultural, gender and psychological differences. The joints most commonly affected by osteoarthritis are: Osteoarthritis is associated with the following symptoms. If you have these are symptoms, you have some form of inflammatory arthritis: swelling, redness or warmth in the joints where you feel pain symptoms on both sides of the body (both knees or hips, etc.) Age: The longer a person uses their joints, the more likely they are to get OA. Genetics: Some osteoarthritis may run in families. Hormones: The reduction of estrogen in women after menopause may accelerate OA. Hormone replacement therapy may help protect women from developing osteoarthritis. Trauma (acute injury) – especially injuries of the knee: For example, injuries to the (ACL) and/or increases the likelihood of osteoarthritis later in life. Repetitive stress injury: Workers who use certain joints repetitively may have a greater risk. Examples include jackhammer operators (wrists, hands and elbows), coal miners (knees), cotton pickers (fingers) and farmers (hips). Obesity or being overweight: This is especially true in hip and knee osteoarthritis, since the extra weight puts strain on these weightbearing joints over time. Nutrition and vitamin aborption problems: In people who are in the early stages of osteoarthritis and have a vitamin D deficiency, the disease may progress more quickly. Video – Supplements for Osteoarthritis: What Should I Know? There is no magic formula for avoiding joint degeneration. However, for osteoarthritis that affects the knees and hips (which are the two joints most commonly affected) maintaining an ideal weight or losing excess weight may help prevent osteoarthritis in these areas or decrease its rate of progression. There are three key elements to getting an accurate diagnosis for osteoarthritis: a complete evaluation and physical examination by a doctor radiological examinations ( and/or other imaging) Your physician will talk with you to learn your medical history and symptoms, and then to a physical exam to assess: presence of any swelling or tenderness of the joint gait (the way you walk) if the disease is in the hip or knee When the physical exam suggests a person may have osteoarthritis, dfferent forms of imaging may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and determine the severity of the joint degeneration. X-rays are very helpful in diagnosing advanced osteoarthritis because the affected joint will have specific characteristics: Bones that are closer to each other than they should be: As cartilage wears away, the joint space can narrow. Cysts: As the body responds to cartilage destruction and attempts to stabilize the joint, cysts or fluid-filled cavities can form in the bone. Increased bone density or uneven joints: When bones are no longer cushioned by cartilage, they can rub against one another, creating friction. The body responds by laying down more bone in response, increasing bone density. Increased bone creates uneven joint surfaces and osteophytes (bone spurs) around the joint margins. X-ray view of the hip joint showing osteoarthritis and joint space narrowing between the femur (thighbone) and pelvis. X-ray view of the hip joint showing severe joint space narrowing and large osteophytes Confirming early onset osteoarthritis is more complicated, because the signs are far more subtle. Hospital for Special Surgery has developed special X-ray views that increase the sensitivity of conventional X-rays, allowing detection of early changes in the joint before they are evident on routine X-rays. In some cases, X-rays alone are not sufficient to show the smaller differences associated with early onset arthritis. When this is the case, other specialized diagnostic imaging technologies are used. These include: (computed tomography, sometimes called a ""CAT scan""): A CT exam is excellent for showing the formation of osteophytes (bone spurs) and how they affect the surrounding soft tissues of the joint. : This sensitive imaging technology is useful for identifying synovial cysts that can form in association with osteoarthritis. Ultrasound can also be used to image cartilage in patients who cannot have an MRI exam because of certain medical conditions. , such as radionuclide bone scans: Bone scans are very sensitive and may show abnormalities in the bones and joints not yet visible on X-rays. They can also be used to image the entire skeleton in one examination to demonstrate whether a patient has osteoarthritis in multiple parts of the body. (magnetic resonance imaging): An MRI is very good at revealing subtle changes in both bony and soft tissues of the musculoskeletal system.

e821b755-6c10-4235-8ecb-6f9b9c2b217c,"— — is a condition that results in joint damage. It’s caused by wear and tear of cartilage, the tissue protecting the ends of your bones and joints. This exposes the nerve endings in bones and results in OA pain. OA is the most common . It’s degenerative, getting worse with age, but can also occur following injury. Without treatment, chronic pain from OA can lead to complications and can significantly affect your quality of life. Some things put you at a higher risk of getting osteoarthritis, including: Cartilage deteriorates naturally with age. Women are more likely to develop OA, though it isn’t understood why. Extra weight may put more stress on joints. Weak joints are more susceptible to OA. Some people inherit the tendency to develop OA. Being born with malformed bones or cartilage can increase your risk of OA. Physically demanding jobs or jobs that require repetitive stress on joints can increase your chances of developing OA. For many people, OA is a source of chronic pain that can be exhausting and debilitating. It can also lead to problems with anxiety and depression. According to the : Adults with arthritis are about 2.5 times more likely to experience a fall or injury. In 2015, 15 million U.S. adults said they had severe joint pain from arthritis. About 1 in 25 U.S. adults (ages 18 to 64) name arthritis as a cause of work limitations. In addition to causing pain, there are a number of ways in which OA can impact your life. Achy, tender joints interfere with restful, restorative sleep. Not getting a full night’s sleep can make your pain seem intensified. Stiffness and can also keep you from getting comfortable in bed. Many people miss multiple days of work per year because of chronic joint pain. Arthritis can also result in a decreased ability to perform normal everyday activities such as: In general, function can be improved with treatment. However, some people with OA may need assistance with simple day-to-day activities. Pain and stiffness can decrease your desire to be active. You may stop wanting to participate in activities that used to bring you joy. Arthritis may cause a decreased ability to exercise or even walk. The lack of activity doesn’t only limit your enjoyment of life — it can cause weight gain. Extra weight may exacerbate OA symptoms, as well as lead to an increased risk of other complications, including: A investigated the link between anxiety and depression and OA, finding that the pain of OA symptoms negatively affected mental health. More than 40 percent of the study’s participants showed increased anxiety and depression as a result of OA symptoms. Other complications that can arise from OA include: deterioration of tendons and ligaments around joints There’s no cure for OA, so treatment aims to manage symptoms and improve joint function, flexibility, and balance. This helps prevent falls which can lead to fractures. It’s important to control pain while increasing mobility and joint functioning. Physical therapy can help increase mobility. Exercise is key to staying limber and maintaining your weight. But be careful not to overuse your joints and make symptoms worse. Take frequent breaks when exercising. There are many medications available to relieve OA pain, including acetaminophen (Tylenol) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen. Corticosteroid injections can be given directly into joints to help reduce swelling and relieve pain, and injections of viscosupplements may provide extra cushioning in joints. Depending on the severity of your OA, your doctor may suggest surgery to replace entire joints. Alternative practices can help increase mobility, reduce stress, and improve your general outlook on life. These include: water therapy such as or exercising in a hot tub Osteoarthritis is a degenerative condition. If left untreated, it’ll get worse with time. Although death from OA is rare, it’s a significant cause of disability among adults. It’s important to talk to your doctor if OA is impacting your quality of life. Surgery to replace joints may be an option, as well as pain medication and lifestyle changes.

Carpal tunnel syndrome is a nerve-related condition that causes pain and numbness in the wrists and hands. It affects three times as many women as men, according to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS). It's primarily seen in adults, especially those who perform assembly-line-type work. Such workers are three times more likely to get carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) than those who perform desk work, according to the NINDS.  Recently, research have found that using devices such as phones, gaming consoles, computers and tablets, can cause CTS in students, as well. Young adults who spent an average of nine hours a day using electronic devices reported more pain in their wrists and hands than their peers who spent less time each day using such devices, according to findings published online in the journal Muscle & Nerve. This puts them at more risk of developing CTS. [Related: ] The carpal tunnel is a passageway in the wrist that protects the median nerve, the main nerve to the hand; the flexor tendons that bend the fingers and thumb; and other soft tissues, such as ligaments and blood vessels. According to the (AAOS), carpal tunnel syndrome occurs when the tissues surrounding the flexor tendons swell and put pressure on the median nerve. This pressure can then pinch the nerve, causing the pain associated with CTS. Carpal tunnel syndrome can have many causes. The most likely cause, according to the AAOS, is heredity. Some people simply have smaller carpal tunnels, and this trait runs in families. Other contributing factors, according to NINDS, include:    Trauma or injury to the wrist that causes swelling, such as sprain or fracture NINDS says there is little clinical data to prove that repetitive and forceful movements of the hand and wrist during work or leisure activities can cause carpal tunnel syndrome. Repeated motions performed at work or in sports have been associated with other disorders, such as and tendonitis. Repetitive activity may also bring on writer's cramp, or spasms in the muscles of the hand that make holding a pen or pencil difficult.  Symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome generally start with nighttime numbness or tingling, along with hand pain, according to Dr. Shari Liberman, a hand and upper extremity orthopedic surgeon at Houston Methodist Hospital. ""Usually, the patient will wake up at night with those symptoms and has to shake out their hands to relieve the pain. The symptoms can progress to daytime numbness or tingling and pain."" Those affected with these symptoms should see a physician, Liberman told Live Science.  These sensations may appear when the individual holds an object, such as a book. As the condition worsens, pain may extend beyond the wrist all the way up to the shoulder, or into the hand. ""When the carpal tunnel compression is severe, the patient will begin to experience weakness in the affected hand,"" Liberman said. Sometimes pain may be misinterpreted as CTS. , arthritis and other problems may be the actual cause of the pain, which makes it important to get a diagnosis from a professional. Carpal tunnel syndrome is fairly common and affects 4 to 10 million Americans, according to the . To diagnose carpal tunnel syndrome, a physician will first perform a physical exam. After checking the feeling and strength in the hand, the doctor may also want to perform additional tests to rule out any other conditions. These exams can include an EMG or nerve conduction velocity test, according to .  An is also called a myogram or an electromyography. This test measures the electrical output of muscles. The doctor places a tiny needle into particular muscles, and this needle detects the electrical activity of the muscles. A tests the speed of electrical impulses in the nerves. Two electrodes are placed on the surface of the skin, and a shock is sent to the nerve. The speed is determined by how long it takes the impulses to travel between electrodes. This test is also called an electroneurography or EneG. For mild cases of carpal tunnel syndrome, surgery is usually not necessary. CTS will get worse without some form of treatment, according to the AAOS, but it can be stopped if caught in the early stages.  Over-the-counter medications, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or NSAIDs (, and , for example), can alleviate pain related to inflammation. Physicians may also inject a corticosteroid such as into the carpal tunnel for pain relief. If an underlying condition causes the carpal tunnel syndrome, treatment of that condition can often reduce carpal tunnel symptoms. Severe cases may require surgery, but patients can try other treatments first. ""There are minimally invasive treatments, such as needle-thread ultrasound-guided release, that have a down time of only one evening,"" Dr. Nathan Wei, director of the Arthritis Treatment Center in Frederick, Maryland, told Live Science. Surgery has a high success rate, over 90 percent, according to the . Surgery options include endoscopic and open surgery, according to the . Endoscopic surgery involves making two small incisions on the ligament that is pressing on the nerve. Open surgery involves opening up the area with a large incision to cut the ligament. By itself, exercising the affected area is not likely to relieve the pain and should not replace other treatments, said Dr. Peter C. Amadio, of the Mayo Clinic. Liberman agreed, adding that exercises can even exacerbate the symptoms. ""Specifically, biking and weightlifting put pressure on the carpal tunnel and can make the symptoms worse,"" she said. ""I recommend a nighttime splint to keep the wrist in a neutral position to allow the pressure on the carpal tunnel to decrease."" Other forms of treatment, such as yoga, and ultrasound therapy, can be integrated into a regular health plan to help patients deal with the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome, according to the Mayo Clinic. There are several ways to reduce the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome. Here are some tips from the : Take breaks from activities that strain the wrist, and bend the wrist every so often. Adjust the work area to prevent strain on joints. Individuals who type as part of their profession should keep the keyboard at elbow height or lower so the wrist is relaxed during work.  Watch your posture at work. Keep the shoulders back to avoid straining neck and shoulder muscles, which can eventually cause problems in the wrists and hands. Exercise the joints, which can build muscle that will protect the carpal tunnel areas from damage. Use the appropriate force when performing tasks such as writing or typing. In other words, don't grip the pen tightly or bang the keys on the keyboard. This puts unnecessary stress on the wrist and hand. Use ergonomic tools that can put less pressure on your joints.

Mayo Clinic Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences Mayo Clinic School of Continuous Professional Development During the physical exam, your doctor will check your joints for swelling, redness and warmth. He or she will also want to see how well you can move your joints. Depending on the type of arthritis suspected, your doctor may suggest some of the following tests. The analysis of different types of body fluids can help pinpoint the type of arthritis you may have. Fluids commonly analyzed include blood, urine and joint fluid. To obtain a sample of your joint fluid, your doctor will cleanse and numb the area before inserting a needle in your joint space to withdraw some fluid. These types of tests can detect problems within your joint that may be causing your symptoms. Examples include: Using low levels of radiation to visualize bone, X-rays can show cartilage loss, bone damage and bone spurs. X-rays may not reveal early arthritic damage, but they are often used to track progression of the disease. CT scanners take X-rays from many different angles and combine the information to create cross-sectional views of internal structures. CTs can visualize both bone and the surrounding soft tissues. Combining radio waves with a strong magnetic field, MRI can produce more-detailed cross-sectional images of soft tissues such as cartilage, tendons and ligaments. This technology uses high-frequency sound waves to image soft tissues, cartilage and fluid-containing structures near the joints (bursae). Ultrasound is also used to guide needle placement for joint aspirations and injections. Arthritis treatment focuses on relieving symptoms and improving joint function. You may need to try several different treatments, or combinations of treatments, before you determine what works best for you. The medications used to treat arthritis vary depending on the type of arthritis. Commonly used arthritis medications include: These medications help reduce pain, but have no effect on inflammation. An over-the-counter option includes acetaminophen (Tylenol, others). For more-severe pain, opioids might be prescribed, such as tramadol (Ultram, ConZip), oxycodone (OxyContin, Roxicodone, others) or hydrocodone (Hysingla, Zohydro ER). Opioids act on the central nervous system to relieve pain. When opioids are used for a long time, they may become habit-forming, causing mental or physical dependence. NSAIDs reduce both pain and inflammation. Over-the-counter NSAIDs include ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and naproxen (Aleve). Some types of NSAIDs are available only by prescription. Oral NSAIDs can cause stomach irritation and may increase your risk of heart attack or stroke. Some NSAIDs are also available as creams or gels, which can be rubbed on joints. Some varieties of creams and ointments contain menthol or capsaicin, the ingredient that makes hot peppers spicy. Rubbing these preparations on the skin over your aching joint may interfere with the transmission of pain signals from the joint itself. Often used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, DMARDs slow or stop your immune system from attacking your joints. Examples include methotrexate (Trexall, Rasuvo, others) and hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil). Typically used in conjunction with DMARDs, biologic response modifiers are genetically engineered drugs that target various protein molecules that are involved in the immune response. There are many types of biologic response modifiers. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors are commonly prescribed. Examples include etanercept (Enbrel, Erelzi, Eticovo) and infliximab (Remicade, Inflectra, others). Other medications target other substances that play a role in inflammation, such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), Janus kinase enzymes, and certain types of white blood cells known as B cells and T cells. This class of drugs, which includes prednisone (Prednisone Intensol, Rayos) and cortisone (Cortef), reduces inflammation and suppresses the immune system. Corticosteroids can be taken orally or can be injected directly into the painful joint. Physical therapy can be helpful for some types of arthritis. Exercises can improve range of motion and strengthen the muscles surrounding joints. In some cases, splints or braces may be warranted. If conservative measures don't help, your doctor may suggest surgery, such as: In some instances, joint surfaces can be smoothed or realigned to reduce pain and improve function. These types of procedures can often be performed arthroscopically — through small incisions over the joint. This procedure removes your damaged joint and replaces it with an artificial one. Joints most commonly replaced are hips and knees. This procedure is more often used for smaller joints, such as those in the wrist, ankle and fingers. It removes the ends of the two bones in the joint and then locks those ends together until they heal into one rigid unit. Botox injections: Can they relieve arthritis pain? testing new treatments, interventions and tests as a means to prevent, detect, treat or manage this disease. In many cases, arthritis symptoms can be reduced with the following measures: If you're obese, losing weight will reduce the stress on your weight-bearing joints. This may increase your mobility and limit future joint injury. Regular exercise can help keep your joints flexible. Swimming and water aerobics may be good choices because the buoyancy of the water reduces stress on weight-bearing joints. Heating pads or ice packs may help relieve arthritis pain. Using canes, shoe inserts, walkers, raised toilet seats and other assistive devices can help protect your joints and improve your ability to perform daily tasks. Many people use alternative remedies for arthritis, but there is little reliable evidence to support the use of many of these products. The most promising alternative remedies for arthritis include: This therapy uses fine needles inserted at specific points on the skin to reduce many types of pain, including that caused by some types of arthritis. Although study results have been mixed, some studies have found that glucosamine works no better than placebo. However, glucosamine and the placebo both relieved arthritis pain better than taking nothing, particularly in people who have moderate to severe pain from knee osteoarthritis. Chondroitin may provide modest pain relief from osteoarthritis, although study results are mixed. The slow, stretching movements associated with yoga and tai chi may help improve joint flexibility and range of motion in people with some types of arthritis. Light stroking and kneading of muscles may increase blood flow and warm affected joints, temporarily relieving pain. Make sure your massage therapist knows which joints are affected by arthritis. While you might first discuss your symptoms with your family doctor, he or she may refer you to a doctor who specializes in the treatment of joint problems (rheumatologist) for further evaluation.

It’s unlikely the pinched nerve is actually in your finger, however. The term pinched nerve indicates that one of your nerves is under pressure, injured, or damaged. There are several different nerves that may cause discomfort in your finger. Treatments to ease pain for a pinched nerve in your finger are similar, and typically require noninvasive methods. You may think of your back or neck when hearing the term pinched nerve, but it’s common for your fingers to be affected by a pinched nerve in your: This condition develops when a nerve is pressed on, constricted, or stretched. You may experience a pinched nerve because of injury, other medical conditions like arthritis, or repetitive motions. There are several types of nerve injury that may cause uncomfortable symptoms in your fingers. This type of pinched nerve happens when pressure occurs on the nerve traveling through your carpal tunnel. You can experience symptoms of in your: Most people who experience this type of pinched nerve work with their hands a lot, such as using a computer, playing a musical instrument, or doing carpentry. You may be more likely to have carpal tunnel syndrome if others in your family have it. This occurs when your ulnar nerve experiences pressure or is stretched. It affects your ring and pinkie fingers. You may experience if you apply direct pressure to the ulnar nerve, which runs from your shoulder to your hand, or if you keep it bent too long, such as when sleeping. You may experience pain if you straighten your fingers because of tunnel nerve syndrome. This may occur especially on the back of your thumb and on your index finger. Your radial nerve may experience pressure near the elbow, causing symptoms in the finger. Finger pain can originate from cervical radiculopathy, which is a pinched nerve in the neck,. You may experience this condition because of arthritis, aging, or an injury. The pain in your fingers could be caused by other conditions that put pressure on your nerves, like: You may also experience pressure in multiple places along the nerve, known as . Symptoms of a pinched nerve in your finger can vary, but you may experience: Sometimes you may experience more symptoms at night if your body holds a certain position for too long while you are sleeping. If you have radial tunnel syndrome, you’ll experience weakness and dull, aching pain, and possibly a “pins and needles” feeling. With so many different nerve conditions that can cause symptoms in your finger, you will need to consider your symptoms closely to identify the cause. Certain conditions cause symptoms in specific fingers. For example, thumb pain may be more likely caused by carpel tunnel syndrome. Pain in your pinkie finger may be caused by cubital tunnel syndrome. Pain occurring in your finger as well as your wrists, elbows, and shoulder may be radial tunnel syndrome or cervical radiculopathy. Seeing your doctor may help diagnose the discomfort in your finger. Your doctor will conduct a physical examination and discuss your symptoms and family history before proceeding with other testing. Your doctor may ask you to perform certain exercises or stretches to identify the source of the symptoms. For carpal tunnel syndrome, your healthcare provider may ask you to bend your wrist for a short time. Your doctor may ask you to move your fingers when applying resistance. Your ability to do these exercises and your description of how you feel when doing them may help with the diagnosis. The doctor may also conduct tests to diagnose the cause of the symptoms. These may include: There are many ways to treat a pinched nerve causing discomfort in your finger. Your doctor may recommend some conservative, first-line approaches to start treating the pinched nerve. If your symptoms don’t improve, you may want to consider higher levels of treatment like certain medications or even surgery. It is important to treat the pinched nerve early to avoid symptoms from worsening over time. Your doctor may tell you to modify your behaviors and rest the area of the pinched nerve. You may want to try a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) like ibuprofen (Advil), aspirin, or naproxen (Aleve) to relieve pain and discomfort in your fingers. Your doctor may recommend that you meet with a physical therapist who will give you certain exercises and stretches to do near the source of your pinched nerve. These may help stretch the nerve or may help you modify your movements. Wearing protective splints or braces that restrict your movement may help calm the area surrounding of your pinched nerve and alleviate symptoms. Your doctor may recommend to treat symptoms caused by a pinched nerve. You may be prescribed an oral medication, or your doctor may inject the corticosteroid near the pinched nerve. This type of medication targets inflammation and pain. In the case of cervical radiculopathy, your doctor may prescribe a short-term use of narcotics to relieve pain if the pain can’t be controlled using other methods. If all other treatments fail to relive symptoms, your doctor may suggest surgery on the area surrounding the pinched nerve. Surgery can involve moving the nerve or the surrounding tissue to relieve pressure from compressing the nerve. For carpal tunnel syndrome, your doctor may focus on releasing pressure from the ligament that puts pressure on your nerve. You can try to using the following methods: Massage the area that feels discomfort using light strokes with the fingers of your other hand. Apply ice or heat to your fingers or other areas affected by the pinched nerve. Keep your arm and fingers elevated a bit when lying down with a pillow. Try stretches and exercises that target the affected area. Avoid doing anything repetitive with your fingers for too long without a break. Train your other hand to complete tasks that you would normally do with the hand experiencing discomfort. Make sure equipment you use with your hands is sized appropriately to your body, and that your workspace allows you to complete tasks with your fingers, hands, and wrists in a comfortable and natural position. You may want to try a few stretches at home to relieve symptoms if your finger discomfort is caused by a pinched nerve. Be careful not to overwork your nerves by limiting the number of times you conduct the stretch each day. One way to address is to stretch your nerves with nerve gliding. Bend your elbow, bringing bent wrist up toward head. For carpal tunnel syndrome, you can do a slightly different stretch. Stretch your wrist by lengthening your arm, pointing your hand and fingers up toward the sky. Pull gently on your fingers with your other hand for 15 seconds. You should see a doctor if your pinched nerve is causing symptoms in your fingers or other areas of your body for a prolonged length of time, and if you don’t have any success finding relief on your own. Also see a doctor if the symptoms impact your day-to-day life. You may experience discomfort in your fingers because of a pinched nerve near your: Talk to your doctor about treatment methods, and try to begin treating the symptoms as soon as they occur to avoid worsening your condition.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common chronic (long-lasting) joint condition. A joint is where two bones come together. The ends of these bones are covered with protective tissue called cartilage. With OA, this cartilage breaks down, causing the bones within the joint to rub together. This can cause , , and other symptoms. OA occurs most often in older people, although it can occur in adults of any age. OA is also called degenerative joint disease, degenerative arthritis, and wear-and-tear arthritis. A leading cause of disability, OA affects more than in the United States. Here’s everything you need to know about OA, from treatment to prevention and more. OA is caused by joint damage. This damage can accumulate over time, which is why age is one of the main causes of the joint damage leading to osteoarthritis. The older you are, the more wear and tear you’ve had on your joints. Other causes of joint damage include past injury, such as: They also include joint malformation, obesity, and poor posture. Certain , such as family history and gender, increase your risk of osteoarthritis. Cartilage is a tough, rubbery substance that’s flexible and softer than bone. Its job is to protect the ends of bones within a joint and allow them to move easily against each other. When cartilage breaks down, these bone surfaces become pitted and rough. This can cause pain within the joint, and irritation in surrounding tissues. Damaged cartilage can’t repair itself. This is because cartilage doesn’t contain any blood vessels. When cartilage wears away completely, the cushioning buffer that it provides disappears, allowing for bone-on-bone contact. This can cause intense pain and other symptoms associated with OA. Here’s what else you need to know about cartilage, joints, and osteoarthritis. OA can occur in any joint. However, the most commonly affected areas of the body include the: The most common include: tenderness (discomfort when pressing on the area with your fingers) As OA becomes more advanced, the pain associated with it may become more intense. Over time, swelling in the joint and surrounding area may also occur. Recognizing the early symptoms of OA can help you to better manage the condition. OA is a progressive condition with five stages, from 0 to 4. The first stage (0) represents a normal joint. Stage 4 represents severe OA. Not everyone who has OA will progress all the way to stage 4. The condition often stabilizes long before reaching this stage. People with severe OA have extensive or complete loss of cartilage in one or more joints. The bone-on-bone friction associated with this can cause severe symptoms such as: The amount of synovial fluid within the joint may increase. Normally, this fluid helps reduce friction during movement. However, in larger amounts, it can cause . Fragments of broken-off cartilage may also float within the synovial fluid, increasing pain and swelling. You may feel pain during activities, but also when you’re at rest. You may feel an increase in your pain level as the day progresses, or more swelling in your joints if you’ve used them a lot throughout the day. You may not be able to move as well, due to stiffness or pain in your joints. This can make it harder to enjoy the day-to-day activities that used to come easily. Your joints may become less stable. For instance, if you have severe OA in your knees, you may experience locking (sudden lack of movement). You may also experience (when your knee gives out), which can cause falls and injury. As a joint continues to wear down, muscle weakness, , and joint deformity may also occur. The joint damage caused by severe OA isn’t reversible, but treatment can help reduce symptoms. Learn everything you need to know about advanced osteoarthritis. OA and share the same symptoms but are very different conditions. OA is a degenerative condition, which means that it increases in severity over time. RA, on the other hand, is an . People with RA have immune systems that mistake the soft lining around joints to be a threat to the body, causing it to attack that area. This soft lining, which includes the synovial fluid, is called the synovium. As the immune system launches its assault, fluid buildup within the joint occurs, causing stiffness, pain, swelling, and inflammation. If you’re not sure which form of arthritis you have, your best bet is to talk to your doctor. But you can also do your own research. OA is often a slow-developing disease that can be hard to diagnose until it starts to cause painful or debilitating symptoms. Early OA is often diagnosed after an accident or other incident that causes a fracture requiring an . In addition to X-rays, your doctor may use an to diagnose OA. This imaging test uses radio waves and a magnetic field to create images of bone and soft tissue. Other diagnostic tests include a blood test to rule out other conditions that cause joint pain, such as RA. A joint fluid analysis can also be used to determine whether or infection is the underlying cause of inflammation. Check out the other tests used to help diagnose osteoarthritis. OA treatment is centered upon . The type of treatment that will help you the most will largely be determined by the severity of your symptoms and their location. Often, lifestyle changes, over-the-counter (OTC) medication, and home remedies will be enough to provide you with relief from pain, stiffness, and swelling. At-home treatments and lifestyle changes for OA include: strengthens the muscles around your joints and may help relieve stiffness. Aim for at least 20 to 30 minutes of physical movement, at least every other day. Choose gentle, low-impact activities, such as walking or swimming.

Stretching can help improve mobility and range of motion. As with any exercise plan, check with your doctor before beginning, to make sure it’s the right course of action for you. If stretching exercises get the green light, try these four osteoarthritis exercises. There are a number of different types of OA medications that can help provide relief from pain or swelling. They include: (acetaminophen) and other pain relievers reduce pain but not swelling. These OTC products are available as creams, gels, and patches. They help to numb the joint area and can provide pain relief, especially for mild arthritis pain. such as Advil (ibuprofen) and Aleve (naproxen) reduce swelling as well as pain. Your doctor may prescribe the antidepressant Cymbalta () for you to help provide OA pain relief. These prescription medications are available in oral form. They may also be given by injection directly into a joint. Your doctor may recommend you try OTC solutions as a first line of defense. Learn more about the OTC and prescription options for osteoarthritis. Alternative treatments and supplements may help to relieve symptoms such as inflammation and joint pain. Some supplements or herbs that may help include: Other remedies can range from taking to using hot or . You should discuss with your doctor any herbs or supplements you’re considering before you use them. This will help ensure that they’re safe and effective, and won’t interfere with other medications you’re taking. Interested in more natural home remedies for OA? Here’s what works. There’s no downside to eating healthy, but if you have OA, diet and nutrition are especially important. First off, you’ll want to keep your weight in a normal range to reduce unnecessary pressure on your joints. There’s also suggesting that some types of OA, such as osteoarthritis of the knee, respond positively to a diet high in , which are nutrients found in fruits and vegetables. Also, the found in many fruits and vegetables may also help combat the free radicals produced by inflammation. Free radicals are molecules that can cause cell damage. A high-quality diet may help provide relief from OA symptoms by and swelling. Eating foods high in the following can be highly beneficial: Increasing your intake of will help, too. Check out more reasons and ways to eat well while living with OA. Osteoarthritis can affect one or several areas of your hands. These areas often include the tips of the fingers, the middle knuckle of each finger, the joint connecting the thumb and the wrist, and the wrist itself. The joints that are affected largely determine the symptoms that occur. These symptoms often include: Women are more prone to OA in the hand than men, and usually get it at a younger age. Hand OA can have a big impact on your ability to do the tasks associated with day-to-day living. However, treatments ranging from lifestyle changes to surgery can help. Read more about OA in the hands and how to treat it. OA can occur in one or both hips. In this way it differs from RA, which usually occurs in both hips at the same time. Hip OA is a slowly degenerative condition. Many people find that they’re able to combat their symptoms for many years by using medication, exercise, and physical therapy. Supports, such as canes, can also help. If the condition worsens, steroid injections, other medications, or surgery can help provide relief. Alternative therapies can also help, and new technologies are on the horizon. Here’s what you need to know about the many treatment options for hip OA. Like hip OA, knee OA can occur in one or both knees. Age, genetics, and knee injury may all play a role in knee OA. Athletes who concentrate solely on one sport that creates extensive, repetitive motion, such as running or tennis, may be at increased risk of OA. Likewise, if you pursue only one type of physical activity, this may overuse some muscles and underuse others, causing weakness and instability in the knee joint. Varying your activities helps to work different muscle groups, allowing all the muscles around your knee to be strengthened. Treatment for knee OA depends on the stage of the condition. Learn about the stages of OA in the knee and how each one is treated. Wearing a brace around your knee can be an excellent nonsurgical treatment for knee OA. Braces can reduce swelling and pressure. They can also increase stability in your knee by shifting your weight away from the damaged part of your knee. This allows for greater mobility. There are several types of knee braces. Some may be custom fitted for you, and others . Your doctor may recommend that you try different kinds of braces for different activities. Find out what the best type of brace for your OA is. Cervical OA is also referred to as neck OA or as . It’s an age-related condition that affects more than . It occurs in both men and women. The cervical spine is located in the neck and contains facet joints. These joints help to maintain flexibility in the spine, allowing for a full range of motion. When the cartilage around the facet joints starts to wear away, cervical OA results. Cervical OA doesn’t always cause symptoms. If it does, symptoms can range from mild to severe and include: pain in your shoulder blade, down your arm, or in your fingers Occasionally, more serious symptoms can occur, such as loss of bladder or bowel control, or loss of balance. Check out the risk factors and treatment options for cervical OA. If you have back pain, you may have . This condition affects the facet joints located in the lower back and buttocks. Age and spine trauma are both potential factors in spinal OA. Women are more likely than men to get this condition. People who are overweight, or whose jobs require squatting and sitting, may also be at increased risk. Spinal OA’s symptoms can vary in severity. They include: stiffness or tenderness in the joints in your back weakness, numbness, or tingling in your arms or legs It’s important to pay attention to these symptoms. If left untreated, spinal OA can worsen, causing more severe symptoms and disability. You may have for OA that you can’t control, such as heredity, age, and gender. But other risk factors can be controlled, and managing them can help reduce your risk of OA.

f55413cc-f838-4b46-9958-f36f2be6628a,"is a painful condition involving the deterioration of the cartilage inside your joints. Affecting some 27 million people in America, it is, by far, the most common arthritic condition. Cartilage - The Key to Understanding Osteoarthritis Inside the joints where human bones meet - places like elbows, knees, shoulders, ankles, and knuckles - is a spongy tissue at the end of the bones called cartilage. Cartilage cushions the bones when we move, protecting the ends from touching, allowing us to twist, bend, turn, and enjoy a broad range of motion. The older we get, the more cartilage can deteriorate - especially in joints that we use over and over. It can also be damaged through injury. As cartilage degrades, the bones are no longer being properly cushioned. The joints can become damaged. Pain and stiffness result, and range of motion is diminished. A person with this kind of deteriorated joint is said to be suffering from osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis can affect anyone, but there are some risk factors that can increase your chances of having the condition: - Since cartilage degenerates, over time, through “wear and tear”, age increases risk. - Any kind of injury that involves bones, joints, and tendons can lead to OA. Sports injury in youth, for example, can contribute to earlier OA in adults. That’s why people who have been injured need to have regular check-ups and x-rays to keep a watchful eye on their joints. They also need to maintain a safe, smart active lifestyle. Learn more about . - More women than men suffer from OA. It is not known why. Women are more likely to seek medical advice then men are, thus it is also unknown if occurrence of OA among men is being under reported. Early menopause has a slight increase of risk factor. - Extra pounds increase the burden on the joints, increasing the “wear and tear”. Losing ten pounds can not only help ease the pain of OA, it can also help slow the rate of cartilage degeneration. - If others in your family suffered from OA, you could, too. Recurring pain in any joint can indicate OA, especially: - The same joint hurts, especially during weight bearing activities, and lessens when you stop moving. Pain is sometimes accompanied by crepitus, a crackling sound that occurs when the joint moves. Symptoms worse at end of the day and/or upon waking - For some people, tender and stiff joints are worse when they awaken and lessen with use. For others, a day’s use leaves their joints hurting more. - As the disease advances, joint destruction hampers movement. Inflammation and swelling can start to occur, and there may be accumulation of synovial fluid that distends the joint capsule, resulting in increased pain. Osteoarthritis is so common, that conversationally, when people say “arthritis” they are usually referring to OA. But medically, the term “arthritis” refers to a range of conditions involving the joints. Other painful arthritic conditions are the result of swelling and inflammation in the joints caused by autoimmune reactions. These conditions include , , and . Once you are diagnosed with OA, there are many treatment options to help you. Excessive pain does not need to be endured. Maintaining an active lifestyle - and not becoming sedentary - is important. Movement can help lessen pain and prevent it from getting worse. But you need to know the right, safe, and smartest moves for you. Like all treatments, your proper “movement prescription” requires having a pinpoint diagnosis and an understanding of your unique, personal condition.",121,numb fingers arthritis,-11.02775764465332,116

Are There Any Home Remedies for Rheumatoid Arthritis? What Are Tips for Managing and Living With Rheumatoid Arthritis? Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs (DMARDs) and RA Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) and Analgesics for RA is a chronic joint disease that damages the joints of the body. It is also a systemic disease that potentially affects the internal organs of the body and leads to disability. is the most common form of autoimmune, inflammatory in adults. It can also affect children. The joint damage is caused by inflammation of the joint lining tissue. Inflammation is normally a response by the body's immune system to ""assaults"" such as infections, , and foreign objects. In rheumatoid arthritis, the inflammation is misdirected to attack the joints. Rheumatoid arthritis is often referred to as . The inflammation in the joints causes , stiffness, swelling, and loss of function. The inflammation often affects other organs and systems of the body, including the , heart, and kidneys. If the inflammation is not slowed or stopped, it can permanently damage the affected joints and other tissues. Rheumatoid arthritis can be confused with other forms of arthritis, such as or arthritis associated with infections. Rheumatoid arthritis, however, is an autoimmune disease. This means that the body's immune system mistakenly attacks the tissues it is supposed to protect. The immune system in rheumatoid arthritis is misdirected and produces specialized cells and chemicals that are released into the bloodstream and attack body tissues. This abnormal immune response causes inflammation and thickening of the membrane (synovium) that lines the joint. Inflammation of the synovium is called synovitis and is the hallmark of an inflammatory arthritis such as rheumatoid arthritis. As the synovitis expands inside and outside of the joint, it can damage the bone and cartilage of the joint and the surrounding tissues, such as ligaments, tendons, nerves, and blood vessels. This leads to deformity and loss of function. Rheumatoid arthritis most often affects the smaller joints, such as those of the hands and/or , wrists, elbows, knees, and/or ankles, but any joint can be affected. The symptoms often lead to significant discomfort and disability. Many people with rheumatoid arthritis have difficulty carrying out normal activities of daily living, such as standing, , dressing, washing, using the toilet, preparing food, and carrying out household chores. The symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis interfere with the ability to work for many people. On average, life expectancy is somewhat shorter for people with rheumatoid arthritis than for the general population. This higher mortality rate does not mean that everyone with rheumatoid arthritis has a shortened life span. Rheumatoid arthritis itself is not a fatal disease. However, it can be associated with many complications and treatment-related side effects that can contribute to premature death. Although rheumatoid arthritis most often affects the joints, it is a disease of the entire body. It can affect many organs and body systems besides the joints. Therefore, rheumatoid arthritis is referred to as a systemic disease. About 1.3 million people in the United States are believed to have rheumatoid arthritis. About 75% of those affected are women. Women are two to three times more likely to develop rheumatoid arthritis than men. Rheumatoid arthritis affects all ages, races, and social and ethnic groups. It is most likely to strike people 35-50 years of age, but it can occur in children, teenagers, and elderly people. Rheumatoid arthritis that begins in people under 16 years of age is similar but not identical to the disease in adults and is referred to as (formerly ). Worldwide, about 1% of people are believed to have rheumatoid arthritis, but the rate varies among different groups of people. For example, rheumatoid arthritis affects about 5%-6% of some Native-American groups, while the rate is very low in some Caribbean people of African descent. The rate is about 2%-3% in people who have a close relative with rheumatoid arthritis, such as a parent, brother or sister, or child. Although there is no cure for rheumatoid arthritis, the disease can be controlled in most people. Early, aggressive therapy, soon after the initial diagnosis, which is optimally targeted to stop or slow down inflammation in the joints can prevent or reduce symptoms, prevent or reduce joint destruction and deformity, and prevent or lessen disability and other complications. Although rheumatoid arthritis most often affects the joints, it is a disease of the entire body. It can affect many organs and body systems besides the joints. Therefore, rheumatoid arthritis is referred to as a systemic disease. How Does Rheumatoid Arthritis Affect the Entire Body? Musculoskeletal structures: Damage to muscles surrounding joints may cause atrophy (shrinking) that results in weakness. This is most common in the hands. Atrophy also may result from not using a muscle, such as from pain or swelling. Damage to bones and tendons can cause deformities, especially of the hands and feet. and are other common complications of rheumatoid arthritis. Skin: Many people with rheumatoid arthritis develop small, firm nodules on or near the joint that are visible under the skin. These are known as rheumatoid nodules and are most noticeable under the skin on the bony areas that stick out when a joint is flexed. Dark purplish areas on the skin (purpura) are caused by into the skin from weakened blood vessels. Purpura is particularly common in those patients who have taken medication, such as . Heart: A collection of fluid around the heart (pericardial effusion) from inflammation is not uncommon in rheumatoid arthritis. This usually causes only mild symptoms, if any, but it can be very severe and lead to poor heart function. Rheumatoid arthritis-related inflammation can affect the heart muscle, the , or the blood vessels of the heart (coronary arteries). Heart attacks are more frequent in patients with rheumatoid arthritis than those without it, therefore, monitoring and cardiovascular health is important. Lungs: Rheumatoid arthritis' effects on the lungs may take several forms. Fluid may collect around one or both lungs and is referred to as a . Inflammation of the lining tissues of the lungs is known as pleuritis. Less frequently, lung tissues may become stiff or scarred, referred to as pulmonary fibrosis. Any of these effects can have a negative effect on breathing. Lung infections are more common with rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid nodules of local inflammation can occur in the lungs. Digestive tract: The digestive tract is usually not affected directly by rheumatoid arthritis. , related to Sjögren's syndrome, is the most common symptom of gastrointestinal involvement. Digestive complications are much more likely to be caused by medications used to treat the condition, such as (stomach inflammation) or caused by NSAID therapy. Kidneys: The kidneys are not usually affected directly by rheumatoid arthritis. Kidney problems in rheumatoid arthritis are much more likely to be caused by medications used to treat the condition. Nevertheless, severe, long-standing disease can uncommonly lead to a form of protein deposition and damage to the kidney, referred to as amyloidosis. Blood vessels: Inflammation of the blood vessels can cause problems in any organ but is most common in the skin, where it appears as purple patches (purpura) or skin ulcers. Blood: or ""low blood"" is a common complication of rheumatoid arthritis. Anemia means that there is an abnormally low number of red blood cells and that these cells are low in , the substance that carries oxygen through the body. (Anemia has many different causes and is by no means unique to rheumatoid arthritis.) A low (leukopenia) can occur from Felty's syndrome, a complication of rheumatoid arthritis that is also characterized by . : The deformity and damage to joints in rheumatoid arthritis often lead to entrapment of nerves. is one example of this. Entrapment can damage nerves and may lead to serious consequences. Eyes: The eyes commonly become dry and/or inflamed in rheumatoid arthritis. This is a result of inflammation of the tear glands and is called Sjögren's syndrome. The severity of this condition depends on which parts of the eye are affected. There are many other eye complications of rheumatoid arthritis, including inflammation of the whites of the eyes (scleritis), which often require the care of an ophthalmologist. Like many autoimmune diseases, rheumatoid arthritis typically waxes and wanes. Most people with rheumatoid arthritis experience periods when their symptoms worsen (known a flare-up or active disease) separated by periods in which the symptoms improve. With successful treatment, symptoms may even go away completely (remission, or inactive disease). The term refers to stiffness in the joints. What Are Symptoms and Signs of Rheumatoid Arthritis? Although rheumatoid arthritis can have many different symptoms, joints are always affected. Rheumatoid arthritis almost always affects the joints of the hands (such as the knuckle joints), wrists, elbows, knees, ankles, and/or feet. The larger joints, such as the shoulders, hips, and jaw, may be affected. The vertebrae of the neck are sometimes involved in people who have had the disease for many years. Usually at least two or three different joints are involved on both sides of the body, often in a symmetrical (mirror image) pattern. The usual joint symptoms include the following: Stiffness: The joint does not move as well as it once did. Its range of motion (the extent to which the appendage of the joint, such as the arm, leg, or finger, can move in different directions) may be reduced. Typically, stiffness is most noticeable in the morning and improves later in the day. Inflammation: Red, tender, and warm joints are the hallmarks of inflammation. Many joints are typically inflamed (polyarthritis). Swelling: The area around the affected joint is swollen and puffy. Nodules: These are hard that appear on or near the joint. They often are found near the elbows. They are most noticeable on the part of the joint that juts out when the joint is flexed. Pain: Pain in rheumatoid arthritis has several sources. Pain can come from inflammation or swelling of the joint and surrounding tissues or from working the joint too hard. The intensity of the pain varies among individuals. These symptoms may keep someone from being able to carry out normal activities. General symptoms include the following: The symptoms usually come on very gradually, although in some people they come on very suddenly. Sometimes, the general symptoms come before the joint symptoms, and an individual may think he or she has the or a similar illness. The following conditions suggest that rheumatoid arthritis is quiet, referred to as ""in remission"": What Are the Different Types of Rheumatoid Arthritis? Symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis usually begin gradually in several joints. Sometimes the symptoms begin only in one joint, and sometimes the symptoms begin initially in the whole body, with generalized stiffness and aching, and then localize to the joints. Typical ""classic"" rheumatoid arthritis is the most common type of rheumatoid arthritis. Classic rheumatoid arthritis involves three or more joints. Usually, people have a gradual onset of joint pain, stiffness, and joint swelling, usually in the fingers, wrists, and forefeet. Elbows, shoulders, hips, ankles and knees are also commonly affected. About 80% of people with rheumatoid arthritis are classified as ""seropositive,"" which simply means the rheumatoid factor (RF) blood test is abnormal. Some people with an abnormal rheumatoid factor also have an abnormal anti-CCP (anti-citrulline antibody) blood test. This is another blood test for rheumatoid arthritis. Approximately 20% of people with rheumatoid arthritis are classified as ""seronegative,"" which means the rheumatoid factor blood test is negative, or normal. In this case, the anti-CCP blood test may be abnormal or normal. Other blood tests, such as the () measure of inflammation, may be abnormal. Uncommonly, the onset of rheumatoid arthritis is episodic. One or several joints may be swollen and painful for several hours to several days. The inflammation then subsides for days to months, and then occurs again. This is known as palindromic rheumatism. People with this condition often develop typical ""classical"" rheumatoid arthritis. Persistent arthritis of just one joint may be the first symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis in some people. Some people experience generalized aching, stiffness, , and fatigue as their initial symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. is the most common type of arthritis, affecting about 27 million people in the United States. Osteoarthritis is caused by degeneration of cartilage, and is also known as . In contrast, rheumatoid arthritis is caused by the immune system attacking the joints. This autoimmune process causes systemic inflammation, while in osteoarthritis, mechanical degeneration causes localized inflammation. Osteoarthritis commonly affects a single joint, such as one knee. , such as multiple injuries playing sports, is a risk factor for osteoarthritis. On the other hand, rheumatoid arthritis usually affects three or more joints, in a symmetric distribution (both wrists, both ankles, and/or the toes on both feet). Rheumatoid arthritis frequently, but not always, causes elevation in blood levels of substances that are markers of systemic inflammation such as the ESR (sed rate or erythrocyte ) and (). In contrast, osteoarthritis does not cause abnormal blood test results. Both osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis are hereditary. For example, if a woman (or man) has osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis, her/his children are at increased risk of developing the same type of arthritis. What Are and Risk Factors of Rheumatoid Arthritis? The cause of rheumatoid arthritis is not known. Many risk factors are involved in the abnormal activity of the immune system that characterizes rheumatoid arthritis. These risk factors include hormones (explaining why the disease is more common in women than men), and Other environmental factors known to increase the risk for developing rheumatoid arthritis include Medical scientists have shown that alterations in the microbiome (altered levels of that normally inhabit the bowels) exist in people with rheumatoid arthritis. Emerging research shows that the microbiome has an enormous influence on our health, immune system, and many diseases, even those previously not directly linked to the gastrointestinal tract. Studies have shown different kinds of bacteria in the of people with rheumatoid arthritis than in those who do not have rheumatoid arthritis. However, it remains unknown how this information can be used to treat rheumatoid arthritis. Treatment is probably not as simple as replacing missing bacteria, but this may explain why some individuals with rheumatoid arthritis feel better with various dietary modifications. What Is Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)? Symptoms, Treatment, Diagnosis The usual symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis are stiff and painful joints, muscle pain, and fatigue. The experience of rheumatoid arthritis is different for each person. Most people with rheumatoid arthritis feel very stiff and achy in their joints, and frequently in their entire bodies, when they wake up in the morning. Joints may be swollen, and fatigue is very common. It is frequently difficult to perform daily activities that require use of the hands, such as opening a door or tying one's shoes. Since fatigue is a common symptom of rheumatoid arthritis, it is important for people with rheumatoid arthritis to rest when necessary and get a good night's . Systemic inflammation is very draining for the body. When Should People Seek Medical Care for Rheumatoid Arthritis? Joint pain or stiffness or swelling around a joint that lasts more than two weeks warrants a visit to a health-care professional. Someone who experiences symptoms that he or she thinks may be caused by arthritis should talk to a doctor. A doctor can explain the treatment options. How Do Health-Care Professionals Rheumatoid Arthritis? On someone's history of symptoms, a health-care professional will suspect that he or she has rheumatoid arthritis or another type of arthritis or rheumatic disease. The diagnosis doesn't end there though. It is very important to know exactly which type of arthritis a patient has because the treatment and outlook for each type can be different. A health-care professional will conduct a thorough interview and physical examination to try to pinpoint the cause of the symptoms. The physician will ask about symptoms, about other medical problems now and in the past, about family medical problems, about current medications, and about habits and lifestyle. There is no single test to confirm the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis. A health-care professional will use the results of the interview and physical examination, lab tests including blood tests, and imaging studies such as X-rays to determine whether or not someone has rheumatoid arthritis. At any time in the process of making the diagnosis or treating the condition, a primary-care physician may refer a patient to a rheumatologist (a specialist in diagnosing and treating rheumatoid arthritis). Lab tests: A health-care professional may suggest any of the following tests: : This test measures how many of each type of blood cell are in the blood. This will show anemia as well as abnormalities in white blood cell counts or platelet counts that can occur with rheumatoid arthritis. Markers of inflammation: These include measures such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP). Levels of both of these are usually elevated in active rheumatoid arthritis and may be good indicators of the extent of disease activity at any given time. Other blood tests: Levels of (such as calcium, magnesium, and potassium) and proteins may be tested. Kidney and functions also may be checked and monitored while taking medications. Immunologic tests: Blood levels of rheumatoid factor (RF), antinuclear antibodies (ANA), and possibly other tests including CCP antibodies (Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide or anti-citrulline antibodies) and 14.3.3 eta protein levels. Synovial fluid analysis: The tissue that lines the joint (synovium) produces fluid that normally helps to lubricate and protect joints. This fluid may be abnormal in quality and excessive quantity from rheumatoid arthritis. It may reveal characteristic signs of inflammation that point to rheumatoid arthritis, such as an elevated number of white blood cells. A sample of this fluid is withdrawn from a joint (usually the knee) through a needle in a procedure called arthrocentesis, or joint aspiration. The fluid is examined and analyzed for signs of inflammation. Imaging studies: X-rays and sometimes other imaging studies often are used to detect damage to the joints. X-rays: X-rays may be taken of sites where symptoms or signs occur. Early in rheumatoid arthritis, the X-ray may be normal or show only soft-tissue swelling, but damage can still be occurring. Over time, the usual finding is erosion of the bony part of the joint. Bone erosion occurs in nearly 80% of patients with one year of untreated disease. These changes are different than those that occur with other types of arthritis such as osteoarthritis. : (MRI) may allow earlier detection of bone erosion than plain film X-rays. : Ultrasound uses high-frequency sound waves to produce images of structures inside the body. It can be used to examine and to detect abnormal collections of fluid in the soft tissues around joints. The abnormal collection of joint fluid is referred to as a joint effusion. Bone scanning: In this test, a special image of the entire skeleton is obtained after a small amount of radioactive isotope is injected into a vein. Diseased or damaged bone takes up the radioisotope in a different way than healthy bone and produces a characteristic picture on X-ray films. This technique may be used to detect inflammatory changes in bone. Densitometry: This scan (DEXA scan) detects decreases in the thickness of bone that may indicate . occurs more frequently in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. : In this test, a small scope, a long narrow tube with a light and a camera on the end, is used to examine the inside of the joint. The scope is inserted through a small incision in the skin. The camera transmits pictures to a video monitor, allowing the doctor to detect signs of rheumatoid arthritis or other joint disease. This test is not always necessary. How Do Health-Care Professionals Classify the Severity of Rheumatoid Arthritis (Stages)? The American College of Rheumatology has developed a system for classifying rheumatoid arthritis into stages based on X-ray changes and signs of joint injury. This system helps medical professionals determine the severity of the rheumatoid arthritis. No damage seen on X-rays, although there may be signs of bone thinning On X-ray, evidence of bone thinning around a joint with or without slight bone damage Joint mobility may be limited; no joint deformities observed Abnormalities of soft tissue around joint possible On X-ray, evidence of cartilage and bone damage and bone thinning around the joint Joint deformity without permanent stiffening or fixation of the joint Abnormalities of soft tissue around joint possible On X-ray, evidence of cartilage and bone damage and osteoporosis around joint Joint deformity with permanent stiffening or fixation of the joint (ankylosis) Abnormalities of soft tissue around joint possible Rheumatologists also classify the functional status of people with rheumatoid arthritis as follows: Class I: Completely able to perform usual activities of daily living Class II: Able to perform usual self-care and work activities but limited in activities outside of work (such as playing sports, household chores) Class III: Able to perform usual self-care activities but limited in work and other activities Class IV: Limited in ability to perform usual self-care, work, and other activities Despite significant advances in treatment over the past decades, rheumatoid arthritis continues to be an incurable disease. While there is no cure, the goal of disease remission is frequently attainable. Treatment of rheumatoid arthritis has two major components: reducing inflammation and preventing joint damage and disability and relieving symptoms, especially pain. Although achieving the first goal may accomplish the second, many people need separate treatment for symptoms at some point in the disease. Are There Any Home Remedies for Rheumatoid Arthritis? If someone has joint pain or stiffness, he or she may think it is just a normal part of getting older and that there is nothing he or she can do. Nothing could be further from the truth. There are several options for medical treatment and even more to help prevent further joint damage and symptoms. Discuss these measures with a health-care professional to find ways to make them work. First of all, don't delay diagnosis or treatment. Having a correct diagnosis allows a health-care professional to form a treatment plan. Delaying treatment increases the risk that the arthritis will get worse and that serious complications will develop. Learn everything about rheumatoid arthritis. If there are any questions, ask a health-care professional. If any questions remain, ask the health-care professional to provide reliable sources of information. Some resources are listed later in this article. Know the pros and cons of all of treatment options, and work with a health-care professional to decide on the best options. Understand the treatment plan and what benefits and side effects can be expected. Learn about the symptoms. If someone has rheumatoid arthritis, he or she probably has both general discomfort (aches and stiffness) and pain in specific joints. Learn to tell the difference. Pain in a specific joint often results from overuse. Pain in a joint that lasts more than one hour after an activity probably means that that activity was too stressful and should be avoided. is a very important part of a complete treatment plan for rheumatoid arthritis, particularly once the is controlled. It may seem that is bad for arthritic joints, but research overwhelmingly shows that exercise in rheumatoid arthritis helps reduce pain and fatigue, increases range of motion (flexibility) and strength, and helps someone feel better overall. Three types of exercise are helpful: range-of-motion exercise, strengthening exercise, and endurance (cardio or aerobic) exercise. Water aerobics are an excellent choice because they increase range of motion and endurance while keeping weight off the joints of the lower body. Talk to a health-care professional about how to start an exercise program and what types of exercises to do and avoid. He or she may refer a patient to a physical therapist or exercise specialist. At least once a day, move each joint through its full range of motion. Do not overdo or move the joint in any way that causes pain. This helps keep freedom of motion in the joints. Avoid situations that are likely to strain the joints. Remember that the joints are more susceptible to damage when they are swollen and painful. Avoid stressing the joint at such times. Learn proper body mechanics. This means learning to use and move the body in ways that reduce the on the joints. This is especially true for the hands, since it's important to protect their flexibility. Ask a health-care professional or physical therapist for suggestions on how to avoid joint strain. Be creative in thinking up new ways to carry out tasks and activities. Use the strongest joint available for the job. Avoid using the fingers, for example, if the wrist can do the job. Take advantage of assistive devices to carry out activities that have become difficult. These simple devices can work very well to reduce on certain joints. Talk to a health-care professional or physical and/or occupational therapist about this. Alternate periods of rest and activity through the day. This is called pacing. General rest is an important part of rheumatoid arthritis treatment, but avoid keeping the joints in the same position for too long a time. Get up and move; use the hands. Holding the joint still for long periods just promotes stiffness. Keep the joints moving to keep them flexible. If it's necessary to sit for long periods, say at work or while traveling, take a short break every hour; stand up, walk around, stretch, and flex the joints. This can improve one's outlook and help put the arthritis in perspective. Some enjoyable activities are even helpful for the joints, such as walking, swimming, and light gardening. If someone is , losing weight not only helps him or her look better, it helps the joints feel better. Reducing weight helps take stress off joints and reduces pain. Maintaining a healthy weight also can help prevent other serious medical conditions such as and . Eat a varied with plenty of fruits and vegetables, lean proteins, and low-fat dairy products. Some research has suggested that a fish-grain diet can decrease the chances of developing rheumatoid arthritis while a Western high-fat diet might increase the chances of developing rheumatoid arthritis. An adequate amount of dietary and calcium can be helpful for those affected by rheumatoid arthritis. Quit . This will reduce the risk of rheumatoid arthritis complications. This will also reduce the risk of , , and other breathing problems as well as . , in fact, has been associated with an increased risk for developing rheumatoid arthritis. has been proven to reduce rheumatoid arthritis disease activity. Take medications as directed. If a patient thinks a medication is not working or is causing side effects, talk to a health-care professional before stopping the medication. Some medications take weeks or even months to reach their full benefit. In a few cases, stopping a medication suddenly can even be dangerous. Any natural remedies should be discussed with a health-care professional to make sure there are no harmful side effects or interactions with . Taking a warm bath before bed can help with relaxation. Massages feel good and may help increase energy and flexibility. Apply an ice pack or compress to a joint to reduce pain and swelling. (Keep a reusable ice pack in the freezer or try using a bag of frozen vegetables.) What Are Medical for Rheumatoid Arthritis? Rheumatoid arthritis is a progressive inflammatory disease. This means that unless the inflammation is stopped or slowed, the condition will continue to worsen with joint destruction in most people. Although rheumatoid arthritis does occasionally go into remission without treatment, this is rare. Starting treatment as soon as possible after diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis is strongly recommended. The best medical care combines medication and nondrug approaches. Physical therapy helps preserve and improve range of motion, increase muscle strength, and reduce pain. Hydrotherapy involves exercising or relaxing in warm water. Being in water reduces the weight on the joints. The warmth relaxes the muscles and helps relieve pain. Relaxation therapy teaches techniques for releasing muscle tension, which helps relieve pain. Both heat and can relieve pain and reduce inflammation. Some people's pain responds better to heat and others' to cold. Heat can be applied by ultrasound, microwaves, warm wax, or moist compresses. Most of these are done in the medical office, although moist compresses can be applied at home. Cold can be applied with ice packs at home. Occupational therapy teaches people ways to use their body efficiently to reduce stress on the joints. It also can help people learn to decrease tension on the joints through the use of specially designed splints. The occupational therapist can help someone develop strategies for coping with daily life by adapting to the environment and using different assistive devices. In some cases, reconstructive surgery and/or joint replacement operations provide the best outcome. Drug approaches include a variety of medications used alone or in combinations. The goal of drug treatment is to induce remission or at least eliminate evidence of disease activity. Early use of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) not only controls inflammation better than less potent drugs but also helps prevent joint damage. Newer DMARDs work better than the older ones in long-term prevention of joint damage. People treated early with DMARDs have better long-term outcomes, with greater preservation of function, less work disability, and a smaller risk of premature death. The current approach, therefore, is to treat rheumatoid arthritis aggressively with DMARDs soon after diagnosis. Treating rheumatoid arthritis early, within three to 12 months after symptoms begin, is the best way to stop or slow progression of the disease and bring about remission. Ongoing (long-term) treatment with combinations of medications may offer the best control and prognosis of rheumatoid arthritis for the majority of people. Combinations of these medications do not usually have more severe adverse effects than one medication alone. What Are Tips for Managing and Living With Rheumatoid Arthritis? The following tips are helpful in managing and living with RA: Live a healthy lifestyle: Eat healthy foods. Avoid and junk food. Quit , or don't start. Don't drink in excess. These common-sense measures have an enormous impact on general health and help the body function at its best. Exercise: Discuss the right kind of exercise for you with your doctor, if necessary. Rest when needed, and get a good night's . The immune system functions better with adequate sleep. Pain and mood improve with adequate rest. Follow your doctor's instructions about medications to maximize effectiveness and minimize side effects. Communicate with your doctor about your questions and concerns. They have experience with many issues that are related to rheumatoid arthritis. The medications for rheumatoid arthritis fall into several different categories. These RA medications include Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs (DMARDs) and RA : This group of drugs includes a wide variety of agents that work in many different ways. What they all have in common is that they interfere in the immune processes that promote inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis. DMARDs can actually stop or slow the progression of rheumatoid arthritis. They can also suppress the ability of the immune system to fight infections. Anyone taking one of these drugs must be very vigilant to watch for early signs of infection, such as fever, , or . Early treatment of infections can prevent more serious problems. Conventional DMARDs include (Rheumatrex, Rasuvo, and others), (), (), and (Plaquenil). These are used alone or in combination (most commonly for moderate to severely active rheumatoid arthritis). Methotrexate (Rheumatrex, Folex PFS): This drug relieves symptoms of inflammation such as pain, swelling, and stiffness. People taking methotrexate must have regular blood tests to measure whether the drug is having any adverse effects on the liver, kidneys, or blood cells. This drug is not suitable for some people with liver problems or women who are or may become . Sulfasalazine (Azulfidine): This drug decreases inflammatory responses by an effect similar to that of or NSAIDs. People taking sulfasalazine must have regular blood tests to measure whether the drug is having any adverse effects on blood cells. Leflunomide (Arava): This drug interferes with cells of the immune system and reduces inflammation. It reduces symptoms and may even slow the progression of rheumatoid arthritis. People taking leflunomide must have regular blood tests to measure whether the drug is having any adverse effects on the liver or blood cells. This agent is not suitable for some people with liver or kidney problems or women who are or may become pregnant. Hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil): This drug was first used against the tropical parasite . It inhibits certain cells that are necessary for the immune response that causes rheumatoid arthritis. People taking hydroxychloroquine must have eye examinations at least yearly to determine whether the drug is having any adverse effects on the . Gold salts (aurothiomalate, []): These compounds contain very tiny amounts of the metal gold. Apparently, the gold infiltrates into immune cells and interferes with their activities. People taking gold must have regular blood and urine tests to measure whether the drug is having any adverse effects on blood cells and the kidney. This medication is less commonly used today. (): This drug stops the production of cells that are part of the immune response associated with rheumatoid arthritis. Unfortunately, it also stops production of some other types of immune cells and thus can have serious side effects. It strongly suppresses the entire immune system and thus leaves the person vulnerable to infections and other problems. It is used only in severe cases of rheumatoid arthritis that have not gotten better with other DMARDs. People taking azathioprine must have regular blood tests to measure whether or not the drug is having any adverse effects on liver and blood cells. (): This drug was developed for use in people undergoing organ transplantation or bone-marrow transplantation. These people must have their immune system suppressed to prevent rejection of the transplant. Cyclosporine blocks an important immune cell and interferes with the immune response in several other ways. People taking cyclosporine must have regular blood tests and checks to measure whether the drug is having any adverse effects on blood cells and blood pressure. It is not used during or in women who may become pregnant. : These agents act like substances produced normally in the body and block other natural substances that are part of the immune response. They block the process that leads to inflammation and damage of the joints. These are targeted treatments that are directed at specific processes in the immune system that are involved in the disease development and progression. Prior to taking biologic response modifiers, patients typically receive screening tests for , , and (TB). Live forms of vaccinations are not generally administered while persons are taking biologic medications. (): This agent blocks the action of necrosis factor, which in turn decreases inflammatory and immune responses. It is given by subcutaneous injection twice weekly. People taking etanercept must have regular blood tests to measure whether the drug is having any adverse effects on blood cells. (): This antibody blocks the action of tumor necrosis factor. It is often used in combination with methotrexate in people whose rheumatoid arthritis does not respond to methotrexate alone. It is given by intravenous infusion every six to eight weeks. People taking infliximab must have regular blood tests to measure whether the drug is having any adverse effects on blood cells. (): This is another blocker of tumor necrosis factor. It reduces inflammation and slows or stops worsening of joint damage in fairly severe rheumatoid arthritis. It is given by subcutaneous injection every two weeks. People taking adalimumab must have regular blood tests to measure whether the drug is having any adverse effects on blood cells. (): This is another blocker of tumor necrosis factor. It reduces inflammation and slows or stops worsening of joint damage in fairly severe rheumatoid arthritis. It is given by subcutaneous injection every four weeks. People taking certolizumab must have regular blood tests to measure whether the drug is having any adverse effects on blood cells. (): This is another blocker of tumor necrosis factor. It reduces inflammation and slows or stops worsening of joint damage in fairly severe rheumatoid arthritis. It is given by subcutaneous injection every four weeks. The intravenous form of golimumab (Simponi Aria) is given every eight weeks. People taking golimumab must have regular blood tests to measure whether the drug is having any adverse effects on blood cells. (): This agent blocks the action of interleukin-1, which is partly responsible for the inflammation of rheumatoid arthritis. This in turn blocks inflammation and pain in rheumatoid arthritis. This agent is usually reserved for people whose rheumatoid arthritis has not improved with DMARDs. It is given by subcutaneous injection daily. The intravenous form of golimumab (Simponi Aria) is given every eight weeks. People taking golimumab must have regular blood tests to measure whether the drug is having any adverse effects on blood cells. (): This agent inhibits T-lymphocytes that contribute to the inflammation and pain associated with rheumatoid arthritis. This drug is reserved for individuals who do not respond to DMARDs, methotrexate, or TNF blockers. It is administered by intravenous infusion. Abatacept may increase the risk of serious infections. (): Given by intravenous infusion over four to five hours, twice, two weeks apart, every four to 10 months, this biologic response modifier decreases the number of B-cells, a type of immune cell that plays an integral role in causing rheumatoid inflammation and damage. Rituximab may increase the risk of serious infections. (Actemra): The agent blocks the chemical messenger interleukin-6 (IL-6) that plays a role in activating the immune system that is responsible for rheumatoid arthritis. Tocilizumab is given intravenously once a month. Regular blood testing is required to monitor for potential side effects on blood cells, liver, and . While biologic medications are often combined with traditional DMARDs in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, they are generally not used with other biologic medications because of the unacceptable risk for serious infections. (Xeljanz) is the first in a new class of ""small molecule"" medications used to treat rheumatoid arthritis called JAK inhibitors. Tofacitinib is a treatment for adults with moderate to severe active RA in which methotrexate was not very effective. Patients can take tofacitinib with or without methotrexate, and this prescription drug is taken by mouth two times a day. Tofacitinib is a ""targeted"" drug that only blocks Janus kinase, special enzymes of inflammation, within cells. This is why it is referred to as a JAK inhibitor. JAK inhibitors are not used with biologic medications. : These very potent agents rapidly block inflammation and other immune responses. They are often called . These agents all work in the same way; they differ only in their potency and in the form in which they are given. Steroids may be given as pills, intravenously, or as injections into a muscle or directly into a joint. In high doses, they can cause many serious side effects and are therefore given only for the shortest possible periods and at the lowest doses possible for the condition. These drugs generally tapered and not stopped abruptly. Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) and Analgesics for RA : These drugs reduce swelling and pain but do not stop joint damage and alone are not sufficient to treat rheumatoid arthritis. These drugs work by blocking an enzyme called cyclo-oxygenase (COX) that promotes inflammation. There are at least two forms of the enzyme: COX-1 and COX-2. Some people with a history of stomach ulcers or liver problems should not take these drugs. This group includes aspirin, although aspirin is rarely used in rheumatoid arthritis because it is not as safe as other agents. COX-2 inhibitors: These agents block only the COX-2 enzyme and are often referred to as selective NSAIDs. They have fewer side effects than the other NSAIDs while still reducing inflammation. Only () is sold in the U.S. market. Nonselective NSAIDs: These drugs block both COX-1 and COX-2. They include (, , etc.), (Oruvail), (), (), and (, ). : These medicines reduce pain but do not affect swelling or joint destruction. (, , ): This drug is often used by people who cannot take NSAIDs because of hypersensitivity, ulcers, liver problems, or interactions with other drugs. Opioids: These drugs may be used to treat moderately severe to severe pain that is not relieved by other analgesics. For more information on these medications, see Understanding Rheumatoid Arthritis Medications. There is little scientific research on the role of herbs, natural products, and nutritional in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. High-dose () has been shown in small studies to reduce rheumatoid arthritis disease activity, and in some cases, fish oil supplementation may allow patients to discontinue NSAIDs. People with rheumatoid arthritis are using turmeric with varying degrees of success in reducing inflammation. Other dietary changes that some people with rheumatoid arthritis can find helpful including increasing hydration for the dry mouth of Sjögren's syndrome, increasing fish intake (especially salmon) for fish oil supplementation to reduce inflammation, and taking anti-inflammatory medications with food to avoid stomach irritation (gastritis and ). As described above, some research has suggested that a fish-grain diet can decrease the chances of developing rheumatoid arthritis while a Western high-fat diet might increase the chances of developing rheumatoid arthritis. There are currently no particular foods that are universally recommended that people with rheumatoid arthritis avoid, but dietary discretion is individualized based on patients' own experiences. A variety of complementary approaches may be effective in relieving pain. These include and massage. Some people with rheumatoid arthritis need several operations over time. Examples include removal of damaged synovium (synovectomy), tendon repairs, and replacement of badly damaged joints, especially the knees or hips. Surgical fusion of damaged rheumatoid wrists can alleviate pain and improve function. Sometimes rheumatoid nodules in the skin that are irritating are removed surgically. Some people with rheumatoid arthritis have involvement of the vertebrae of the neck (cervical spine). This has the potential for compressing the and causing serious consequences in the nervous system. This is important to identify prior to anesthesia intubation procedures for surgery. These people with serious spinal involvement occasionally need to undergo surgical fusion of the spine. A specialist or primary-care physician should regularly monitor the patient's condition, response to treatment, and side effects and other problems related to the rheumatoid arthritis or treatment. The best way to monitor the condition is to see if there is any disability (loss of function) and, if so, how much. The frequency of these visits depends on the activity of the rheumatoid arthritis. If the treatment is working well and the patient's condition is stable, the visits can be less frequent than if the rheumatoid arthritis is getting worse, there are complications, or if the patient is having severe side effects of treatment. Each person's situation must be decided individually. There is no known way to prevent rheumatoid arthritis, although progression of the disease usually can be stopped or slowed by early, aggressive treatment. As a rule, the severity of rheumatoid arthritis waxes and wanes. Periods of active inflammation and tissue damage marked by worsening of symptoms (flares) are interspersed with periods of little or no activity, in which symptoms get better or go away altogether (remission). The duration of these cycles varies widely among individuals. Outcomes are also highly variable. Some people have a relatively mild condition, with little disability or loss of function. Others at the opposite end of the spectrum experience severe disability due to pain and loss of function. Disease that remains persistently active for more than a year is likely to lead to joint deformities and disability. Approximately 40% of people have some degree of disability 10 years after their diagnosis. For most, rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic progressive illness, but about 5%-10% of people experience remission without treatment. This is uncommon, however, after the first three to six months. Rheumatoid arthritis is not fatal, but complications of the disease shorten life span by a few years in some individuals. Although generally rheumatoid arthritis cannot be cured, the disease gradually becomes less aggressive and symptoms may even improve. However, any damage to joints and ligaments and any deformities that have occurred are permanent. Rheumatoid arthritis can affect parts of the body other than the joints. The early treatment and use of DMARDs and biologic response modifiers in rheumatoid arthritis has resulted in patients experiencing more profound relief of symptoms and less joint damage and less disability over time. So the prognosis is best when treatment is started early. New treatments are on the horizon. Common complications of rheumatoid arthritis include the following: and : This condition results from damage to nerves, most often those in the hands and feet. It can result in tingling, numbness, or burning. Anemia: This is a low level of hemoglobin, a protein in the blood that carries essential oxygen to cells and tissues. Symptoms include weakness, low energy, pallor, and shortness of breath. Scleritis: This is a serious inflammation of the blood vessels in the white portion (sclera) of the eye that can damage the eyes and impair vision. Infections: People with rheumatoid arthritis have a higher risk for infections. This is due partly to the abnormal immune system in rheumatoid arthritis and partly to the use of immune-suppressing medications for treatment. Digestive tract problems: Many people experience stomach and intestinal distress. Again, this is more often a side effect of medications used to treat rheumatoid arthritis. Osteoporosis: Osteoporosis, or the loss of , is more common in women with rheumatoid arthritis than in women in general. The hip is particularly affected. The risk for osteoporosis also appears to be higher than average in men with rheumatoid arthritis who are older than 60 years. Lung disease: Certain conditions involving inflammation of the lungs seem to be more common in people with rheumatoid arthritis than in the general population. These include and pleuritis, lung infections, lung nodules, and pulmonary fibrosis. However, a definite link between smoking and rheumatoid arthritis may at least partly account for this finding. smoking, in any case, may increase the severity of the disease. : Rheumatoid arthritis can affect the blood vessels and may increase the risk for coronary heart disease. Sjögren's syndrome: This is another autoimmune rheumatic disease, like rheumatoid arthritis. It causes extreme dryness of certain body tissues, especially the eyes and mouth. Dryness of the eyes is common in people with rheumatoid arthritis. Felty's syndrome: This condition combines enlargement of the spleen with impairment of the immune system (low white blood cell count), leading to recurrent . This syndrome sometimes responds to DMARD therapy. and other cancers: The risk for , a of the , is higher than normal in people with rheumatoid arthritis. This is thought to be a result of abnormalities in the immune system. The risk of lymphoma is higher in those patients with active inflammatory disease. Other cancers that may be more common in people with rheumatoid arthritis include prostate and lung cancers. , a syndrome, is more common in people with autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and than in the general population. Rheumatoid : This is an autoimmune inflammation of the blood vessels that can occur in patients who have severe, active rheumatoid arthritis for many years. The symptoms of this are a very specific-looking or nonhealing ulcerations on the legs. Macrophage activation syndrome: This is a life-threatening complication of rheumatoid arthritis. It is diagnosed by bone marrow testing and requires immediate treatment. Symptoms include persistent fever, weakness, drowsiness, and lethargy. Overall, the rate of premature death is higher in people with rheumatoid arthritis than in the general population. The most common causes of premature death in people with rheumatoid arthritis are infection, vasculitis, and poor . Fortunately, the manifestations of severe, long-standing disease, such as nodules, vasculitis, and deforming are becoming less common with optimal treatments. There is no known cure for rheumatoid arthritis. However, with early, aggressive treatment with DMARDs, many patients are able to achieve remission, meaning the symptoms of RA are quiet. Sometimes, the dose of medications may be reduced when remission is achieved. It is unusual for rheumatoid arthritis to remain in remission if medications are stopped, and when this does occur (rarely), symptoms and signs usually come back over time. For this reason, it is not advisable to stop rheumatoid arthritis medications unless advised to do so by a rheumatologist.

Sometimes people can feel frustrated, perhaps even angry or resentful. Sometimes it helps to have someone to talk to. This is the purpose of support groups. Support groups consist of people in the same situation. They come together to help each other and to help themselves. Support groups provide reassurance, motivation, and inspiration. They can help people see that their situation is not unique, and that gives them power. They also provide practical tips on coping with the disease. Support groups meet in person, on the telephone, or on the Internet. Ask a health-care professional or contact the following organizations or look on the Internet to find a suitable support group. If someone does not have access to the Internet, go to the public library. Drug therapy for rheumatoid arthritis has improved so much that it can now slow disease progression, preventing joint damage and loss of function. The earlier that treatment is started, the better the chance to slow disease progression and prevent damage and loss of function. People who are severely disabled by rheumatoid arthritis may require orthopedic surgery for joint reconstruction or replacement with manufactured joints (prostheses). Pain relievers may be used occasionally. Such drugs include acetaminophen (Tylenol), tramadol (Ultram), or narcotic-containing pain relievers. These drugs do not reduce joint swelling or damage.

1c775151-04a5-4c54-b957-43041be5c227,"Carpal Tunnel Syndrome and Diabetes: What’s the Connection? — Believe it or not, carpal tunnel syndrome is yet another “complication” associated with diabetes. Beyond simple forearm discomfort, it can be quite debilitating. Here’s an overview for people with diabetes on what carpal tunnel syndrome is exactly, and what you can do about it. As you probably know, is a progressively painful hand and arm condition that develops from a pinched nerve in your wrist. It specifically affects the median nerve, which runs through the carpal tunnel from your hand into your forearm. The median nerve provides feeling to the palm side of your fingers, and is the muscle power that powers your thumb. When the median nerve is pinched from swelling of nerves or tendons in the carpal tunnel, numbness, tingling, and pain can affect the hand and fingers. It can also lead to other symptoms, like poor circulation and loss of grip strength. The root cause of the condition is unknown. But with diabetes, researchers believe that high blood glucose levels make the tendons of the carpal tunnel become . That means the tendons become inflamed, and excess sugars form a “biological superglue” that makes the tendons less able to slide freely — similar to what happens in . In the general population, CTS affects between 2 and 3 percent of people, but it seems to cluster around people who are already dealing with other health challenges. The most common conditions to carpal tunnel syndrome are: thyroid conditions (that’s most of us, as diabetes and thyroid conditions are bosom buddies) high blood pressure (again, common among people with diabetes) autoimmune disorders (applies to those of us with type 1 diabetes) that CTS appears in up to 20 percent of people with diabetes, “suggesting that the link between diabetes and carpal tunnel syndrome could be due to excessively high blood sugar levels.” In fact, some years ago research evidence was being circulated that CTS might actually predict type 2 diabetes. In 2014, Dutch researcher Steven H. Hendriks and his team decided to afresh and attempt to weed out confounding factors — other conditions that confuse data sets in clinical research. What they found was that while type 2 diabetes was more frequently diagnosed in people with CTS, it couldn’t be singled out as an independent risk factor after they adjusted for body mass index, gender, and age. In other words, the type 2 population shares the demographic of the CTS population. And, tellingly, they found no association between CTS and the duration of diabetes, the level of glycemic control, or the degree of microvascular complications — all of which you’d expect if diabetes and CTS had a direct relationship. So, it just may be that more weight, older age, and being female increases the risk of both diabetes and CTS. Regarding type 1 diabetes, one — albeit 15 years old — showed a “lifetime risk of symptomatic carpal tunnel syndrome in people with T1D.” Oy! In a rare case of diabetes being good news for a change, while we have more CTS than other folks, we don’t tend to get its most severe form. That goes to people with (which can exist either with diabetes or independently of it). Add the fact that folks who spend a lot of time typing on computers have an occupational risk factor (and of course you know we type 1s are an internet-savvy set!). We found it interesting that in addition to the “keyboarding occupations,” other occupations with a high-risk for CTS include: assembly line workers who use repetitive wrist motions construction workers who use vibrating power tools Lots of folks may wonder whether they got CTS or have a higher risk for it if someone else in their family has it. The answer is yes: Genetics are at play here. there’s definitely a genetic component to CTS, which is especially the case when it hits young people. Other genetic factors that may contribute to developing CTS include abnormalities in certain genes that regulate , a fatty substance that insulates nerve fibers. Basically, just like with diabetes, if you have a family history of the condition, you’re more likely to get it. CTS is actually part of the family. It’s sometimes called an “entrapment neuropathy.” To better understand how a nerve can become entrapped, it helps to visualize how the carpal tunnel is built. The carpal tunnel is a narrow passageway in your wrist between your forearm and hand. And just like some terrestrial tunnels are shared by both roads and rails, the carpal tunnel in your body is shared by both tendons and nerves. In some people, “traffic congestion” in the carpal tunnel can lead to fender benders that affect the primary nerve to the hand, causing CTS. If you were to cut your hand off — not that we’re recommending it — and flop it on the table palm up, you’d find that the carpal tunnel is more like a covered aqueduct than a proper tunnel. It’s a U-shaped trough of small bones. At the base of the trough are the flexor tendons that power your fingers. Along the top of the bundle of tendons runs the median nerve, the pipeline for sensation for the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and part of the ring finger. Over the top of the channel runs a band-like strap of ligament called the transverse carpal ligament. It could be described as a small trench with a lot of plumbing running through it. CTS happens when the tendons at the base of that trench get inflamed. As they swell, they press upward on the nerve, and the nerve gets pinched (entrapped) between the swelling tendons at the bottom of the shaft and the ligament strap at the top. Symptoms from numbness or tingling on the thumb-side of the hand to horrible, crippling pain. The pain can be felt in the hands, wrist, or forearm. It usually strikes the dominant hand , but in about half of people who have CTS, it’s of the body. In case you think it’s just a case of sore wrists, think again. The pain can be surprisingly intense! Our own DiabetesMine editor-in-chief, Amy Tenderich, has dealt with CTS, writing in 2008: “I never imagined how painful or debilitating it can be. At its worst, I could literally not make toast for my kids in the morning, let alone help them button their sweaters. I could barely hold my blow-dryer up straight, and was wiped out from being up all night with the pain.” At one time, it was believed that repetitive motion of the wrists actually caused CTS. Now most experts agree that isn’t the case. Rather, there’s consensus that CTS is exclusively caused by the size of the carpal tunnel and is exacerbated by repetitive motion. (This is in much the same way that obesity doesn’t cause diabetes if you’re not predisposed, but can trigger it if you are.) Just as tunnels through mountains vary in length and bore, so too, apparently, do carpal tunnels in people, creating a congenital predisposition. Sorry, gang, size really does matter. At least for CTS. Basically, people with smaller tunnels are more likely to get CTS, largely due to the fact that the margin for error is so small: It doesn’t take much swelling to pinch off a smaller tunnel. This also might explain why women are more likely to get CTS than men. They have smaller wrists, and hence smaller carpal tunnels. Maybe this means that if you have a small tunnel, work on the assembly line during the day, and play in an amateur piano league at night, you’re really in for it. Meanwhile, as to the connection between diabetes and CTS, who knows? Maybe the genes that cause diabetes also cause small carpal tunnels. Keep in mind that symptoms for carpal tunnel start , so it’s important to see your doctor early if you’re often feeling “pins and needles,” or a burning or loss of sensation in your hands. Do you wake up at night with your hands or thumbs feeling numb, like they’ve “gone to sleep”? When you do get examined, your doctor will run some tests, most importantly to make sure that you don’t have . The two conditions can feel similar but aren’t the same thing. They require different treatments. Two clinical tests used to diagnose CTS are the , which sound really scary but are actually just flexing exercises to check if you experience a tingling sensation in your hands or wrists. In the Tinel’s sign test, your doctor taps the inside of your wrist over the median nerve. If you feel tingling, numbness, or a mild “shock” sensation in your hand, you may have CTS. The Phalen test has you resting your elbows on a table, and then letting your wrists dangle so your hands are pointing down with your palms pressed together in the prayer position. (This sums it up nicely.) A positive result is when your fingers tingle or feel numb within a minute. Treatments for CTS range from rest and wrist splints to medications, physical therapy, and even surgery. For most folks, avoiding activities that aggravate the wrist (which, sadly, includes working on the computer), , and taking ibuprofen can help with the pain and keep the pressure off the median nerve until things heal. Other you can try include stretches and elevating your hands and wrists whenever possible. While keeping your hands warm can help with pain and stiffness, medical experts recommend icing joints that are known to be affected CTS. A concludes that “application of cold to the hand may reduce compression of the carpal ligament and nerve.” Your doctor may recommend corticosteroids to lessen your pain and inflammation. These drugs reduce the amount of swelling and pressure placed on the median nerve. Injections are more effective than oral steroids. This therapy may be particularly effective if an inflammatory condition is causing your CTS, such as . If your condition doesn’t improve within a few months, your doctor may recommended that you see an orthopedic surgeon or neurologist to talk about surgery. In fact, CTS surgery is one of the most surgeries performed in the United States. What’s involved in carpal tunnel syndrome surgery? Remember that carpal ligament we talked about at the start? The “roof” of the carpal tunnel? In the traditional CTS , the ligament is cut to relieve pressure. Basically, the tunnel is routed out to create a larger bore. Any other tissue (such as a tumor) that may be putting pressure on the median nerve can also be removed during surgery. There are actually two methods of carpal tunnel surgery, called open and endoscopic. But be aware: Neither is foolproof. According to , both are 95 percent effective. Nevertheless, each has advantages and disadvantages, mostly related to ongoing discomfort after the surgery. The less invasive endoscopic version requires a much smaller incision, which reduces pain, recovery time, and scarring. But according to from the Hand and Wrist Institute, in about 2 percent of cases, physicians can’t see the tissue properly to do the endoscopic surgery safely, so they have to resort to the “open” version. Naturally, diabetes also complicates things. Many medical sources still state the disclaimer: “Surgery may only provide partial relief when another medical condition, such as rheumatoid arthritis, obesity, or diabetes, is contributing to carpal tunnel syndrome.” Scott King, a type 1 and former editor of Diabetes Health magazine, had CTS for a long time. He finally made the move to have general several years ago. After the procedure, he shared with us: “I have only one little hole in both wrists, almost healed now but scars are still sensitive and I can TYPE again with no pain! The worst part after the surgery was that my hands hurt horribly for the first 2 days… but a week later I was flying out on a business trip, and everything was great! I do wish I had the surgery earlier, as I still have tingling in my left hand from permanent damage to the nerve.” Clearly, choosing whether to undergo surgery is a big decision. Check out from Ortho Illinois to help you make a decision. Ergonomics and exercises for carpal tunnel syndrome In addition to keeping blood sugars in range (best way to prevent ALL complications!), a good way to offset CTS risk is keeping your wrists straight as much as possible and avoid flexing them unnecessarily — which often happens when we sit in front of our ubiquitous computers for too long. To help with this, DiabetesMine’s Amy Tenderich even had a visit her home office at one point to check the setup of her chair height and keyboard. Sounds pretentious, but it actually really helped, she says. Experts agree that ergonomic positioning can help prevent pinching the nerves in your wrist and is super helpful for both prevention and treatment of CTS. Also, there are you can do at your desk anytime to help prevent CTS and keep your hands and arms healthy and loose. So, any people with diabetes out there dealing with CTS? We feel for you!

8a9672d5-28fc-44b3-bcd2-72676939e044,"Osteoarthritis afflicts nearly 21 million Americans, men and women alike. Depending on its severity, arthritis can be a minor annoyance or a disabling disease that takes over every aspect of your life. Symptoms of osteoarthritis usually don't appear until you're in your 40s or 50s. Most people over the age of 60, in fact, would show some signs of arthritis on X-rays, although only a third will experience symptoms. Some health experts estimate that as many as 90 percent of us will get some form of osteoarthritis at some point in our lives. In more severe cases, a doctor may prescribe medicine or even recommend surgery for this condition. However, for patients who have just recently noticed symptoms of osteoarthritis, or who have a mild case, there are some home remedies for osteoarthritis pain relief that may prove effective. This page will provide an overview of the causes, symptoms, and conventional treatment methods for osteoarthritis before we move into a discussion of home remedies for osteoarthritis pain relief, namely glucosamine sulfate, on the following pages of this article. Osteoarthritis occurs as a result of the breakdown of the cartilage in the joints. In a normal joint, the ends of the bones are covered with cartilage: a durable, elastic tissue that protects the bones and allows the joint to move freely. Cartilage gets the oxygen and nutrients it needs by absorbing them, like a sponge, from the joint fluid (called synovial fluid). As the joint bends, waste products are squeezed out of the cartilage; as the joint relaxes, nutrients and oxygen are absorbed. (Controlled movement, therefore, benefits the joints.) In osteoarthritis, the cartilage thins out and may even wear away, leaving areas where bones rub directly against each other. As a result, the edges of the bones may thicken and form bony swellings called spurs (medically known as osteophytes). Stiffness and dull pain in the joints, with little or no inflammation, are generally the result. These are the typical symptoms of osteoarthritis. The weight-bearing joints (hips, knees, and spine) are most frequently involved in osteoarthritis. Other joints often affected are the finger joints closest to the tips of the fingers, which may develop bony knobs. The joint at the base of the thumb and the big-toe joint may also be affected. Osteoarthritis rarely affects the wrists, elbows, shoulders, ankles, or jaw. Although osteoarthritis may affect more than one joint at a time, the disease does not affect other systems or organs of the body. Osteoarthritis is considered a chronic disease, but it may not necessarily get progressively worse, and many people with the condition are relatively free of symptoms. Few people are severely disabled by the disease. While a breakdown of the cartilage in the joints is essentially the source of the symptoms of osteoarthritis, it is not always clear why this breakdown occurs. Most often, the thinning of the cartilage is attributed to years of wear and tear and the inability of the body to repair the resulting damage. Previous injury that causes inflammation in a joint can also make it more likely to be affected by osteoarthritis. Unusual stress on a joint, either through a repetitive activity -- such as typing or playing a sport -- or because of excess body weight, may bring about the changes associated with osteoarthritis, perhaps earlier than is typical. Some individuals are born with a misalignment of their joints that leaves them prone to osteoarthritis. And in some cases, there appears to be a genetic component. Diagnosing osteoarthritis can be difficult, partly because the disease's symptoms may be mistaken for those of other conditions, including injuries, muscle or spinal-disc problems, or even other forms of arthritis. X-rays and laboratory tests can help rule out other conditions. But perhaps the most valuable diagnostic tool available to doctors is the physical examination, including a medical history and a detailed discussion of the symptoms. To help your doctor make a diagnosis, be prepared to tell him or her which part of your body hurts; what the pain feels like, when it began, and how long it lasts; what, if anything, seems to trigger the pain or make it worse; when and if you have stiffness or other symptoms; what activities you may have trouble doing; and what, if anything, helps to relieve your pain. The best conventional treatment for osteo­arthritis generally involves prescribed exercises to keep the joints flexible, encourage nourishment of the cartilage, and strengthen the surrounding tissues; joint protection, often based on the suggestions of a physical or occupational therapist, to limit further damage; and, when necessary, both drug and nondrug measures to ease discomfort and decrease stiffness. Losing excess weight, eating a nutritionally balanced diet, and getting enough rest are also often part of the treatment prescription. As noted previously, it is the movement of a joint that forces oxygen and nutrients into the cartilage and removes waste products, thus helping to keep the cartilage healthy. When the pain and stiffness of arthritis set in, however, moving the affected joint is the last thing on many patients' minds. The tendency to limit the motion of an affected joint can actually aggravate the problem and may lead to even greater loss of mobility. While excessive or very strenuous activity may not be appropriate, gentle range-of-motion exercises can actually decrease stiffness and pain. Range-of-motion exercises are used to put a joint through the full range of its natural motion without excessive stress. They are essential to any treatment plan for arthritis. Your doctor or a physical therapist can show you appropriate exercises or recommend an exercise class designed for people with arthritis. Extremely important, too, is protecting arthritic joints from injury or excessive strain. This may boil down to simple techniques such as using your forearm, rather than your bent wrist and hand, to push open a door or placing heavy kitchen equipment on shelves at waist height. Increasing knowledge of the needs of people with arthritis has also led to an abundance of products designed to make daily tasks easier on painful joints. For example, forks, spoons, knives, and other utensils with soft, built-up handles that make gripping easier are now available in many grocery and department stores. Even if your joints aren't currently painful enough to affect your grasping ability, such joint-friendly devices can limit strain and may help prevent progression of symptoms. Additional measures to help ease the pain and stiffness of arthritis include heat and cold treatments. Hot showers or baths or heating pads may improve flexibility, especially before exercise or other physical activity. And cold packs can often help numb a particularly painful joint. If these measures don't give adequate pain relief, your doctor may recommend medication. Most often, it will be acetaminophen or a non­steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). Some NSAIDs, such as aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen sodium, are available over the counter. Stronger NSAIDs, such as sulindac, indomethacin, tolmetin sodium, and fenoprofen calcium, are available only by prescription. These medications can be quite effective in relieving joint pain. As with many other drugs, however, they can have some uncomfortable and even dangerous side effects, especially if you must take them on an ongoing basis. Aspirin and other NSAIDs, for example, may irritate the stomach lining and cause severe internal bleeding in some people. Taken in large amounts over the long term, they can also cause kidney and liver damage. Some research even suggests that these drugs may actually inhibit cartilage repair and increase the progression of the disease. The advent of COX-2 inhibitors, which are powerful inflammation-blocking drugs, seemed to herald a new era of treatment for people with arthritis. However, use of the drugs has been linked to increased risk of cardiovascular problems, including heart attacks and strokes, and most have been removed from the market. If medications don't work to relieve your symptoms, or if your disease is severe, your doctor may recommend surgery to ease your pain. There are two main types of operations for arthritis. The first is ""clean-up"" surgery to repair a damaged joint by removing debris, correcting a deformity, or fusing bones. In the second type of surgery, the arthritic joint is removed and replaced with an artificial one. Thousands of people with arthritis have undergone surgery to get relief. However, in one of the first-ever studies to compare arthroscopic ""clean-up"" surgery to fake (placebo) surgery, this procedure was found to be useless. According to the study, which was published in the in 2002, simply squirting fluid into the knee joint worked every bit as good as performing the usual ""clean-up"" procedure. Most doctors are now avoiding recommending this surgery to patients. And it's important to remember that all surgeries are difficult.

Glucosamine Sulfate stimulates connective tissue in a way that can help treat osteoarthritis. Glucosamine is a modified sugar molecule the body makes from glucose (blood sugar). Our bodies need glucosamine to function properly because glucosamine is a kind of building block for substances called mucopolysaccharides (MPSs), which are the major components of cartilage, bone, ligaments, nails, hair, and skin. Glucosamine stimulates connective tissue, encouraging it to repair itself. It is this property that makes glucosamine sulfate useful to treat osteoarthritis. Think of glucosamine as a security guard whose mission it is to protect the tiny biochemical factories in your body called chondrocytes. Found largely in joints, chondrocytes produce collagen and other substances and assemble them into cartilage. Normally, glucosamine is on the job to see that orders are filled. But if you have arthritis, your chondrocytes cannot produce enough glucosamine, and degeneration results. The chondrocytes begin to act as if they are under orders to destroy cartilage. And the ""factory"" just can't make enough new cartilage to replace what's lost. In severe joint damage, chondrocytes stop making glucosamine altogether. There are several types of glucosamine available for purchase, and the differences among them occur because of what is chemically bonded to the base molucule. The two forms you're most likely to see in stores are glucosamine sulfate and glucosamine hydrochloride. Only glucosamine sulfate has shown any consistent activity and efficacy when used to treat osteoarthritis. Although glucosamine hydrochloride is cheaper, it is ineffective and should not be used. There is considerable evidence that using glucosamine sulfate to treat osteoarthritis can prompt your body to flip a ""switch"" and convince the haywire chondrocytes to stop destroying cartilage -- and even begin to rebuild it. Just how glucosamine sulfate convinces chondrocytes to stopping running amok is unclear. What we do know from animal studies is that glucosamine sulfate works nothing like aspirin or other NSAIDs. Instead, it appears to function as a nutrient. Most of the initial research on glucosamine sulfate was conducted in Europe, where pharmaceutical companies were quick to realize the nutrient's importance in treating arthritis. In fact, glucosamine sulfate has become the arthritis treatment of choice for many European physicians, who turn to conventional drugs only when glucosamine sulfate proves to be ineffective. Throughout Portugal, for example, it's glucosamine sulfate you'll receive if your doctor hands you a diagnosis of arthritis. In 1982, more than 250 Portuguese doctors participated in a nationwide study to determine the supplement's effectiveness in treating arthritis. The physicians gave 1,506 osteoarthritis patients a daily dose of 1,500 milligrams of glucosamine sulfate for six to eight weeks. In another group, 1,077 arthritis sufferers were treated with NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen, or with corticosteroids. At the end of the trial, 95 percent of patients in the glucosamine group showed marked improvement, compared to 70 percent of patients in the NSAIDs group. Consequently, the Portuguese doctors, as a group, rated glucosamine a better arthritis treatment than standard drugs. In one of the best studies to date, 318 people in Spain who had osteoarthritis of the knee were randomly assigned to take glucosamine sulfate, acetaminophen, or placebo for six months. Those on the glucosamine sulfate regimen took 1,500 milligrams just once per day. Nevertheless, glucosamine sulfate was superior to acetaminophen and placebo at relieving the totality of symptoms and improving function. In another experiment, scientists at Vigevano General Hospital in Pavia, Italy, studied 80 arthritis patients for 30 days. The subjects, all in their 60s, were suffering from osteoarthritis of the neck, lumbar (lower) spine, or multiple joints -- conditions that doctors find most difficult to treat. Half the patients were given a daily dose of 1,500 milligrams of glucosamine sulfate; the other half got a sugar pill. At the end of the trial, 10 patients in the glucosamine sulfate group reported that their symptoms had disappeared. No one in the control group made such a claim. Buoyed by the results of such experiments, more and more researchers have been testing glucosamine sulfate. Researchers gave 24 patients with osteo­arthritis of the knee either 500 milligrams of glucosamine sulfate three times a day or a placebo. In six to eight weeks, those who received the supplement enjoyed significant reductions in pain, joint tenderness, and swelling. They reported no side effects. Eighty osteoarthritis patients suffering from pain, swelling, and restricted movement were given either glucosamine sulfate or a placebo. After three weeks, 73 percent of patients in the glucosamine group reported marked improvement of symptoms. Scientists biopsied (surgically removed and examined a small amount of tissue) cartilage taken from the glucosamine patients, moreover, and found that the tissue appeared far healthier than samples taken from the placebo group. Researchers at several clinics in Germany and Italy set out to determine the effectiveness of glucosamine sulfate. The test group was composed of 141 patients with osteoarthritis of the knee. One group received a placebo. The other got 1,500 milligrams a day of glucosamine sulfate. After four weeks, 55 percent of glucosamine-taking patients noted improvements, compared to 38 percent in the placebo group. Some osteoarthritis patients may benefit from taking glucosamine supplements in combination with other pain relief and treatments for osteoarthritis. Learn more on the next page.

Although glucosamine sulfate can be an effective natural treatment for osteoarthritis pain relief, it is not the only effective means of treating this condition. In fact, using glucosamine sulfate with other medications may be a good way of repairing joints, reducing pain and treating osteoarthritis. One of the first glucosamine sulfate studies compared the nutrient's effectiveness with that of conventional painkillers. In 1980, researchers at the First Medical Division in Venice, Italy, studied 30 elderly patients with advanced osteoarthritis. For three weeks, half the patients were given injections and pills of glucosamine sulfate; the other half received injections and pills of a standard painkiller. At the end of the trial, both groups reported significant decrease in joint pain and improvement in joint function. But after all treatments were stopped, the glucosamine subjects continued to note improvements. The control subjects did not. Four patients in the glucosamine-treated group, in fact, became symptom free, but none in the control group did. Thus, the researchers concluded, even in cases of severe degenerative joint disease, glucosamine sulfate reduces pain as well as painkilling pharmaceutical drugs. Two years later, researchers at St. John's Hospital in Oporto, Portugal, compared glucosamine sulfate to ibuprofen. For eight weeks, 40 patients with osteoarthritis of the knees took daily doses of either 1,500 milligrams of glucosamine or 1,200 milligrams of ibuprofen. In the first two weeks, ibuprofen seemed to relieve pain faster and better than glucosamine sulfate. But after two more weeks, no more improvements were reported by the ibuprofen camp. At the end of eight weeks, patients in the glucosamine group were reporting far less pain than those in the ibuprofen group and showed more significant improvements in joint function. Another study comparing the two drugs followed 200 patients with osteoarthritis of the knees for four weeks. As in the previous study, one group got 1,500 milligrams of glucosamine a day; the other received daily doses of 1,200 milligrams of ibuprofen. After one week, ibuprofen takers were feeling better than glucosamine patients. But by the second week, and notably by the fourth week, glucosamine patients said they felt just as good as ibuprofen patients. More important, researchers noted, 35 percent of people taking ibuprofen reported experiencing side effects, including nausea, itching, and fatigue. Only six percent of glucosamine patients reported mild stomach upset. Seven subjects had to stop taking ibuprofen because of toxicity; only one person in the glucosamine group had to pull out of the study. The researchers concluded that glucosamine sulfate was, in some ways, more effective than conventional pain relievers in treating osteoarthritis patients. But, they noted, it could take two to three weeks of glucosamine therapy before a patient noticed results. Glucosamine is found to some degree in most of the foods we eat, especially fish and meat. But no food is particularly rich in the nutrient, and most glucosamine appears to be destroyed by cooking. That means you need to take glucosamine supplements to achieve medical benefits. Glucosamine is available in three varieties: the previously discussed glucosamine sulfate and glucosamine hydrochloride, and N-acetylglucosamine (NAG). Some holistic practitioners insist that all three varieties of glucosamine are equally effective in relieving arthritis pain. This belief was largely found to be false with the publication of the Glucosamine/Chondroitin Arthritis Intervention Trial in the in 2006. This study of 1,583 people with osteoarthritis of the knee found that glucosamine hydrochloride was practically useless. When glucosamine hydrochloride was combined with chondroitin sulfate, there was some benefit for more serious osteoarthritis pain, but glucosamine hydrochloride by itself should not be used. Further testing of the other varieties as well as comparisons of glucosamine sulfate and NAG are needed in order to assess the benefits of NAG. Likewise, the usefulness of glucosamine sulfate preparations that also contain chondroitins is yet unclear. (Chondroitin is also produced by the body and helps cartilage retain fluid, keeping it spongy.) Nearly all the research has used glucosamine sulfate supplements alone, not in combination with chondroitins. A growing body of research suggests chondroitin sulfate is also effective, but it is still not as well-supported as glucosamine sulfate. For individuals who need to restrict their sodium intake, glucosamine sulfate is available in a potassium-bound form; look for glucosamine sulfate potassium chloride. A final important note is that even if you take glucosamine sulfate, it would be extremely wise to also take lifestyle steps to protect your joints. That means eating a nutritious diet, getting regular exercise and rest, keeping excess weight off, and, if possible, refraining from repetitive motions that put excessive stress on your joints. A review of two trials that have lasted three years found that overall, glucosamine sulfate does delay the worsening of osteoarthritis of the knee. These studies used X-rays to measure whether knees were deteriorating. Those participants who took 1,500 milligrams of glucosamine sulfate once a day had one-third to one-half the risk of worsening compared to those taking placebos. In one completed study, samples obtained by scanning electron microscopy showed that cartilage taken from subjects who had used glucosamine sulfate appeared healthy and young. No other treatment has been shown to prevent osteoarthritis from progressing. This puts glucosamine sulfate into a category by itself. Given its terrific safety record and the fact it's relatively inexpensive, people with osteoarthritis should definitely consider glucosamine sulfate when seeking treatment. If you suffer from arthritis, ask a holistically oriented physician whether glucosamine might help you. It's possible that you and your doctor can come up with a therapy to reduce your symptoms, and perhaps even reverse them, without the risk of dangerous side effects. Osteoarthritis can be a painful or even debilitating condition, but if you suffer from the symptoms of osteoarthritis, know that you are not alone -- and natural home remedies like glucosamine sulfate may be able to help.

Mayo Clinic Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences Mayo Clinic School of Continuous Professional Development Your doctor may ask you questions and conduct one or more of the following tests to determine whether you have carpal tunnel syndrome: Your doctor will review the pattern of your symptoms. For example, because the median nerve doesn't provide sensation to your little finger, symptoms in that finger may indicate a problem other than carpal tunnel syndrome. Carpal tunnel syndrome symptoms usually occur while holding a phone or a newspaper or gripping a steering wheel. They also tend to occur at night and may wake you during the night, or you may notice the numbness when you wake up in the morning. Your doctor will conduct a physical examination. He or she will test the feeling in your fingers and the strength of the muscles in your hand. Bending the wrist, tapping on the nerve or simply pressing on the nerve can trigger symptoms in many people. Some doctors recommend an X-ray of the affected wrist to exclude other causes of wrist pain, such as arthritis or a fracture. However, X-rays are not helpful in making a diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome. This test measures the tiny electrical discharges produced in muscles. During this test, your doctor inserts a thin-needle electrode into specific muscles to evaluate the electrical activity when muscles contract and rest. This test can identify damage to the muscles controlled by the median nerve, and also may rule out other conditions. In a variation of electromyography, two electrodes are taped to your skin. A small shock is passed through the median nerve to see if electrical impulses are slowed in the carpal tunnel. This test may be used to diagnose your condition and rule out other conditions. Our caring team of Mayo Clinic experts can help you with your carpal tunnel syndrome-related health concerns Treat carpal tunnel syndrome as early as possible after symptoms start. In the early stages, simple things that you can do for yourself may make the problem go away. For example: Other treatment options include wrist splinting, medications and surgery. Splinting and other conservative treatments are more likely to help if you've had only mild to moderate symptoms that come and go for less than 10 months. If you have numbness in your hands, you need to see a doctor. If the condition is diagnosed early, nonsurgical methods may help improve carpal tunnel syndrome, including: A splint that holds your wrist still while you sleep can help relieve nighttime symptoms of tingling and numbness. Even though you only wear the splint at night, it can also help prevent daytime symptoms. Nighttime splinting may be a good option if you're pregnant because it does not involve the use of any medications to be effective. , such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others), may help relieve pain from carpal tunnel syndrome in the short term. There isn't evidence, however, that these drugs improve carpal tunnel syndrome. Your doctor may inject your carpal tunnel with a corticosteroid such as cortisone to relieve pain. Sometimes your doctor uses an ultrasound to guide these injections. Corticosteroids decrease inflammation and swelling, which relieves pressure on the median nerve. Oral corticosteroids aren't considered as effective as corticosteroid injections for treating carpal tunnel syndrome. If carpal tunnel syndrome is caused by rheumatoid arthritis or another inflammatory arthritis, then treating the arthritis may reduce symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome. However, this is unproved. During carpal tunnel release, a surgeon makes an incision in the palm of your hand over the carpal tunnel ligament and cuts through the ligament to relieve pressure on the median nerve. The surgery may be done by making one incision on the palm side of the wrist, or by making several small incisions. Surgery may be appropriate if your symptoms are severe or don't respond to other treatments. The goal of carpal tunnel surgery is to relieve pressure by cutting the ligament pressing on the median nerve. The surgery may be performed with two different techniques: Your surgeon uses a telescope-like device with a tiny camera attached to it (endoscope) to see inside your carpal tunnel. Your surgeon cuts the ligament through one or two small incisions in your hand or wrist. Some surgeons may use ultrasound instead of a telescope to guide the tool that cuts the ligament. Endoscopic surgery may result in less pain than does open surgery in the first few days or weeks after surgery. Your surgeon makes an incision in the palm of your hand over the carpal tunnel and cuts through the ligament to free the nerve. Discuss the risks and benefits of each technique with your surgeon before surgery. Surgery risks may include: During the healing process after the surgery, the ligament tissues gradually grow back together while allowing more room for the nerve. This internal healing process typically takes several months, but the skin heals in a few weeks. Your doctor generally will encourage you to use your hand after the ligament has healed, gradually working back to normal use of your hand while initially avoiding forceful hand motions or extreme wrist positions. Soreness or weakness may take from several weeks to a few months to resolve after surgery. If your symptoms were very severe, symptoms may not go away completely after surgery. Carpal tunnel symptoms: Role of nonsurgical treatment Carpal tunnel syndrome surgery: Immediate and long-term results testing new treatments, interventions and tests as a means to prevent, detect, treat or manage this disease. Integrate alternative therapies into your treatment plan to help you cope with carpal tunnel syndrome. You may have to experiment to find a treatment that works for you. Always check with your doctor before trying any complementary or alternative treatment. Yoga postures designed for strengthening, stretching and balancing the upper body and joints may help reduce pain and improve grip strength. Early research suggests that certain physical and occupational hand therapy techniques may reduce symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome. High-intensity ultrasound can be used to raise the temperature of a targeted area of body tissue to reduce pain and promote healing. Research shows inconsistent results with this therapy, but a course of ultrasound therapy over several weeks may help reduce symptoms. Take short, frequent breaks from repetitive activities involving the use of your hands. Rotate your wrists and stretch your palms and fingers. Take a pain reliever, such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) or naproxen sodium (Aleve). Wear a snug, not tight, wrist splint at night. You can find these over-the-counter at most drugstores or pharmacies. If pain, numbness or weakness recurs and persists, see your doctor. Carpal tunnel exercises: Can they relieve symptoms? Here's some information to help you get ready for your appointment and what to expect from the doctor. Take note of when your symptoms are at their worst. Does any particular activity seem to make them worse, or do you notice them at a particular time of day? Keep track of the things you've tried to make the symptoms better. Write down the medications you've taken to manage your symptoms. If it's getting better, worse or staying the same. If there are certain activities that seem to cause it, make it worse or make it better. If you think you may have carpal tunnel syndrome, there are some simple things you can do before you see a doctor for the first time. First, try to determine whether any activities seem to make it worse, and change how you do those or avoid them if possible. For example, if driving seems to cause symptoms, try changing the position of your hands on the steering wheel. Also, although there is some cost involved, there is no harm in trying a wrist splint at night to see if that helps the symptoms. Carpal tunnel syndrome fact sheet.

e5cc26fd-bb87-47e2-9cc6-875996a72154,"— — Arthritis involves chronic inflammation of one or more joints in the body. (OA) is the most common type of arthritis. In people with OA, the cartilage in one or more joints deteriorates with time. Cartilage is a tough, rubbery substance. Normally, it protects the ends of bones and allows joints to move easily. When the cartilage degenerates, the smooth surfaces of bones in joints become pitted and rough. This causes pain in the joint and can irritate the surrounding tissues. Over time, the cartilage may wear away completely. Bones in the joint that rub together can cause severe pain. Some degradation of cartilage is part of the natural aging process. However, not everyone develops OA. The reasons one person develops the disease when someone similar does not is not well understood. Specific causes of OA may vary from person to person. Certain factors are known to increase the risk of OA. Some of these factors are beyond your control. However, you can reduce the risk of developing OA from damage caused by lifestyle factors such as: OA sometimes runs in families. If your parents or siblings have OA, you’re more likely to as well. Doctors don’t know why OA runs in families. No gene has yet been identified as the cause, but genes may contribute to OA risk. OA is directly connected to wear and tear on joints. It becomes more common as people get older. According to the , more than one third of adults over the age of 65 have symptoms of OA. OA can affect both men and women. According to the , it’s slightly more common in men until age 45. After that, it’s more common in women. This may reflect the different joint stressors experienced by men and women at different ages. People who have injured a joint are more likely to develop OA in that joint. Being overweight or obese puts increased stress and strain on the body. This increases the risk of OA in the joints. People who are overweight or obese are particularly susceptible to OA in the: However, obesity is also associated with OA in non-weight-bearing joints, such as those in the hands. This suggests that extra mechanical stress on the joints or weight alone may not increase OA risk. Repetitive actions can put undue stress on your joints, and occupations that require such repetitive actions can increase OA risk. Job tasks that fit this category might include: kneeling or squatting for more than an hour a day People who regularly participate in joint-intensive sports may also have an increased OA risk. Sitting or standing improperly can strain your joints. This can increase OA risk. Other types of arthritis can increase your risk of developing OA later in life. These include: Medical conditions that affect joint health can affect your risk for OA. For example, bleeding disorders can cause bleeding in the joints. Conditions that affect blood flow or inflammation can also affect risk. Some medical conditions associated with OA include: Not everyone with OA has symptoms all the time. Most people with OA have symptoms that come and go throughout the day. Certain common triggers for OA symptoms have been identified. However, specific triggers may vary from person to person. Staying still for too long can cause your joints to stiffen. This makes movement more likely to hurt. Lack of activity during the night may partially explain why OA pain is often worse when people wake up. Research has linked stress to exaggerated perceptions of pain. Changes in weather can worsen symptoms of OA. People with OA are often especially sensitive to cold, damp weather. — — Expert Q&A: Treatments for Osteoarthritis of the Knee Have questions about treatments, medications, and surgery for osteoarthritis?

These symptoms may be due to a common condition called carpal tunnel syndrome. What are the Risk Factors of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome? What Are The Treatment for Carpal Tunnel Syndrome? It is a nerve disorder affecting the strength and sensations in hand and wrist, caused by pressure on the median nerve. This nerve supplies all the four fingers except the small one (pinky finger) and a few muscles at the thumb’s base, which is due to the narrowing of the tunnel. According to studies, women and the elderly are more affected. If it is not treated correctly, then it might lead to various symptoms such as weakness and numbness of the muscles. Mostly, the symptoms develop gradually and have on-off characteristics. Once, it develops into a more severe form, in later stages, the symptoms are frequent and can represent as follows: Weak and clumsy hands that make it challenging to perform small day to day activities. Unable to hold things or often dropping them because of loss of proprioception or weakness. Pain. The pain might have different nature and intensity. However, few patients do not report pain at all. What are the Risk Factors of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome? Certain conditions make a person more susceptible to acquire this condition, and they are as follows: Repetitive movement of the hands: This may activate the tendons present in the wrist and cause swelling that leads to pressure on the nerve. I am suffering from extreme muscle weakness.What may be the reason? I have numbness in my left foot.What could have caused this? I feel numbness in penis. Is it due to nerve impingement? : Changes in the hormones may cause it. It is identified by some researchers that the pregnancy period is the most crucial one. An increase in the level of hormones might contribute to the unstable hormone levels. It might result in carpal tunnel syndrome. Gender: Women are more likely to be affected. Reports from the World Health organization show that men are affected too but in very few numbers. General health conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, and imbalance of thyroid hormones have known to be associated with this condition. Alcoholics. The habit of drinking alcohol might directly involve the median nerve. This might be very harmful to the patient. In the very few reported cases of carpal tunnel syndrome in males, the main reason was an addiction to alcohol. Tumor in the tunnel region that causes compression of the nerve. On visiting your doctor, the following diagnostic methods will be used, along with certain tests to conclude. The physical examination would be the best way for diagnosis. Gently tap or apply pressure in the median nerve area along with the inside region of the wrist and check for any numbness or tingling sensation. Extend or flex your wrist and look for any numbness. Checking the sensation in fingers with instruments and the patient’s eye closed. Any weakness might indicate carpal tunnel syndrome. But for the confirmatory part, the doctors will proceed with the other tests. They are: Electrophysiological Tests: This helps to identify the severity of the nerve damage or compression. It can diagnose any other nerve compression or condition if present. It helps to identify the nerve that is not conducting the signals and the severity, thus guiding the treatment as well. It also detects how fast the median nerve could transfer the impulse. While performing this procedure, many electrical node patches are attached to the skin. The nerve will be voluntarily stimulated for this study. As the name suggests, this measures the conduction of electricity in muscles and nerves. In medical terms, “myo” refers to muscles. The technology of electromyogram records the electrical activity of the skeletal muscles. It is a non-invasive procedure and is the best diagnostic tool. This checks for nerve compression via imaging the soft and hard tissues. Hence, you may be advised to go for a wrist ultrasound. A hand-wrist radiograph showing the arrangement bone will further help in diagnosis. Also, it can be used to rule out other conditions of bone. This might not be helpful in mild cases of carpal tunnel syndrome. Magnetic resonance imaging can be used to visualize the soft tissue in a more detailed way. In this, the patient is asked to rest elbows on the table and let the wrist fall freely for some time. Usually, the patients with this syndrome develop tingling or numbness in the fingers within 60 seconds: the earlier the symptom, the more severe the condition. What Are The Treatment for Carpal Tunnel Syndrome? It is always better to visit your doctor in the initial stages of the symptom to get better treatment and outcome. The management can be either conservative or surgical. Conservative or non-surgical management: When the symptoms are in the initial stages, the following might help and avoid any surgery needed. Lifestyle modification is needed. If the person is addicted to alcohol, they might refrain from the habit. Bracing or Splinting: Wearing them helps to relax the nerves and thus reduces the symptoms. They are preferred at night, but even during the morning, this can be worn. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are given to reduce pain like and Naproxen. Change in the activities that cause them pain or symptoms and giving rest to severe wrist movements. Exercises for Nerve Gliding: Certain exercises help relieve the nerve from the tunnel and can be followed under a doctor’s supervision and advice. Steroid Injections: Injecting these in the carpal tunnel will help relieve the symptoms temporarily. Surgical management: In case of severe symptoms of muscle weakness or damage, a surgical method is followed to relieve the nerve and is called a carpal tunnel release. This can be done either endoscopically or through conventional methods. After surgery, you will be asked to elevate your hand above the heart level and move fingers to avoid or reduce swelling and stiffness. There can be minor symptoms like pain, swelling for a few months, and it may take time to get your pinch and grip actions back entirely and effectively. You may also have to wear a brace or splint for quite some time (weeks). Though the symptoms may look initially not so bothersome, it is always advisable to consult your doctor to clear the doubts and get the necessary treatment as soon as possible. The availability of doctors online through some medical platforms has made consultations easy, and thus, you can get guided professionally.   This is a sponsored Ad. icliniq or icliniq doctors do not endorse the content in the Ad. What Will Happen If Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Is Not Treated? In the case of no treatment, carpal tunnel syndrome will lead to symptoms like numbness and weakness that could be mild, moderate, or even very severe. It might affect the routine activity of the affected individual. Adequate treatment and consultation with the physician are mandatory to prevent complications. Treating at an earlier stage is better. What Type of Jobs Can Cause Carpal Tunnel Syndrome? The following job people have a higher risk of Carpal tunnel syndrome, which involves repetitive hand movements, strong gripping, and mechanical stress in the palm. Assembly line worker. Sewer or knitter. Baker. Cashier. Hairstylist. Musician. What Are the Warning Signs of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome? The warning signs of carpal tunnel syndrome are a pain that radiates from the hand towards the shoulder. Secondly, a pain that is more severe on the thumb side of the hand. An untrue feeling of having shocked near the thumb and fingers near the thumb. Numbness, tingling, weakness can also be other presenting warning signs in a patient affected by carpal tunnel syndrome. Which Nerve Is Compressed in Carpal Tunnel Syndrome? Carpal tunnel syndrome occurs due to the compression of the median nerve in the wrist. This would lead to ischemia of the wrist that can further lead to symptoms like numbness, weakness, and tingling sensation of the hand and wrist. It most commonly presents with pain in and around the wrist region. You should contact your doctor if you have severe discomfort and pain. The surgery indicated for carpal tunnel syndrome is carpal tunnel release surgery. During the treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome, the transverse carpal ligament is cut, which was initially causing pressure on the median nerve, and this surgery would involve a cut or incision from the base of the palm. Non-surgical treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome is possible at the initial stages of the syndrome that would include wrist splints that can be used to limit the movement of the hands, especially during sleeping. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can be used to help with pain and inflammation. Corticosteroids can be used to treat patients with inflammation, and this group of drugs also aids in relieving pressure over the affected median nerve. The ways to overcome carpal tunnel syndrome: Rest to hands and wrist or restricting movements to the hand Wear splints. Grip losing exercises. Warm compress. Mild stretch. Elevating hands. Painkillers. Fetal position during sleeping has to be avoided in all means and ways. To avoid sleeping in a fetal position, one can choose a pillow hugging method of sleeping. Wrist splints can be worn during sleeping to avoid movements making sure the splint does not compress much. For more clarification on this, get help from our experts at icliniq.com. Carpal tunnel syndrome initially presents as pain and swelling, mild numbness, weakness, and tingling, which confuses with many other disease presentations. However, on a thorough and focused physical examination, carpal tunnel syndrome can be elicited. Over the counter pain medications, warm compress over the wrist and hand, wearing splints and attempting to perform mild wrist stretching exercises are the various methods to relieve pain from carpal tunnel syndrome. On having the symptoms of weakness, numbness, pain, tingling sensation, and most importantly, considering your work nature and routine activities, we can conclude that it might be carpal tunnel syndrome. But if you need to confirm the condition, then you should consult your doctor. The normal carpal tunnel syndrome is not a serious disorder to be feared off, especially if proper medical care is given there is no need for worrying. Complications occur only if it is left untreated. The tendons and ligaments start getting affected in the later stages. Carpal tunnel syndrome rarely goes away by itself. You should consider taking proper treatment for this. With medical treatment, it does not usually recur. Also, the treatment does not leave behind any lifetime defects in the hand and wrist of the affected patient. The patient should perform a series of physiotherapy exercises to heal naturally. It is possible to fix the syndrome naturally only if the effect or severity of the syndrome is way less. Once the median nerve is severely compromised, natural remedies do not usually help. Many people may proceed to their usual workouts with prescribed medical braces, but however to be on the safer side, patients are instructed to avoid wrist gripping exercises like weight lifting and pull-ups and pushups. It would be better if exercises are avoided completely until full cure and recovery of the disease are achieved. Adequate medical care and treatment is the only way to stop the progress of the disease. The other way of treating the disease from progressing is avoiding the activities that aggravate carpal tunnel syndrome. Do not involve in physical activities. It is a procedure done under anesthesia. So, usually, it is not painful. However, the pain might be present post-surgically. The degree of pain is also related to the cause of the syndrome. If it is only due to repetitive movements, the pain is quite less, but if it is due to any trauma and associated other injuries, the pain could be worse and severe. Can You Get Permanent Nerve Damage From Carpal Tunnel? Yes, it is possible that you might get nerve damage. If left untreated carpal tunnel syndrome might lead to permanent injury to the nerve, it might cause ischemia that might lead to necrosis, so treatment is mandatory to prevent permanent damage to the median nerve. https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000433.htm https://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/patient-caregiver-education/fact-sheets/carpal-tunnel-syndrome-fact-sheethttps://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/patient-caregiver-education/fact-sheets/carpal-tunnel-syndrome-fact-sheet Comprehensive Medical Second Opinion.

0c2a171b-3099-4826-933c-71c39814887c,"— — Osteoarthritis (OA) affects of adults over the age of 65. A significant fraction of younger adults also suffer from OA symptoms. OA occurs when cartilage begins to break down from age or heavy use. Cartilage normally covers the ends of bones and allows them to move freely against each other. The degeneration of cartilage exposes the bones of the joint and allows bone on bone contact. This can cause: Osteoarthritis can affect any joint in your body, but the most commonly affected areas are: Not all joint pain and stiffness is caused by OA. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) can cause similar pain, but there are a number of physical symptoms that differentiate RA, an inflammatory disease, from OA. One readily visible difference is that RA, unlike OA, is typically symmetrical. If it affects a joint on one side of the body, it will generally affect the same joint on the other. The symptoms of OA vary from person to person. Some people may only have mild pain and swelling. Others may experience joint damage that significantly affects their quality of life. OA of the knees, in particular, is a major cause of disability in the United States. For most people with OA, stiffness is worse in the mornings. It is usually also worse after periods of inactivity or rest. At these times, joints may feel: Soreness and aching pain are common symptoms of OA. Muscle pain can also occur in the surrounding tissue. Usually, pain, like stiffness, is most intense after sleep or a period of inactivity. Some people with OA feel more pain during movement of the joints and less pain when at rest. Over time, the pain may occur even when the joints are not used. Joint tenderness, sensitivity of the joints to touch, can also occur in people with OA. pinched nerves caused by swelling and displacement of joint tissue Swelling is more common in people with RA than OA. However, people with OA also experience swelling. Swelling is the body’s reaction to irritants, such as bone on bone contact. It contributes to the stiffness and pain experienced by patients with OA. According to the , about 80 percent of people with OA have some problem with range of motion. About 25 percent need assistance with daily living activities. They may need help with: Bone spurs are small bony projections. They can occur naturally, but they may also be a response to inflammation in a joint. Bone spurs, also called osteophytes, can sometime be felt as hard little lumps around joints affected by OA. They are not painful in and of themselves. However, bone spurs can rub against nearby nerve and bone, causing additional pain. People with OA often have to exert extra physical effort in order to carry out the basic daily tasks of living. This can cause fatigue. Inflammation is caused by chemical mediators called cytokines. They can also cause fatigue. Many people with OA hear sounds in their joints when they move. Their joints may make noises such as: These noises are often accompanied by discomfort or pain. People who suffer from OA are at an increased risk for anxiety and depression. Chronic pain from OA can cause a great deal of stress, as can the disability that often results from OA. Having healthy coping mechanisms in place can reduce the risk of depression and anxiety. Fever is not generally a symptom of OA. However, extensive inflammation can cause a low-grade fever. OA may negatively impact your quality of life. However, it is usually not a disease that requires urgent or emergency action. That said, not all joint pain is caused by OA. Joint pain can also be caused by other, serious health problems.

The condition is an inflammation. It occurs when the cartilage that cushions the joints wears away. Cartilage is a buffer of sorts that lets your joints move smoothly. When cartilage begins to break down, your bones end up rubbing together when you move. The friction causes: Many of the causes of osteoarthritis are out of your control. But you can make lifestyle changes to reduce your risk of developing OA. Arthritis is a common joint problem usually associated with older adults. According to the , most people show symptoms of osteoarthritis by the time they are 70 years old. But OA isn’t restricted to older adults. Younger adults can also experience symptoms that may signify OA, including: Younger people are more likely to develop arthritis as a direct result of a trauma. OA tends to run in the family, especially if you have genetic joint defects. You’re more likely to suffer from OA symptoms if your parents, grandparents, or siblings have the condition. If your relatives have symptoms of joint pain, get the details before making a doctor’s appointment. Diagnosis of arthritis relies heavily on medical history as well as a physical examination. Learning about your family’s health history can help your doctor come up with an appropriate treatment plan for you. Gender also plays a role in osteoarthritis. Overall, more women than men develop the progressive symptoms of OA. The two sexes are on equal ground: roughly the same amount of each gender is affected by arthritis, until around age 55, according to the . After that, women are more likely to have OA than men of the same age. The trauma of a sports injury can cause osteoarthritis in adults of any age. Common injuries that may lead to OA include: Sports-related knee trauma, such as anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) strains and tears, are particularly problematic. They’ve been linked to an increased risk of later developing OA, according to research published in . In some cases, what you do for a living (or a hobby) could lead to arthritis. OA is sometimes referred to as a “wear and tear” disease. Repetitive strain in your joints can cause the cartilage to wear down prematurely. People who perform certain activities in their jobs for hours at a time may be more likely to develop joint pain and stiffness. This includes: The joints that are commonly affected by occupation-related OA include: Osteoarthritis affects people of all ages, genders, and sizes. However, your risk for developing the condition increases if you’re overweight. Excess body weight places additional stress on your joints, especially your: OA can also cause cartilage damage, the hallmark of the condition. If you’re concerned about your risk, or already feeling joint pain, talk to your doctor about an appropriate weight loss plan. Medical conditions that involve bleeding near a joint can cause osteoarthritis to become worse or new symptoms to develop. People with the bleeding disorder or avascular necrosis — the death of bone tissue due to a lack of blood supply — could also experience symptoms associated with OA. You’re also more at risk for OA if you have other forms of arthritis, such as gout or rheumatoid arthritis. Osteoarthritis is a chronic and progressive medical condition. Most people find that their symptoms increase over time. Although OA doesn’t have a cure, there are different treatments available to ease your pain and maintain your mobility. Make an appointment with your doctor as soon as you suspect you might have arthritis.

e23d0c1f-3829-45be-9425-175904ad8085,"Information about the 2019 Novel Coronavirus. Información sobre el coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). Carpal tunnel release is a surgery used to treat and potentially heal the painful condition known as carpal tunnel syndrome. Healthcare providers used to think that carpal tunnel syndrome was caused by an overuse injury or a repetitive motion done by the wrist or hand, often at work. They now know that it’s most likely a congenital predisposition (something that runs in families) – some people simply have smaller carpal tunnels than others. Carpal tunnel syndrome can also be caused by injury, such as a sprain or fracture, or repetitive use of a vibrating tool. It's also been linked to pregnancy, diabetes, thyroid disease, and rheumatoid arthritis. The median nerve and tendons that allow your fingers to move pass through a narrow passageway in the wrist called the carpal tunnel. The carpal tunnel is formed by the wrist bones on the bottom and the transverse carpal ligament across the top (or inside) of the wrist. When this part of the body is injured or tight, swelling of the tissues within the tunnel can press on the median nerve. This causes numbness and tingling of the hand, pain, and loss of function if not treated. Symptoms usually start slowly, and may get worse over time. They tend to be worse on the thumb side of the hand. It is not uncommon for a person to have carpal tunnel in both hands. During a carpal tunnel release, a surgeon cuts through the ligament that is pressing down on the carpal tunnel. This makes more room for the median nerve and tendons passing through the tunnel. It usually improves pain and function. A diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome is about the only reason to have a carpal tunnel surgery. And even then, your healthcare provider will likely want you to try nonsurgical treatments first. These may include: Shots of steroids in the wrist to help ease swelling and pain The reasons that a healthcare provider would recommend a carpal tunnel release surgery may include: The nonsurgical interventions for carpal tunnel syndrome don’t relieve the pain. The healthcare provider performs an electromyography and nerve conduction test of the median nerve and determines that you have carpal tunnel syndrome. The muscles of the hands or wrists are weak and actually getting smaller because of the severe pinching of the median nerve. The symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome have lasted a prolonged period of time with no relief. What are the risks of carpal tunnel release surgery? As with most surgeries, carpal tunnel release is not without its risks. Your wrist will be made numb and you may be given medicine to make you sleepy and not feel pain (called local anesthesia) for the procedure. In some cases, general anesthesia is used. This is when medicines are used to put you into a deep sleep during surgery. Anesthesia poses risks for some people. Other potential risks of a carpal tunnel release surgery include: Injury to the median nerve or nerves that branch out from it The recovery from carpal tunnel surgery takes time – anywhere from several weeks to several months. If the nerve has been compressed for a long period of time, recovery may take even longer. Recovery involves splinting your wrist and getting physical therapy to strengthen and heal the wrist and hand. There may be other risks, depending on your specific medical condition. Talk about any concerns with your healthcare provider before the procedure. How do I get ready for carpal tunnel release surgery? Tell your healthcare provider about all medicines you are currently taking, including over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, herbs, and supplements. You will probably need to stop taking any medicines that make it harder for the blood to clot, such as ibuprofen, aspirin, or naproxen. If you’re a smoker, try to quit before the surgery. Smoking can delay healing. You may need to get blood tests or an electrocardiogram (ECG) before surgery. You will usually be asked not to eat or drink anything for 6 to 12 hours before the surgery. Based on your medical condition, your healthcare provider may request other specific preparations. What happens during carpal tunnel release surgery? Carpal tunnel release is usually an outpatient procedure. That means that you can go home the same day as the surgery if all goes well. There are 2 types of carpal tunnel release surgery. The traditional method is the open release, in which the surgeon cuts open the wrist to do the surgery. The other method is endoscopic carpal tunnel release. During this surgery, a thin, flexible tube that contains a camera is put into the wrist through a tiny incision (cut). The camera guides the healthcare provider as the surgery is done with thin tools put into the wrist through another small cut. In either case, here is the general steps in a carpal tunnel release surgery: You will usually be asked to remove your clothing, or at least your shirt, and put on a hospital gown. Typically, local anesthetic is used for this procedure to numb the hand and wrist. In an open release surgery, the surgeon cuts about a 2-inch incision on the wrist. Then he or she uses common surgical instruments to cut the carpal ligament and enlarge the carpal tunnel. In an endoscopic carpal tunnel release, the surgeon makes 2 half-inch incisions. One is on the wrist, and one is on the palm. Then he or she inserts a camera attached to a narrow tube into one incision. The camera guides your surgeon as he or she inserts the instruments and cuts the carpal ligament through the other incision. The surgeon will stitch up the incision or incisions. Your hand and wrist will be placed in a splint or bandaged heavily to keep you from moving your wrist. Once the surgery is done, you’ll be monitored for a short time, and then allowed to go home. Only in rare cases or when there are complications is an overnight stay needed for a carpal tunnel release surgery. What happens after carpal tunnel release surgery? Your wrist will likely be in a heavy bandage or a splint for 1 to 2 weeks. Healthcare providers usually schedule another appointment to remove the bandage or splint. During this time, you may be encouraged to move your fingers to help prevent stiffness. You’ll probably have pain in your hand and wrist after surgery. It’s usually controlled with pain medicines taken by mouth. The surgeon may also have you keep the affected hand elevated while sleeping at night to help decrease swelling. Once the splint is removed, you will likely begin a physical therapy program. The physical therapist will teach you motion exercises to improve the movement of your wrist and hand. These exercises will speed healing and strengthen the area. You may still need to sometimes use a splint or brace for a month or so after surgery. The recovery period can take anywhere from a few days to a few months. In the meantime, you may need to adjust job duties or even take time off from work while you heal. Your healthcare provider will talk to you about activity restrictions you should follow after surgery. Let your healthcare provider know about any of the following: Redness, swelling, bleeding, or other drainage from the incision These problems may need to be treated. Talk to your healthcare provider about what you should expect and what problems mean you need to see your healthcare provider right away. Before you agree to the test or the procedure make sure you know: What the possible side effects or complications are When and where you are to have the test or procedure Who will do the test or procedure and what that person’s qualifications are What would happen if you did not have the test or procedure Any alternative tests or procedures to think about Who to call after the test or procedure if you have questions or problems How much you will have to pay for the test or procedure",121,numb fingers arthritis,-11.560615539550781,133

The most common complaint regarding of the lower spine, also known as is frequent and unrelenting lower back pain. In general, osteoarthritis is the result of deterioration of the cartilage in your joints. Cartilage deterioration occurs due to years of wear and tear, which results in your bones rubbing together, causing joint pain and swelling [source: ]. Osteoarthritis can occur in all the joints throughout your body. Osteoarthritis of the spine, in particular, is the deterioration of cartilage between the facet joints or discs in your spine [source: ]. The friction between your spinal discs causes inflammation and pain. Typically, pain related to of the lower spine is also felt in the neck region [source: ]. Other common symptoms of osteoarthritis of the lower spine include decreased mobility and flexibility of the back. Bone spurs, which are small bone growths on the spine, can also cause pitching of spinal nerves, known as spinal stenosis [source: ]. This nerve pitching can result in numbness, tingling and a weakening sensation in the legs [source: ]. Keep in mind that these symptoms are common for a variety of different spine-related health concerns, so it's best to consult your doctor if you experience constant back pain or back stiffness. It's also important to note that mild osteoarthritis of the lower spine is a natural part of aging. Almost everyone in older age experiences some lower back pain as a result of osteoarthritis. Sometimes, these mild symptoms are little cause for concern. In fact, you start developing early signs of osteoarthritis of the spine in your thirties. Other risk factors, besides age, include gender (men are more likely to have osteoarthritis before 45, women are more likely to experience osteoarthritis after 45), genetics, obesity and other preexisting conditions, such as diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis [source: ]. Is it easy to cope with mild osteoarthritis of the spine? Can you get arthritis from cracking your knuckles? How do you cope with multi-level degenerative osteoarthritis?

2b4a52cb-b1d9-4f8a-bf71-c12fca6b0ff7,"Is Arthritis Hereditary? Genes & Causes Responsible for Arthritis Can your genes put you at risk for developing arthritis? If you have a family history of arthritis, you may feel concern about the possibility of a to this chronic illness. Watching family members struggle with symptoms such as inflammation, pain, stiffness and loss of mobility is enough to make anyone worry about what the future may hold. But is there any necessity for such concern? Arthritis is often classified into three main categories, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis and gout.1 The causes of osteoarthritis are usually summed up as ‘wear and tear’ but ‘wear and repair’ is closer to what actually takes place in the disorder.2 Rheumatoid arthritis, however, is an inflammatory disorder of the immune response, resulting in inflammation of the joint linings and tendons and other symptoms including fatigue.3 Can your genes put you at risk for developing arthritis? But how concerned should you be if there is a history of arthritis in your immediate or extended family? Is your genetic history your destiny? Is the grinding of the machinery of transcription and translation inexorable? Not automatically, it seems: certain genes may ‘increase the likelihood’ of developing rheumatoid arthritis, but do not have complete penetrance i.e. possession of a particular gene does not automatically mean you will develop RA.3 How much of a factor is genetics in arthritis? Rheumatoid arthritis is believed to have a strong genetic component and ‘does seem to run in families’.3 Official documentation from the UK National Health Service gives a percentage of 40-60% of certain types of osteoarthritis having a genetic component2, while possession of two copies of a particular gene is described as resulting in ‘a 60% increased risk for RA’.4 It seems that more than one is involved in the transmission of RA.3 If genetic history is in fact significant in the development of arthritis, can other factors ameliorate or aggravate the course of the disease? Nutritional supplements such as chondroitin have been used as complementary treatments by some people.5 Exercise is important for osteoarthritis, especially after surgery,1 while alternative and complementary therapies including massage, acupuncture and hydrotherapy have their proponents.5 Obesity on the other hand may aggravate osteoarthritis.2 Are treatments for arthritis affected by suggestions of a genetic component? Gene therapy for RA was recently described as in the early stages regarding human trials7, while a January 2009 article in reviewed ‘the first clinical evidence’ of positive results of gene therapy for RA in humans.8 It has been described as ‘too early to say’ whether the Stat4 genetic pathway might reveal significant new avenues for RA treatment.4 Even if your genes may put you at increased risk of arthritis, is there anything you can do to improve an existing condition or reduce your risk of developing it in the first place? Rapid treatment of arthritis soon after onset of the disease is very important and may reduce the damage resulting from disease progression.5 Treatments fall into the categories of analgesics, NSAIDS (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), DMARDS (disease-modifying, anti-rheumatic drugs), biologicals and corticosteroids.3 What testing is available to determine the presence of arthritis? There is no infallible test: instead a ‘clinical diagnosis’ is made on the basis of a patient’s symptoms and history. Blood tests and X-rays may assist with this process.3 Focussing on treatments, tactics and lifestyle choices – i.e. effective disease management, may be more useful than anxiety about what your genes may have in store regarding arthritic conditions. 1 NHS Choices. “Treating Joint Pain”. 03/03/2008 (15/08/2009) https://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Pain/Pages/Jointpain.aspx2 NHS Choices. “Causes of osteoarthritis.” 03/08/2009 (15/08/2009) https://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Osteoarthritis/Pages/Causes.aspx3 Arthritis Research Campaign. “Rheumatoid Arthritis.” June 2006 (15/08/2009) https://www.arc.org.uk/arthinfo/patpubs/6033/6033.asp4 Remmers E, et al. “STAT4 and the risk of rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus.” NEJM 2007;357(10):13-22.5 NHS Choices “Treating arthritis.”. 05/08/2008 (15/08/2009) https://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Arthritis/Pages/Treatment.aspx 6 Evans‌, C.H., & PD Robbins‌ “Gene therapy for arthritis.“ Expert Opinion on Investigational Drugs July 1997, Vol. 6, No. 7, Pages 837-840 7 James M Woods, Yasmin Sitabkhan, Alisa E Koch “Gene therapy for rheumatoid arthritis: recent advances.” Current gene therapy. 01/03/2008; 8(1):24-41.8 Prescott, B. “Gene therapy demonstrates benefit in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.” 26/01/2009.

e9d09c07-3860-45c5-80c7-b0507b9eac76,"from the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons from the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons English español Therapeutic Exercise Program for Carpal Tunnel Syndrome In some areas, nonessential orthopaedic procedures that were postponed due to COVID-19 are now resuming. For information:  Questions and Answers for Patients Regarding Elective Surgery and COVID-19. For patients whose procedures have not yet been rescheduled:  What to Do If Your Orthopaedic Surgery Is Postponed. Carpal tunnel syndrome is a common condition that causes pain, numbness, and tingling in the hand and arm. The condition occurs when one of the major nerves to the hand — the median nerve — is squeezed or compressed as it travels through the wrist.  In most patients, carpal tunnel syndrome gets worse over time, so early diagnosis and treatment are important. Early on, symptoms can often be relieved with simple measures like wearing a wrist splint or avoiding certain activities. If pressure on the median nerve continues, however, it can lead to nerve damage and worsening symptoms. To prevent permanent damage, surgery to take pressure off the median nerve may be recommended for some patients. The carpal tunnel is a narrow passageway in the wrist, about an inch wide. The floor and sides of the tunnel are formed by small wrist bones called carpal bones. The carpal tunnel protects the median nerve and flexor tendons that bend the fingers and thumb. Reproduced and adapted from Rodner C, Raissis A, Akelman E: Carpal tunnel syndrome. Orthopaedic Knowledge Online Journal. Rosemont, IL, American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, 2009; 7(5). Accessed March 2016. The roof of the tunnel is a strong band of connective tissue called the transverse carpal ligament. Because these boundaries are very rigid, the carpal tunnel has little capacity to ""stretch"" or increase in size. The median nerve is one of the main nerves in the hand. It originates as a group of nerve roots in the neck. These roots come together to form a single nerve in the arm. The median nerve goes down the arm and forearm, passes through the carpal tunnel at the wrist, and goes into the hand. The nerve provides feeling in the thumb and index, middle, and ring fingers. The nerve also controls the muscles around the base of the thumb. The nine tendons that bend the fingers and thumb also travel through the carpal tunnel. These tendons are called flexor tendons. Therapeutic Exercise Program for Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Carpal tunnel syndrome occurs when the tunnel becomes narrowed or when tissues surrounding the flexor tendons swell, putting pressure on the median nerve. These tissues are called the synovium. Normally, the synovium lubricates the tendons, making it easier to move your fingers. Carpal tunnel syndrome is caused by pressure on the median nerve as it travels through the carpal tunnel. When the synovium swells, it takes up space in the carpal tunnel and, over time, crowds the nerve. This abnormal pressure on the nerve can result in pain, numbness, tingling, and weakness in the hand.  Most cases of carpal tunnel syndrome are caused by a combination of factors. Studies show that women and older people are more likely to develop the condition. Other risk factors for carpal tunnel syndrome include: This is likely an important factor. The carpal tunnel may be smaller in some people or there may be anatomic differences that change the amount of space for the nerve—and these traits can run in families. Repeating the same hand and wrist motions or activities over a prolonged period of time may aggravate the tendons in the wrist, causing swelling that puts pressure on the nerve. Doing activities that involve extreme flexion or extension of the hand and wrist for a prolonged period of time can increase pressure on the nerve. Hormonal changes during pregnancy can cause swelling. Diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and thyroid gland imbalance are conditions that are associated with carpal tunnel syndrome. Numbness, tingling, burning, and pain—primarily in the thumb and index, middle, and ring fingers Occasional shock-like sensations that radiate to the thumb and index, middle, and ring fingers Pain or tingling that may travel up the forearm toward the shoulder Weakness and clumsiness in the hand—this may make it difficult to perform fine movements such as buttoning your clothes Dropping things—due to weakness, numbness, or a loss of proprioception (awareness of where your hand is in space) In most cases, the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome begin gradually—without a specific injury. Many patients find that their symptoms come and go at first. However, as the condition worsens, symptoms may occur more frequently or may persist for longer periods of time. Night-time symptoms are very common. Because many people sleep with their wrists bent, symptoms may awaken you from sleep. During the day, symptoms often occur when holding something for a prolonged period of time with the wrist bent forward or backward, such as when using a phone, driving, or reading a book. Many patients find that moving or shaking their hands helps relieve their symptoms. During your evaluation, your doctor will talk to you about your general health and medical history and will ask about your symptoms. He or she will carefully examine your hand and wrist and perform a number of physical tests. During these tests, your doctor will: Press down or tap along the median nerve at inside of your wrist to see if it causes any numbness or tingling in your fingers (Tinel sign) Bend and hold your wrists in a flexed position to test for numbness or tingling in your hands Test sensitivity in your fingertips and hands by lightly touching them with a special instrument when your eyes are closed. Check for weakness in the muscles around the base of your thumb Look for atrophy in the muscles around the base of your thumb. In severe cases, these muscles may become visibly smaller. To perform Tinel's test for nerve damage, your doctor will tap on the inside of your wrist over the median nerve. Reproduced from JF Sarwark, ed: Essentials of Musculoskeletal Care, ed 4. Rosemont, IL, American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, 2010. These tests will help your doctor measure how well your median nerve is working and help determine whether there is too much pressure on the nerve. The tests will also help your doctor determine whether you have another nerve condition, such as neuropathy, or other sites of nerve compression that might be contributing to your symptoms. Close up of an EMG being performed with a nerve conduction study. These tests measure the signals travelling in the nerves of your hand and arm and can detect when a nerve is not conducting its signal effectively. Nerve conduction studies can help your doctor determine how severe your problem is and help to guide treatment. An EMG measures the electrical activity in muscles. EMG results can show whether you have any nerve or muscle damage. An ultrasound uses high-frequency sound waves to help create pictures of bone and tissue. Your doctor may recommend an ultrasound of your wrist to evaluate the median nerve for signs of compression. X-rays provide images of dense structures, such as bone. If you have limited wrist motion or wrist pain, your doctor may order x-rays to exclude other causes for your symptoms, such as arthritis, ligament injury, or a fracture. These studies provide better images of the body's soft tissues. Your doctor may order an MRI to help determine other causes for your symptoms or to look for abnormal tissues that could be impacting the median nerve. An MRI can also help your doctor determine if there are problems with the nerve itself—such as scarring from an injury or tumor. Although it is a gradual process, for most people carpal tunnel syndrome will worsen over time without some form of treatment. For this reason, it is important to be evaluated and diagnosed by your doctor early on. In the early stages, it may be possible to slow or stop the progression of the disease. If diagnosed and treated early, the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome can often be relieved without surgery. If your diagnosis is uncertain or if your symptoms are mild, your doctor will recommend nonsurgical treatment first. Wearing a splint or brace reduces pressure on the median nerve by keeping your wrist straight. Wearing a brace or splint at night will keep you from bending your wrist while you sleep. Keeping your wrist in a straight or neutral position reduces pressure on the nerve in the carpal tunnel. It may also help to wear a splint during the day when doing activities that aggravate your symptoms. Medications such as ibuprofen and naproxen can help relieve pain and inflammation. Symptoms often occur when your hand and wrist are in the same position for too long—particularly when your wrist is flexed or extended. If your job or recreational activities aggravate your symptoms, changing or modifying these activities can help slow or stop progression of the disease. In some cases, this may involve making changes to your work site or work station. A steroid injection into the carpal tunnel may relieve symptoms for a period of time. Some patients may benefit from exercises that help the median nerve move more freely within the confines of the carpal tunnel. Specific exercises may be recommended by your doctor or therapist. Corticosteroid, or cortisone, is a powerful anti-inflammatory agent that can be injected into the carpal tunnel. Although these injections often relieve painful symptoms or help to calm a flare up of symptoms, their effect is sometimes only temporary. A cortisone injection may also be used by your doctor to help diagnose your carpal tunnel syndrome. If nonsurgical treatment does not relieve your symptoms after a period of time, your doctor may recommend surgery. The decision whether to have surgery is based on the severity of your symptoms—how much pain and numbness you are having in your hand. In long-standing cases with constant numbness and wasting of your thumb muscles, surgery may be recommended to prevent irreversible damage. The surgical procedure performed for carpal tunnel syndrome is called a ""carpal tunnel release."" There are two different surgical techniques for doing this, but the goal of both is to relieve pressure on your median nerve by cutting the ligament that forms the roof of the tunnel. This increases the size of the tunnel and decreases pressure on the median nerve. The transverse carpal ligament is cut during carpal tunnel release surgery. When the ligament heals, there is more room for the nerve and tendons. In most cases, carpal tunnel surgery is done on an outpatient basis. The surgery can be done under general anesthesia, which puts you to sleep, or under local anesthesia, which numbs just your hand and arm. In some cases, you will also be given a light sedative through an intravenous (IV) line inserted into a vein in your arm. In open surgery, your doctor makes a small incision in the palm of your hand and views the inside of your hand and wrist through this incision. During the procedure, your doctor will divide the transverse carpal ligament (the roof of the carpal tunnel). This increases the size of the tunnel and decreases pressure on the median nerve. After surgery, the ligament may gradually grow back together—but there will be more space in the carpal tunnel and pressure on the median nerve will be relieved. In endoscopic surgery, your doctor makes one or two smaller skin incisions—called portals—and uses a miniature camera—an endoscope—to see inside your hand and wrist. A special knife is used to divide the transverse carpal ligament, similar to the open carpal tunnel release procedure. Here, an endoscope is inserted through a portal in the patient's wrist. A cutting instrument will be inserted in the palm. The outcomes of open surgery and endoscopic surgery are similar. There are benefits and potential risks associated with both techniques. Your doctor will talk with you about which surgical technique is best for you. Immediately following surgery, you will be encouraged to elevate your hand above your heart and move your fingers to reduce swelling and prevent stiffness. You should expect some pain, swelling, and stiffness after your procedure. Minor soreness in your palm may last for several weeks to several months. Grip and pinch strength usually return by about 2 to 3 months after surgery. If the condition of your median nerve was poor before surgery, however, grip and pinch strength may not improve for about 6 to 12 months. You may have to wear a splint or wrist brace for several weeks. You will, however, be allowed to use your hand for light activities, taking care to avoid significant discomfort. Driving, self-care activities, and light lifting and gripping may be permitted soon after surgery. Your doctor will talk with you about when you will be able to return to work and whether you will have any restrictions on your work activities. Although complications are possible with any surgery, your doctor will take steps to minimize the risks. The most common complications of carpal tunnel release surgery include: For most patients, surgery will improve the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome. Recovery, however, may be gradual and complete recovery may take up to a year. If you have significant pain and weakness for more than 2 months, your doctor may refer you to a hand therapist who can help you maximize your recovery. If you have another condition that causes pain or stiffness in your hand or wrist, such as arthritis or tendonitis, it may slow your overall recovery.

For these patients, a complete recovery may not be possible. Occasionally, carpal tunnel syndrome can recur, although this is rare. If this happens, you may need additional treatment or surgery.

Short term, this causes hypermobility of the smaller joints around the fingers; the ligaments of the thumb gradually become slightly stressed. ‘In the long term, over-use of the fingers causing stress in a repetitive manner can lead to Osteoarthritis, as the cartilage between the joints begins to degenerate.’ When arthritis sets in the fingers, there is a possibility of excess bone formation around the joints, which can then lead to enlargement or deformation of the finger. Although this isn t extremely damaging to one’s health, here are other factors in play that would influence the rates of degenerative change on joints such as diet, family history and underlying health condition. Limit texting to short messages. For a long message, use voice-to- text, or go old school, a phone call is actually a lot easier. Use the swipe feature, allowing you to slide to letters rather than type. Take a break and put down your phone, before your hand starts hurting. Break up texting or gaming into shorter sessions. Stretch your fingers, wrist and forearms at periodic intervals. Place the phone on a table or counter to text using both hands. Larger phones are most likely better for the fingers because the fingers have more space to spread out. But, the catch is that the larger devices are heavier, so your hand has to support the extra weight and could cause smartphone pinky.

Healthy joints help your body move, bend, and twist. Knees glide up and down stairs without creaking or crunching. Hips move you along on a walk without a complaint. But when you have arthritis, such simple, everyday movements can hurt. Using the stairs can be painful. Walking a few steps, opening a door, and even combing your hair can be hard. Arthritis is mainly a disease of the . But it can happen in other joints too. A joint is where two bones connect. And you have them all over your body. Arthritis is most common in older people. Even though you can't cure arthritis, there are many treatments that can help with your pain and make it easier for you to move. And you can do things to keep the damage from getting worse. The simplest way to describe arthritis is that it's wear and tear on the cartilage of your joints. This cushioning tissue is firm, thick, and slippery. It covers and where they meet to form a joint. With arthritis, there are changes in the cartilage that cause it to break down. When it breaks down, the bones rub together and cause damage and pain. Experts don't know why this breakdown in cartilage happens. But aging, joint injury, being overweight, and genetics may be a part of the reason. Your joints may ache, or the pain may feel burning or sharp. Getting up in the morning can be hard. Your joints may feel stiff and creaky for a short time, until you get moving. The muscles around the joint may get weaker. This happens a lot with arthritis in the knee. Joints can start to look like they are the wrong shape, especially as arthritis gets worse. Reduced range of motion and loss of use of the joint. As your arthritis gets worse, you may not be able to fully bend, flex, or extend your joints. Or you may not be able to use them at all. Your joints may make crunching, creaking sounds. Your doctor will check that your pain is not caused by another problem. He or she will ask questions about your symptoms, such as: Are your joints stiff in the morning? If yes, how long does the stiffness last? If your joints are tender and swollen and the muscles are weak, this will also help your doctor confirm whether you have arthritis. You may also have to check your joints for damage. Your doctor may want to do blood tests or other tests to see if there are other causes for your pain. There are many treatments for arthritis, but what works for someone else may not help you.

Having shots of medicine in the joint also helps some people. Heat may help you loosen up before an activity. Ice is a good pain reliever after activity or exercise. Your doctor may give you gels or creams that you can rub on the joint to make it stop hurting. Losing weight may be one of the best things you can do for your arthritis. It helps take some of the stress off of your joints. Having stronger thigh muscles, for example, can help reduce stress on your knees. Swimming, biking, and walking are good activities. But make sure you talk to your doctor about what kind of activity is best for you. You may also get help from a physical therapist. If the pain in your hip or knee does not get better with treatment, you may decide to have surgery to replace the joint. There are also some things you can do at home to help relieve your symptoms. For example, there are devices and tools that can take the stress and weight off of your joints and make it easier for you to hold objects, open and close things, and walk. Doorknob covers, tape, braces, splints, and canes may help. You might also try changing activities or the way you do things to reduce the stress on the joint that hurts and allow you to move better.

Because you'll likely take medicine for a long time, you'll need to see your doctor for regular checkups to look for any side effects that may develop from long-term use. He or she may prescribe medicine that can help prevent stomach ulcers, which may develop when you take pain medicine every day. In most cases, people can manage their osteoarthritis symptoms with medicine and lifestyle changes. But surgery may be an option if: You have tried medicine and other treatments, but they haven't helped. ""I wasn't sure about having surgery since I was so young. I had heard that an artificial hip could give out in 10 to 20 years ... But when the medicine I was taking stopped working, I figured I had gone as far as I could go with this, and decided to go ahead with the surgery ... It's a strange feeling to be able to walk without a limp and to walk up and down stairs without grabbing on to the railing.""— Read more about Steve and how he learned to cope with arthritis. . This joins (fuses) two bones in a damaged joint so that the joint won't bend. Doctors may use it to treat arthritis of the spine, ankles, hands, and feet. In rare cases, it's used to treat the knees and hips. . This may be used to smooth a rough joint surface or remove loose cartilage or bone fragments. In some people it may help relieve pain for a short time and allow the joint to move better. . This is most often done in younger, more active people who have pain and disability caused by a badly damaged hip. This is done when other treatments haven't worked and damage to the joint can be seen on X-rays. It involves surgery to replace the ends of bones in a damaged joint. The surgery creates new joint surfaces. The joints that are replaced most often are the hip, knee, and shoulder. But other joints such as the elbow and the ankle can also be replaced. . This is done to correct certain defects in the hip and knee. In most cases, it's done in active people younger than 60 who want to delay surgery to replace a hip or knee. . Surgery is more common on the larger joints, such as the hip and the knee. But if pain in the small joints of the hands or feet is so bad that the person can't use those joints, surgery may help. A newer procedure for arthritis of the knee uses a small cup shaped like a ""C."" It's placed in the joint space of the inner knee and acts as a cushion for the joint. It may help delay surgery to replace the knee. If you're in poor health or have certain health problems, you may not be able to have surgery. Your doctor can help you decide if surgery is right for you. Here are some things to think about if you're thinking about surgery: After surgery, most people are able to go back to doing their daily tasks and sports with less pain. You will need several months of physical therapy to get the best use of your joint. typically last 10 to 20 years. You may need another surgery if the new joint wears out. If you have already lost a lot of your strength, flexibility, balance, endurance, and ability to be active before you have surgery, then after the surgery you might have a harder time returning to your normal activities. For help deciding whether to have joint replacement surgery, see: Arthritis: Should I Have Hip Replacement Surgery? Arthritis: Should I Have Knee Replacement Surgery? Arthritis: Should I Have Shoulder Replacement Surgery? In the days or weeks before your surgery, talk to your doctor about what you need to do to get ready for your return home. For example, you may need to arrange for someone to drive you home and to help you after your surgery. Or you may need to make changes to your home, such as removing small rugs, to help you move around. Many people use some form of to treat certain health problems, including osteoarthritis. These treatments are often used along with standard care to help relieve their arthritis symptoms. Some of these treatments may help you move more easily and deal with the stress and pain of arthritis. But in some cases, not much is known about how safe they are or how well they may work. Be sure to tell your doctor if you're using a complementary therapy or if you're thinking about trying one. He or she can discuss the possible benefits and potential side effects of these treatments and whether any of these treatments may interfere with your standard care. For example, some diet supplements and herbal medicines may cause problems if you take them with another medicine. to try to relieve pain and stiffness. Examples include: .

Experts are testing new medicines and methods that they hope will one day help prevent, reduce, or repair cartilage damage. For example, they're looking at cartilage transplants and the use of stem cells to grow new cartilage. So far, therapies to repair cartilage have only been studied in younger people with small, well-defined holes in their knee cartilage.

When the swollen tendons squeeze or compress the median nerve, it causes pain, tingling, and numbness. is sometimes referred to as a repetitive motion syndrome. Foods and supplements that alleviate inflammation may benefit this condition. In some instances, the right type of diet may alleviate symptoms enough so that other medical treatments are not needed. In other instances, it may be a beneficial addition to medical treatment. Certain foods may also exacerbate this condition, by furthering inflammation in the body. Read on to learn about the foods and supplements that help or hurt carpal tunnel syndrome. Carpal tunnel syndrome has a number of known causes. These include: history of repetitive wrist movements, such as typing or machine work also plays a central role in the pain-related symptoms caused by carpal tunnel syndrome. Inflammation is a natural process in the body that helps protect you from injury and infection. However, chronic inflammation has been to: A diet high in processed foods may increase levels of pro-inflammatory proteins, called cytokines. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFa) is a cytokine that has been to carpal tunnel pain. Research shows that diets rich in processed foods may increase inflammatory proteins, like TNFa. Foods that promote inflammation may make carpal tunnel syndrome worse. These include: are also referred to as simple carbohydrates, or simply, “bad carbs.” They include grains that have been stripped of fiber, nutrients, and bran. They also include desserts and sodas. Many refined carbohydrates are also high in . These include desserts such as pie and cake. Other foods high in saturated and trans fat include: beef, pork, and processed luncheon meats, including bologna are often high in trans fat and salt. They include many fast foods, such as French fries, fried chicken, and tacos. Since salt can cause , it may worsen swelling and pressure on the median nerve. Avoid foods that are high in salt, including processed, packaged foods. Also avoid adding table salt to meals. A too-heavy intake of can raise inflammation levels in the body. A found that long-term, excessive drinking could increase the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome. Foods that are beneficial for carpal tunnel syndrome Foods that reduce inflammation have been in studies to be beneficial to health and may support a reduction in carpal tunnel syndrome symptoms. They include: have anti-inflammatory properties and are neuroprotective. A small found that omega-3 fatty acids reduced numbness and pain caused by carpal tunnel syndrome. Foods containing omega-3 fatty acids include: coldwater fatty fish, such as salmon, tuna, herring, mackerel, and sardines can reduce inflammation and may help alleviate the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome. They include: berries, including blueberries, strawberries, and goji berries supplementation is a controversial treatment for carpal tunnel syndrome. It’s sometimes recommended by healthcare providers because it’s optimal for overall health, plus it may help reduce carpal tunnel symptoms. It’s not completely clear how B6 works for this condition. One is that it acts as an analgesic, by raising the pain threshold of people with carpal tunnel syndrome. supplementation may be beneficial for reducing the effects of nerve damage and . Eating a diet high in this nutrient may also be beneficial. include: is a spice that contains curcumin, which has been to have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective effects for peripheral nerves. In addition to scientific data, users of turmeric say it’s beneficial for reducing the inflammation associated with carpal tunnel syndrome and with other conditions, including . If you decide to try turmeric, make sure to use it with black pepper. The pepper increases the bioavailability of curcumin, increasing its effectiveness. Supplements that may relieve symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome If your diet is lacking in the vitamins and nutrients found in the foods listed above, you may benefit from taking them as supplements. They include: , which are high in omega-3 fatty acid and antioxidants In addition, there are supplements that may be beneficial to take, as the nutrients are hard to get through diet alone. They include: has neuroprotective properties and has been to reduce carpal tunnel syndrome symptoms. It’s found in some foods, such as spinach and organ meat, but in very small amounts. is found in hot red peppers. It has been to have pain-relieving properties. Other ways to reduce symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome for carpal tunnel syndrome may be useful for pain relief and for alleviating swelling. They include: oral over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medication reducing repetitive motion activities that require flexing of the wrist. These include typing, using a computer mouse, handwriting, and working a cash register not falling asleep with your wrists held in a bent position Carpal tunnel syndrome can be painful and debilitating. Since it can occur in both wrists, it may significantly reduce your ability to participate in daily activities. If at-home treatments and dietary changes don’t help, talk with a healthcare provider. In some instances, may be beneficial for alleviating this condition and reducing pain. You may also wish to consider medical treatments, such as cortisone injections. Surgical solutions for carpal tunnel syndrome may be highly beneficial. Carpal tunnel syndrome is a painful condition caused by the compression of nerves in the wrist and palm. Eating certain foods and taking dietary supplements may help alleviate the swelling and inflammation caused by this condition. There are also some at-home treatments that can help.

16b5a241-82b5-4d7d-8582-19039f9fb592,"Common Conditions of the Wrist: A Powerful, but Vulnerable Joint HSS Health Connection by Public & Patient Education From the issue,  The wrist is one of the most complicated joints in the body. It allows you to wave, hammer, stir and throw objects. When that motion is compromised by discomfort or injury, it can dramatically impair how you go about your day. Wrist injuries are among the most common problems of the upper extremity, and there are new treatments available. Having your symptoms assessed early by a hand surgeon may save you a lifetime of pain and disability. The wrist – the joint between your hand and arm – contains eight bones called carpal bones that are arranged in two rows. The scaphoid, lunate, triquetral and pisiform bones move with the arm bones, and the trapezium, trapezoid, capitate, and hamate bones are connected to the bones of the palm. The carpal bones are connected by ligaments. Many tendons connecting the forearm muscles to the fingers and thumb run through the wrist. Extensor tendons on the back of the wrist straighten your fingers, while flexor tendons on the front of the wrist bend them. Nerves and blood vessels also pass through the wrist. Together all of these structures work in a coordinated way to provide your wrist with exceptional range of motion. Both of these painful disorders are due to compression of the tissues running through ""tunnels"" in the wrist and at the base of the thumb. The carpal bones of the wrist and the transverse carpal ligament form the carpal tunnel. The median nerve and nine tendons that flex the fingers and thumbs pass through this tunnel. occurs when there is pressure on the median nerve, causing numbness, tingling, and weakness. With (also called de Quervain's tendinosis), the tunnel where the tendons on the thumb side of the wrist run through are thickened and cause pain – especially during grasping, twisting, or forming a fist. There may also be swelling on the thumb side of the wrist and a catching or snapping sensation when moving the thumb. These conditions may be related to overuse injuries due to repetitive stress on the wrist. Changes in hormones, such as during pregnancy, as well as rheumatoid arthritis can also raise the risk of developing these tunnel syndromes. If you have these symptoms, a doctor will examine your wrist and hand function and ask you to hold it in different positions to assess your discomfort. You may also have tests of muscle and nerve function. Carpal tunnel syndrome and de Quervain's tendinosis are often treated using special splints to rest the wrist and thumb, frequent breaks from repetitive activities, anti-inflammatory medications such as ibuprofen or naproxen, and sometimes cortisone injections. There are stretches you can do regularly before and after the repetitive activities to help reduce the onset of symptoms. If after several months you are still experiencing discomfort or if your symptoms were severe from the beginning, you may need surgery to cut the ligament to take the pressure off the median nerve (for carpal tunnel syndrome) or release the tendon sheath putting pressure on the thumb tendons (for de Quervain's syndrome). Both can be done on an outpatient basis, followed by splinting and hand therapy to restore lost strength and range of motion. Anytime you fall on your wrist, you are at risk of a fracture. It can happen during sports, while riding a bicycle or scooter (a trend in recent years as more adults ride motorized scooters in cities), skateboarding, or hiking. Older individuals with osteoporosis are also prone to fracturing a wrist during a fall. The most common break in the wrist is called a distal radius fracture – a break in the arm bone called the radius. It happens when you fall on an outstretched wrist. Complex wrist fractures may involve not only the radius, but also the ulna and carpal bones. A fracture will cause pain, swelling, and bruising. The sooner you see a doctor for an evaluation, the sooner you can receive the most effective treatment. The treatment you need depends on how much bone displacement has occurred and how much intervention it will take to move the bones back to their correct positions. Some fractures require only a cast, while others may need surgery with hardware such as plates and screws to fix the bones in the proper place. The hardware is usually left in place permanently unless it causes irritation of the soft tissues. Healing generally takes about six weeks. A hand therapist can support your recovery. There are steps you can take to avoid a wrist fracture. Wear wrist guards when doing activities such as rollerblading, skateboarding, or snowboarding. Watch your terrain and don't go too fast when you are riding a bike or scooter. Avoid distractions such as talking on the phone or wearing headphones, so you can be aware of who is around you and any vehicles near you. If you've ever fallen on an outstretched hand, you may be at risk of SLAC wrist. SLAC stands for ""scapho-lunate advanced collapse,"" characterized by arthritis that can cause symptoms ranging from mild to debilitating. It happens when the fall tears the scapho-lunate (SL) ligament, which binds the scaphoid and lunate bones. An X-ray of the area typically looks normal right after the injury, but one to three years (and sometimes decades) later, there is pain and instability of the wrist, and an X-ray shows that the scaphoid and lunate bones have separated. If you develop pain, swelling, or bruising after falling on your wrist, see a doctor right away. SLAC wrist can decrease range of motion, and the doctor may actually be able to feel the bones shifting. An MRI would show the torn ligament. Even when the SL ligament is surgically repaired within six weeks of injury, 30% of patients still develop arthritis in the joint. Surgeons now know that they need to repair four different wrist ligaments early after the injury to achieve the best patient outcomes. If you have SLAC arthritis that developed years after an injury, you may find it increasingly difficult to open a jar, lift a pan, do yoga, or open a doorknob. As many as four to five million Americans may be living with these kinds of impairments. To treat the arthritis, a hand surgeon can either partially fuse the scaphoid and lunate bones or remove them. Both surgeries reduce symptoms, but also range of motion in the wrist. Hand therapy is vital for regaining lost function. There is hope for those suffering from moderate to severe SLAC arthritis: Hospital for Special Surgery and Brown University investigators developed a total wrist replacement, which the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved in March 2020. Surgeons plan to start using this promising implant in November 2020 in patients with advanced SLAC arthritis. Disorders of the wrist can have a significant impact on your ability to get through the activities you normally engage in every day. Seeing a hand surgeon – an orthopedic surgeon with advanced training in the care of the upper extremity – soon after your symptoms begin gives you the best chance of receiving the most effective treatment early, including nonsurgical therapies, before long-term stiffness and immobility set in.

7a07b47a-9a12-46d3-9f2c-10cd446a6358,"from the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons from the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons English español Trigger finger is a condition that causes pain, stiffness, and a sensation of locking or catching when you bend and straighten your finger. The condition is also known as “stenosing tenosynovitis.” The ring finger and thumb are most often affected by trigger finger, but it can occur in the other fingers, as well. When the thumb is involved, the condition is called “trigger thumb.” The flexor tendons are long cord-like structures that attach the muscles of the forearm to the bones of the fingers. When the muscles contract, the flexor tendons allow the fingers to bend. Each of the flexor tendons passes through a tunnel in the palm and fingers that allows it to glide smoothly as the finger bends and straightens. This tunnel is called the “tendon sheath.” Along the tendon sheath, bands of tissue called “pulleys” hold the flexor tendons closely to the finger bones. The tendons pass through the pulleys as the finger moves. The pulley at the base of the finger is called the “A1 pulley.” This is the pulley that is most often involved in trigger finger. The tendon sheath attaches to the finger bones and keeps the flexor tendon in place as it moves. The A1 pulley is near the opening of the tendon sheath.Reproduced from JF Sarwark, ed: Essentials of Musculoskeletal Care, ed 4. Rosemont, IL, American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, 2010. In a patient with trigger finger, the A1 pulley becomes inflamed or thickened, making it harder for the flexor tendon to glide through it as the finger bends. Over time, the flexor tendon may also become inflamed and develop a small nodule on its surface. When the finger flexes and the nodule passes through the pulley, there is a sensation of catching or popping. This is often painful. The thickened nodule on the flexor tendon strikes the A1 pulley, making it difficult to straighten the finger. Reproduced and adapted from JF Sarwark, ed: Essentials of Musculoskeletal Care, ed 4. Rosemont, IL, American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, 2010. In a severe case of trigger finger, the finger locks and becomes stuck in a bent position. Sometimes the patient must use his or her other hand to straighten the finger. This video of trigger thumb and trigger finger clearly shows the catching of the tendon at the A1 pulley. While the causes of trigger finger are not well known, several factors may increase your risk for developing the condition. These include: Trigger finger is more common in people with certain medical conditions, such as diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis. The condition is known to occur after forceful use of the fingers and thumb. Symptoms of trigger finger often start without a single injury. They may follow a period of heavy or extensive hand use, particularly pinching and grasping activities. This patient's trigger finger is locked in a bent position.  A tender lump at the base of the finger on the palm side of the hand A catching, popping, or locking sensation with finger movement Stiffness and locking tend to be worse after periods of inactivity, such as when you wake up in the morning.  In a severe case, the involved finger may become locked in a bent position. Your doctor will be able to diagnose a trigger finger by talking with you about your symptoms and examining your hand. Typically, x-rays or other tests are not needed. Tenderness over the flexor tendon sheath in the palm of your hand Triggering when you bend and straighten your finger During the examination, your doctor will check your finger for stiffness and signs of locking. Reproduced from JF Sarwark, ed: Essentials of Musculoskeletal Care, ed 4. Rosemont, IL, American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, 2010. Initial treatment for a trigger finger is usually nonsurgical. Resting your hand and avoiding activities that make it worse may be enough to resolve the problem. Wearing a splint at night to keep the affected finger or thumb in a straight position while you sleep may be helpful. Gentle stretching exercises can help decrease stiffness and improve range of motion in the involved digit. Over-the-counter medications, such as acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), can help relieve pain and inflammation. . Corticosteroid, or cortisone, is an anti-inflammatory agent that can be injected into the tendon sheath at the base of the trigger finger. A steroid injection may resolve the triggering over a period of one day to several weeks. If symptoms do not improve with time, a second injection may be given. If two injections do not help the problem, surgery may be considered.  Steroid injections are less likely to be effective in patients with diabetes, but may still help avoid surgery. They can cause a short-term rise in blood sugar, so glucose levels in diabetic patients should be monitored after injection. Photo and illustration show a steroid injection into the A1 pulley. Reproduced from JF Sarwark, ed: Essentials of Musculoskeletal Care, ed 4. Rosemont, IL, American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, 2010. If your finger does not get better with nonsurgical treatment, you may wish to consider surgery. Surgery is elective. The decision for surgery is based on how much pain or loss of function you have in your finger. If, however, your finger or thumb is stuck in a flexed or bent position, your doctor may recommend surgery to prevent permanent stiffness. The surgical procedure for trigger finger is called “tenolysis” or “trigger finger release.” The goal of the procedure is to release the A1 pulley that is blocking tendon movement so the flexor tendon can glide more easily through the tendon sheath. Typically, the procedure is done in an outpatient setting with an injection of local anesthesia to numb the area for surgery. Surgery is performed through either a small open incision in the palm or with the tip of a needle. The A1 pulley is divided (released) so that the flexor tendon can glide freely. Although pulleys have an important function in the hand, releasing the A1 pulley should not cause problems in the future. During trigger release surgery, the A1 pulley is cut (dotted blue line). Reproduced and adapted from JF Sarwark, ed: Essentials of Musculoskeletal Care, ed 4. Rosemont, IL, American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, 2010. Complications can occur with any type of surgery. Your doctor will discuss the risks with you before surgery and will take specific measures to help prevent complications. The most common complications following surgery for trigger finger or trigger thumb include: Inability to straighten the involved finger. If you were not able to straighten your finger completely before surgery, you might not be able to do so afterward. Temporary soreness or swelling at the site of surgery Persistent locking or clicking. This may indicate that more of the pulley needs to be released or may be caused by another problem in your finger. “Bowstringing.” In a small number of cases, the tendon may “bow” away from the bone, resulting in reduced range of motion. Bowstringing occurs when one of the more important pulleys is released. Digital nerve injury. This may cause numbness or tingling along part of the finger. Most patients are encouraged to move their finger immediately after surgery. It is common to have some soreness in your palm. Elevating your hand above your heart can help reduce pain and swelling. Although your incision will heal within a few weeks, it may take from 4 to 6 months for swelling and stiffness in your hand and fingers or thumb to go away completely. If stiffness, swelling, or pain persist after surgery, your doctor may recommend seeing a hand therapist. Patients who have surgery experience significant improvement in function as well as relief from the pain of a trigger finger. Still, if a contracture or loss of motion was present before surgery, complete range of motion may not be restored.

ANALGESIC ADMINISTRATION- Tylenol (although patients are at risk for liver damage if more than 4000 mg daily), topical drug applications (i.e. Lidocaine 5% patches), NSAIDs, opioids (when all other drugs fail), cortisone (single joint temporary relief), (b.) PAIN MANAGEMENT (nonpharmacologic) like: rest, joint positioning, heat or cold applications, weight control(c.) COMPLEMENTARY & ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES (CAMs): accupuncture, acupressure, tai chi, music therapy, and cognitive-behavioral therapies (i.e. imagery, prayer, topical capsaicin products- blocks substance P, a neurotransmitter for pain), GLA (gamma-linolenic acid)- which is an omega-6 fatty acid, glucosamine, and chondroitin Osteoarthritis (OA): interventions (surgical management) -the most common is TOTAL JOINT ARTHROPLASTY (TJA) - surgical creation of a joint, also known as TOTAL JOINT REPLACEMENT (TJR).*almost any synovial joint in the body can be replaced with a prosthetic system that consists of at least 2 parts...-a less invasive procedure using arthroscopy may be used to remove damaged cartilage. And OSTEOTOMY (bone resection) may be performed to correct joint deformity... Total Joint Arthroplasty (TJA): (contraindications) -infection anywhere in the body-advanced osteoporosis-rapidly progressive inflammation-a patient over 85 yrs: the decision may become ethical, in addition to physical risk & cost-v-benefit. Nursing Interventions to Prevent Complications of Total Joint Arthroplasty (TJA) (dislocation):-position correctly-for hip, keep leg slightly abducted-for hip, prevent hip flexion beyond 90 degree-assess for pain, rotation, and extremity shortening-report immediately to physician(infection):-use aseptic technique for wound care and emptying of drains-wash hands thoroughly when caring for patient-culture drainage fluid, if change-monitor temperature-report excessive inflammation or drainage to physician Nursing Interventions to Prevent Complications of Total Joint Arthroplasty (TJA) **cont... (venous thromboembolism):-patient to wear elastic stockings and/or sequential compression device-teach leg exercises to patient-encourage fluid intake-observe for signs of thrombosis (redness, swelling, or pain)-observe patient for changes in mental status-administer anticoagulant as prescribed-do not massage legs-do not use knee gatch on bed(hypotension, bleeding, or infection):-take vital signs at least every 4 hours-observe patient for bleeding-report excessively low blood pressure or bleeding to physician -has steadily increased over last 30 yrs-""primary arthroplasty""- is the 1st time a patient receives it-""revision arthroplasty""- if the implant loosens-performed most often in those over 60 yrs-patient receives an IV antibiotic, usually cephalosporin (ex- Ancef) at least 1 hr before initial incision-patient placed under general neuroaxial (epidural/spinal) anesthesia for LE surgery Chart 20-4, Care of Patients with Total Hip Arthroplasty After Hospital Discharge (hip precautions):-do not sit or stand for prolonged periods-do not cross legs beyond the midline of body-do not bend your hips more than 90 degrees-use an ambulatory aid, such as a walker-use assistive/adaptive devices for dressing-resume sexual intercourse as usual per surgeon(pain management):-report increased hip pain to doctor-take oral analgesics as prescribed, PRN-do not overexert yourself, rest frequently Chart 20-4, Care of Patients with Total Hip Arthroplasty After Hospital Discharge **cont. (incisional care)-inspect your hip incision every day for redness, heat, or drainage, call doc if these present-cleanse your hip incision with mild soap and water every day, dry thoroughly(other care)-continue walking & leg exercises-report pain, redness, or swelling to doctor-report chest pain or SOB to doctor-if on anticoagulant, follow the precautions learned in hospital to prevent bleeding; avoid straight razor, avoid injuries, report bruising, bleeding, etc. Q: does the patient with a THA get out of bed the day after surgery? Q: what is the most potentially life-threatening complication after THA? venous thromboembolism (VTE), which includes deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE)-older patients esp. at risk b/c of age and decreased circulation before surgery An older patient may not have a fever with infection but instead may experience an altered mental state. Note: Postoperative care with Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) postoperative nursing care of the patient with a TKA is similar to that for the patient with a total THA, however, maintaining hip abduction is not necessary. -the surgeon may prescribe a continuous passive motion (CPM) machine- prevents scar tissue, initial setting is 20-30 degrees of flexion -can be done in either THA or TKA-uses 1 or 2 smaller incisions-cannot be used w obese or w osteoporosis-not done for revision surgeries, only primary-benefit: dec. soft tissue damage & post-op pain, and often a shorter hospital stay-less post-op complications Q: has it been reported that patients with a TKA have higher pain than patients with THA? -is a recent advance in post-op pain care w LE total joint arthroplasty.In this procedure, the anesthesiologist injects the femoral or sciatic nerve with local anesthetic and the patient receives a continuous infusion by portable pump. *decreases pain & allows patients to participate in rehab earlier-with CPNB, perform neurovascular assessments every 2-4 hours (or hosp. protocol) -after THA and TKA, the shoulder and hand are the most common joints replaced for severe OA, RA, or trauma-elbow, wrist, ankle and foot replacements are not performed as often -is newer-because the shoulder is complex and has many articulations (joint surfaces), subluxation (partial dislocation) or complete dislocation is a major complication-the glenohumeral joint is replaced usually is performed most often for patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but is done for anyone whose severe arthritis limits movement & causes uncontrolled pain phalangeal joint, metacarpal or metatarsal arthroplasties often for patients with RA-also any bone in the wrist can be replaced-total ankle arthroplasties (TAA) have been problematic for three (3) decades, but newer non-cemented prosthetic systems have renewed interest -balance & coordination-gait-joint movement-transfer performance-walking Two (2) types of exercise recommended for patients with OA: RECREATIONAL - hobbies and sports, with no planned purpose other than relaxationor THERAPEUTIC - includes carefully planned activities that are designed to improve muscle strength, muscle tone, and ROM*the ideal time for exercise is immediately after application of heat The Arthritis Foundation is an important community resource for all patients with arthritis and CTD. is one of the most common connective tissue diseases and is the most destructive to the joints. -it is chronic, progressive, systemic inflammatory autoimmune & affects primarily the synovial joints-2 million people-European Americans have it more than others In RA, antibodies (rheumatoid factors [RFs] are formed that attack healthy tissue, especially snovium -RFs consist mainly of immunoglobulins M and G, and they bind with antigens forming immune complexes is a vascular granulation tissue composed of inflammatory cells; it erodes articular cartilage and eventually destroys bone. -joints progressively inflamed & very painful-GEL PHENOMENON (morning stiffness, 45m to several hours after awakening)-joints feel soft & look puffy bc of synovitis and EFFUSIONS (joint swelling with fluid, esp. in knees)-fingers appear spindle-like-possible muscle atrophy & dec.

At one time or another, everyone has had a minor injury to a finger, hand, or wrist that caused pain or swelling. Most of the time our body movements do not cause problems, but it's not surprising that symptoms develop from everyday wear and tear, overuse, or an injury. Finger, hand, or wrist injuries most commonly occur during: Work or projects around the home, especially if using machinery such as lawn mowers, snow blowers, or hand tools. The risk of finger, hand, or wrist injury is higher in contact sports, such as wrestling, football, or soccer, and in high-speed sports, such as biking, in-line skating, skiing, snowboarding, and skateboarding. Sports that require weight-bearing on the hands and arms, such as gymnastics, can increase the risk for injury. Sports that use hand equipment such as ski poles, hockey or lacrosse sticks, or racquets also increase the risk of injury. In children, most finger, hand, or wrist injuries occur during sports or play or from accidental falls. Any injury occurring at the end of a long bone near a joint may injure the growth plate (physis) and needs to be evaluated. Older adults are at higher risk for injuries and fractures because they lose muscle mass and bone strength as they age. They also have more problems with vision and balance, which increases their risk of accidental injury. Most minor injuries will heal on their own, and home treatment is usually all that is needed to relieve symptoms and promote healing. An acute injury may occur from a direct blow, a penetrating injury, or a fall, or from twisting, jerking, jamming, or bending a limb abnormally. Pain may be sudden and severe. Bruising and swelling may develop soon after the injury. Acute injuries include: . After a wrist or hand injury, may extend to the fingers from the effects of gravity. Injuries to , such as a injury. Broken bones (), such as a . Crushing injury, which can lead to . Overuse injuries occur when too much stress is placed on a joint or other tissue, often by ""overdoing"" an activity or repeating the same activity. Overuse injuries include the following: is caused by pressure on a nerve () in the wrist. The symptoms include tingling, numbness, weakness, or pain of the fingers and hand. is actually a symptom of tendinosis, a series of very small tears (microtears) in the tissue in or around the . In addition to pain and tenderness, common symptoms of tendon injury include decreased strength and movement in the affected area. can occur in the hand and wrist when tendons and the tendon covering (sheath) on the thumb side of the wrist swell and become inflamed. Treatment for a finger, hand, or wrist injury may include first aid measures; medicine; ""buddy-taping"" for support; application of a brace, splint, or cast; physical therapy; and in some cases, surgery. Treatment depends on: Your age, health condition, and activities (such as work, sports, or hobbies). to decide if and when you should see a doctor. The medical assessment of symptoms is based on the body parts you have. If you are transgender or nonbinary, choose the sex that matches the body parts (such as ovaries, testes, prostate, breasts, penis, or vagina) you have in the area where you are having symptoms. If your symptoms aren’t related to those organs, you can choose the gender you identify with. If you have some organs of both sexes, you may need to go through this triage tool twice (once as ""male"" and once as ""female""). This will make sure that the tool asks the right questions for you. Has it been more than a month since the finger, hand, or wrist injury? Have you had finger, hand, or wrist surgery in the past month? If a cast, splint, or brace is causing the problem, follow the instructions you got about how to loosen it. Do you think that any of your fingers might have frostbite? Have you had a in the past 2 to 3 hours? Do you have that has not slowed down with direct pressure? The are different than the . Are you having trouble moving your fingers or hand normally? Have you had trouble moving the fingers, hand, or wrist for more than 2 days? How bad is the pain on a scale of 0 to 10, if 0 is no pain and 10 is the worst pain you can imagine? are different than . Do you have any pain in your fingers, hand, or wrist? on a scale of 0 to 10, if 0 is no pain and 10 is the worst pain you can imagine? Is your hand and different from the other hand? If the hand or arm is in a cast, splint, or brace, follow the instructions you got about how to loosen it. Hand is blue, very pale, or cold and different from other hand Hand is blue, very pale, or cold and different from other hand Is any part of a finger partially or completely cut off? Is it more than the tip of the finger or more than half the size of a dime, or can you see the bone? Gently wash off any dirt, wrap the cut-off part in a clean cloth, put the wrapped part in a plastic bag, place the bag on ice to keep the digit cool and bring it to the hospital. Was the finger or wrist twisted or bent out of its normal position, even if it is back in its normal position now? Is the finger or hand trapped in something, like a jar or a toy? Is there an object stuck in your finger or hand, and you can't get it out? This could be something like a nail, a needle, or a large piece of wood, metal, or plastic. Has your hand or finger been injected with something under high pressure, like oil or paint from a sprayer? Hand or finger injected with something under high pressure Hand or finger injected with something under high pressure Did you have swelling or bruising within 30 minutes of the injury? Do you have weakness, numbness, or tingling in your arm or hand that has lasted more than an hour? Weakness is being unable to use the arm or hand normally no matter how hard you try. Pain or swelling may make it hard to move, but that is not the same as weakness. Numbness, weakness, or tingling for more than 1 hour Numbness, weakness, or tingling for more than 1 hour Do you suspect that the injury may have been caused by abuse? This is a standard question that we ask in certain topics. It may not apply to you. But asking it of everyone helps us to get people the help they need. Are there red streaks leading away from the area or pus draining from it? Do you have diabetes, a , peripheral arterial disease, or any surgical hardware in the area? ""Hardware"" includes things like artificial joints, plates or screws, catheters, and medicine pumps. Diabetes, immune problems, peripheral arterial disease, or surgical hardware in affected area Diabetes, immune problems, peripheral arterial disease, or surgical hardware in affected area Many things can affect how your body responds to a symptom and what kind of care you may need. These include: . Babies and older adults tend to get sicker quicker. . If you have a condition such as diabetes, HIV, cancer, or heart disease, you may need to pay closer attention to certain symptoms and seek care sooner. . Certain medicines, herbal remedies, and supplements can cause symptoms or make them worse. , such as surgery or injury. These kinds of events can cause symptoms afterwards or make them more serious. , such as eating and exercise habits, smoking, alcohol or drug use, sexual history, and travel.

f9ad207a-49ca-4d79-bcdd-273412f99965,"How to Diagnose, Treat, and Prevent Thenar Eminence Pain — Your thenar eminence is the soft fleshy area at the base of your thumb. The found here make your thumb opposable. That is, they allow your thumb to grip and hold small objects like a pencil, sewing needle, or spoon. An opposable thumb also lets you text on your phone, grasp and turn a doorknob, and carry heavy bags. You use your thumb to perform many of your daily tasks. Over time, these repetitive motions can stress the muscles that control your thumb, causing inflammation and pain. Keep reading to learn how thenar eminence pain is diagnosed, how it’s treated, and how it can be prevented. To evaluate thenar eminence pain, your doctor will ask you: the location of your pain and if it spreads to another place if anything makes it better or worse, especially a certain movement Your doctor will then examine your hand, focusing on the location of the pain. They may try to reproduce the pain by moving your thumb or wrist. In this test, your doctor may push on your thenar eminence with their thumb to locate the painful area. A carpal tunnel compression test, in which your doctor pushes on your carpal tunnel, is a more common test. Your doctor will perform this test if they suspect your pain is related to or causing carpal tunnel syndrome. Most often, thenar eminence pain occurs because you’ve developed overuse syndrome from repetitive thumb movements. The pain is located in your thenar eminence because the muscles that move your thumb are there. One of the most common but easily avoidable causes of thenar eminence overuse syndrome is frequent texting with your thumbs. The muscles in your thenar eminence are connected to the ligament that runs across the inside of your wrist over your carpal tunnel. When this ligament becomes inflamed or there’s any swelling of tissues in the carpal tunnel, it narrows the carpal tunnel, compressing everything in it, including the median nerve. The median nerve that runs through this tunnel triggers the muscles in your thenar eminence. When the nerve gets compressed, it can cause thenar eminence pain. It works the other way, too. Overuse syndrome in your thenar muscles can contribute to carpal tunnel syndrome in your wrist. can also cause pain in your thenar eminence. Sports injuries, especially in baseball, can cause thenar eminence pain. Typically, it happens when you catch a fast-moving ball with your bare hands or fall on your thenar eminence after stretching to catch a ball. If you can stop the activity that’s causing the inflammation and pain, it will usually get better. Often this isn’t possible because it’s a work activity. If it’s due to a hobby or sports, you may not want to give it up. Medical treatments and home remedies can help even if you don’t completely stop the offending activity. Usually a combination from both categories works best. A thumb splint is commonly used to treat thenar eminence pain. It immobilizes your thumb, so the muscles can’t be overused. This helps to relieve the pain and gives your muscles time to heal. You might not be able to wear the splint all the time if it interferes with your ability to perform your job, but you should wear it whenever possible. nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as and The best way to prevent thenar eminence pain from happening or reoccurring is by avoiding activities that involve repetitive thumb movement. Sometimes you can’t stop these activities because they’re necessary for work or you want to continue the activity that causes it. In this case, you should take frequent breaks to rest the muscles controlling the thumb. You can also find alternate ways to perform the activity that don’t involve overusing your thumb. Stretching your thumb and hand muscles can also help prevent the muscles from becoming stiff. Here are some good stretches for your thenar eminence: Gently push your thumb back toward your forearm while spreading your other fingers apart. Push your palm down against a flat surface while keeping your thumb and index finger as wide apart as you can. Lay your hand on a flat surface with your palm up and gently lean into your thenar eminence with your elbow, moving it around the area. Many occupations, sports activities, and hobbies increase your risk for pain and inflammation in your thenar eminence. A few of these are: occupations that use computers or hand tools frequently Thenar eminence pain is usually due to overuse syndrome brought on by repetitive thumb movements. It typically improves with a combination of medical treatments and home remedies. You can sometimes prevent thenar eminence pain by avoiding activities that require repetitive thumb movement. When that’s not possible, taking frequent breaks during the activity and performing stretches can be helpful. — What’s Causing the Pain on or Near My Thumb, and How Do I Treat It?

It will also depend on your needs and the severity of your OA at the time of diagnosis. Most doctors begin OA treatment with simple, noninvasive options. “Noninvasive” means the treatment won’t involve inserting anything into the body However, you may need more intensive treatment if your symptoms aren’t manageable with lifestyle changes and medication. For some people, surgery (an invasive treatment) can be the best way to manage the symptoms of severe OA. Many people can help control their OA symptoms with basic lifestyle changes. Talk to your doctor about whether these options may be right for you. can play a major role in reducing the pain that comes with OA. An active lifestyle can help you: People with OA should stick to gentle, low-impact exercise. It’s important to stop exercising if you begin to feel any new or increased joint pain. Any aches that last for more than a few hours after you finish exercising mean that you’ve probably done too much. For example, you might consider , which is considered ideal for people with OA. It’s less weight bearing, so it’s gentler on your joints. As well, exercising in warm water increases blood flow to your joints, which brings in nutrients and proteins essential for repairing damaged tissue. When it comes to OA, exercise isn’t just about aerobic conditioning. You also need to work on strength and stretching to support your joints and to maintain your flexibility. Maintaining a healthy weight can reduce stress on joints. If you are overweight or obese, talk to your doctor about how to lose weight safely. Weight loss can help with the pain of OA, especially for OA of the knee. It may also reduce inflammation in the body. A can also help you get essential nutrients that might decrease inflammation and may slow the progression of arthritis. If your joints are swollen and achy, give them a break. Try to avoid using an inflamed joint for 12 to 24 hours to let the swelling go down. It’s also a good idea to get enough sleep. Fatigue may increase your perception of pain. Both cold and heat can help treat OA symptoms. Applying ice to an aching area for 20 minutes helps restrict blood vessels. This reduces fluid in the tissue and decreases swelling and pain. You can repeat the treatment two or three times a day. A bag of frozen vegetables makes a great ice pack. Just make sure to wrap any ice pack you use in a T-shirt or towel. Otherwise, the cold could hurt or even damage your skin. You can do the same 20-minute treatment pattern with a hot water bottle or a heating pad. Both can be found at your local drugstore. Heat opens the blood vessels and increases circulation, which as previously mentioned aids in repairing damaged tissue. Heat is also good for helping with stiffness. You may find relief with both cold and heat. Experiment to see what works best for you. However, restrict your use to no more than 20 minutes at a time. Then give your body a break. Several types of may help relieve OA symptoms. However, different types of drugs have different effects. It’s important to choose the right drugs to help with your symptoms. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) is an OTC painkiller. It reduces pain, but not inflammation. Taking too much can cause liver damage. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can help combat multiple OA symptoms. As implied by their name, they reduce inflammation. They also help with pain. OTC NSAIDs include: It’s important to note that NSAIDs can potentially cause significant side effects over time. These can include: Using a topical NSAID (one applied to your skin) may decrease risk of these side effects, as less of the medication circulates in the body. A variety of creams and gels are available that can help relieve OA pain. These may contain active ingredients such as menthol (Bengay, Stopain) or capsaicin (Capzasin, Zostrix). Capsaicin is the substance that makes hot peppers “hot.” Diclofenac, an NSAID, comes in a gel form (Voltaren gel) or solution (Pennsaid), which require a prescription. For some people with OA, OTC painkillers aren’t helpful enough. You may need prescription medications if symptoms start to affect your quality of life. Managing the pain and swelling may help you perform normal, everyday tasks. Corticosteroids reduce inflammation, which decreases swelling and pain in joints. For OA, corticosteroids are usually given by injection, so they should be administered only by an experienced clinician and used judiciously to avoid complications and side effects. Corticosteroid injections may only be needed once for benefit. However, they may be given three or four times per year if needed. Currently, triamcinolone acetonide (Zilretta) is the only FDA-approved corticosteroid to treat osteoarthritis of the knee. This brand-name drug is more expensive than generic triamcinolone acetonide, which is available for other forms of OA. Prescription NSAIDs do the same thing as OTC NSAIDs. However, they are available in stronger doses that work for longer periods of time. Prescription NSAIDs include: Prescription NSAIDs can sometimes cause undesirable side effects. Talk to your doctor about how to reduce your risk. Strong painkillers can provide relief from severe pain, but it should be noted that they also have the potential to cause addiction, and aren’t recommended for treating OA. These include: In addition to drugs and surgery, other medical treatments for OA are available. These treatments aim to restore proper function to your joints. Physical therapy can be useful for some people with OA. It can help: A physical therapist can help you develop an exercise regimen suited to your needs. Physical therapists can also help you with assistive devices such as: These can provide support to weakened joints. They can also take pressure off injured bones and reduce pain. In addition, a physical therapist can show how to use canes or walkers. They may also try taping parts of the knee, such as the patella, to ease knee pain for some people. Severe cases of OA may require surgery to replace or repair damaged joints. There are several types of surgery and types of implants used in OA. If surgery for OA is required, joint replacement is generally the best option. This is particularly true for people who are older, because they are unlikely to need a second replacement. Joint replacement surgery is also known as arthroplasty. This procedure removes damaged joint surfaces from the body and replaces them with prosthetics made of plastic or metal. Hip and are the most common types of joint replacement. However, other joints can be replaced, including the shoulders, elbows, fingers, and ankles. Prosthetic joints may last two decades or more. However, the lifespan of a joint replacement depends on how that joint is used and how strong the supporting tissues are over time. Osteotomy is a type of surgery used to realign bones damaged by arthritis. This relieves stress on the damaged part of the bone or joint. Osteotomy is usually performed only on younger people with OA, for whom joint replacement isn’t preferable. The bones in a joint can be permanently fused to increase joint stability and reduce pain. This surgery usually results in severely limited or no range of motion in the joint. However, in serious OA cases, it may be the best way to relieve chronic, debilitating pain. In this procedure, a surgeon trims torn and damaged cartilage from a joint. This is done with the use of an arthroscope. An arthroscope is a small camera on the end of a tube. It allows doctors to see into the knee joint while performing procedures on the joint. Arthroscopy can also be used to remove bone spurs. In the past, this was a popular surgery to treat osteoarthritis of the knee. However, has shown that arthroscopy is no more effective at treating long-term pain than medication or physical therapy. Many options are available for treating osteoarthritis. If you have OA, work with a doctor to find the right treatment for you. — — Osteoarthritis is the most common type of arthritis.

For information:  Questions and Answers for Patients Regarding Elective Surgery and COVID-19. For patients whose procedures have not yet been rescheduled:  What to Do If Your Orthopaedic Surgery Is Postponed. Arthritis involves inflammation of one or more of your joints. Pain and stiffness are common symptoms of arthritis, and when these occur in your wrist, simple daily activities can become more difficult. There are many types of arthritis, and most of these can affect the wrist. Although the severity of symptoms related to arthritis can vary, most arthritis-related diseases are chronic. This means that they are long-lasting—even permanent—and can eventually cause serious joint damage. Your wrist is a complex joint—it is actually made up of multiple small joints. When healthy, the bones glide easily over each other during movement, protected by smooth cartilage that coats the joint surfaces. Arthritis damages this cartilage. As the disease progresses, there is a gradual loss of cartilage. Without a smooth joint surface, the bones rub against each other, leading to joint damage that cannot be repaired. Although there is no cure for arthritis today, there are many treatment options available to help relieve your symptoms. Some options may also slow the progression of joint damage. With proper treatment, many people are able to manage their symptoms and stay active. The wrist is a complex joint that connects the hand to the forearm. It is formed by the two bones of the forearm—the radius and the ulna—and eight small carpal bones. The carpal bones are arranged in two rows at the base of the hand. There are four bones in each row. The bones of the wrist. Cartilage coats the ends of the bones to create a gliding joint. Reproduced from JF Sarwark, ed: Essentials of Musculoskeletal Care, ed 4. Rosemont, IL, American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, 2010. The joint surface of each bone is covered with articular cartilage—a slippery substance that protects and cushions the bones as you move your hand and wrist. Although there are many types of arthritis, the three that most commonly affect the wrist are: Osteoarthritis can develop due to normal ""wear-and-tear"" in the wrist, particularly in people who have a family history of arthritis. It is a common problem for many people after they reach middle age, though it may occur in younger people, too. In osteoarthritis, the smooth, slippery articular cartilage that covers the ends of the bones gradually wears away over time. Because the cartilage surface has little to no blood supply, it has little ability to heal or regenerate when it becomes injured or worn down. As the cartilage wears away, it becomes frayed and rough, and the protective space between the bones decreases. This can result in bone rubbing on bone and lead to pain and stiffness in the joint. () This x-ray of a healthy wrist shows normal joint space. () In this wrist with osteoarthritis, the cartilage is worn and the healthy space between bones is narrowed. (Right) Reproduced from JF Sarwark, ed: Essentials of Musculoskeletal Care, ed 4. Rosemont, IL, American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, 2010. Osteoarthritis in the wrist can also develop from Kienböck's disease. In Kienböck's disease, the blood supply to one of the carpal bones—the lunate—is disrupted, causing the bone to die and slowly collapse. Over time, this collapse can lead to changes and arthritis in the joints around the lunate. Surgical photo of the lunate bone in a patient with Kienböck's disease. The cartilage in the center of the joint surface has worn down, exposing the bone underneath (red arrow). The black arrows indicate an area of healthy cartilage. Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic disease that can affect multiple joints throughout the body. The condition often starts in smaller joints, such as those found in the hand and wrist. It is symmetrical, meaning that it usually affects the same joint on both sides of the body. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease. This means that the body's immune system attacks its own tissues. In rheumatoid arthritis, the defenses that normally protect the body from infection instead damage normal tissue (such as cartilage and ligaments) and can soften bone. Rheumatoid arthritis often affects the joint between the two bones of the forearm, the radius and ulna. The deformity in the ulna can cause wearing and possible rupture of the tendons that straighten your fingers. This can cause more deformity and loss of function in your hand. The exact cause of rheumatoid arthritis is not known—there are no clear genetic or environmental factors. Although it is not an inherited disease, researchers believe that some people have genes that could make them more likely to have rheumatoid disease. In this wrist with advanced rheumatoid arthritis, the alignment of the carpal bones has collapsed, leading to a loss of joint space between the bones. Posttraumatic arthritis can develop after an injury, such as a broken wrist bone or a torn ligament. This trauma can cause a direct injury to the cartilage or a delayed wearing of the cartilage due to a change in the way the bones move together—such as after a ligament tear. Posttraumatic arthritis can develop over many years from the initial injury. Despite proper treatment, an injured joint is more likely to become arthritic over time. Not all patients with arthritis will experience symptoms. When they do occur, the severity varies greatly from patient to patient. For some patients, the symptoms are not constant—but may come and go depending on their level of activity and other factors. Your doctor will talk with you about your overall health and medical history and ask you to describe your symptoms. He or she will perform a careful examination of your hand and wrist, looking for: During the examination, your doctor will measure the range of motion in your wrist. During the examination, your doctor may also evaluate: Finger and thumb mobility—To determine how well your tendons and joints are functioning Nerve function—To determine if you have another condition that may be affecting your wrist, such as carpal tunnel syndrome (nerve compression) X-rays provide detailed images of dense structures, such as bone. X-rays of your wrist will help your doctor learn more about the exact location and severity of your arthritis. They can also help your doctor distinguish between various types of arthritis. Your doctor may recommend blood tests to determine which type of arthritis you have. With rheumatoid and other types of inflammatory arthritis, blood tests are important for an accurate diagnosis. Osteoarthritis is not associated with blood abnormalities. There is no cure for arthritis, but there are a number of treatments that may help reduce the frequency of your symptoms and relieve the pain and loss of function it can cause. In general, initial treatment for arthritis is nonsurgical in nature and designed to help minimize your symptoms. Limiting or stopping the activities that make your pain worse is the first step in relieving symptoms. Wearing a wrist splint for a short time will help support the joint and ease the stress placed on it by frequent use and activities. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin, naproxen, and ibuprofen can help reduce both pain and swelling. Topical NSAIDs can be applied directly to the skin in the area of the joint. Specific exercises will help improve range of motion and function in your wrist. Your doctor or a physical therapist can help develop an exercise program that meets your specific needs. Cortisone is a powerful anti-inflammatory agent that can be injected into an arthritic joint. Although an injection of cortisone can provide relief and reduce inflammation, the effects may be temporary. This may include using ""contrast soaks"" of warm and cold water to help reduce swelling. If your symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis are not adequately controlled by the above therapies, your doctor may prescribe additional medications. These medications—called disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs)—are designed to stop the immune system from attacking the joints. Like all medications, DMARDs have both risks and benefits. Your use of DMARDs will be directed by a rheumatologist. If nonsurgical treatment does not relieve your pain and your quality of life has been significantly affected by arthritis, your doctor may recommend surgery. The goal of surgery is to relieve pain while preserving or improving hand function. Typically, this is done by minimizing or eliminating bone-on-bone contact. There are a number of procedures for arthritis of the wrist. Your doctor will talk with you about which procedure will work best in your case. In this procedure, your doctor removes three carpal bones in the row of bones that is closest to the forearm. The procedure is designed to reduce your pain while maintaining some wrist motion. The three wrist bones that are removed in a proximal row carpectomy. X-ray image of a wrist after the procedure. If motion is the source of your pain, your doctor may recommend fusion. Fusion is essentially a ""welding"" process. The basic idea is to fuse together the bones so that they heal into a single, solid bone. The theory behind fusion is that, if the painful bones do not move, they should not hurt. During the procedure, your doctor removes the damaged cartilage and then uses pins, plates, or screws to hold the joint in a permanent position. Over time, the bones fuse or grow together— similar to the way the fractured ends of a bone heal together. In some cases, your doctor can perform a partial fusion in which just some of the carpal bones are fused together. This addresses the damaged joint surfaces, but leaves the healthy joints intact to preserve some wrist motion. In this partial wrist fusion, the scaphoid bone has been removed and screws have been used to hold four carpal bones in place. If your arthritis is extensive, however, a complete wrist fusion may be necessary. In this procedure, all of the carpal bones are fused together, along with the radius (one of the bones in the forearm). Although all wrist motion is eliminated in a complete fusion, forearm rotation and finger/thumb motion are generally preserved. In this complete wrist fusion, the bones are held together with a combination of plates, screws, and pins. In total wrist replacement, your doctor removes the damaged cartilage and bone in your wrist and then positions new metal or plastic joint surfaces to restore the function of the joint. Replacing the wrist joint relieves the pain of arthritis while allowing more wrist movement than fusion. In this total wrist replacement (arthroplasty), the worn-out bones have been replaced with an implant made of metal and plastic. It can be discouraging to learn that you have arthritis, but there are some things you can do to help lessen the impact the condition has on your life. These include: If your symptoms worsen or you are having a hard time coping, ask your doctor to review your treatment plan and determine if changes are needed. If certain activities aggravate your arthritis, cut down or eliminate these activities to help minimize your symptoms. Some alternative therapies appear to help arthritis pain. Always talk to you doctor before trying any alternative treatments as they may interfere with your overall treatment plan.

Mayo Clinic Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences Mayo Clinic School of Continuous Professional Development During the physical exam, your doctor will check your affected joint for tenderness, swelling, redness and flexibility. To get pictures of the affected joint, your doctor might recommend: Cartilage doesn't show up on X-ray images, but cartilage loss is revealed by a narrowing of the space between the bones in your joint. An X-ray can also show bone spurs around a joint. An uses radio waves and a strong magnetic field to produce detailed images of bone and soft tissues, including cartilage. An isn't commonly needed to diagnose osteoarthritis but can help provide more information in complex cases. Analyzing your blood or joint fluid can help confirm the diagnosis. Although there's no blood test for osteoarthritis, certain tests can help rule out other causes of joint pain, such as rheumatoid arthritis. Your doctor might use a needle to draw fluid from an affected joint. The fluid is then tested for inflammation and to determine whether your pain is caused by gout or an infection rather than osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis can't be reversed, but treatments can reduce pain and help you move better. Medications that can help relieve osteoarthritis symptoms, primarily pain, include: Acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) has been shown to help some people with osteoarthritis who have mild to moderate pain. Taking more than the recommended dose of acetaminophen can cause liver damage. Over-the-counter , such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and naproxen sodium (Aleve, others), taken at the recommended doses, typically relieve osteoarthritis pain. Stronger are available by prescription. can cause stomach upset, cardiovascular problems, bleeding problems, and liver and kidney damage. as gels, applied to the skin over the affected joint, have fewer side effects and may relieve pain just as well. Normally used as an antidepressant, this medication is also approved to treat chronic pain, including osteoarthritis pain. A physical therapist can show you exercises to strengthen the muscles around your joint, increase your flexibility and reduce pain. Regular gentle exercise that you do on your own, such as swimming or walking, can be equally effective. An occupational therapist can help you discover ways to do everyday tasks without putting extra stress on your already painful joint. For instance, a toothbrush with a large grip could make brushing your teeth easier if you have osteoarthritis in your hands. A bench in your shower could help relieve the pain of standing if you have knee osteoarthritis. For some people, arthritis damages one side of the knee more than the other side. This can cause your knee to bow inward or outward. Removing or adding a wedge of bone in your upper shinbone or lower thighbone can help straighten out this bowing and shift your weight to the undamaged part of your knee joint. Hip prostheses are designed to mimic the ball-and-socket action of your hip joint. During hip replacement surgery, your surgeon removes the diseased or damaged parts of your hip joint and inserts the artificial joint. One of the most common reasons for knee replacement surgery is severe pain from joint damage caused by wear-and-tear arthritis (osteoarthritis). Osteoarthritis can erode the slick cartilage that helps your knee joint move smoothly. An artificial knee joint has metal alloy caps for your thighbone and shinbone, and high-density plastic to replace damaged cartilage. If conservative treatments don't help, you may want to consider procedures such as: Injections of corticosteroid medications may relieve pain in your joint. During this procedure your doctor numbs the area around your joint, then places a needle into the space within your joint and injects medication. The number of cortisone injections you can receive each year is generally limited to three or four injections, because the medication can worsen joint damage over time. Injections of hyaluronic acid may offer pain relief by providing some cushioning in your knee, though some research suggests these injections offer no more relief than a placebo. Hyaluronic acid is similar to a component normally found in your joint fluid. If osteoarthritis has damaged one side of your knee more than the other, an osteotomy might be helpful. In a knee osteotomy, a surgeon cuts across the bone either above or below the knee, and then removes or adds a wedge of bone. This shifts your body weight away from the worn-out part of your knee. In joint replacement surgery (arthroplasty), your surgeon removes your damaged joint surfaces and replaces them with plastic and metal parts. Surgical risks include infections and blood clots. Artificial joints can wear out or come loose and may need to eventually be replaced. testing new treatments, interventions and tests as a means to prevent, detect, treat or manage this disease. Learn all you can about your condition and how to manage it, especially about how lifestyle changes can affect your symptoms. Exercising and losing weight if you're overweight are important ways to lessen the joint pain and stiffness of osteoarthritis. Low-impact exercise can increase your endurance and strengthen the muscles around your joint, making your joint more stable. Try walking, bicycling or water aerobics. If you feel new joint pain, stop. New pain that lasts for hours after you exercise probably means you've overdone it, not that you've caused damage or that you should stop exercising. Try again a day or two later at a lower level of intensity. Carrying extra weight increases the stress on your weight-bearing joints, such as your knees and your hips. Even minor weight loss can relieve some pressure and reduce your pain. Talk to a dietitian about healthy ways to lose weight. Tai chi and yoga involve gentle exercises and stretches combined with deep breathing. Many people use these therapies to reduce stress in their lives, and research suggests that tai chi and yoga might reduce osteoarthritis pain and improve movement. Make sure the yoga you choose is a gentle form and that your instructor knows which of your joints are affected. Avoid moves that cause pain in your joints. Both heat and cold can relieve pain and swelling in your joint. Heat, especially moist heat, can help muscles relax and ease pain. Cold can relieve muscle aches after exercise and decrease muscle spasms. Topical capsaicin, a chili pepper extract, applied to your skin over an arthritic joint might help some people. You might have to apply it three to four times a day for several weeks before you see a benefit. Some people can't tolerate the irritation. Wash your hands well after applying capsaicin cream. Shoe inserts or other devices might help reduce pain when you stand or walk. These devices can support your joint to help take pressure off it. Assistive devices can help relieve stress on your joints. A cane takes weight off your knee or hip as you walk. Hold the cane in the hand opposite the leg that hurts. Gripping and grabbing tools may make it easier to work in the kitchen if you have osteoarthritis in your fingers. Check catalogs or medical supply stores or ask your doctor or occupational therapist about assistive devices. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS). This uses a low-voltage electrical current to relieve pain. It provides short-term relief for some people with knee and hip osteoarthritis. Simple tips for staying active and mobile with osteoarthritis Complementary and alternative medicine treatments that have shown promise for osteoarthritis include: Some studies indicate that acupuncture can relieve pain and improve function in people who have knee osteoarthritis. During acupuncture, hair-thin needles are inserted into your skin at precise spots on your body. Studies have been mixed on these nutritional supplements. A few have found benefits for people with osteoarthritis, while most indicate that these supplements work no better than a placebo. Glucosamine and chondroitin can interact with blood thinners such as warfarin and cause bleeding problems. This nutritional supplement — a mixture of avocado and soybean oils — is widely used in Europe to treat knee and hip osteoarthritis. It acts as an anti-inflammatory, and some studies have shown it can slow or even prevent joint damage. Omega-3s, found in fatty fish and fish oil supplements, might help relieve pain and improve function. Talk to your doctor about supplements you're considering. Glucosamine: Does it protect cartilage in osteoarthritis? Your ability to cope despite pain and disability caused by osteoarthritis often determines how much of an impact osteoarthritis will have on your life. Talk to your doctor if you're feeling frustrated, because he or she may have ideas about how to cope or refer you to someone who can help. You might start by seeing your primary care doctor, who might refer you to a doctor who specializes in joint disorders (rheumatologist) or orthopedic surgery.

Many people knowingly or otherwise are wearing incorrect footwear; understanding its effects on the body and choosing the right pair can help prevent problems. , Consultant Orthopaedic & Joint Replacement Surgeon, S L Raheja Hospital, Mahim-A Fortis Associate, shares some important inputs about the right footwear to wear.

They also increase the risk of ankle sprains. Prolonged use of high heels can cause shortening of calf muscles, also resulting in foot pain. They also put increased stress on the Knees, Hips and Spine, causing related issues. For regular wear, avoid wearing heels more than 2 inches. Also Read - Strenuous physical activities may actually reduce your risk of knee osteoarthritis, say experts If you are suffering from , avoid wearing stiff or rigid shoes and high heels. Research shows that flexible footwear with a low heel (0.5 inches) reduces the load on the knees. Longstanding Diabetes can lead to nerve damage, which causes numbness in the feet. As a result, one may not feel minor cuts or blisters, which can rapidly progress to serious infection. Regular foot inspection for redness, blisters or cuts and use of specialised soft footwear can help prevent serious complications amongst Diabetics. Have the length and width of your feet measured while buying new footwear, as your size can change with time. It should be measured in the evening as the feet swell a little towards the end of the day. There should be about half an inch space between your longest toe and tip of the shoe. The widest part of your foot must fit within the widest part of the footwear. There should be no crowding or pinching of the toes. If the shoe is shorter than the foot, it can result in toe deformities. Narrow footwear can cause Corns or Bunions. If the shoe is too big, it may result in blisters and pain due to sliding. You should feel comfortable in the footwear. Walk around the store with the new pair to check for comfort. The footwear should be well cushioned to reduce the impact when your feet strike the ground. Remember, the shoe must conform to your foot and not the other way around! Choose a shoe with a squared or rounded toe-box. A pointed toe-box can result in Corns, Callosities, Bunions, toe deformities and blisters. The arch of the shoe should complement the arch of your foot. The heel counter (back of the shoe) should be firm enough to resist squeezing-in so it can support the heel well. The shoe must bend at the toe-box and not at the shank (arch area). If your footwear shows worn out tread patterns, asymmetrically worn out heel, which are obvious defects or signs of wear and tear, then it is time to change your footwear. If your previously comfortable shoe is now causing pain or a change in your walking, it may be a sign of wear.

Thank your spine, a stack of little bones called vertebrae along the center of your back, from your seat to your neck. It supports your head, shoulders, and upper body. Your spine plays another key role: The vertebrae make a tunnel for your spinal cord. That's the set of nerves that connect your brain to most of your body. A cushion called a disk sits between each of your vertebrae, so they don't scrape against each other. As you age, the disks start to dry out. If you put too much stress on your back, a disk may tear or break. Doctors call this a herniated disk. You may not notice. But your arms or legs might hurt, or they could feel numb or tingly. Usually, exercise and painkillers help. If not, you may need an operation. It's the result of the gradual breakdown in your neck as you get older. You could get a slipped disk there, or the vertebrae may sprout extra bone called spurs to try to boost strength. The ligaments that connect the vertebrae can get stiff and tight. Regardless of the cause, your neck may hurt or be harder to move. If disks or vertebrae squeeze nerves and nerve roots a lot, you could have permanent damage. Your vertebrae have slippery tissue on each end that helps your back flex without friction. If that cartilage gets rough or wears down, the vertebrae start to rub against each other, and it makes your back painful or stiff. Women are more prone than men to get osteoarthritis in their backs, and it tends to get worse over time. Your doctor can't reverse it. But painkillers, therapy, and exercise help ease the symptoms. Your spine has spaces in it for your spinal cord and the nerves that branch out from it. When those spaces shrink, bones can press against nerves. You might not even notice it, but any time nerves are messed with, you could have pain, tingling, or numbness, or your muscles might seem weak. Osteoarthritis is the most common cause of spinal stenosis. When it's severe, a surgeon goes in and makes more room for the nerves. If pain shoots down from your lower back, through your bottom, and into your leg, the culprit may be your sciatic nerve. A herniated disk, bone spur, or some other spine problem can put pressure on it. Doctors call this sciatica. It usually affects only one side of your body. Hot packs, cold packs, stretching, and painkillers can help you feel better, but you may need a doctor to fix the cause. Sometimes, cancer spreads from the spot where it starts to form a new growth in your spine. Lung, breast, prostate, and bone cancers are more likely to go there. A few non-cancer conditions can create a spine tumor, too. Your back might hurt, with the pain spreading through your body. Your arms or legs might be numb or weak. Part of your body could even be paralyzed. Your doctor may recommend surgery, radiation, or chemo. Scoliosis is one of the conditions that can twist your spine out of shape. The most common type affects children during their growth spurt before puberty, bending the spine sideways. If your child has scoliosis, their shoulders might be uneven, or one shoulder blade might stick out more than the other. Nobody knows what causes this. Scoliosis can get worse and cause problems, but a brace may help prevent that and the need for surgery to correct it. This condition bends your spine forward. It usually happens when your vertebrae crack or mash down. Older women get it most often, but it can also affect children whose spines develop wrong. It can cause pain and other problems, and in severe cases, it bends your whole body out of shape. Depending on how curved your spine is, treatment might include painkillers, exercise, or surgery. This type of arthritis typically starts off making your low back and hips stiff and sore, especially in the morning. Over time, it can spread up your spine and to other joints and organs. Vertebrae and bones in your rib cage could fuse, leaving you hunched over. Young men get it more often than women, and it may run in families. Early treatment with exercise and medication helps slow the progress. An injury most often comes from an accident (like a fall, car crash, or sports mishap) or from a gunshot. In most cases, the spinal cord gets bruised, or part of its blood supply is cut off. That may keep your brain from controlling part of your body, so it can be very serious. The higher on your spine, the more of your body is affected. Your chance of getting better depends on how bad the injury is. Accidents and injuries can also break bones. When that happens to one of the top seven vertebrae, just below your skull, it's called a broken neck; farther down is a broken back. Bone loss because of age can make your back weak, too, and you might get a break that happens slowly over time. In that case, a back brace or surgery may help. Broken vertebrae could also hurt your spinal cord. Vertebrae might slide sideways, so that they don't line up with the ones above and below them. Spondylolisthesis is a main cause of lower back pain. It happens as your body ages, but it also can affect young people who do sports that stress the lower back, like football, gymnastics, and weightlifting. Rest should help. If the pain keeps up, you may need surgery. The nerves that branch out from your spine in your lower back help your brain control your legs and the organs in your pelvis. A herniated disk, fracture, or other condition could put pressure on this group of nerves, called the cauda equina, causing this rare but dangerous ailment. You need surgery right away to restore any loss of feeling, movement, or control of your bladder and bowels. In rare cases, a little fluid-filled sac called a cyst can form in your spinal cord. It could happen when brain tissue pushes down from your skull into your spinal cord, or from an injury or tumor. Syringomyelia may not give you any problems. But if the cyst keeps growing, it can injure your spinal cord, and you could end up needing surgery. If you're lucky, a spine condition doesn't do anything you notice. But if you do feel something wrong, pay attention. Call right away if your arms or legs feel weak or numb or you suddenly can't hold your pee or poop. Check with your doctor if you've had cancer or if you have pain that doesn't come from hard work, doesn't go away, hurts more at night, or gets worse.

If you have any questions, you should ask your GP or other relevant health professional. The trapezium is the cube-shaped bone in your wrist that is joined to the base of your thumb (trapeziometacarpal joint). is the most common type of arthritis, where there is gradual wear and tear of a joint. Osteoarthritis eventually wears away the normal cartilage covering the surface of the joint. The bone underneath becomes damaged, causing joint pain, stiffness and weakness. The main benefit of surgery is to relieve pain and so improve how your thumb works. A splint often helps by restricting the movement of your thumb but you may find that a splint makes it difficult for you to perform normal activities. A steroid injection into the joint can reduce pain in most people but the symptoms usually come back after several weeks or months. It is possible to replace the joint with an artificial joint made of metal and plastic but most thumb joint replacements have a high failure rate and can also cause pain. For young and active people with no arthritis below the trapezium, it may be better to have an arthrodesis (where the thumb bones are permanently fixed together using screws). The operation usually takes an hour to 90 minutes. Your surgeon will make a small cut on the back of your hand at the base of your thumb, and remove the trapezium. Your surgeon may construct a ligament to connect the thumb to your wrist using a tendon that runs over the trapezium. damage to the artery that passes near to the trapezium severe pain, stiffness and loss of use of your hand The bandage or cast will be removed after 4 to 6 weeks. Regular exercise should help you to return to normal activities as soon as possible. Before you start exercising, ask the healthcare team or your GP for advice. Your thumb should continue to improve over the next year as you get back a good range of movement. Osteoarthritis at the base of your thumb can cause pain when you use your thumb and prevent you from performing normal activities. A trapeziectomy can relieve the pain and so improve how your thumb works.

Cervical disc degeneration occurs when a healthy disc in the cervical or neck region begins to deteriorate rapidly, usually as a result of aging. As a result, the discs in the spine become dehydrated, affecting both the flexibility and height of the disc. The disc or discs can cause pain, limit range of motion and lead to compression of the nerve. Nonoperative treatment may be helpful in relieving symptoms. However, depending on the diagnosis, surgery, such as fusion, may be necessary to relieve pressure and pain. Spinal stenosis causes narrowing in your spine. The narrowing puts pressure on your nerves and spinal cord and can cause pain. Spinal stenosis occurs mostly in people older than 50. Younger people with a spine injury or a narrow spinal canal are also at risk. Diseases such as arthritis and scoliosis can cause spinal stenosis, too. Symptoms might appear gradually or not at all. They include: Numbness, weakness, cramping, or pain in your arms or legs Doctors diagnose spinal stenosis with a physical exam and imaging tests. Treatments include medications, physical therapy, braces and surgery. NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases One of the most common neck conditions that occurs with age is cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM). Over time, the normal wear-and-tear effects of aging can lead to a narrowing of the spinal canal. This compresses the spinal cord. CSM can cause a variety of symptoms, including pain, numbness and weakness. Spinal cord compression is a very common neck condition affecting older people in the United States. Symptoms usually begin after the age of 50, but can occur earlier if there was an injury to the spine at a younger age. Many people with CSM will have steady progression of their disease. Once symptoms start, they tend to continue. Typically, the disease progresses slowly over several years. In about five to 20 percent of people, CSM worsens more rapidly. Neck pain may result from abnormalities in the soft tissues—the muscles, ligaments and nerves—as well as in bones and joints of the spine. The most common causes of neck pain are soft-tissue abnormalities due to injury or prolonged wear and tear. In rare instances, infection or tumors may cause neck pain. In some people, neck problems may be the source of pain in the upper back, shoulders, or arms. When the spinal cord is slowly compressed, people may develop symptoms such as: Difficulty walking: loss of balance and/or a wide-based gait characterized by clumsy, staggering, tottering movements Weakness and coordination problems: trouble lifting objects or dropping things Generally used to describe an unsuccessful surgery for back pain, the cause of failed spinal surgery may include: Pain is the most obvious sign of this condition. While treatment may be difficult, new treatment options are available and should be discussed with your surgeon. A herniated, or slipped, disc occurs when all or part of a disc is forced through a weakened part of the disc. This may place pressure on nearby nerves or the spinal cord. The disc may move out of place (herniate) or break open (rupture) from injury or strain. When this happens, there may be pressure on the spinal nerves. This can lead to pain, numbness or weakness. The lower back (lumbar area) of the spine is the most common area for a slipped disc. The neck (cervical) discs are sometimes affected. The upper-to-mid-back (thoracic) discs are rarely involved. A herniated disc is one cause of radiculopathy, any disease that affects the spinal nerve roots. Slipped discs occur more often in middle-aged and older men, usually after strenuous activity. Other risk factors include conditions present at birth that affect the size of the lumbar spinal canal. The pain most often occurs on one side of the body. With a slipped disc in your lower back, you may have sharp pain in one part of the leg, hip or buttocks and numbness in other parts. You may also feel pain or numbness on the back of the calf or sole of the foot. The same leg may also feel weak. With a slipped disc in your neck, you may have pain when moving your neck, deep pain near or over the shoulder blade or pain that moves to the upper arm, forearm and fingers. You can also have numbness along your shoulder, elbow, forearm and fingers. When bending backward or walking more than a few yards You may also have weakness in certain muscles. Sometimes, you may not notice it until your doctor examines you. In other cases, you will notice that you have a hard time lifting your leg or arm, standing on your toes on one side, squeezing tightly with one of your hands or other problems. The pain, numbness or weakness often goes away or improves over weeks or months. Surgery may be an option if your symptoms do not go away with other treatments and time. Kyphosis is a curving of the spine that causes a bowing or rounding of the back, which leads to a hunchback or slouching posture. Kyphosis can occur at any age, although it is rare at birth. Adolescent kyphosis, also known as Scheuermann’s disease, is caused by the wedging together of several bones of the spine (vertebrae) in a row. The cause of Scheuermann’s disease is unknown. Degenerative diseases of the spine (such as arthritis or disc degeneration) Fractures caused by osteoporosis (osteoporotic compression fractures) Slipping of one vertebra forward on another (spondylolisthesis) Kyphosis can also be seen with scoliosis. Each cause has its own risk factors. Instability in the spine is a general term for abnormal movement between vertebrae, often caused by disc degeneration. As a result, nerves become irritated and the patient experiences such symptoms as pain, a sensation that the back is “catching,” spasms or loss of motion when extending or flexing. Some people have neck pain that may radiate into the shoulder and arm. This type of pain is often caused by an injury near the root of a spinal nerve. A nerve root injury is sometimes referred to as a “pinched” nerve. The medical term for this condition is cervical radiculopathy. Cervical radiculopathy pain travels down the arm in the area of the involved nerve. Pain is usually described as sharp. There can also be a “pins and needles” sensation or even complete numbness. In addition, there may be a feeling of weakness with certain activities. Symptoms can be worsened with certain movements, like extending or straining the neck or turning the head. These symptoms are often made better by placing the hand on the head and stretching the shoulder. The majority of patients with cervical radiculopathy get better with time and never need surgery, or even any treatment at all. Some patients will have the pain go away quickly over days to weeks, while others take longer. It is also not uncommon for cervical radiculopathy to come back at some time in the future. Some patients do develop persistent symptoms and require evaluation and treatment for the arm pain or weakness. There are several surgical procedures for radiculopathy. The procedure that is right for you will depend on many factors, most importantly the type of problem you have. Scoliosis causes a sideways curve of your backbone, or spine. These curves are often S- or C-shaped. Scoliosis is most common in late childhood and the early teens, when children grow fast. Girls are more likely to have it than boys. It can run in families. Symptoms include leaning to one side and having uneven shoulders and hips. Doctors use your medical and family history, a physical exam, and imaging tests to diagnose scoliosis. Treatment depends on your age, how much more you're like to grow, how much curving there is, and whether the curve is temporary or permanent. People with mild scoliosis might only need checkups to see if the curve is getting worse. Others might need to wear a brace or have surgery. NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases Spina bifida is a neural tube defect—a type of birth defect of the brain, spine or spinal cord. It happens if the spinal column of the fetus doesn’t close completely during the first month of pregnancy. This can damage the nerves and spinal cord. Screening tests during pregnancy can check for spina bifida. Sometimes it is discovered only after the baby is born. The symptoms of spina bifida vary from person to person. Most people with spina bifida are of normal intelligence. Some people need assistive devices such as braces, crutches or wheelchairs. They may have learning difficulties, urinary and bowel problems or a buildup of fluid in the brain. The exact cause of spina bifida is unknown. It seems to run in families. Taking folic acid can reduce the risk of having a baby with spina bifida. Women who could become pregnant should take it daily. Source: NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke A number of problems can change the structure of the spine or damage the vertebrae and surrounding tissue. They include: Conditions, such as ankylosing spondylitis and scoliosis Bone changes that come with age, such as spinal stenosis and herniated discs Spinal diseases often cause pain when bone changes put pressure on the spinal cord or nerves. They can also limit movement. Treatments differ by disease, but sometimes they include back braces and surgery. Source: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases Spondylolisthesis is a condition in which a bone in the spine slips out of the proper position onto the bone below it. In children, spondylolisthesis usually occurs between the fifth bone in the lower back and the first bone in the pelvis area. It is often due to a birth defect in that area of the spine or sudden injury. In adults, the most common cause is abnormal wear on the cartilage and bones (such as arthritis). Bone disease and fractures can also cause spondylolisthesis. Certain sports—such as gymnastics, weight lifting and football—put a great deal of stress on the bones in the lower back. They also require that the athlete constantly overstretch the spine. This can lead to a stress fracture on one or both sides of the vertebra. A stress fracture can cause a spinal bone to become weak and shift out of place. Spondylolisthesis may vary from mild to severe. A person with spondylolisthesis may have no symptoms. The condition can produce increased lordosis (also called swayback), but in later stages may result in kyphosis (roundback) as the upper spine falls off the lower spine. Pain, numbness, or tingling in the thighs and buttocks Before we can determine a course of treatment for your spinal condition or complex spine deformity, our orthopedic surgeons need to evaluate your condition. Our diagnostic process includes a physical examination and neurologic exam, which may include the use of lights or reflex hammers to assess motor, sensory and reflex skills. During your visit, you and your doctor will discuss your current condition, limitations and medical history. Your physician also reviews any prior imaging or operative reports including X-rays, MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) or CT (computed tomography) scans. These imaging reports give your physician detailed images of any deterioration or abnormality in your bones or soft tissues. Your doctor may order further testing, if necessary, including additional X-rays, MRI, CT scan, EMG, myelogram and/or bone density. An EMG uses tiny electrodes to send signals to your muscles, and records their response. This test helps your doctor evaluate the health of your muscles and nerve cells. A myelogram involves the use of a contrast dye to further highlight areas of concern.

99f2ebd8-6a04-4ec6-9a14-aa36298e1290,"What everyone ought to know about Finger Dislocation We’ve all experienced finger injuries in our lifetime and for a magnitude of reasons…ranging from something as simple as a bruise or cut when preparing a meal in the kitchen, or for a more serious one such as it being crushed in the way of slamming door. However, a Finger Dislocation is a totally different type of injury. As the word dislocation suggests displacement or dislodgement of the finger bone from the joints. Yes, Finger Dislocation is a much more distressing condition which requires immediate medical intervention and more so by an Orthopaedic Specialist. In this post, we’ll look at some of the causes, visible symptoms, and the treatment options should you find yourself in the unfortunate circumstance of having a Dislocated Finger. The cause of a Finger Dislocation is either “jamming” your finger on the end of the fingertip with an excessive force, or it may be caused if your finger becomes overextended in a particular direction. This can happen when experiencing a fall…landing wrongly on the outstretched hand perhaps trying to desperately get hold of something to avert the fall. One of the most common cause resulting in Finger Dislocation is a Sports Injury. It can happen when you’re playing a variety of sports such as basketball or baseball and having the ball jam your finger. Finger Dislocation is also common in the game of cricket where hands and wrists are at high risk of impact. Or it can be getting your finger caught in sports equipment or other type of equipment and pull your finger out of its normal placement. Typically, when you have dislocated your finger you’re going to know it. It’s visible and not a subtle injury that you may question. Your finger will look either crooked or bent in an odd shape and it will be quite painful and distressing followed by swelling. You may also experience numbness or tingling in the finger and the finger will start to look pales as well. In the worst scenarios, depending on how severe the finger injury was, it even may break/rupture the skin when you have a finger dislocation. Any sign of a finger dislocation calls for a trip to an Orthopaedic or Emergency Room Doctor. You need to have the finger put back into place before any permanent damage is done. The longer you wait to receive treatment, it can make it more difficult to put it back into place or can cause irreversible damage. Before you get to the doctor, make sure to remove any items of jewelry, watch, etc from the injured finger if you have any on. Travel to the doctor’s office with ice on your hand. Once you arrive at the medical center or hospital, they will most likely give you a local anaesthetic or some pain medications via IV or mouth so that the doctor can put your finger back into its proper place. Thereafter, you may receive either a splint or have your finger taped to the healthy one next to it. This will help it to heal and prevent any chance of it slipping back out of place during healing. Treatment options would vary with the severity of the injury. In cases where torn ligaments and broken bones are involved then surgery and K-wire Fixation may be carried out.

When it comes to lifting, moving, writing, and doing everyday chores, your biceps go through a lot of movement. If you’re doing too much you can begin to notice biceps pain start to creep in and you may think it’s just overuse of your muscles. However, it is important to know that your biceps can be injured through lifting heavier than normal objects, overusing the muscle or other ways. One of the injuries you can develop is called biceps tendinitis. Discover below what biceps tendinitis treatment is available and how you can tell if that is what you have going on. The main cause of tendinitis is due to overuse of the bicep muscle. This could be because you’re a baseball player, you lift heavy objects on a daily basis or you love to swim. You can have this show up in your bicep, elbow or shoulder. It is generally caused by the repetitive motions being done over and over by your arm. So if you have a job that is a repetitive movement, or if your favorite sport does the same, you can have a cause of tendonitis start to show up. You may have biceps pain start in one or both of your arms depending on which arm is affected. Pain is generally located in the shoulder or elbow and not in both places at the same time. You may notice a sharp pain if you have a tear in the tendon or even bruising and swelling. You may also notice pain during movement that has caused the problem in the first place. If you have torn the tendon, then you may require surgery to fix the problem. There are a few different options for biceps tendinitis treatment. You can start with ice packs on the affected area. This can help to reduce any inflammation in the joint or bicep area that is causing the pain. You can also take an over the counter anti-inflammatory to help make sure it reduces inflammation and the pain. Resting the arm that is hurting is also highly advised. Try to take some time off of the activity that caused the pain so that your arm can rest and heal. Biceps pain can be quite difficult to deal with, especially when it starts to affect your daily life. Be sure to take preventative measures if you have a repetitive job or task done each day. Change up your routine and get plenty of rest to make sure you don’t injure your arm further. Children are always playing, jumping around, running and generally having a great time. However, there is an injury that can occur to a child that happens suddenly and is cause for a visit to the pediatrician. The commonly termed phrase is pulled elbow or nursemaids elbow, but it is known in the medical community as a radial head subluxation. What is that and what can you do to prevent it from happening to your child? Here are a few things you need to know about this common injury and how you can keep it from happening. Basically, nursemaids elbow is when the joint of the elbow is pulled partially out. The ligaments around the elbow and the bones in the arm are still growing and are not as tight as the ligaments in adults. This can lead to young children suffering from this injury where they have a small separation of their radiocapitellar joint. Some children have ligaments that are very loose around this joint and thus can suffer from this injury multiple times. The nursemaids elbow or pulled elbow injury can happen multiple different ways. If children are playing with their friends and someone pulls on their arm too hard it can pop out of place. If you or their care giver is holding their hand and you must pull them quickly out of harm’s way, it can cause the joint to dislocate. When friends or family swing your child around by their arms it can also cause this radial head subluxation to take place. Another way that it can be done is if you’re holding the hand of your child and they happen to pull back on you rather harshly or sometimes even when they fall down and are still holding your hand. It is very rare that it happens from a fall such as this but it does. While it can be a common injury to your children, you want to make sure to try and prevent it as much as possible. Be sure you do not swing your child around while only holding their arms or hands. This can be an easy way to have the pulled elbow injury pop up. Also pick your children up by grasping them under the arms. Do not try to lift them up by their hands or arms. Make sure you also avoid tugging on their arms or hand as this can cause nursemaids elbow as well. The biceps brachii or commonly know as biceps are a two headed muscle that lies between the shoulder and the elbow. Its role is to function as a tool to facilitate bending of the elbow and the rotating of the forearm. A strong biceps muscle will also help to stabilise the entire shoulder. Biceps are attached to the bones by biceps tendons and if the tendons are injured, the attachment capability is severely reduced. This will result in an eventual loss of strength and the inability to rotate the forearm. Biceps tendon tears are rather common injuries especially at the elbow. Injuries to the biceps tendon will cause impairment due to the wide usage of the biceps muscle. The initial stage of treatment is non-surgical in nature. The main aim of it is to bring down the pain and swelling. As such, pain relief medication and ice is often used to fufill the objectives. It is important for swelling to dissociate before surgical treatment is performed as the blood and fluids must be drained away. Surgical treatment involves the reattachment of the biceps tendon. Once the swelling has gone down, surgery is performed immediately. This is because of a 3 weeks healing window that the biceps has. During the 3 weeks, retraction of the torn tendon is minimized. If surgery is performed a month later, the retraction will result in the inability of the tendon to reattach itself. An open surgery will be conducted and the torn tendon will be debrided and reattached back using sterile sutures that are self-dissolving. There will be 1 incision made at the elbow crease to retrieve the torn bendon and the other incision will be made at the back of the forearm in order to secure the reattachment. Due to the difficulties involved in this 2 step procedure, a new 1 step procedure has been developed. In this newly created process, only 1 incision will be made at the skin crease and it will be secured using an Endo button. The Endo button is a small piece of metallic button that bolts the tendon within the tuberosity bone tunnel. The entire healing process will take roughly 6 weeks. Post-surgery treatment will require the arm to be immobilised using an elbow sling. A physical therapist will also be assigned to teach the patient simple exercises that can be done at home. It is important to get the joint moving again to prevent scarring of tissues and increase the range of motion. Causes And Symptoms Of Scaphoid Fracture Of The Wrist A scaphoid fracture is essentially a break in the bone located at the thumb of the wrist. First and foremost, there are eight carpal bones in our wrist and the one that is most prone to a fracture is the scaphoid bone. Scaphoid bone fractures require a timely diagnosis, as they need to be treated in order to recover. When proper treatment is administered, healing will be speedy. Without proper treatment, the patient may suffer from long-term consequences such as stiffness and even arthritis as the bone supply in the scaphoid is scarce. In this article, let’s look at some of the causes and symptoms of this fracture. The most common cause of a scaphoid fracture is when using it to cushion a fall. It is our natural instinct to shield the bulk of our body from an impact by stretching out our hand. The fingers are weak in tension and the impact coupled with the weight of our body is more than sufficient to fracture the scaphoid bone. They can also be twisted and broken during high impact sports such as basketball, rugby and soccer. Goalkeepers especially are vulnerable, as they have to constantly stop balls that travel at speeds up to 200km/h. Unlike other forms of fracture where bruising and swelling will be present, a scaphoid fracture do not exhibit these symptoms. Instead, there will only be minor symptoms such as pain and tenderness only when you are touching the thumb, the inability to grip something hard, the inability to twist the wrist and/or thumb as well as light bruises. The symptoms are pretty similar to a sprained wrist and patients often have the mentality that it will recover on its own. There will not be any deformation at the wrist area at all. If the symptoms persist after a day, it may be a sign of fracture and medical attention must be sought immediately. When a scaphoid fracture is diagnosed and identified using x-ray, treatment will commence immediately. There is a risk that the fracture may develop into a nonunion which is essentially the inability for both bones to heal together or one of the bones losing its blood supply and dying off. A scaphoid fracture is a complex injury that will bring nothing but trouble. However, advances in the medical industry have seen an increase in the success rates after treatment has been administered, of which minimally invasive techniques appears to be the most promising one. Kienböck’s Disease is a medical condition of uncertain etiology. What this means is that the exact cause is unknown. This disease involves the collapse of the lunate bone located is the wrist and is usually unilateral. The blood supply to the lunate will then be hindered and without blood, the bone will die off. This is because blood contains the necessary nutrients and oxygen that the bone cells need to grow, repair and sustain itself. When this supply is cut off, osteonecrosis will occur, leading to painful wrist and the eventual development of arthritis. Patients who suffer from Kienböck’s Disease have no idea that they have it. This is due to the similarity between it and a normal sprained wrist. There will be pain and swelling will be present at the wrist region. Slowly, the flexibility of the wrist will be reduced and stiffness will start to onset due to the reduced range of motion available. Over time, the strength of the wrist will decrease and it will be difficult to clench the fist together. Despite the advanced medical technological in this era, there is still no complete cure for Kienböck’s Disease. However, there are generally 2 kinds of treatment methods namely the non-surgical ones and the surgical ones. Since there is no cure, the ultimate aim of treatment is simply to relieve the pressure built up on the lunate and allows blood to flow properly. Non-surgical treatment is preferred during the initial stages of this disease. Treatment methods include the usage of anti-inflammatory drugs to reduce swelling and pain. Some doctors may also require their patients to use a wrist splint to prevent unwanted movements. In serious cases, a cast may be used instead of a splint. If no noticeable improvements were seen during this period, a progression into a surgical treatment may be on the table. As mentioned above, the main purpose of treatment is to relieve the pressure and reinstate proper blood flow. Revascularisation is a method that is capable of performing that. Revascularisation involves the removal of a bone that has blood vessels attached to it and reattached to the diseased bone. This reattached bone is capable of performing all the tasks that are required. Metal screws may be used to fasten the bone properly while it attaches itself over time. Each patient will respond differently to the types of treatment administered. Some patients may feel better after a non-surgical treatment while others may require surgical intervention to allow them to get the relief they need. Wrist arthroscopy is a minimally invasive surgical technique performed with the aim of diagnosing and treating existing problems with the wrist. You may be familiar with traditional surgery where the intended area is cut open, treated and stitched back. On the contrary, uses small fiber optic instruments that allows the surgeon to look inside the body and treat it with robotic arms. This will reduce the chance of infection and shorten the recovery time. Following a wrist injury, the wrist may be unable to perform to its full ability. There may be the presence of a clicking sound when you rotate it and swelling will be present. Unlike the rest of the body, the wrist is rather small in comparison. In order to properly assess and treat it, the ligaments, cartilage and bones will need to be observed in detailed. A small high definition camera will be fixed to a tiny fiber optic tube by the surgeon. Small incisions will be made at the affected site and the camera will be inserted into the back of the wrist joint. The real time images captured will be projected onto a TV screen where the surgeon is able to see magnified pictures. Different robotic arms will also be inserted through other incisions and they will be controlled by the surgeon who will then repair the injured parts accordingly. After the surgery, your wrist will be wrapped in a protective bandage and a splint to provided support and prevent unwanted movement. Since the incisions are tiny, they will close up on their own after some time and infection risks are significantly lowered. However, there are still certain risks involved. Despite the reduced risk of infection, 1% of the patients still suffer infection due to various reasons. Some patients also reported numbness which is due to the damage to the nerves. However, this will go away after some time. The next few days following the surgery, the wrist should be kept elevated in order to prevent swelling and blood clot formation. The surgery site should also be kept clean and dry to prevent any infection. Ice may be used to bring down the swelling. Recovery time will differ among patients and one way to shorten it is through the aid of physical therapy sessions. Your doctor will prescribe you simple exercises that can be performed at home in order to help regain the full range of motion and flexibility. Flexor tendon injuries as the name suggest are injuries affecting the tendons. Tendons are thick, elastic fibrous cord like structures that connects the muscles to the bones. The ability for our fingers to bend and flex is due to the flexor muscles. Flexor muscles start from our elbow down to the forearms and finally the tendons which are finally attached to the fingers. Each of our finger has two flexor tendons and that includes the thumb. The usual culprit for a flexor tendon injury is due to a deep cut in the fingers or hands which injures the flexor tendons. In this article, we will look at some of the causes and symptoms of flexor tendon injuries. Flexor tendon injuries are challenging as they cannot heal without surgical treatment. Unlike other forms of injuries, tendons need to be brought together and stitched back surgically in order for healing to occur. Secondly, careful postoperative management needs to be planned in detail as immobilisation can cause rupture of the tendon. Lastly, the bulkiness of the tendon needs to be reduced but scarring will make it almost impossible. Sports activities are the main culprit of flexor tendon injuries. The most popular sports are soccer, rugby and wrestling. In fact, there is a term “jersey finger” that is used by athletes due to their repeated occurrence with jersey wearing activities. Jersey finger occurs when a player is grabbing another player’s jersey and finger and a sudden change in direction is initiated, pulling the tendon off the bone. Other activities include rock climbing which requires a lot of finger strength. Some medical conditions may also lead to a decrease of strength in the flexor tendons, making them more prone to tearing. Patients who are suffering from rheumatoid arthritis will have weak tendons and in serious cases, the tendon can tear without any prior notice. The patient will only realise it when he cannot bend his finger anymore. Symptoms will vary among patients but the most common signs include: Flexor tendon injuries are difficult to manage due to its complex nature. Therefore, it is important to seek medical advice immediately when you suspect your might have suffered a jersey finger injury. If surgery is really required, do not worry. Surgery often brings in good return of finger functions. Fingertip injuries are a common form of injury at various places such as home, office and outdoors. They can occur due to different reasons with the most common being a sudden trauma, during food preparation and cleaning. There are many different forms of fingertip injuries and they can exist as tearing, crushing or even amputating in nature. Due to the importance of our fingertip to our daily lives, even a minor injury can be disruptive to our activities. Extreme pain is often felt due to the rich amount of nerves present. In this article, we will look at the treatment for fingertip injuries. The treatment methods for fingertip injuries differ from the type of injury sustained. In mild cases where only part of the tissue is removed, a simple dressing is all that is required. The wound needs to be properly rinsed with water and cleaned with an antiseptic agent to kill off all the bacteria that are present. A gauze needs to be placed over the wound to prevent direct contact with the atmosphere and promote healing. For minor cases where part of the bone is exposed, the dangling flesh needs to be trimmed and sanitized. The process will be largely similar to the mild case except for the fact that stitches may be required if the wound is unable to close on its own after a couple of days. In serious cases where a large chunk of flesh is chipped off or the fingertip severed, grafts and reattachment will be required when possible. Large grafts are available for harvesting at the groin region. The patient will need to undergo surgery for the grafting process. In situations involving a severed finger, reattachment is the first option provided that the severed finger can be found and is deemed to be still able to function when reattached. The severed part of the finger needs to be placed in an ice box but not in direct contact with the ice to prevent frostbite from damaging the tissues. There are also cases of bone injuries in the form of a fracture. These broken fingers are usually at the tip of the fingers and do not affect the function of the finger but they can cause pain and tenderness. Broken finger treatment methods will usually involve the realignment of bone fragments through the use of a splint or metal implants. The fingertip sensation may be lost for a few months following a fingertip injury. Deformities may be present but these will go away when the finger is fully healed. Injuries are classified into 2 types; those that involves the flesh and those that involves the bone. , , , In our hand are 5 bones which connect the wrist to the thumbs and fingers. These are the metacarpal bones and they are located between the phalanges and carpus bones. When one of these bones breaks, it is classified as a hand fracture and a splint or cast is often required to be worn whilst the bones heal on their own. For serious cases, surgery may be required to surgically reconnect and mend them using cement. In this article, we will be looking at the causes of fracture as well as the aftercare instructions for them. Although our bones have good compressive strength, it has poor tensile strength. When sufficient force is applied, the bone can fracture and when this occurs, it is accompanied by pain, swelling and the inability to utilise it. A cast or splint will usually be placed in order to immobilise the hand as well as to prevent any unwanted stresses while it heals. In order to make the pain more bearable, your doctor will prescribe pain relief medication to be taken orally. Since this medication requires some time before it works, you should take it before the previous one wears off in order to prevent feeling any unwanted pain. In cases where inflammation is present, antibiotics will need to be consumed in order to treat the infection caused by bacteria. Always make sure that medication is taken on time to prevent any gaps in the recovery process. When you are at home, you can apply an ice pack to the fractured portion of your hand. Icing helps to decrease inflammation and the pain associated with it. It also constricts the blood vessels and help to speed up the delivery of essential nutrients required for healing. It also reduces tissue damages to the sensitive parts. However, always remember to remove your cast or splint prior to the application of ice as the cast and splint cannot get wet. In order to regain finger movement in the shortest time, you should try to work out your fingers. A hand grip is great for building up hand strength and muscle and you can use it anywhere. Hand fractures will usually require between 4 to 6 weeks for it to fully heal, but it will take an even longer time for you to regain full strength. In order to reduce this timeframe, you should make use of any possible time to gain those muscles. We are conveniently located at #02-10/11/12 Gleneagles Medical Centre.

A combination of lifestyle and genetic factors are likely to blame. However, the risk factors are so diverse that nearly everybody has one or more of them at some point in their lives. Carpal tunnel syndrome can cause , stiffness, and in the fingers and hand. There is no known way to prevent carpal tunnel, but some exercises can lower your chances of needing surgery. We spoke to , a Vermont-based physical therapist, for exercise suggestions. Here are three basic moves you can do any time of day. These stretches and exercises are simple and don’t require any equipment. You can easily do them at your desk, while waiting in line, or whenever you have a minute or two to spare. “Problems like carpal tunnel are best addressed … with stretches done throughout the day,” says Dr. DiBlasio. Protect your wrists in just a few minutes a day with these easy movements. Remember that nursery rhyme from when you were a kid? Turns out it’s a great stretch for your hands: Start with your hands together in prayer position. Spread fingers apart as far you can, then “steeple” the fingers by separating palms of hands, but keeping fingers together. “This stretches the palmar fascia, carpal tunnel structures, and median nerve, the nerve that gets irritated in a carpal tunnel syndrome,” says DiBlasio. This one is so simple even your officemates won’t notice you doing it, so you don’t have any excuses for not trying it. This is as straightforward as it sounds: shake hands like you’ve just washed them and are trying to air dry them. “Do this for a minute or two every hour to keep flexor muscles of your hands and its median nerve from getting cramped and tight during the day,” he advises. If that sounds like a lot, you could even integrate this into your hand washing routine. You washing your hands frequently, right? If not, use your carpal tunnel treatment as another reason to lather up more often and keep the flu at bay! This last exercise is the deepest stretch of the set: Place one arm straight out in front of you, elbow straight, with your wrist extended and fingers facing the floor. Spread your fingers slightly and use your other hand to apply gentle pressure to the downward-facing hand, stretching your wrist and fingers as far as you’re able. When you reach your maximum point of flexibility, hold this position for about 20 seconds. Do this two to three times on each side, and try to do this stretch every hour. After a few weeks of doing this multiple times a day, you’ll notice significant improvement in your wrist’s flexibility. Remember that stretching is an important part of any healthy routine; don’t limit your regimen to the exercises on this list. Every part of your body can benefit from the increased , movement, and mobility that stretching can help provide. Call your doctor if you think you’re experiencing carpal tunnel. Prompt treatment may help you relieve symptoms and keep the syndrome for getting worse. The exercises mentioned above should only be part of your treatment plan. Other treatments for carpal tunnel include: Your doctor may recommend surgery if these treatments don’t improve your symptoms. — — Having carpal tunnel syndrome doesn't have to be a pain.

Osteoarthritis: 15 Tips to Improve Daily Living With OA Reviewed By: Primary osteoarthritis destroys cartilage and that can make everyday activities like getting into and out of a car much more difficult. It is the most common type of arthritis and is associated with ""wear and tear"" of joints. It is different than rheumatoid arthritis, which is an autoimmune disease. Treatment can help ease certain symptoms but you may need to work around your condition. You have to be creative with how you move your body when you have arthritis. This can help limit stress on painful joints. A less painful way to get into the car involves backing into the seat slowly. Once you're sitting, swing both legs around together. You can do the same movement in reverse to get out of the car. Swing your legs out first then slide to the edge of the seat so you can stand up more easily. A beaded seat cover can help you do these movements more easily. Swivel seat cushions are also available to make it easier to get into and out of a car with osteoarthritis of the hips and knees. Doing common things that many people take for granted, including pushing microwave buttons, can be difficult for those suffering from osteoarthritis joint pain. Severe cartilage destruction means bone comes into painful contact with bone. Simple everyday activities, like eating and brushing your teeth, can be challenging. Simple aids can help you work around these challenges when you have a health condition like osteoarthritis. Try placing sponge hair rollers around the handles of your toothbrush and utensils to make holding them easier. Use a dowel or a ruler with a rubber stopper on the end to push buttons on the microwave, TV, and other appliances. Quick fixes like these make living with the disease easier. It's important to get exercise, even when you have osteoarthritis. Walking may be painful, but wearing shoes with adequate cushioning and good arch support can take the strain off of your knees. Tying shoe laces may be difficult. Elastic laces can be a big help. The first time you wear a pair of shoes with elastic laces, have someone else put them on and tie the laces for you. Leave the laces tied so you can then slip the shoes on and off easily. You can use a shoehorn if you need extra help. If you have flat feet, hammertoes, bone spurs (osteophytes), high arches, or other foot condition, see an orthopedist for treatment. You're more likely to stress joints if your gait isn't right. Wearing orthotics may help not just your feet, but your knees and hips to feel better, too. Swimming can be an ideal form of exercise for those with osteoarthritis. You're more likely to exercise when you feel well. Standing for long periods of time may be challenging when you have osteoarthritis, especially in the kitchen while preparing food and doing dishes. Use an adjustable chair or stool on wheels so you can sit instead of stand during meal prep and kitchen clean up. To minimize trips to the fridge and the pantry, use a rolling utility cart to keep food items, ingredients, and spices close by. A pizza wheel is a handle item to have on hand in the kitchen. Use it to cut not only pizza but also lasagna, sandwiches, and other foods. Using a pizza wheel is easier on joints in your hands and wrists than using a knife. Altering the way you do everyday activities can help take the pressure off of smaller joints. Use larger joints and muscles of your body, when you can, to do activities. Hips are great for closing cabinets and doors. You can also carry large items, like a laundry basket, supported on your hip to take some of the strain off your arms. Be careful with this move if you have osteoarthritis of the hip or spine. Always use two hands instead of one to carry items like pots and pans. It's good to place one hand underneath a large item and one on top or on the side for extra stability. If you're having trouble with everyday tasks, ask your doctor about osteoarthritis treatment. Medications, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), can help arthritis patients control pain and inflammation. Grocery shopping may take a lot out of you, either because you are in pain or because you don't have a lot of energy. There are more and more grocery delivery services available. Have groceries delivered to you, if possible. If you have to go shopping yourself, use the following information to make it easier. Be organized. Have a list and organize the list so you can pick up items in the store as efficiently as possible. Sit down periodically in the store if you need to rest. Lean on the shopping cart to take the strain off your body. Ask the person bagging your groceries for help taking them to the car. At home, include family members in the task of carrying groceries into the house. Once inside, put away the perishables first. You can rest if you need to before unpacking nonperishable items. Lifting something heavy while bending at the waist is a risk factor for a back injury. To lift something heavy, experts generally recommend you should squat to protect the health of your back. However, squatting can be tough on osteoarthritis knees. Doing squats is a great exercise to build up the strength in your hips and legs. If your doctor says it is safe for you, go ahead and squat, but do it right. Support your body as much as possible by holding on to a heavy piece of furniture or the edge of a countertop. Do not let your knees go beyond your ankles. Keep proper alignment to protect your knees. You can do squats over a chair in case you get too tired or have too much pain. That way you can sit down easily. People with osteoarthritis must move in ways that protect their joints. If knee osteoarthritis is severe, injections to the knee joint or knee replacement surgery may be treatment options. When you have a diagnosis like osteoarthritis, you may have to alter your routine to avoid pain and injury. When it comes to housework, avoid doing too much in one day. You don't want your symptoms to flare. Clean one room or section of the house per day to avoid overuse injuries. Bring all the cleaning solutions, dust cloths, vacuum, broom, and other supplies you need with you at once to minimize trips to and from the area where you store them. Listen to your body and take breaks when you need to. Take special care of knees if you have knee osteoarthritis. Stop and take a rest if pain or other symptoms occur while you're doing tasks. Over time, you'll develop strategies for doing the tasks you need to do safely despite your disease. Climbing up and down stairs can be tough if you have hip osteoarthritis or osteoarthritis of the knee. Patients should avoid doing activities that aggravate knee osteoarthritis, if possible. Take the elevator and avoid stairs, if you can. If you cannot avoid stairs, use the handrail for support. To minimize knee pain, favor your better leg by leading with it to go upstairs. Lead with the bad leg while going downstairs. Remember the saying, ""up with the good and down with the bad,"" to minimize symptoms. Osteoarthritis is a frustrating disease because it can affect your ability to do everyday activities. Concentrate on what you can do to avoid pain and provoking further degeneration. Armed with the right information, patients can be active and avoid common mistakes. If you're having difficulty climbing stairs or doing other activities, see your doctor to discuss treatment and minimize joint injury. Severe osteoarthritis can lead to deformity and falls. Taking a bath or a shower may be harder when you have osteoarthritis. In general, warm water is good for arthritis pain and can help ease symptoms. Stiffness and bone on bone pain from degenerative arthritis can make it more difficult to bathe, but you can work around the disease. Use a loofah or shower mitt to make it easier to reach hard to reach places. This also eases pressure on finger joints. If getting into the tub is difficult, place a towel on the edge. Sit on it and swivel around to both get into and out of the bathtub. Use a soap on a rope if you have a diagnosis of arthritis in finger joints that makes picking up soap difficult. If drying off causes pain, step into a thick robe to dry off instead of rubbing and patting dry with a towel. Drying off the usual way may affect your symptoms. Osteoarthritis is a condition that may affect the ability to do everyday activities, including sleep. Patients with arthritis may experience joint pain and swelling that may it hard to get to sleep and stay asleep. Try taking pain medication like ibuprofen, one of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), with dinner to ease arthritis pain and swelling. Take a nice warm bath or shower before turning in for the night. People can use a heated blanket, hot water bottle, or heat pad to ease joint discomfort. Joints like hips may be prone to be more painful when lying down. Heat should lessen pain and make it easier to fall asleep, especially if you have osteoarthritis of the hip. Tasks in the kitchen like opening cans or jars and chopping and peeling vegetables can be difficult if you have painful finger joints from osteoarthritis. People with the disease can learn to develop new habits and work around their symptoms. Use an electric can opener instead of a manual one. Reach for a cap gripper to open jars more easily. Choose knives, peelers, and other implements that have paddled handles. Some people with osteoarthritis may find it helpful to cook in batches and freeze meals ahead of time so they have to cook less frequently. Healthy frozen meals from the grocery store are another option if your joints are too swollen or painful to cook. Any time you can keep from stressing your joints with osteoarthritis, take measures to do so. Patients with osteoarthritis in finger joints and wrists may have a hard time with tasks in the bathroom like brushing teeth, flossing, and turning on and off faucets. Use an electric toothbrush instead of a manual toothbrush. Use a dental floss holder to minimize finger strain that can occur while flossing. Put special grips on faucets to make them easier to turn on and off. If sore hips make it difficult to use the toilet, install a raised toilet seat to help. Install grab bars around the toilet and in the shower stall for extra support and to minimize the risk of falls. There are even special aids to make it easier for you to open medication bottles. Tasks at work that include sitting at a desk, typing, and other activities may be more difficult for people who have osteoarthritis to do. Reduce the possibility of further joint symptoms by ensuring you have an ergonomic set up. Sit in a comfortable chair with your feet flat on the floor or with a foot riser if you have back problems. Your forearms should be parallel to the desk. Bend your elbows at a 90 degree angle and hold them close to your body while you type. Use a headset instead of awkwardly holding the phone between your chin and shoulder. Improper work station ergonomics are a risk factor for injuries and joint damage if you have arthritis. Your human resources representative will have information on how best to set up your work space to minimize the risk of injury. See your doctor for treatment if osteoarthritis is getting in the way of your ability to do your duties at work. People who have osteoarthritis live with pain and the potential for further destruction to cartilage by doing activities that stress joints. Once cartilage is lost, it's gone for good. Then bone interacts with bone and it can be very painful. If walking is difficult, use a cane, walker, leg brace, or crutch. A walker may help you be more mobile. If it's difficult to open doors, use a doorknob extender that turns knobs into easier to use levers. Get a universal remote for the TV that has large buttons. If dressing is difficult, use zipper pulls and clothes and shoes with Velcro. Use a shoehorn to put on shoes and there are even devices to help you put on socks more easily. A tool called a key turner can help you start your car and open keyed doors more easily. People who are having trouble doing everyday activities, working, or engaging in hobbies can see an occupational therapist. Treatment with this kind of therapist can help you work around physical and other limitations to be able to do the things you need and want to do. They have information about how to best do activities while protecting your health. For severe osteoarthritis, talk to your doctor about treatment options or clinical trials that may provide relief.

By May 15, 2018 Doctors don’t have to be palm readers to make incredible predictions about your health. Your hands speak volumes, especially when something’s not working right. Their form, function, and appearance can offer important prognostic and diagnostic clues. “You can learn a lot by looking at the hands,” agrees Kelly Weselman, MD, communications chair for the American College of Rheumatology and a rheumatologist with WellStar Rheumatology in Smyrna, Georgia. We asked Dr. Weselman and other medical specialists, including a neurologist, cardiologist, and dermatologist, to share common and quirky things they look for when examining the hands and what these signs and symptoms could mean.

Many people experience nighttime tingling or numbness because they sleep with their wrists bent. That bend compresses the median nerve leading from the wrist to the hand, explains the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons. Your doctor may order an EMG (electromyogram) to look for nerve or muscle damage, says Matthew Barrett, MD, assistant professor of neurology at the University of Virginia Health System in Charlottesville. Carpal tunnel treatments range from splints to surgery, he says. But there are lots of other reasons for hand numbness and tingling. For example, you might experience temporary tingling in your fingers if you’re hyperventilating because you’re anxious, he says. One cautionary note: “Any sudden onset of numbness or weakness (of the arms or hands) should always make someone worried about potential ,” Dr. Barrett adds. In that event, call 911. Yes, (also called stenosing tenosynovitis) is a real thing. It means you have a finger that pops, catches, or gets stuck when you try to bend and straighten it. Triggering is more common in women than men and most often affects the ring finger or thumb. What happens is that a tendon (a rope-like structure connecting bone to muscle) or the tunnel it runs through becomes inflamed, making it harder for the tendon to move. Anyone can get trigger finger. But you see it more often in people with inflammatory forms of , thyroid disease, and diabetes, as well as people who use their hands a lot, Dr. Weselman observes. is a chronic autoimmune condition that causes scaling on the skin’s surface and can show up on the hands or nails. “Psoriasis on the hands can look like red, scaly, raised plaques and can sometimes include pustules—white pus bumps—on the palms,” Dr. de la Feld says. , like pitting, yellowish staining under the nail, or separation of the nail from the nail bed, also can occur, she adds. If you think you have psoriasis, it’s important to get diagnosed. As Dr. de la Feld points out, “Psoriasis may be associated with many comorbidities, including arthritis and cardiovascular disease.” RELATED: If your fingers blanch (meaning they lose their color) and then turn blue (or purple or black) when it’s cold or you’re stressed, it’s a good bet you have .

It’s just irritating,” she explains. “Or, it could be something that’s related to an underlying autoimmune disease, most often or scleroderma.” Sometimes hand shakiness is no big deal, and other times it can be a sign of neurologic disease. Everyone has a little bit of shakiness in their hands (think about the last time you did something very precise, like threading a needle). This is a called a physiologic tremor, Dr. Barrett explains, and when you’re , over-caffeinated, taking certain medicines, or going through alcohol withdrawal, it becomes more noticeable. Another type of tremor, called essential tremor, causes hand and arm shakiness on both sides of the body. It often runs in families and is present with action, whenever someone is performing a manual task like eating, Dr. Barrett says. And then there are various disease-related tremors. , for example, usually involves one hand, or is more prominent in one hand. The tremor occurs when the hand is at rest. “If combined with slowness of movement and stiffness in the limb affected by the tremor, it could be consistent with Parkinson’s disease,” he says. When Dr. Albers sees patients with painful, red or purple bumps on their fingertips (called Osler nodes), the diagnosis is almost a given: “It’s very specific to endocarditis,” she says, a bacterial infection of the heart valves. Endocarditis can also cause bleeding under the skin of the palms, leaving purple or brown spots, as well as bleeding under the nail or in the skin near the nail.

Abstract Abstract Carpal tunnel syndrome, the most common entrapment neuropathy of the upper extremity, is caused by compression of the median nerve as it travels through the carpal tunnel. Classically, patients with the condition experience pain and paresthesias in the distribution of the median nerve, which includes the palmar aspect of the thumb, index and middle fingers, and radial half of the ring finger. Additional clues include positive physical examination findings, such as the flick sign, Phalen maneuver, and median nerve compression test. Although patients with typical symptoms and signs of carpal tunnel syndrome do not need additional testing, ultrasonography and electrodiagnostic studies are useful to confirm the diagnosis in atypical cases and rule out other causes. If surgical decompression is planned, electrodiagnostic studies should be obtained to determine severity and surgical prognosis. Conservative treatment may be offered initially to patients with mild to moderate carpal tunnel syndrome. Options include splinting, corticosteroids, physical therapy, therapeutic ultrasound, and yoga. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, diuretics, and vitamin B are not effective therapies. Local corticosteroid injection can provide relief for more than one month and delay the need for surgery at one year. Patients with severe carpal tunnel syndrome or whose symptoms have not improved after four to six months of conservative therapy should be offered surgical decompression. Endoscopic and open techniques are equally effective, but patients return to work an average of one week earlier with endoscopic repair. Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is often a debilitating disorder that is commonly encountered in primary care. It is the most common entrapment neuropathy of the upper extremity, affecting approximately 3% of the general adult population. Women are three times more likely to have CTS than men, and the prevalence and severity increase with age. Work-related activities that require a high degree of repetition and force or use of hand-operated vibratory tools significantly increase the risk of CTS. A large prospective cohort study found that forceful hand exertion was the most important factor in the development of CTS in workers. Additional risk factors include family history and a personal history of diabetes mellitus, obesity, hypothyroidism, pregnancy, and rheumatoid arthritis.  Enlarge     Print Ultrasound measurement of a cross-sectional area of the median nerve by an experienced clinician may be used as a diagnostic test for carpal tunnel syndrome. Local corticosteroid injection is effective for more than one month in patients with mild to moderate carpal tunnel syndrome and delays the need for surgery at one year. Splinting, therapeutic ultrasound, carpal bone mobilization, and nerve glide exercises are effective short-term treatments for carpal tunnel syndrome.

The carpal tunnel is bordered superiorly by the transverse carpal ligament and inferiorly by the carpal bones, through which the median nerve and nine flexor tendons of the forearm pass. Increased pressure in the carpal tunnel leads to compression and damage of the median nerve. Abstract The hallmarks of CTS are pain and paresthesias in the distribution of the median nerve, which includes the palmar aspect of the thumb, index and middle fingers, and radial half of the ring finger . Symptoms can vary widely and occasionally localize to the wrist or the entire hand, or radiate to the forearm or rarely the shoulder. Patients often awaken with symptoms and shake out their hand to provide relief. This is known as the flick sign, and is 93% sensitive and 96% specific for CTS. Other provoking factors include tasks that require repetitive wrist flexion or hand elevation, such as driving or holding a telephone for extended periods.       Reprinted with permission from LeBlanc KE, Cestia W.

Because sensory fibers are more susceptible to compression than motor fibers, paresthesias and pain usually predominate early in the course of CTS. In more severe cases, motor fibers are affected, leading to weakness of thumb abduction and opposition. Patients may describe difficulty holding objects, opening jars, or buttoning a shirt. Disappearance of pain is a late finding that implies permanent sensory loss. Abstract A complete examination of the entire upper extremity, including neck, shoulder, elbow, and wrist, should be conducted to exclude other causes . Most patients with early, mild to moderate CTS will not have physical examination findings. However, initial inspection of the hand and wrist can provide clues to precipitating factors, such as signs of injury or arthritic changes. A square-shaped wrist (increased depth-to-width ratio) has an odds ratio of 4.56 (95% confidence interval, 2.97 to 6.99) for CTS, likely related to obesity.  Enlarge     Print Painful thumb motion, positive grind test, radiographic findings Neck pain, numbness of the thumb and index finger only, positive Spurling test History of diabetes mellitus; bilateral, lower extremity involvement Pronator syndrome (median nerve compression at the elbow) Forearm pain; sensory loss over the thenar eminence; weakness with thumb flexion, wrist extension, and forearm pronation Symptoms related to cold exposure, typical color changes Paresthesias of the ring and little fingers, positive Tinel sign and compression tests at the elbow or wrist (Guyon canal) Use of vibratory hand power tools, symptoms of Raynaud phenomenon Adapted with permission from LeBlanc KE, Cestia W.

Carpal tunnel syndrome. Am Fam Physician. . In more severe disease, permanent sensory and motor deficits occur. Patients may have decreased sensation to pain (hypalgesia) on the palmar aspect of the index finger compared with the ipsilateral little finger on the affected hand. Lack of two-point discrimination manifests as the inability to distinguish between points less than 6 mm apart. Sensation over the thenar eminence should be normal in patients with CTS because it is supplied by the palmar cutaneous branch of the median nerve, which branches off proximal to the carpal tunnel. Therefore, decreased sensation over the thenar eminence indicates a median nerve lesion proximal to the carpal tunnel. Weakness of thumb abduction and opposition and atrophy of the thenar eminence may occur in advanced CTS. The diagnostic accuracy of provocative maneuvers for CTS varies widely . However, these tests are simple to perform, and a combination of positive findings increases the likelihood of CTS. The hand elevation test has similar sensitivity and specificity as the Phalen maneuver and the Tinel sign. To perform the hand elevation test, the patient raises his or her hands above the head for one minute; the onset of symptoms is a positive result. One systematic review found that a classic or probable pattern on a hand symptom diagram has a higher diagnostic accuracy than any single maneuver.  Enlarge     Print Diagnostic Value of History and Physical Examination Findings for Carpal Tunnel Syndrome History of awakening with symptoms and shaking the hand to provide relief Positive findings on both the median nerve compression test and the Phalen maneuver Classic or probable pattern on hand symptom diagram Flex the patient's wrist 90 degrees with the elbow in full extension; pain or paresthesias in the fingers innervated by the median nerve within 60 seconds are a positive result Ask the patient to raise the thumb perpendicular to the palm, then apply downward pressure on the distal phalanx while the patient resists Apply direct pressure over the transverse carpal ligament; sensory symptoms within 30 seconds are a positive result Repeatedly tap the volar surface of the patient's wrist over the transverse carpal ligament; pain or paresthesias in the fingers innervated by the median nerve are a positive result Decreased sensation to pain on the palmar aspect of the index finger compared with the ipsilateral little finger on the affected hand Adapted with permission from LeBlanc KE, Cestia W.

A self-administered hand symptom diagram for the diagnosis and epidemiologic study of carpal tunnel syndrome. J Rheumatol. . Abstract The diagnosis of CTS is clinical in a patient with characteristic symptoms and physical examination findings. However, electrodiagnostic studies aid in confirming the diagnosis in atypical cases, determining severity, and planning for surgery. Evidence suggests that ultrasonography may also be useful in diagnosing CTS. Electrodiagnostic studies include nerve conduction studies and electromyography. Nerve conduction studies confirm CTS by detecting impaired median nerve conduction across the carpal tunnel, with normal conduction elsewhere. Electromyography assesses pathologic changes in the muscles innervated by the median nerve, typically the abductor pollicis brevis muscle. Electrodiagnostic studies can exclude other conditions, such as polyneuropathy and radiculopathy, and gauge the severity of CTS. Electrodiagnostic studies have a sensitivity of 56% to 85% and specificity of 94% to 99% for CTS. Results may be normal in up to one-third of patients with mild CTS. Therefore, these studies should be reserved for confirming CTS in atypical cases and excluding other causes. Electrodiagnostic studies should be obtained before surgery to confirm the diagnosis and estimate prognosis because patients with more severe CTS are less likely to have complete recovery after surgery. Repeat nerve conduction studies showing improvement can help reassure these patients. The cross-sectional area of the median nerve is closely correlated with CTS symptoms and severity. A meta-analysis found that a cross-sectional area of 9 mm or more is 87.3% sensitive and 83.3% specific for CTS. Experience in performing ultrasonography for the diagnosis of CTS correlates with greater inter-rater reliability when measuring the cross-sectional area. Advantages of ultrasonography include lower cost; noninvasiveness; patient comfort; and evaluation of etiologies such as tenosynovitis, mass lesions, and tendinopathies. However, ultrasonography relies on local expertise and cannot rule out etiologies such as polyneuropathies or gauge severity of CTS. Plain radiography may be useful if structural abnormalities, such as bone or joint disease, are suspected. Magnetic resonance imaging is not generally indicated. Laboratory testing for comorbidities, such as diabetes or hypothyroidism, may be considered if there are other signs suggesting disease. Abstract Management of CTS is based on disease severity. In mild to moderate cases, a trial of conservative treatment is recommended. Patients with severe CTS or nerve damage on electrodiagnostic studies should be offered surgical decompression. Conservative treatment modalities include splinting, corticosteroids, physical therapy, therapeutic ultrasound, and yoga. Conservative therapy usually improves symptoms in two to six weeks and reaches maximal benefit at three months. If there is no improvement after six weeks, another approach should be considered. Splinting is a first-line treatment for mild to moderate CTS because of its simplicity, low cost, and tolerability. A 2012 Cochrane review found nocturnal wrist splinting to be more effective than placebo, but found insufficient evidence to recommend one splint design over another or compare effectiveness of splinting to other conservative interventions. However, one study showed that patients wearing a neutral wrist splint were twice as likely to report symptom relief compared with patients wearing an extension splint. Splinting is advisable in reversible cases of CTS, such as in pregnancy, and can be combined with other treatment modalities. Increasing evidence supports local carpal tunnel corticosteroid injection as an effective treatment for CTS. A 2007 Cochrane review found symptomatic benefit for up to one month; however, more recent evidence shows improvement lasting 10 weeks to more than one year. Corticosteroid injections can also delay the need for surgery. A double-blinded randomized controlled trial of 111 patients treated with a single injection of 80-mg methylprednisolone, 40-mg methylprednisolone, or saline found greater improvement at 10 weeks with the methylprednisolone injections compared with placebo, and patients in the 80-mg injection group were less likely to have surgery at 12 months. Notably, most patients underwent surgery by one year. Additional randomized controlled trials that included repeat injections showed symptomatic improvement beyond 12 months and similar findings of decreased need for surgery at one year. Evidence does not support one injection technique over another or a particular steroid formulation. However, ultrasound-guided injection may be more effective than blind injection  and allows for direct visualization to ensure accurate and safe needle placement ( and ). Although injection is generally safe, there is risk of median nerve injury and tendon rupture. A repeat injection in the same wrist may be offered after six months. If symptoms recur after two injections, another treatment or surgery should be considered.  Enlarge     Print Corticosteroid Injection Technique for the Treatment of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Patient should be in a seated position with the forearm supinated and wrist slightly extended Identify the injection site medial to the palmaris longus tendon or midway between the palmaris longus and the flexor carpi ulnaris tendons, and 1 cm proximal to the most distal wrist crease () Cleanse the area with chlorhexidine or povidone-iodine solution Using a 25-gauge needle and sterile technique, inject 1 mL of 10-mg-per-mL triamcinolone acetonide and 1 mL of lidocaine 1% without epinephrine Direct the needle at a 45-degree angle distally until the tip of the needle lies under the midpoint of the flexor retinaculum Inject slowly; if the patient experiences shock-like pain or paresthesias, stop the injection and redirect the needle medially Adapted with permission from LeBlanc KE, Cestia W.

Oral prednisone at a dosage of 20 mg daily for 10 to 14 days improves symptoms and function compared with placebo; the improvement lasts up to eight weeks. Oral corticosteroids are less effective than corticosteroid injection. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, diuretics, and vitamin B are not effective therapies. There is limited evidence that physical therapy techniques such as carpal bone mobilization, therapeutic ultrasound, and nerve glide exercises are effective CTS treatments. Nerve glide exercises are simple hand and finger movements that theoretically restore normal movement of the median nerve, which can become “tethered” from nerve compression. A video demonstrating these exercises is available at . Although the evidence for these techniques is limited, they are easy to learn; can be done at home; and can be combined with other treatments, such as splinting. Therapeutic ultrasound and carpal bone mobilization require an experienced therapist, have limited evidence of effectiveness, and require multiple sessions (typically five days per week for two to four weeks with therapeutic ultrasound). One randomized trial of 42 patients with CTS found that yoga improved pain at eight weeks vs. wearing a wrist splint. Carpal tunnel decompression provides a lasting, good outcome in 70% to 90% of cases. Surgery is the treatment of choice for patients with severe median nerve damage as characterized by permanent sensory or motor loss, or ongoing axonal loss or denervation on electrodiagnostic studies. Endoscopic and open techniques are equally effective; however, patients return to work on average eight days earlier with endoscopic repair than with open repair. The most common complications are a painful scar and pillar pain (pain adjacent to the site of ligament release). Most patients note significant improvement in one week and are able to return to normal activities in two weeks. However, some patients (especially those with severe CTS) take up to one year to recover fully. Postoperative splinting does not improve outcomes and may increase stiffness and adhesion formation.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is divided into five stages. Stage 0 is assigned to a normal, healthy knee. The highest stage, 4, is assigned to severe OA. OA that has become this advanced is likely to cause significant pain and disrupt joint movement. Stage 0 OA is classified as “normal” knee health. The knee joint shows no signs of OA and the joint functions without any impairment or pain. A person with stage 1 OA is showing very minor bone spur growth. Bone spurs are boney growths that often develop where bones meet each other in the joint. Someone with stage 1 OA will usually not experience any pain or discomfort as a result of the very minor wear on the components of the joint. Without outward symptoms of OA to treat, many doctors will not require you to undergo any treatments for stage 1 OA. However, if you have a predisposition to OA or are at an increased risk, your doctor may recommend you take supplements, such as chondroitin, or begin an routine to relieve any minor symptoms of OA and to slow the progression of the arthritis. Stage 2 OA of the knee is considered a “mild” stage of the condition. of knee joints in this stage will reveal greater bone spur growth, but the cartilage is usually still at a healthy size, i.e. the space between the bones is normal, and the bones are not rubbing or scraping one another. At this stage, synovial fluid is also typically still present at sufficient levels for normal joint motion. However, this is the stage where people may first begin experiencing symptoms—pain after a long day of walking or running, greater stiffness in the joint when it’s not used for several hours, or tenderness when kneeling or bending. Talk with your doctor about your possible signs of OA. Your doctor may be able to detect and diagnose the condition at this early stage. If so, then you can develop a plan to prevent the condition from progressing. Several different therapies can help relieve the pain and discomfort caused by this mild stage of OA. These therapies are mainly non-pharmacologic, which means you do not need to take medicine for symptom relief. If you are overweight, losing weight through diet and exercise can relieve minor symptoms and improve your quality of life. Even people who are not overweight, will benefit from exercise. Low-impact aerobics and strength training can help strengthen the muscles around the joint, which increases stability and decreases the likelihood of additional joint damage. Protect your joint from exertion by avoiding kneeling, squatting, or jumping. Braces and wraps can help stabilize your knee. Shoe inserts can help realign your leg and relieve some of the pressure you put on your joint. Some people may require medication for mild pain relief. These are usually used in conjunction with nonpharmacological therapies. For example, if you need to take NSAIDs or (such as Tylenol) for pain relief, you should also try exercise, weight loss, and protecting your knee from unnecessary stress. Long-term therapy with these medicines may cause other problems. NSAIDs can cause stomach ulcers, cardiovascular problems, and kidney and liver damage. Taking larger doses of acetaminophen may cause liver damage. Stage 3 OA is classified as “moderate” OA. In this stage, the cartilage between bones shows obvious damage, and the space between the bones begins to narrow. People with stage 3 OA of the knee are likely to experience frequent pain when walking, running, bending, or kneeling. They also may experience joint stiffness after sitting for long periods of time or when waking up in the morning. Joint swelling may be present after extended periods of motion, as well. If nonpharmacological therapies do not work or no longer provide the pain relief they once did, your doctor may recommend a class of medications known as . Corticosteroid drugs include , a hormone which has been shown to relieve OA pain when injected near the affected joint. Cortisone is available as a pharmaceutical drug, but it’s also produced naturally by your body. Some corticosteroid injections can be administered three or four times a year. Others, such as triamcinolone acetonide (Zilretta), are only administered once. The effects of a corticosteroid injection wear off in about two months. However, you and your doctor should look at the use of corticosteroid injections carefully. shows long-term use can actually worsen joint damage. If over-the-counter NSAIDs or acetaminophen are no longer effective, prescription pain medicine, such as and , can help relieve the increased pain common in stage 3 OA. On a short-term basis, these medicines can be used to treat moderate to severe pain. However, narcotic medicines are not recommended for long-term use due to the risk of increased tolerance and possible dependence. Side effects of these medicines include nausea, sleepiness, and fatigue. People who don’t respond to conservative treatments for OA—physical therapy, weight loss, use of NSAIDs and analgesics—may be good candidates for viscosupplementation. Viscosupplements are intra-articular injections of hyaluronic acid. A typical treatment with a viscosupplement requires one to five injections of hyaluronic acid, given one week apart. There are a few injections that are available as a single-dose injection. The results of a viscosupplementation injection are not immediate. In fact, it may take several weeks for the full effect of the treatment to be felt, but relief from symptoms typically lasts a few months. Not everyone responds to these injections. Stage 4 OA is considered “severe.” People in stage 4 OA of the knee experience great pain and discomfort when they walk or move the joint. That’s because the joint space between bones is dramatically reduced—the cartilage is almost completely gone, leaving the joint stiff and possibly immobile. The synovial fluid is decreased dramatically, and it no longer helps reduce the friction among the moving parts of a joint. Bone realignment surgery, or osteotomy, is one option for people with severe OA of the knee. During this surgery, a surgeon cuts the bone above or below the knee to shorten it, lengthen it, or change its alignment. This surgery shifts the weight of your body away from the points of the bone where the greatest bone spur growth and bone damage has occurred. This surgery is often done in younger patients. Total knee replacement, or arthroplasty, is a last resort for most patients with severe OA of the knee. During this procedure, a surgeon removes the damaged joint and replaces it with a plastic and metal device. Side effects of this surgery include infections at the incision site and blood clots. Recovery from this procedure takes several weeks or months and requires extensive physical and occupational therapy. It is possible that replacing your arthritic knee won’t be the end of your OA knee problems. You may need additional surgeries or even another knee replacement during your lifetime, but with the newer knees, it may last for decades. — — 6 Early Symptoms of Osteoarthritis (OA): Pain, Tenderness, and More Osteoarthritis (OA) is a form of degenerative joint pain.

Pinched Nerve (Nerve Entrapment or Nerve Compression) Medical Editor: What Is a Pinched Nerve in the Neck or Lower Back? A pinched nerve can cause symptoms like pain, numbness, tingling, or weakness along the path of the pinched nerve. Nerves are like electrical cords distributed throughout the entire body that carry information from the brain to the rest of the body and vice-versa. nerves carry information from the brain out to the body. This allows the brain to send commands to the various organs of the body. For example, these commands are sent to the muscles causing them to contract and move, or to the heart to either beat faster or slower. nerves send information from the body back to the brain for processing, including information about pain, touch, taste, temperature, or other sensations. The information travels along the nerve by an electrochemical signal, much like information traveling along an electrical cord. the signal is interrupted somewhere along its path. Nerves carry electrical signals from the brain to the body and vice-versa. can cause symptoms like pain, numbness, tingling, or weakness along the path of the pinched nerve. Most people improve from a pinched nerve with rest, ice, medication, or physical therapy. Weakness or wasting of the muscles from a pinched nerve can suggest permanent nerve injury. A pinched nerve is caused when a nerve is somehow damaged or injured by direct pressure or compression and is unable to properly conduct its signal. There are many potential causes for a pinched nerve, depending on the location of the nerve. Swelling around a nerve can be caused by an injury, bruise, or other conditions, including the swelling of the extremities that can occur with . An inherited tendency, as manifested by a family history of a similar condition, can also increase an individual's chance of developing a pinched nerve. What Is a Pinched Nerve in the Neck or Lower Back? A pinched nerve in the neck or lower back can be caused by is a narrowing of the spinal canal through which the nerves pass with the spine. A pinched nerve in the lower back or buttock can compress the , which can cause . A pinched nerve in the wrist can be caused by . This condition is caused by compression of the median nerve as it passes through confined tissues of the wrist. Cubital tunnel syndrome is a similar condition caused by compression of the ulnar nerve in the elbow. Both of these conditions are more common in people with and people who perform repetitive activities such as typing, using a computer keyboard for long periods of time, or working on an assembly line. Medically speaking, the term ""myalgia"" refers to what type of pain? The symptoms of a pinched nerve depend on what nerve is affected. Each nerve is responsible for sending information to or from specific parts of the body. Weakness of the muscles along the path of the nerve A pinched nerve may feel like, for example, the sensation when a part of your body has ""fallen asleep."" A pinched nerve can cause symptoms at the site of damage, or any location further down the path from the affected nerve. A pinched nerve in the neck can cause or stiffness, along with symptoms down the arm. A pinched nerve in the lower back causes and stiffness with symptoms down the leg. A doctor can often identify which nerve is pinched in the neck or lower back based on what portion of the patient's arm or leg is affected. A pinched nerve in the wrist from typically affects the thumb, index, and middle fingers. It can also cause a weakness in the person's grip strength, and atrophy of the muscle of the palm near the thumb. A pinched nerve in the elbow from cubital tunnel syndrome affects the forearm, the ring (fourth finger), and the small fingers of the hand. The doctor will begin by asking the patient various questions about his or her pain, numbness, tingling, weakness, and other symptoms. The patient may also be asked about other medical conditions, work history, and family medical history. This information can often assist in identifying the nerve(s) affected. The doctor will then examine the part of the body involved. This may include testing the patient's strength, sensation, and muscle tone in specific muscles. Depending on the results of the medical history and the physical examination, the patient may need additional tests. If the doctor suspects the patient has a pinched nerve (compression of the nerves) in the neck or lower back, X-rays may be necessary to assess possible injury to the spine or arthritis of the spine. Depending on the severity and duration of the patient's symptoms, he or she may also need a or an scan. These imaging studies provide additional information about a pinched nerve not seen on regular X-rays, and can provide additional information in preparation for surgical intervention if necessary. The doctor may also recommend specific tests for the affected nerve including a nerve conduction study or an (). In the nerve conduction study, the test stimulates the nerves with a mild electrical impulse and measures speed of the impulse traveling in the nerve. In the EMG, a small needle is placed into the muscle while the patient contracts the muscle to measure the electrical activity of the muscles. In many cases, a pinched nerve can be treated with If the pinched nerve is in the arm ( or cubital tunnel syndrome), the doctor may recommend for a short period of time. The brace limits the amount of movement around the nerve, which allows it to rest and recover. The brace also prevents the patient from movements that may further compress or pinch the affected nerve. A brace used for carpal tunnel syndrome covers the wrist and and is extended slightly back. This is because during flexion (bending the wrist down) the median nerve in the wrist is further pinched. The brace for cubital tunnel syndrome in the elbow can be used to keep the elbow from bending too much, which further stretches the ulnar nerve. can assist to stretch and strengthen specific muscles in the body, which helps relieve the pressure on the pinched nerve. Various medications can also be used to treat a pinched nerve. Anti-inflammatory medications can reduce the inflammation (swelling) around the affected nerve. For example, Other medications used specifically for nerve related pain include If the symptoms from a pinched nerve do not improve with the above treatments, surgery may be recommended. Surgery may also be recommended if the patient develops additional weakness in the muscles, or if the particular nerves being pinched cause loss of control of the bowel or bladder (). These are signs of more severe . Surgery for a pinched nerve depends on the location of the nerve being pinched. If the pinched nerve is in the wrist (carpal tunnel syndrome) or elbow (cubital tunnel syndrome), the surgeon can release the tissues over the nerve in the wrist or elbow to free the nerve tissue pressure. If the pinched nerve is in the neck or lower back, a spine surgeon or neurosurgeon can remove a portion of the disc or bone spurs that are compressing the nerve in the spine. In some cases, if it is necessary to remove large portions of bone or disc, the surgery may require a to stabilize the spine after freeing the nerve. In most cases, individuals with a pinched nerve are able to recover completely without any long lasting symptoms. Most patients respond well to conservative treatment including rest, activity modification, ice, physical therapy, and medications. Surgical operations are typically only recommended for people who do not improve with the conservative treatment or if they have worsening muscle weakness. The longer a patient has symptoms of a pinched nerve, and the worse the symptoms become, the less chance there is for a full recovery. Pain, numbness and tingling usually resolve completely with treatment. If a person develops weakness or wasting of the muscles, he or she should see a doctor as soon as possible to prevent any permanent nerve damage. A pinched nerve (nerve entrapment) in or near the elbow can cause elbow pain, numbness, tingling, or weakness of the arm, wrist, or hand. The nerve that most commonly gets pinched in or near the elbow is the ulnar nerve. It is located in the elbow area, on the little finger side when the palm is facing up. Less often, the median or the posterior interosseous nerve, a branch of the radial nerve next to the elbow area on the thumb side when the palm is facing up, may get pinched.

62065c7c-5d29-4dd8-8517-ddac43b3a30e,"— — Most people experience knee pain at some point in their lives. Sports, exercise, and other activities can cause muscle strains, tendinitis, and more serious injuries to ligaments and cartilage. It’s difficult to pinpoint the exact number of people who experience knee pain over their lifetime, but we do know the rates of how many people experience pain severe enough to turn to : In 2017, knee replacement surgeries were performed in the United States. The severity of knee pain can vary widely and depends on factors such as the cause and your age. For some, knee pain can be so severe that it limits daily activities. For others, mild knee pain may be a chronic hindrance to the active lifestyle they desire. The location of knee pain can also vary. For example, the found that the most commonly reported location of knee pain is in the middle of the knee, in the joint that connects the thighbone to the shinbone. The second most common area people experience knee pain is in the kneecap area. Some people experience a combination of the two. Here are some of the most common conditions and injuries that cause severe knee pain. If you have an injury to the ligaments in your knee, you can experience knee pain. The ligaments are what connect your thigh bone (femur) to your lower leg bones (tibia and fibula). They hold these bones together and keep the knee stable. and tears are very common sports injuries, and can occur to the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), and medial collateral ligament (MCL). Knee ligament injuries may also occur from high-energy accidents, such as a car crash. The ACL ligament is the main ligament that runs through the middle of the joint between the thighbone and shinbone. ACL ruptures are the most common type of ligament injury in athletes. ACL tears can occur as a result of an injury from movements that occur in sports, such as: the knee abruptly “giving out,” causing you to fall down or feel unstable while walking Any ligament injury can result in severe knee pain and could require surgery. Other injuries, including tears, can take place in the cartilage of the knee. Cartilage is a semi-hard (tough, but flexible) tissue that covers the end of your bones. In addition, knee cartilage also includes the two menisci on either side of the joint: the meniscus, located on the inside of the knee, and the meniscus, positioned on the outside of the knee. A is a common injury, and typically requires surgery. Unlike a ligament injury, which can happen in a variety of ways, a meniscus tear typically occurs as a result of one single movement. For instance, a sudden twist or turn can cause this knee cartilage to tear. Meniscus tears are more common as you age, because the cartilage gets weaker and thins out, so it’s more likely to tear. Symptoms of a cartilage tear in the knee can include: initial pain and discomfort (though still able to walk) worsening pain and stiffness days after the injury is a condition that causes inflammation and pain in joints in the body, but it most often occurs in the knee. Arthritis is a chronic condition that can get worse over time and eventually require surgery. The three most common types of arthritis are , post-traumatic arthritis, and . Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune condition that causes the tissue around the joint to become inflamed and thickened. Chronic inflammation often leads to damage and loss of cartilage. Rheumatoid arthritis occurs in about of the U.S. population and is two to three times more common in women. Symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis are similar to other types of arthritis in the knee: Post-traumatic arthritis can result after a serious knee injury, including bone fractures and ligament tears. Injuries such as a broken bone can wear down the joint surface and cause arthritis over time. Knee injuries can damage the cartilage in your knee as you get older, leading to the following symptoms: The most common type of arthritis is osteoarthritis, which is a progressive wearing of the cartilage in the knee joint. It occurs in people age 50 and older. After 50, the impact of osteoarthritis can worsen due to accumulated use and the wearing down of cartilage that occurs with age. Osteoarthritis is often the result of bone rubbing on bone, and yes, that’s as painful as it sounds. Osteoarthritis can also be caused by age, weight, genetics, previous injuries, infections, illness (such as a tumor or gout), and certain occupations, such as construction and manufacturing. According to a 2018 study in , knee pain that lasts more than 1 year is commonly associated with osteoarthritis. Doctors diagnose arthritis and other knee problems using X-rays and a physical evaluation. You will be asked about your pain level, knee flexibility and function, activity levels, any past injuries or conditions, and your family history (such as if anyone in your family has arthritis). Medical professionals will also use to identify the type of arthritis affecting your knee. These tests could include: Bloodwork can check for an anti-CCP antibody, which can indicate rheumatoid arthritis. Other antibodies can be related to a more widespread disorder, such as lupus, with inflammation throughout the whole body. Doctors can have fluid drawn from the actual knee joint to examine it. If the fluid has uric acid crystals in it, it can indicate that gout is causing the inflammation and pain. The presence of bacteria indicates an infection is the source of these symptoms. X-rays can help identify signs of arthritis, such as if the space between the bones is narrower, if there are any bone spurs, or if the joint isn’t aligned correctly. CAT scans and MRI scans produce more detailed images of the bones and soft tissues, respectively, so they are used more to diagnosis injuries and unexplained swelling. For instance, if your doctor suspects a cartilage or ligament tear, they will most likely order an MRI scan. Knee pain usually becomes worse as arthritis progresses. Many people with severe pain from arthritis choose to have surgery to relieve their symptoms and help repair the joint. But surgery isn’t right for everyone. Some of the more conservative options for treating knee pain from arthritis include medication and at-home strategies like exercise. The exact treatment plan that’s recommended for your knee pain will depend on factors such as severity of your pain, your age, your activity levels, and any other medical conditions you have. Typically, your doctor will try the least invasive type of treatment, such as weight loss and medication, and then move down the line to consider surgery. Because there are many considerations before turning to surgery, it’s crucial to discuss and explore all treatment options with your doctor. Weight loss may help improve your knee pain because it lessens the amount of weight on your knee joint. Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) guidelines recommend losing 5 percent of your weight over a 20-week period. If you have osteoarthrosis, performing strengthening and stretching exercises for your knee is primarily about improving your function and mobility. This can help relieve pain and stiffness. Both land-based exercise, such as yoga, and water-based movements, such as aquatic aerobics, can be helpful. A physical therapist can help you learn how to practice hot/cold therapy at home to relieve pain and stiffness. If you have limited mobility as a result of your knee arthritis, working with a physical or occupational therapist can help you find tools to use in your everyday life. For instance, you could get fitted for a custom knee brace or walker. Natural remedies can include things like supplements, essential oils, and acupuncture. Acupuncture in particular is as a helpful and effective option for arthritis knee pain relief. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen (Advil) or aspirin (Bufferin) are recommended to help most individuals who have knee osteoarthritis relieve pain and inflammation. Talk with your doctor about an appropriate at-home dosage plan. The most effective type of medicine for knee arthritis, triamcinolone acetonide (Zilretta), is the only FDA-approved medication to treat osteoarthritis of the knee. This is a corticosteroid injected into your knee that releases medicine slowly over a 3-month period. The slow release of the medicine has been found to relieve pain and swelling and reduce some of the negative side effects of steroids, such as increased blood sugar. The recommends that people who have knee arthritis try topical pain relievers — which is medicine you apply directly on the skin, instead of taking by mouth — because it can help relieve pain without as many side effects. Although more on this remedy for knee arthritis is needed, it has often been used to help supplement fluids in the knee joint to decrease pain. The two primary types of surgery to treat knee arthritis are and Osteotomy is mostly used in younger, more active people as a way to delay needing a joint replacement. The surgery involves cutting the bones and realigning them to help improve function and decrease pain. If the arthritis is only located in one area of the knee, a doctor can perform a partial knee replacement to replace only the affected area. If the whole knee is involved, a total knee replacement can be performed. There are many different causes of knee pain, ranging from injury to medical conditions. But no matter what kind of knee pain you’re dealing with, have your knee evaluated by a doctor to make sure you don’t have a serious injury or disorder causing the pain. It’s important to treat any injury or condition you may have that is causing your knee pain. It’s also important to recognize that you don’t have to live with knee pain — a health provider may be able to recommend tools to relieve your pain, such as physical therapy or medication. — — Clinical Outcomes and Statistics of Knee Replacement How effective is knee replacement surgery in relieving severe knee pain?

Our Leadership Campus Transformation Sustainability Community Needs Assessment & Service Plan Government & Community Affairs Our Advertising Our Leadership Campus Transformation Sustainability Community Needs Assessment & Service Plan Government & Community Affairs Our Advertising MyChart Patient Login Give Osteoarthritis of the knee is a progressive condition that causes aching pain, stiffness, and loss of mobility in the knee joint. The knee is the largest joint in the body, and is one of the strongest. It’s composed of three bones: the bottom part of the thighbone, called the femur; the top part of the shinbone, called the tibia; and a large, round bone that covers and protects the joint, called the patella or kneecap. The ends of these bones are lined in a protective material called cartilage, a smooth material that acts like a shock absorber and helps the bones to move easily while the body is in motion. The cause of knee pain and other osteoarthritis symptoms is often bone-on-bone friction, which happens when the cartilage has begun to erode. Over time, cartilage may wear away completely, leaving the joint vulnerable to permanent damage. New research suggests that not everyone experiences osteoarthritis symptoms as a result of cartilage “wear and tear.” Knee pain results in many people from an inflammation in the membrane lining the knee joint, called the synovium. In a healthy knee, the synovium secretes a gel-like substance called synovial fluid that lubricates the joint and helps absorb stress during movement. Pain and stiffness related to osteoarthritis have been linked to a thinning of synovial fluid, which further contributes to joint degeneration. Typically, osteoarthritis of the knee—as a result of cartilage erosion, thinning of the synovial fluid, or both—occurs in people over age 60 due to years of movements related to daily living. Younger people may develop premature cartilage erosion from a knee injury or from repeated high-impact activities, such as running. For some, the disease progresses rapidly, and for many others, the symptoms of osteoarthritis worsen over years or decades. Musculoskeletal specialists, including rheumatologists, sports medicine physicians, radiologists, physiatrists—doctors who specialize in rehabilitation—and orthopedic surgeons collaborate at NYU Langone’s to diagnose osteoarthritis of the knee. Our experts base a diagnosis on a person’s symptoms, as well as the results of diagnostic imaging tests. Doctors rely on information about your family and medical history to find clues about whether your symptoms are caused by osteoarthritis of the knee. Doctors may ask when you first noticed pain or stiffness, whether you feel discomfort all the time or only at certain times or during certain activities, whether pain keeps you from moving your leg in certain ways, if you hear a grinding or clicking sound during movement, and whether pain or other symptoms have limited your day-to-day activities. In addition, doctors ask for details about any previous knee injuries or knee surgery. An injury to soft tissue in the knee, such as a , may have damaged cartilage or underlying bone, increasing the risk of continued cartilage deterioration and osteoarthritis. Your doctor carefully examines your knee during a physical exam to look for signs of osteoarthritis. He or she may gently move the knee and leg to assess the joint’s flexibility and range of motion and listen for any cracking or popping noises in the joint, called crepitus, that may be a sign of joint damage. The doctor might also press lightly against the knee to test for tenderness and determine whether any discomfort results from movement in the joints. Torn soft tissue in the knee may cause similar symptoms, and our doctors are able to differentiate between osteoarthritis and another type of knee injury. Our doctors also examine the hip joints and ask you to walk a few steps to see if disorders of the hip affect how you walk. If the hip joint is stiff or weak, the knee has to work harder and absorb more of the body’s weight during movement, which may cause discomfort in the knee. This referred pain could indicate that something other than knee osteoarthritis is causing your symptoms. X-rays provide clear, detailed images of the knee joint and may reveal bone spurs or narrowing of the joint, the classic hallmark for diagnosing osteoarthritis of the knee. A healthy knee joint appears to have a gap between the bones on an X-ray because the cartilage acts as a cushion between the femur and the tibia. Doctors can see evidence of cartilage erosion by looking at the space between the bones in the knee joint as well as the shape of the bones that make up the joint. In an arthritic joint, this gap is narrowed and the shape of the bones is less smooth or less round. Doctors at NYU Langone often use ultrasound in a doctor’s office to view an important aspect of the inside of the knee that cannot be seen on an X-ray: the soft tissues surrounding the bone such as the synovium. Ultrasound uses high-frequency sound waves to create real-time images of structures inside the body that both the physician and the person being examined can see. Ultrasound can reveal inflammation in soft tissues and the abnormal accumulation of fluid in the front or back of the joint. Ultrasound exams allow the physician to assess the degree of inflammation and identify the location of excess fluid. Your doctor may use a procedure called arthrocentesis to remove the excess fluid. This can result in immediate and significant pain relief. In addition, the synovial fluid removed can be tested in a laboratory and the results used to determine the best course of treatment. An ultrasound image may also show bony growths in the joint, a classic sign of osteoarthritis. These growths, called osteophytes or bone spurs, develop as part of the body’s response to friction between bones. When bones rub directly against each other, they start to deteriorate, and the body produces new bone to make up for the loss. But bone spurs develop unevenly and may cause discomfort by getting in the way of smooth joint motion. As part of the diagnostic process, doctors at NYU Langone use a measurement called a patient-reported outcome score to assess your type of knee pain and current level of function. This method consists of a questionnaire that doctors use to obtain information about your specific symptoms: if they prevent you from participating in everyday activities, how much symptoms affect your overall quality of life, and whether you’ve limited your participation in sports or exercise because of arthritis. The results of the questionnaire help doctors in creating a treatment plan. For example, some people may not show joint damage on an X-ray, but still have chronic pain. Others feel little or no pain even though an X-ray reveals significant cartilage erosion. By using the patient-reported outcome tool, our arthritis experts ensure that treatment is individualized to meet your needs and not solely based on diagnostic tests. If your symptoms include swelling, warmth, or redness, doctors may recommend arthrocentesis. In this procedure, doctors remove fluid from the knee joint using a needle. The fluid is analyzed in a laboratory and the results can rule out other possible causes of joint pain and inflammation such as gout, infections, and , a different form of arthritis that typically affects multiple joints at once. To perform arthrocentesis, doctors first inject a small amount of local anesthetic to numb the skin, then carefully guide the needle into the joint space where fluid has accumulated. The doctor removes fluid through the needle and sends it to a lab for testing. Results are typically available in two days, at which time your doctor calls or meets with you to discuss the results. Joint fluid can also be analyzed for biologic markers in those who want to participate in the Joint Preservation Registry, an advanced research program being conducted at NYU Langone. Arthritis specialists evaluate substances present in joint fluid to identify individual patterns of disease and tailor treatment to address the form of arthritis that is affecting you. NYU Langone orthopedic surgeons at the Joint Preservation and Arthritis Center are actively involved in research to incorporate biomarker testing into care plans.

Repetitive strain injuries () are a family of injuries affecting tendons, tendon sheaths, muscles, nerves and joints. They cause persistent or recurring pains most commonly in the neck, shoulders, forearms, hands, wrists, elbows and lower limbs. The term “repetitive strain” injury is misleading. Unlike other diseases, s are not easily classified because they have a variety of causes and include injuries to different parts of the body. A number of terms are applied to such injuries including: repetitive injury, repetitive motion injury, repetitive trauma, overuse injury, cumulative trauma disorder, occupational musculoskeletal disorder and cervio-brachial disorder. The different terms indicate that such injuries involve repetition, and can also be caused by force, rapid movement, overuse, static loading, excessive strain, uncomfortable positioning of limbs or holding one’s posture in an unnatural, constrained or constricted position. In the past, repetitive strain injuries were most commonly attributed to those persons involved in sports - hence the names, “tennis elbow” or “golfer’s elbow”. These injuries were generally not recognized amongst workers, although syndromes related to specific occupations such as “weaver’s cramp” and “threader’s wrist” were reported. However, s are increasingly common among a variety of worker groups, from clerks to jackhammer operators, from maintenance workers to typists. Many workers are unfamiliar with repetitive strain injuries so everyday aches and pains are overlooked and no connection is made between the injury and the workplace. Aches and pains warn that a serious injury may be developing. If the causes are not eliminated or the worker moved from the job immediately, the damage can be permanent and irreversible. Sometimes the injury is crippling, leaving the worker in pain and possibly immobile for life. Although the number of injuries reported is increasing, there are no regulations or standards covering them. The causes of repetitive strain injuries can be classified in the following ways: Rapid movement injuries, caused by repeated rapid movements; Forceful movement injuries, cause by exertion of muscle movement; Static loading injuries, caused by fixed positioning with unsupported limbs. Such injuries can be caused by either too little movement or excessive movement while handling light as well as heavy loads. Often, repetitive strain injuries have multiple causes. A maintenance worker using a screwdriver may get pains from repetitive use of force while working at an uncomfortable angle. operators may sit in an uncomfortable position with no wrist support and use rapid finger movements on a poorly designed keyboard. These workers may develop a number of serious injuries because of effects on their musculoskeletal system. Any work that forces a person into an “unnatural” position can lead to repetitive strain injuries. The forceful twisting of a screwdriver, repetitive finger movements without rest, sitting in an uncomfortable position, bending the wrists for long periods, working with arms above shoulder length, gripping tools forcefully, etc., strain tendons, ligaments, and muscles causing injury. Repetitive strain injuries are linked to type of work conducted, the tools used, and the design of the work station. For example, most tools are made for “the average man”. Sometimes grips are too wide or too slippery. Gloves may be too thick causing separation of fingers, or they may not be flexible enough. Tight gripping and squeezing with overstretched hand muscles is then required (the fact that standard hand tools are too large for many women helps explain why s are more common amongst women). The workstation may be designed so that workers strain their bodies bending, stretching, reaching or twisting, etc. Other factors contributing to repetitive strain include excessive work rates, lack of job variation, speed up, poorly maintained equipment, stress, overtime, vibration and inadequate training.s can be caused by overwork. Our bodies are simply not designed to work faster, more vigorously, endlessly or without rest. They break down, just like machines that are overworked. Rapid, repetitive motions with insufficient rest can cause s. With overwork, the body is forced to work too much with not enough time to recover. This spiralling effect - coupled with stress, another contributor to s – can cause injuries that might never heal without a long-term break from their causes. What are the symptoms of Repetitive Strain Injuries? Description of how s feel range from “a sense of discomfort” to “excruciating pain”. General symptoms include: clumsiness of the hands (loss of ability to grasp items, impaired thumb and finger dexterity) Pain in one area of the body may radiate to other connecting parts. Pain from the wrist can radiate to the forearm and the shoulder joint. If a worker has any one of these symptoms, it should be reported immediately. Bones and muscles make up what is known as the “musculoskeletal system”. This provides support and strength, keeps the body moving and protects internal organs. The bones, connected by joints, serve as levers for the muscles to act upon. The muscles are anchored to the bones by tendons, and ligaments connect two or more bones, cartilages or other structures. Any activity that wears away at this system may cause a repetitive strain injury. Tendons are a common site of overuse injuries. They are tough tissues with very few nerve endings and little in the way of blood supply. Often found where there are a large number of joints to move in a relatively small space (e.g., hands or wrists), tendons connect the body of the muscle to the bone which it is intended to move. Certain repetitive movements or forceful exertions such as twisting a screwdriver can cause the tendons to rub against adjacent bones and ligaments. This can cause friction which damages the tendons and lead to the constriction of the muscles they were designed to move. The various names for repetitive strain injuries reflect the fact that different tendons, joints or muscles may become damaged depending on which movements are overdone. This is a partial list of a wide range of related diseases that run up the entire hand, wrist, forearm, elbow, shoulder and neck. Rapid and repetitive movements such as keyboard work on typewriters or s, and the repeated twisting of the forearm and hands with tools such as pliers can cause an injury known as tenosynovitis. While tendonitis is the inflammation of the tendons, tenosynovitis is the inflammation of the tendon sheaths usually at the hand or wrist. Tendons located at the wrist and ankle are enclosed in delicate synovial sheaths (you can feel the tendons and synovia move as you place a finger below the wrist crease and open and close your fist). The double walled sleeve of the sheath secretes synovial fluid which provides lubrication for the tendon so that damage and injury from rubbing, friction and pressure is prevented. Rest periods are needed to replenish the fluid. With continuous movement, the lubrication protecting the tendons sheaths is depleted or poor quality lubricant is produced. This causes friction which in turn stimulates increased production of lubricant. When increased lubricant production cannot meet the demand, the tendon and sheath rub against each other and can become inflamed. Movements become painful and can cause a creaking sound called crepitus. In the early stages of tenosynovitis, the worker may experience numbness, tingling and pain during movement. If this happens, work should cease. Injury to the sheath can restrict hand or arm movement and weaken both muscle and grip. Symptoms of tenosynovitis include pain in the wrist and forearm which may travel up the elbow to the shoulder. Swelling and a clear cracking sound may occur. If recognized early enough, as with most such injuries, the condition will improve with rest, although the condition may flare up again. If work continues after the first symptoms appear however, the tendon and tendon sheaths may scar, causing irreversible damage. The only reasonable way to deal with tenosynovitis is to prevent it. This is a type of tenosynovitis more commonly known as “trigger thumb”. It affects the common sheath for the two tendons of the thumb just above the wrist. It is caused by repetitive trigger-like movements involving the wrist. Repeated and forceful movements strain the tendons, irritate them, and cause inflammation and thickening. The thickening tendon can eventually lock and render movement of the associated muscles and bones useless. There are various forms of tendonitis. , for example, affects the tendons which move the shoulders, rotating the arm inward and outward. , refers to the inflammation of the area surrounding the tendons and the muscle junction. It is a thickening of the finger tendons which makes it difficult to straighten the fingers after bending. Tasks requiring too wide a grip on a handle while squeezing can lead to this problem. Repetitive finger movements, pinching and squeezing with fingertips, hand exertions with bent wrist, excessive use of the index finger, twisting of wrists, overly tight grip and uneven work movement can lead to a painful condition called carpal tunnel syndrome. The carpal tunnel is a narrow channel formed by carpal bones on three sides the thick, inelastic carpal ligament on the fourth. It runs through the inner side of the wrist. Tendons inside that tunnel run parallel the extremely fragile median nerve. This nerve passes from the shoulder and forearm to the hand, sending nerve signals to some fingers and the palm. Flexing causes the tendons inside the carpal tunnel to compress on the median nerve (just as sitting for a long period with legs with legs crossed compresses a nerve and causes numbness). Simple occurs when the presence of fluid or the thickening of tissues squeezes the median nerve. The more serious condition of Secondary occurs when inflamed tendon sheaths in the carpal tunnel (tenosynovitis) cause increased pressure on the median nerve. Workers performing light, but highly repetitive movements of the wrist and fingers are particularly likely to develop this injury. The symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome are numbness, tingling and burning sensations, pain in the wrist, wasting of the muscles at the base of the wrist, shiny palm, clumsiness of hands, swelling of the wrist and hand, loss of ability to grasp items and impaired thumb and finger dexterity. In the early stages one may have a sore wrist or forearm. In later stages the pain can be acute and the movement of wrist or fingers limited. There may be a grating sensation (crepitus) with movement. In the advanced stage, finger movements may be jerky, and in the final stage the thumb and fingers may become locked. Sometimes repeated small movements of the palm (e.g. rubber stamping) can cause deposits of fibrous tissue on the tendon sheath of the palm and thumb. A progressive, painless thickening and tightening of the palm tissue beneath the skin takes place causing the hand to close into a claw-like position. It becomes impossible to extend the finger and the hand can become permanently bound. The first symptom of this condition - a small nodule on the palm is followed by nodules appearing on the fingers. Ganglion is an injury closely associated with repetitive strain injuries of the wrist and hands. Precise, repetitive hand movements may lead to the formation of round, hard swelling near a tendon, sheath or joint usually on the back the hand or wrist. Cramping of the hand or forearm can result from the repetitive movement of handwriting or typing. Nerves are affected causing uncontrolled finger movements. Strain injuries of the muscle and tissues in the area of the elbow joint are known as . This is also commonly referred to as “tennis elbow” (lateral epiconylitis) or “golfer’s elbow” (medial epicondylitis). Muscles which bend the wrist and fingers forward and backward are attached at their upper ends to bone and ligament just above the elbow joint. Common causes of epicondylitis include: repeated strain of the forearm (hammering, laying bricks); bending of the wrist against a resisting force (twisting a screwdriver or carrying a heavy load with arms extended); lifting objects with hand held downward and the forefinger in a grasping position. There may be tenderness and swelling in or near the elbow and pain may radiate from the elbow. The pain may be especially acute if the hand is moved. (tennis elbow) is the inflammation of the tissue at the elbow end of the humerus bone (the largest bone of the upper arm). Symptoms are pain and tenderness when fingers are moved with the elbow held away from the body. The pain radiates from the elbow joint. Miner’s elbow, weaver’s elbow, housemaid’s knee, hod-carrier’s shoulders, dustman’s shoulders, and miner’s beat hand, are common names for bursitis. It is an inflammation of the bursa, a fluid-filled fibrous sac often found in areas subject to friction, for example around joints or where a tendon passes over a bone. Excessive, prolonged and repeated pressures or jolts to joints can lead to bursitis, with symptoms of severe pain and restricted movements. Repetitive lifting of your arms can lead to further complications. Two tendons in the shoulder area can be strained because of repetitive work. One of the tendons passes over the top of the shoulder joint and lifts the arm away from the side. The other passes in front of the shoulder joint and assists forward and upward movement of the arm. Work requiring the arms to be moved or lifted away from the chest can cause muscle overload. is one injury resulting from the continuous use of shoulder muscles and tendons. Shoulder and neck strain muscles are related. Neck muscles control head posture and lift and brace the shoulders. Like shoulder muscles, they are in constant use. Symptoms of injury include pain in both areas during rest, stiffness in the neck and headaches arising from the neck, muscle tightness and tender spots in the muscles. Physicians may be confused about the source of pain since it may be “referred” to other parts of the body. Nerves in the shoulders travel down the arm to the hands and any injuries involving shoulders may cause pain elsewhere. Workers with a repetitive strain injury in one part of the body may develop problems in other areas at the same time. When feeling discomfort or pain from doing work in one particular way, they may try and compensate through movements that cause other strain injuries. Thus, pain in wrists or hands can be followed by pains in forearms and shoulders. An additional problem is that workers may try to “work through the pain”. Since they do not relate their pain to the workplace they try to keep up productivity and don’t stop their work. As a result, inflammation continues and worsens leading to even greater injury. Getting s diagnosed is a major concern. The pain can be persistent, but because there are no open signs of injury or damage aside from occasional swelling, workers are accused of being neurotic or malingerers. Often the victim is blamed and told that the pain is “all in the mind”. While the worker finds that doing the job may lead to a painful condition, the pain usually goes away with rest. When returning to work the pain reappears. Other workers may see this person as a chronic complainer because they fail to make the connection between the unseen injury and work. Some physicians have called such problems “women’s complaints” saying that women are more prone to s. However, it’s more likely that many women receive such injuries because they are employed in large numbers where such injuries are common (e.g. typing, keyboard work) or because the tools they must use are designed for the “average male”, not for the smaller grip many women have. Again, because the injury is not plainly visible, women workers are accused of “hysteria”.  Because repetitive strain injuries have numerous causes affecting a variety of areas, eliminating them demands a comprehensive prevention program. The cornerstone of such a program must be to make the job fit the person rather than make the person fit the job. An education program outlining the source and prevention of repetitive strain injuries. Workers should be informed of the symptoms of such injuries so that they can be identified before any serious injury occurs. A reporting system to ensure early symptoms are dealt with seriously and immediately. Workers should not put up with the pain. A provision for rest and time-off work. If the cause of the repetitive motion, trauma, etc. is eliminated a healing process can begin. Too often the worker will return to work as soon as pain disappears. This furthers the problem possibly causing a worsening of the condition. Surgery to deal with serious injury is always the last resort especially in the case of repetitive strain injuries. Job rotation, job enlargement, and repeated rest breaks should be used to break up the series of repetitive motion that can lead to injury. Jobs can be redesigned to eliminate de-skilling, and monotonous and repetitive tasks. Job rotation can be used to vary the muscles used in the work process. A program to investigate and document all complaints of pain related to the workplace. A careful analysis of the workplace should be conducted to detect potential causes of s. A full scale ergonomics study can look at the force, speed and direction of movements, frequency of movements, work posture, rate of worker and stress.  Redesign of tools to fit the individual or specific task. For example, some tools can be designed with smaller grips that require less power to manipulate, squeeze or press, so that hands and wrists are in the same posture as when they are hanging relaxed at one’s side. Badly fitting components should be eliminated and machinery well maintained. Sometimes tools may be redesigned, but the effect is offset by a resultant increase in the work rate. A mix of both tool or workplace redesign and rest breaks would be the most effective. Recognition of repetitive strain injuries as serious occupational injuries is yet to be fully recognized. Each province has different coverage under the Workers’ Compensation Board. Some jurisdictions do not even consider repetitive strain injuries while others will deal with the problem case by case. Workers must demand legislation that covers all repetitive strain injuries and which recognizes the direct relationship between their injuries and the workplace.

What are the symptoms of Repetitive Strain Injuries? Description of how s feel range from “a sense of discomfort” to “excruciating pain”. General symptoms include: clumsiness of the hands (loss of ability to grasp items, impaired thumb and finger dexterity) Pain in one area of the body may radiate to other connecting parts. Pain from the wrist can radiate to the forearm and the shoulder joint. If a worker has any one of these symptoms, it should be reported immediately. Bones and muscles make up what is known as the “musculoskeletal system”. This provides support and strength, keeps the body moving and protects internal organs. The bones, connected by joints, serve as levers for the muscles to act upon. The muscles are anchored to the bones by tendons, and ligaments connect two or more bones, cartilages or other structures. Any activity that wears away at this system may cause a repetitive strain injury. Tendons are a common site of overuse injuries. They are tough tissues with very few nerve endings and little in the way of blood supply. Often found where there are a large number of joints to move in a relatively small space (e.g., hands or wrists), tendons connect the body of the muscle to the bone which it is intended to move. Certain repetitive movements or forceful exertions such as twisting a screwdriver can cause the tendons to rub against adjacent bones and ligaments. This can cause friction which damages the tendons and lead to the constriction of the muscles they were designed to move. The various names for repetitive strain injuries reflect the fact that different tendons, joints or muscles may become damaged depending on which movements are overdone. This is a partial list of a wide range of related diseases that run up the entire hand, wrist, forearm, elbow, shoulder and neck. Rapid and repetitive movements such as keyboard work on typewriters or s, and the repeated twisting of the forearm and hands with tools such as pliers can cause an injury known as tenosynovitis. While tendonitis is the inflammation of the tendons, tenosynovitis is the inflammation of the tendon sheaths usually at the hand or wrist. Tendons located at the wrist and ankle are enclosed in delicate synovial sheaths (you can feel the tendons and synovia move as you place a finger below the wrist crease and open and close your fist). The double walled sleeve of the sheath secretes synovial fluid which provides lubrication for the tendon so that damage and injury from rubbing, friction and pressure is prevented. Rest periods are needed to replenish the fluid. With continuous movement, the lubrication protecting the tendons sheaths is depleted or poor quality lubricant is produced. This causes friction which in turn stimulates increased production of lubricant. When increased lubricant production cannot meet the demand, the tendon and sheath rub against each other and can become inflamed. Movements become painful and can cause a creaking sound called crepitus. In the early stages of tenosynovitis, the worker may experience numbness, tingling and pain during movement. If this happens, work should cease. Injury to the sheath can restrict hand or arm movement and weaken both muscle and grip. Symptoms of tenosynovitis include pain in the wrist and forearm which may travel up the elbow to the shoulder. Swelling and a clear cracking sound may occur. If recognized early enough, as with most such injuries, the condition will improve with rest, although the condition may flare up again. If work continues after the first symptoms appear however, the tendon and tendon sheaths may scar, causing irreversible damage. The only reasonable way to deal with tenosynovitis is to prevent it. This is a type of tenosynovitis more commonly known as “trigger thumb”. It affects the common sheath for the two tendons of the thumb just above the wrist. It is caused by repetitive trigger-like movements involving the wrist. Repeated and forceful movements strain the tendons, irritate them, and cause inflammation and thickening. The thickening tendon can eventually lock and render movement of the associated muscles and bones useless. There are various forms of tendonitis. , for example, affects the tendons which move the shoulders, rotating the arm inward and outward. , refers to the inflammation of the area surrounding the tendons and the muscle junction. It is a thickening of the finger tendons which makes it difficult to straighten the fingers after bending. Tasks requiring too wide a grip on a handle while squeezing can lead to this problem. Repetitive finger movements, pinching and squeezing with fingertips, hand exertions with bent wrist, excessive use of the index finger, twisting of wrists, overly tight grip and uneven work movement can lead to a painful condition called carpal tunnel syndrome. The carpal tunnel is a narrow channel formed by carpal bones on three sides the thick, inelastic carpal ligament on the fourth. It runs through the inner side of the wrist. Tendons inside that tunnel run parallel the extremely fragile median nerve. This nerve passes from the shoulder and forearm to the hand, sending nerve signals to some fingers and the palm. Flexing causes the tendons inside the carpal tunnel to compress on the median nerve (just as sitting for a long period with legs with legs crossed compresses a nerve and causes numbness). Simple occurs when the presence of fluid or the thickening of tissues squeezes the median nerve. The more serious condition of Secondary occurs when inflamed tendon sheaths in the carpal tunnel (tenosynovitis) cause increased pressure on the median nerve. Workers performing light, but highly repetitive movements of the wrist and fingers are particularly likely to develop this injury. The symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome are numbness, tingling and burning sensations, pain in the wrist, wasting of the muscles at the base of the wrist, shiny palm, clumsiness of hands, swelling of the wrist and hand, loss of ability to grasp items and impaired thumb and finger dexterity. In the early stages one may have a sore wrist or forearm. In later stages the pain can be acute and the movement of wrist or fingers limited. There may be a grating sensation (crepitus) with movement. In the advanced stage, finger movements may be jerky, and in the final stage the thumb and fingers may become locked. Sometimes repeated small movements of the palm (e.g. rubber stamping) can cause deposits of fibrous tissue on the tendon sheath of the palm and thumb. A progressive, painless thickening and tightening of the palm tissue beneath the skin takes place causing the hand to close into a claw-like position. It becomes impossible to extend the finger and the hand can become permanently bound. The first symptom of this condition - a small nodule on the palm is followed by nodules appearing on the fingers. Ganglion is an injury closely associated with repetitive strain injuries of the wrist and hands. Precise, repetitive hand movements may lead to the formation of round, hard swelling near a tendon, sheath or joint usually on the back the hand or wrist. Cramping of the hand or forearm can result from the repetitive movement of handwriting or typing. Nerves are affected causing uncontrolled finger movements. Strain injuries of the muscle and tissues in the area of the elbow joint are known as . This is also commonly referred to as “tennis elbow” (lateral epiconylitis) or “golfer’s elbow” (medial epicondylitis). Muscles which bend the wrist and fingers forward and backward are attached at their upper ends to bone and ligament just above the elbow joint. Common causes of epicondylitis include: repeated strain of the forearm (hammering, laying bricks); bending of the wrist against a resisting force (twisting a screwdriver or carrying a heavy load with arms extended); lifting objects with hand held downward and the forefinger in a grasping position. There may be tenderness and swelling in or near the elbow and pain may radiate from the elbow. The pain may be especially acute if the hand is moved. (tennis elbow) is the inflammation of the tissue at the elbow end of the humerus bone (the largest bone of the upper arm). Symptoms are pain and tenderness when fingers are moved with the elbow held away from the body. The pain radiates from the elbow joint. Miner’s elbow, weaver’s elbow, housemaid’s knee, hod-carrier’s shoulders, dustman’s shoulders, and miner’s beat hand, are common names for bursitis. It is an inflammation of the bursa, a fluid-filled fibrous sac often found in areas subject to friction, for example around joints or where a tendon passes over a bone. Excessive, prolonged and repeated pressures or jolts to joints can lead to bursitis, with symptoms of severe pain and restricted movements. Repetitive lifting of your arms can lead to further complications. Two tendons in the shoulder area can be strained because of repetitive work. One of the tendons passes over the top of the shoulder joint and lifts the arm away from the side. The other passes in front of the shoulder joint and assists forward and upward movement of the arm. Work requiring the arms to be moved or lifted away from the chest can cause muscle overload. is one injury resulting from the continuous use of shoulder muscles and tendons. Shoulder and neck strain muscles are related. Neck muscles control head posture and lift and brace the shoulders. Like shoulder muscles, they are in constant use. Symptoms of injury include pain in both areas during rest, stiffness in the neck and headaches arising from the neck, muscle tightness and tender spots in the muscles. Physicians may be confused about the source of pain since it may be “referred” to other parts of the body. Nerves in the shoulders travel down the arm to the hands and any injuries involving shoulders may cause pain elsewhere. Workers with a repetitive strain injury in one part of the body may develop problems in other areas at the same time. When feeling discomfort or pain from doing work in one particular way, they may try and compensate through movements that cause other strain injuries. Thus, pain in wrists or hands can be followed by pains in forearms and shoulders. An additional problem is that workers may try to “work through the pain”. Since they do not relate their pain to the workplace they try to keep up productivity and don’t stop their work. As a result, inflammation continues and worsens leading to even greater injury. Getting s diagnosed is a major concern. The pain can be persistent, but because there are no open signs of injury or damage aside from occasional swelling, workers are accused of being neurotic or malingerers. Often the victim is blamed and told that the pain is “all in the mind”. While the worker finds that doing the job may lead to a painful condition, the pain usually goes away with rest. When returning to work the pain reappears. Other workers may see this person as a chronic complainer because they fail to make the connection between the unseen injury and work. Some physicians have called such problems “women’s complaints” saying that women are more prone to s. However, it’s more likely that many women receive such injuries because they are employed in large numbers where such injuries are common (e.g. typing, keyboard work) or because the tools they must use are designed for the “average male”, not for the smaller grip many women have. Again, because the injury is not plainly visible, women workers are accused of “hysteria”.  Because repetitive strain injuries have numerous causes affecting a variety of areas, eliminating them demands a comprehensive prevention program. The cornerstone of such a program must be to make the job fit the person rather than make the person fit the job. An education program outlining the source and prevention of repetitive strain injuries. Workers should be informed of the symptoms of such injuries so that they can be identified before any serious injury occurs. A reporting system to ensure early symptoms are dealt with seriously and immediately. Workers should not put up with the pain. A provision for rest and time-off work. If the cause of the repetitive motion, trauma, etc. is eliminated a healing process can begin. Too often the worker will return to work as soon as pain disappears. This furthers the problem possibly causing a worsening of the condition. Surgery to deal with serious injury is always the last resort especially in the case of repetitive strain injuries. Job rotation, job enlargement, and repeated rest breaks should be used to break up the series of repetitive motion that can lead to injury. Jobs can be redesigned to eliminate de-skilling, and monotonous and repetitive tasks. Job rotation can be used to vary the muscles used in the work process. A program to investigate and document all complaints of pain related to the workplace. A careful analysis of the workplace should be conducted to detect potential causes of s. A full scale ergonomics study can look at the force, speed and direction of movements, frequency of movements, work posture, rate of worker and stress.  Redesign of tools to fit the individual or specific task. For example, some tools can be designed with smaller grips that require less power to manipulate, squeeze or press, so that hands and wrists are in the same posture as when they are hanging relaxed at one’s side. Badly fitting components should be eliminated and machinery well maintained. Sometimes tools may be redesigned, but the effect is offset by a resultant increase in the work rate. A mix of both tool or workplace redesign and rest breaks would be the most effective. Recognition of repetitive strain injuries as serious occupational injuries is yet to be fully recognized. Each province has different coverage under the Workers’ Compensation Board. Some jurisdictions do not even consider repetitive strain injuries while others will deal with the problem case by case. Workers must demand legislation that covers all repetitive strain injuries and which recognizes the direct relationship between their injuries and the workplace.

Carpal Tunnel Syndrome may occur in pregnancy because of the increase in fluid retention that will cause swelling within the tendon sheath around the median nerve of the hand. The syndrome usually occurs in both hands during the second or third trimester and will resolve when the swelling is gone (by 3 months postpartum). Carpal Tunnel Syndrome does tend to recur with later pregnancies. Generally, intervention is limited to splinting of the wrist at night and Tylenol for pain. It is only the severe cases (severe, debilitating pain of both hands and atrophy of the thenar area) that need to be referred (Blackburn, 2013, p. 522) Bursitis is a pathologic inflammatory disorder of the bursae caused by varied acute or insidious processes. A diagnosis is suspected with the common features that may include pain at motion and at rest, regional loss of range of motion, visible swelling, esp if the affected bursa lies close to the surface; and tenderness to palpation. The most common cause of is by mechanical irritation resulting from overhead activities, and it leads to rotator cuff tendinitis. Other processes that cause bursitis include overuse, trauma, autoimmune diseases, crystal deposits, and infection. Discuss the history and physical findings to confirm diagnosis of bursitis. Hx: Pain exacerbated by overhead activities, and there may be a sleep aching that interrupts sleep at night. Physical: Increased pain with active abduction and internal rotation of the arm plus tenderness below the acromion is demonstrated. Weakness with internal rotationNeer's and Hawkin's Impingement SignsThe impingement injection test (10 ml of 1% lidocaine is inj into the subacromial space; after 5-10min, the maneuver for impingement signs are repeated. If pain is reduced 50% the shoulder pain is secondary to subacromial bursitis and tendonitis. Periodic gentle range of motion joint activitiesAvoidance of activities that exacerbate the pain Therapeutic modalitiesNSAIDSStronger analgesics prn esp at nightFor severe cases- Corticosteroid injections (limited to 3 inj in 12 month period no fewer than 30 days apart)PT-exercises, ultrasound, and electrical stimulation Typical c/o with rotator cuff tear is shoulder pain aggravated by movement, esp overhead activity, and radiating to the anterior aspect of the arm. Abduction is painful and weak, and tenderness may be elicited over the insertion of the greater tuberosity. On exam, the pt will be unable to abduct arm, instead producing a characteristic shoulder shrug. Passive range of motion may not be affected. The drop arm test and the empty can test assess the integrity of the rotator cuff, and results are positive with a significant tears. What diagnostic tests are indicated for diagnosis of rotator cuff tear or rupture/ Plain X-ray films may help dx massive rotator cuff tears (ordered by NP)MRI can help confirm a dx of rotator cuff injury and impingement. MRI, CT scan, and ultrasound should be ordered in consultation with a specialist, particularly when there may be a need for surgical intervention. Labs are seldom needed. But CBC, ESR, Uric Acid, and serologic test for rheumatologic diseases can be performed if indicated by H&P. What is the recommended treatment for rotator cuff tear? Ice packs or cold for the first few day followed by heat, and graded exercisePhysical therapyNSAIDs, low potency opioids, and non-opioidsIntra-articular corticosteroid injectionActivity modification-avoid any activities that precipitates symptoms and esp the offending or ""abusive"" activity. Immobilization (sling) is useful in some situations, only recommended when instability is apparent and never for more than 3-4 days.ROM exercises-pendulum swing and the wall climb (2-3x/day for 5-10 min) The most common and worrisome complication of chronic shoulder pain is adhesive capsulitis. Adhesive capsulitis is characterized by a gradual, progressive decline in shoulder mobility, often resulting from prolonged joint immobilization after a painful episode. Diffuse aching pain and limited mobility are common. Pain is r/t the stretching of the restricted joint capsule. Both active and passive ROM of the glenohumeral joint and scapula is limited. Patient often have difficulties with ADLs, including dressing, toileting and even feeding themselves.

If the pts typical pain is reproduced at any point when the leg is in 20-70 degrees of hip flexion, this indicates a positive test.This maneuver identifies irritation of the lower lumbar nerve roots, L5 and S1. What is the typical presentation with Osteoarthritis? Insidious, progressive pain or stiffness of one or more jointsSx worse on arising and after a prolonged activity. Relieved w/rest.Pain/stiffness worse with weight-bearing activities (stairs, changing positions/activity, walking, prolonged standing)Crepitus (grinding), swelling, joint deformity and gradual loss of motionIf OA involves the cervical or lumbar spine patient may report neuropathy (nerve pain) and rediculopathy (nerve root pain) as nerves are compressed.OA in the hip presents w/groin or buttock pain, may radiate to the knee. patient may favor the hip causing muscles weakness. Known as Trendelenburg's gait.OA of knee may lead to joint deformity, pain on palpation and joint effusions, also atrophy of the quadriceps muscle. 70% of knee OA affects medial joint. What will you include in the physical exam of a patient suspected of osteoarthritis? Range of motion, pain on palpation, crepitus, swelling, deformity (mostly covered in above question)Most diagnostic testing is used to rule out other disease processes.Bone scan may show increased metabolic activity; x-ray may show lost joint space as disease progresses. Joint fluid may be aspirated to rule out crystalline, infectious or inflammatory conditions. What type of deformities are most often seen on hands with someone who has osteoarthritis? Heberden's nodes: deformity of the distal interphalangeal jointsBouchard's nodes: deformity of the proximal interphalangeal joints What is the typical medical management of care for a patient with osteoarthritis? Tylenol 1g 3x daily (max daily dose 3g/24 hours) mainstay for initial treatmentTramadol (not an NSAID but a non-opioid pain reliever). Synergistic effect w/tylenol or NSAIDs.NSAIDs~ use cautiously in patients at risk for cardiac toxicity, or renal & liver dysfxHyaluronans: intra-articular injections act as lubricant and improves fluid viscosity within the joint. Injected 1x week for 3-5 weeks. Benefits last for >6 months.Kenalog and Depo-Medrol: corticosteroid intra-articular injections. After initial increase in pain, warmth and redness, most patients have significant pain relief. Cannot be done more often than every 3-4 months. Cautious w/patients taking oral prednisone or diabetics. Other medications: opiates, neurontin, SSRIs, tricyclic antidepressants, OTC rubs and patches, lidocaine patches, topical NSAID gel (diclofenac)Non pharmacologic management: : EXERCISE, PT and OT (strengthens structure, improves ROM, decreases pain, improves CV conditioning, weight reduction). Also stretching programs, supportive footwear, assistive devices, heat, ice. Weight reduction is a big factor in symptom improvement. Complamentary: acupuncture, glucosamine with or w/o chondroiton (1500mg daily for 6 months - if no improvement, discontinue)Also: omega-3, bromelain, dimethyl sulfoxide, ginger, MSM, SAM-eSurgery (total joint replacement) if none of the above work. Pain and immobilityDecreased quality of life (well-being and mood), less exercise, inability to control weightIncreased risk of falls DT pain and weakness Ankle sprain, what is the difference between grade 1,2 and 3? Grade 1 :due to overstretching there is a microscopic tear in the ligamentGrade 2: an incomplete tear of the ligament causing some functional impairment Grade 3 : a complete tear or the ligament, with loss of ligament integrity ( LE sprains result in weight bearing difficulty) RICE: Rest- Ice (at 20 minute intervals) - if spasms occur switch to heat CompressionElevation -for the initial 24hrs the ankle should be elevated above the level of the heart ( to reduce swelling) Compartment syndrome is complication of any muscular injury caused by a decreased blood flow to the compartment resulting in ischemia and necrosis. Compartment syndrome can additionally be caused by a very tight bandage causing constriction in the fasha (compartment) the compression causes a histamine release and additional compression, can lead to irreversible muscle and nerve damage in 2-4 hours ( in 24-48 hrs there may be complete limb function loss and a permanent deformity.Elastic bandages need to be removed every 2-3 hours for 15 minutes then re-wrapping snugly. peripheral neuropathy that involves entrapment and compression of the median nerve affecting the carpal tunnel in the wrist .The hand consists of a bony canal, known as the carpal tunnel, located at the base of the palm. The carpal tunnel is surrounded by the carpal bones on the ulnar, radial, and dorsal sides. The transverse carpal ligament covers the carpal tunnel which aids as a passage for blood vessels, tendons, and the median nerve of the hand. Any condition causing edema or irritation to the tendons of the hand will decrease the size of the canal, which will result in pressure to the median nerve by the transverse carpal ligament, eliciting symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome Discuss diagnostic tests used for carpal tunnel syndrome. Several maneuvers can be performed when determining a diagnosis for CTS. A pin sensation test of the hand will identify the nerve distribution affected, which in the case of CTS the median nerve distribution would be affected. Three common tests performed to evaluate CTS include the Tinel's test, Phalen's test, and thumb abduction Discuss how EMG could be used for diagnosis of carpal tunnel. Definitive analysis of nerve function can be performed with studies of how well an electric impulse conducts along the nerve. A device called an EMG can detect abnormalities in nerve impulse conduction; these nerve conduction abnormalities are the cause of carpal tunnel syndrome symptoms. The EMG does not always need to be performed, but may be done if a patient's symptoms are not typical of carpal tunnel syndrome. Tinel's Sign-Tinel's test is performed by tapping the median nerve along its course in the wrist. A positive test is found when this causes worsening of the tingling in the fingers when the nerve is tapped. Phalen's test is done by pushing the back of your hands together for one minute. This compresses the carpal tunnel and is also positive when it causes the same symptoms you have been experiencing with your carpal tunnel syndrome. How can you provide immediate relief from carpal tunnel? Immobilizing the affected wrist, especially at night, with help alleviate symptoms. Ice to the affected area and tylenol for pain prn. Resting the affected extremity will be necessary. Pregnant women may obtain relief from wrist splinting, massage, cold compresses, analgesics, and a combination of strengthening and stretching exercises Why does carpal tunnel syndrome happen in pregnancy? Because of the increase in fluid retention that will cause swelling within the tendon sheath around the median nerve of the hand. The syndrome usually occurs in both hands during the second or third trimester and will resolve when the swelling is gone (by 3 months postpartum). Carpal Tunnel Syndrome does tend to recur with later pregnancies. Generally, intervention is limited to splinting of the wrist at night and Tylenol for pain. It is only the severe cases (severe, debilitating pain of both hands and atrophy of the thenar area) that need to be referred (Blackburn, 2013, p. 522) What is typical follow up plan for carpal tunnel during pregnancy? A follow-up visit will be scheduled in 7-14 days for re-evaluation of CTS symptoms . This time period will allow for non-surgical interventions to take effect. The patient will be advised to schedule an appointment sooner or contact the provider if symptoms worsen. Describe an appropriate work-up for a patient with complaints of Fibromyalgia OLDCARTSDefinition: More than 3 months of musculoskeletal pain above and below the waist bilaterally associated with pain on palpation of tender points. Hallmark Sx: persistent, widespread pain & chronic fatigue; may report allodynnia or hyperalgesia (basically an exaggerated pain response to stimuli that is not painful), and pain worse w/repetition. Pain is typically constant throughout day.Other somatic complaints and/or comorbidities: non restorative sleep, cognitive difficulties, auditory, vestibular and ocular complaints, chronic rhinitis or ""allergies"", migraines, palpitations, irritable bowel syndrome, subjective sense of joint swelling and mood disorders, TMJ, female urethreal syndrome, chronic fatigue syndrome, depression, anxiety.8-9x more prevalent in women than men, usual onset is gradual at 40-50y/o; affects 3-6 million americans; accounts for 2% of all primary care visits; 10% of internal medicine referrals and 20% of rheumatology referrals. What is the physical exam of patient with complaint of fibromyalgia? Pt will have normal muscle strength, no evidence of synovitis or soft tissue inflammationRule out other diseases-reumatological, infectious, neurological, endocrineLabwork all results are normal CBC, ESR, RF, ANA, TSH, but are important in excluding underlying autoimmune disorders i.e.. lupus, and RA By exclusion of other diagnoses, normal lab work, pain criteria met. What is the major component in the pathogenesis of fibromyalgia? Altered central pain processing which means pain is recognized at a lower threshold and over a larger area; elevated pain neurotransmitter substance is seen in brain as well as altered pain inhibitory mediators, dysfunction of HPA axis, decreased growth hormone (GH), insulin-like growth factor (IGF) and prolactin, causing interruption of stage 3 and 4 of sleep, which is responsible for the morning fatigue (text). American College of Rheumatology developed criteria for classification of FMS in 1990. 2 criteria are: 1) pain in axial skeleton-low back, thoracic spine, anterior chest or neck, and all 4 body quadrants and 2) excessive tenderness elicited at 11 of 18 muscle-tendon sites, with 4kg of pressure-examiner uses pressure point of thumb, enough to blanch examiner's nailbed. However, patients can still have FMS w/o meeting this criteria. This tool is not meant to be used as rigid diagnostic criteria.

Medical Editor: When Should I Call the Doctor About Spinal Stenosis? The spinal canal is formed by the central openings of a series of bones (vertebrae) stacked on top of each other. The upper part of the spinal canal is the cervical spine in the neck, the middle part is the thoracic spine of the midback, and the lower part is the lumbar spine of the lower back. The spinal canal is attached to the head at the top and to the pelvis at the bottom. The passes from the brain through the spinal canal and travels down the back. Nerves exit off the spinal cord between vertebrae of the neck and low back that help control the arms and legs respectively. Spinal stenosis is a condition whereby there is abnormal narrowing in the spinal canal. This narrowing limits the amount of space available for the spinal cord and nerves. As spinal stenosis becomes more severe there is compression or squeezing of the spinal cord and its nerves. Spinal stenosis can occur anywhere in the spinal canal, but it is most common in the cervical and lumbar spine. The most common reason to develop spinal stenosis is , or bony and soft tissue changes that result from ageing. Spinal stenosis is usually seen in patients over 50 years of age, and becomes progressively more severe with increased age. The normal ""wear and tear"" of ageing can cause in the spine that leads to spinal stenosis. This can be from (osteophytes) forming, bulging and wear of the intervertebral discs, and thickening of the ligaments between the vertebrae. Sometimes, increased motion between the vertebrae can cause one vertebra to slip forward on another. This is called , and it can also cause spinal stenosis. Not everyone develops spinal stenosis as they become older. Certain people are more likely to develop spinal stenosis than others. People that have a family history of spinal stenosis or other back problems are at an increased risk of developing spinal stenosis because of a genetic trait. Also, people that subject their backs to greater demands such as heavy laborers or athletes are also at an increased risk to develop spinal stenosis than someone with a more sedentary job. Spinal stenosis may also occur in people with certain connective tissue diseases such as anhylosing spondylitis. The term refers to stiffness in the joints. The symptoms of spinal stenosis depend on where the stenosis occurs in the spinal canal and how severe it is. Symptoms caused by compression of the spinal cord are called myelopathy. These can include: difficulty buttoning buttons or picking up small coins, and Symptoms caused by compression of the nerves are called radiculopathy. These can include: weakness along the path of the nerve being compressed. When stenosis develops in the neck (cervical spine stenosis) there can be compression of the spinal cord and the nerves that travel into the arms and hands. This can cause symptoms of: When the stenosis develops in the lower back (lumbar spine stenosis) there is compression of the nerves that travel into the legs and . This can cause: weakness or cramping in the legs and feet, particularly progressively with and being relieved with resting. These symptoms are sometimes referred to as pseudoclaudication (false blockage) as they mimic the symptoms of inadequate circulation to the legs that is referred to as claudication. When Should I Call the Doctor About Spinal Stenosis? If an individual begins to experience increasing pain in the neck or back or numbness and tingling in the arms and legs you they have spinal stenosis. While these symptoms range in severity from annoying to significantly impairing function, they should be evaluated by a healthcare professional. There are many potential causes of these symptoms and some causes are serious. If the patient's symptoms last longer than six weeks or if the patient develops any increasing weakness in the arms or problems controlling the bowel or bladder they should seek medical attention. When the patient visits a doctor, he or she will be asked questions about his or her symptoms. This is called a medical history. It will allow the doctor to obtain information about when the patient first developed symptoms, what makes it better or worse, what previous treatments have been tried, and what other medical conditions the patient may have that can affect spinal stenosis. The doctor will then perform a physical examination, which will test the patient's muscle strength, reflexes, sensation, balance, and circulation to help determine if he or she has spinal stenosis. The specific location of the patient's symptoms can help the doctor determine which nerves are affected by the stenosis. After the medical history and physical examination the doctor may order various tests to help confirm the diagnosis of spinal stenosis. These can include imaging studies such as X-rays, a CT () scan, or an (). These can help identify if the patient has any arthritis in the spine and can show the spinal cord and nerve being compressed. The doctor may also order testing of the patient's nerves to see if there is any damage to the nerves caused by the spinal stenosis. These tests are called nerve conduction studies and EMGs (). Low Back Pain Symptoms, Causes, Treatment and Relief There are various treatments available for spinal stenosis depending on how severe the patient's symptoms are and underlying medical conditions. In the majority of cases, it can be treated without surgery. If the patient's symptoms are relatively mild and resolving he or she may not need to seek medical care. In many cases symptoms can improve with simple measures the patient can begin on their own. Activity modification can help lessen symptoms. The patient should try to avoid certain activities that tend to worsen the symptoms. Heat or ice to the affected areas if needed. Over-the-counter medications may be taken to relieve pain. There are a variety of medical treatments available for spinal stenosis. Initial treatments include anti-inflammatory medications such as (, , etc.) or (, Naprelan, , ). These medications help reduce the inflammation and swelling around the nerves being compression. Oral medications may be tried. Epidural steroid (cortisone) injections can provide a larger dose of medications to reduce inflammation directly to the site of . Physical therapy can help strengthen the muscles surrounding the spinal column and take some of the pressure off the spine. What Is Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)? Symptoms, Treatment, Diagnosis Sometimes, patients do not obtain enough relief of their symptoms from these nonsurgical treatments. If the patient is unable to function or do his or her normal activities due to pain, surgery could be an option. Additionally, patients with severe spinal cord compression (myelopathy) or increasing weakness of the muscles should consider surgery to help prevent permanent . The surgeon customizes the surgical options for each person. There are several types of surgeries to treat spinal stenosis. The goal of each of these surgeries is to provide more space for the spinal cord or nerves that are being compressed due to spinal stenosis. This is accomplished by various procedures that involve removal of bone and/or tissues that are compressing the spinal nerves in the low back, referred to as decompression. These operations all require diligent management of postoperative care. Surgical procedures for spinal stenosis in the spine of the low back that are somewhat less invasive than traditional lumbar decompression have become available. Interspinous devices that have been used in certain patients for this purpose include X-Stop and Coflex devices, but these are considered investigational devices by many practitioners at this time. In the lumbar spine, this is most commonly treated with a . This surgery removes a portion of the vertebra (lamina) to create additional space for the nerve. If any a small portion of the lamina is removed it is called a laminotomy. If too much of the bone has to be removed, or if there is too much motion remaining between the bones, the decompression may need to be combined with a fusion to help stabilize the spine. In the cervical spine, the most common treatment is an anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF). With this surgery the disc is removed from between two vertebrae along with any bone spurs pushing on the nerves or spinal cord. A bone graft is then used to replace the disc, and a metal plate is attached to the front of the vertebrae to help the bone grow together or fuse. If multiple levels are involved in the neck, one of more vertebrae can be removed. This is called a corpectomy. After the bones are removed, a bone graft replaces them along with a plate. Cervical spinal stenosis can also be treated surgically from the back side of the neck. A laminectomy can be performed as in the lumbar spine, but is typically combined with a fusion in the cervical spine to prevent any abnormal motion from instability after the surgery. A final procedure for cervical stenosis is a laminoplasty. The involves creating more space in the back of the spinal canal by opening the back of the spine like a door, and leaving it open with a combination of bone grafts or plates. The follow-up care with a physician will depend on what treatment has been provided. If the patient is treated without surgery he or she will likely have close follow-up initially to determine how he or she is are responding to the treatment. Once the symptoms begin to improve the patient can follow-up less frequently or only if he or she has a problem to discuss. If the patient has had surgery he or she will have close follow-up for years after surgery. Unfortunately, there is no way to prevent spinal stenosis from occurring. It is most commonly due to degenerative arthritis that occurs with ageing. Individuals can help limit the symptoms by staying fit and in good overall shape. In most cases the prognosis for spinal stenosis is very good. Many people can obtain good relief of their symptoms with nonsurgical treatment. In some case, as the stenosis becomes more severe, the nonsurgical treatment become less effective. For those patients, surgery is a good option to consider. Most patients obtain good relief of the symptoms in their arms and legs soon after the surgery relieves the compression of the nerves. The exception is in more severe cases where there was prolonged compression of the nerves that caused permanent nerve damage. As in other parts of the body, arthritis of the spine can be progressive even after surgery. It is possible to develop new symptoms years after surgery either at the same level or at nearby levels. Osteoarthritis (OA) is not a single disease but rather the end result of a variety of disorders leading to the structural or functional failure of one or more of your joints. Osteoarthritis is the most common cause of chronic joint pain, affecting over 25 million Americans. Osteoarthritis involves the entire joint, including the nearby muscles, underlying bone, ligaments, joint lining (synovium), and the joint cover (capsule). Osteoarthritis also involves progressive loss of cartilage. The cartilage tries to repair itself, the bone remodels, the underlying (subchondral) bone hardens, and bone cysts form. This process has several phases. Medically reviewed by Aimee V. HachigianGould, MD; American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery REFERENCE: Levin, Kerry, MD.

Medical Editor: When Should Someone Seek Medical Care for a Bone Spur? How Do Health Care Professionals Diagnose Bone Spurs? Is Follow-up Necessary After Treatment of Bone Spurs? A bone spur is an outgrowth of bone that can occur along the edges of a bone. It is also called an osteophyte. Seek medical care if you are experiencing persistent pain due to bone spurs. Treatment options depend upon the signs and symptoms that you are experiencing. Bone spurs can form in any bone but are most commonly found in joints, where two or more bones come together. They also occur where muscles, ligaments, or tendons attach to the bone. Some of the most common parts of the body affected by bone spurs are the neck (cervical spine), low back (lumbar spine), shoulder, hip, knee, and heel. Other areas may be affected as well, including the (), hands, wrists, and (the top of the foot [midfoot], arch of the foot, or toes). Bone spurs typically occur because of continued or rubbing of a bone for a prolonged period of time. This can be due to or inflammation such as . Normally there is a layer of cartilage along the edges of bones where they come together to form a joint. With , this cartilage layer becomes worn away, and the bones can rub directly against each other. New bone forms in response to the or inflammation. It is the bone's method of trying to stabilize or protect itself. There are other medical conditions that are commonly associated with bone spurs. These include a condition known as . This is an inflammation of the fascia or connective tissue on the bottom of the foot where it attaches to the heel bone or calcaneus. (DISH) and are both inflammatory disorders that affect the body's ligaments and cause bone spurs in the spine. The term refers to stiffness in the joints. Risk factors for bone spurs include to a joint. An accident that injures a joint increases the likelihood of osteoarthritis and bone spurs occurring in that joint later in life. Also, overuse of a joint or tendon can predispose one to bone spurs. Genetics is also a risk factor for the development of bone spurs. People with many family members with bone spurs are more likely to develop bone spurs themselves. The conditions and diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH) both place a person at high risk for developing bone spurs in the spine. is a risk factor for the development of bone spurs and osteoarthritis. The exact connection between these is unknown. Bone spurs do not always cause symptoms. Many people have bone spurs but do not know it. However, if bone spurs rub against other bones or nearby soft tissues they can cause pain or a loss of normal motion in a joint. This is most common in the hips, knees, shoulders, hands, and feet. If the bone spurs rub against tendons or ligaments, they can cause pain or a tear. This is a common complication in the shoulder and can lead to a rotator cuff tear. If bone spurs occur in the spine, they can cause pain and loss of motion, but they can also pinch the nerves or . When nerves in the spine are pinched, it is known as radiculopathy. It can cause pain, numbness, tingling, or weakness in the arms or legs. If the spinal cord is compressed, it is called myelopathy. This can cause problems with balance, weakness, and pain. When Should Someone Seek Medical Care for a Bone Spur? If you are having problems with increased pain in your joints or loss of motion, you may have bone spurs. Other conditions can also cause these symptoms. If these symptoms cause significant persistent pain, you should seek medical care to have it evaluated. Specialists who treat people with bone spurs include internists, family medicine doctors, generalists, rheumatologists, orthopedists, and physical medicine and rehabilitation specialists. Physical therapists and occupational therapists also treat patients with bone spurs. How Do Health Care Professionals Diagnose Bone Spurs? A doctor will likely begin with a medical history and physical examination. The medical history is a series of questions about someone's condition and a review of any other medical problems. The physical examination will include testing the joints that are affected to determine how much motion an individual has, how much pain one experiences with motion, and a check of muscle strength. Based on the results of the medical history and physical, a physician may recommend obtaining imaging studies to diagnose bone spurs. This often starts with plain radiographs (X-rays). These are typically able to show if bone spurs have formed and if the joint is affected. If there is a question of possible tear of a tendon such as a rotator cuff tear, an may be ordered. An MRI or may also be ordered in the spine to assess for possible nerve or spinal cord compression. Treatment for bone spurs depends on the symptoms one is having. Pain is the most common symptom and is often initially treated with medications. Anti-inflammatory medications are typically used first. These help both to relieve pain and to reduce the inflammation caused by the bone spurs. A doctor may also recommend physical therapy to help with bone spur symptoms. The physical therapy is not able to remove bone spurs, but it can help with some of the symptoms related to them. If one has a loss of motion in a joint caused by bone spurs, physical therapy can help strengthen the surrounding muscles and increase the motion in the joints. Physical therapy can include ice or packs, stretching exercises, treatments, or massage. In some cases, an injection of a steroid such as into the joint can help reduce pain from bone spurs. These injections can often be performed in a doctor's office, depending on the joint involved. If the hips or spine are involved, the injections usually are performed using an X-ray machine to help guide the placement of the injection. Over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medications can be used to treat pain. A doctor or physical therapist can provide a patient with simple stretching exercises to perform at home. Other home remedies for bone spurs include applying ice to the affected joint. What Is Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)? Symptoms, Treatment, Diagnosis If the bone spurs affect the foot or heel, a doctor may recommend special pads or inserts for shoes called orthotics to help take the pressure off the bone spurs. Is Follow-up Necessary After Treatment of Bone Spurs? If one continues to have worsening problems due to bone spurs, follow up with a doctor for further evaluation. In some cases, if symptoms cannot be controlled with more conservative treatment, surgery could be an option. The goal of surgery is to remove the bone spurs to allow for a more normal joint or to remove the pressure on muscles, tendons, ligaments, or nerves. The surgery may simply remove the bone spurs, but in other cases, the removal could be part of a larger surgery such as a joint-replacement surgery. Bone spurs are usually the result of , so there is no specific way to prevent them. Maintaining an active lifestyle and being physically fit can often help reduce the symptoms related to bone spurs. Maintaining a healthy weight reduces the load on the joints. This may help prevent the formation of bone spurs, especially in the knees. The prognosis for the treatment of bone spurs is good. There have been many recent advancements in medications for the treatment of arthritis and other causes of bone spurs. Additionally, newer and less invasive surgical techniques allow for a faster recovery and return to normal activities.

Medical Editor: When Should Someone Seek Medical Care for Spondylosis? What Tests Do Doctors Use to Diagnose Spondylosis? Are Physical Therapy, Exercise, and Adjunctive Therapies Effective for Spondylosis? Are Minimally Invasive Procedures and Injections Effective Treatments for Spondylosis? What Are Treatment Options for Spondylosis? The word comes from the Greek word for . Spondylosis refers to degenerative changes in the spine such as and degenerating intervertebral discs between the vertebrae. Spondylosis changes in the spine are frequently referred to as . For example, the phrase ""spondylosis of the lumbar spine"" means degenerative changes such as of the vertebral joints and degenerating intervertebral discs (degenerative disc disease) in the low back. Spondylosis can occur in the cervical spine (neck), thoracic spine (upper and mid back), or lumbar spine (low back). Lumbar spondylosis and cervical spondylosis are the most common. Thoracic spondylosis frequently does not cause symptoms. Lumbosacral spondylosis is spondylosis that affects both the lumbar spine and the sacral spine (below the lumbar spine, in the midline between the buttocks). Multilevel spondylosis means that these changes affect multiple vertebrae in the spine. There are several medical terms that sound similar to and are often confused with spondylosis including the following: Spondylitis is inflammation of one or more vertebrae, such as in , an inflammatory form of of the spine. This is a very different process than spondylosis because spondylosis is degenerative while spondylitis is inflammatory. Spondylolysis is incomplete development and formation of the connecting part of the vertebra, the pars interarticularis. This defect predisposes to spondylolisthesis (see below) because of spinal instability. Spondylolisthesis is forward or backward displacement of the body of one vertebrae in relation to an adjacent vertebra. For example, anterior spondylolisthesis of L4 on L5 means that the fourth lumbar vertebra has slipped forward on the fifth lumbar vertebra. As a result, the spine is not normally aligned. If the displaced vertebrae shift with movement of the spine, this is referred to as dynamic spondylolisthesis. Dynamic shifting of the vertebrae is visualized with X-rays of the spine performed with patients flexing (bending forward) and then extending (bending backward) their back. Spondylosis deformans is growth of bone spurs (osteophytes) or bony bridges around a degenerating intervertebral disc in the spine. is narrowing of the spinal canal. This narrowing of the spinal canal limits the amount of space for the and nerves. Pressure on the spinal cord and nerves due to limited space can cause symptoms such as pain, numbness, and tingling. is pain shooting down the as it runs from the low back down the buttock and the leg, either on one side or both sides. often occurs when a puts pressure on the sciatic nerve as it exits the spinal canal in the low back. Sciatica is a specific type of radiculopathy (compression or irritation of nerves as they leave the spinal column). Sciatica can be associated with spondylosis because the degenerative changes in the spine predispose to and subsequent . Spondylosis is an phenomenon. With age, the bones and ligaments in the spine wear, leading to bone spurs (osteoarthritis). Also, the intervertebral discs degenerate and weaken, which can lead to disc herniation and bulging discs. Spondylosis is common. Symptoms are often first reported between the ages of 20 and 50. Over 80% of people over the age of 40 have evidence of spondylosis on X-ray studies. The rate at which spondylosis occurs is partly related to genetic predisposition as well as injury history. Genetics is another risk factor for spondylosis. If many people in a family have spondylosis, there is likely to be a stronger genetic predisposition to spondylosis. Spinal injury is also a risk factor for spondylosis. Injuries can cause intervertebral discs to herniate. Also, osteoarthritis is more likely to develop in injured joints, including joints in the spine. This can take years to develop. Many different specialties of physicians treat spondylosis, including internists, family medicine doctors, general practitioners, rheumatologists, neurologists, neurosurgeons, orthopedists, and pain-management specialists. Non-physician health-care practitioners who often treat spondylosis include physician assistants and nurse practitioners, as well as physical therapists, massage therapists, and chiropractors. Many people with spondylosis on X-ray do not have any symptoms. In fact, lumbar spondylosis (spondylosis in the low back) is present in 27%-37% of people without symptoms. In some people, spondylosis causes and due to nerve compression (pinched nerves). Pinched nerves in the neck can cause pain in the neck or shoulders and . Nerve compression is caused by bulging discs and bone spurs on the facet joints, causing narrowing of the holes where the nerve roots exit the spinal canal (foraminal stenosis). Even if they are not large enough to directly pinch a nerve, bulging discs can cause local inflammation and cause the nerves in the spine to become more sensitive, increasing pain. Also, disc herniations can push on the ligaments in the spine and cause pain. If new nerves or blood vessels are stimulated to grow from the pressure, can result. Because of the pain, the local area of the spine may attempt to splint itself, resulting in regional tenderness, muscle spasm, and trigger points. Characteristic findings of spondylosis can be visualized with X-ray tests. These findings include decrease in the disc space, bony spur formation at the upper or lower portions of the vertebrae, and calcium deposition where the vertebrae have been affected by degenerative inflammation. Symptoms of spondylosis include localized pain in the area of spondylosis, usually in the back or neck. Spondylosis in the cervical spine (neck) can cause . However, it is controversial whether more mild spondylosis, such as small bone spurs and bulging discs that do not compress nerves, causes . This is because most middle-aged and elderly people have abnormal findings on X-ray tests of spondylosis, even when they are completely pain free. Therefore, other factors are likely major contributors to . If a herniated disc from spondylosis causes a , pain may shoot into a limb. For example, a large disc herniation in the lumbar spine can cause nerve compression and cause pain that originates in the low back and then radiates into the legs. This is called radiculopathy. When the sciatic nerve, which runs from the low back down the leg to the foot, is affected, it is called sciatica. Radiculopathy and sciatica often cause numbness and tingling (sensation of pins and needles) in an extremity. Back pain due to a bulging disc is typically worse with prolonged standing, sitting, and forward bending and is often better with changing positions frequently and . Back pain due to osteoarthritis of the facet joints is typically worse with walking and standing and relieved with forward bending. Symptoms of numbness and tingling may be felt if a nerve is pinched. If a nerve is severely pinched, weakness of an affected extremity may occur. If a herniated disc pushes on the spinal cord, this can cause injury to the spinal cord (myelopathy). Spondylosis with myelopathy refers to spondylosis that is injuring the spinal cord. Spondylosis without myelopathy refers to spondylosis without any injury to the spinal cord. Symptoms of myelopathy include numbness, tingling, and weakness. For example, a large herniated disc in the cervical spine could cause cervical myelopathy if it is large enough to push on the spinal cord with resulting symptoms of numbness, tingling, and weakness in the arms and possibly the legs. What Is Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)? Symptoms, Treatment, Diagnosis When Should Someone Seek Medical Care for Spondylosis? Because the diagnosis of spondylosis is made with images by plain film X-ray, , or scan, most people with this diagnosis have already seen their doctor. Reasons for re-evaluation by a health-care professional include the following: If your pain is not manageable with the prescribed treatment For the development of acute nerve dysfunction, such weakness in one or more limbs (For example, see your doctor if your leg is weak and you are unable to flex your foot at the ankle or walk on your toes or heels.) Loss of bladder or bowel control, in the setting of acute back or neck pain, such as inability to start or stop urinating, can indicate a serious nerve dysfunction and should be evaluated at the emergency department immediately. Numbness in the groin area, or ""saddle anesthesia,"" meaning numbness in the distribution where the bottom would contact a saddle: This can indicate a serious nerve dysfunction and should be evaluated at the emergency department immediately. If back or neck pain is associated with or greater than 100 F What Tests Do Doctors Use to Diagnose Spondylosis? The diagnosis of spondylosis is made using radiology tests such as plain film X-rays, MRI, or CT scans. X-rays can show bone spurs on vertebral bodies in the spine, thickening of facet joints (the joints that connect the vertebrae to each other), and narrowing of the intervertebral disc spaces. CT scans of the spine are able to visualize the spine in greater detail and can diagnose narrowing of the spinal canal (spinal stenosis) when present. MRI scans are expensive but show the greatest detail in the spine and are used to visualize the intervertebral discs, including the degree of disc herniation, if present. An MRI is also used to visualize the vertebrae, the facet joints, the nerves, and the ligaments in the spine and can reliably diagnose a pinched nerve. There is no treatment to reverse the process of spondylosis, because it is a degenerative process. The treatments for spondylosis target the back pain and neck pain that spondylosis can cause. Therefore, the treatment of spondylosis is similar to the treatment of back pain and neck pain. Available treatments fall into several categories: medications, self-care, and physical therapy, adjunctive therapies (chiropractics and ), minimally invasive procedures such as injections, and surgery. No medication has been proven to reverse the degenerative process of spondylosis. Treatment of pain from spondylosis commonly includes anti-inflammatory medications, analgesics (), and muscle relaxants. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications, or NSAIDs, can be very effective in relieving back and neck pain from spondylosis. Some of these medications, such as (, ) and (), are available without a prescription. Other NSAIDs are prescription strength and may be prescribed by a health-care professional. Muscle relaxants such as () and () are examples of that can relieve the muscle spasm associated with spondylosis. Analgesics (pain medications), such as () and (), are used to treat pain. If the pain is extremely severe, sometimes a medication (, or others) is prescribed for the first several days. is known to be anti-inflammatory and has been proven to improve several conditions such as and . There are some studies suggesting it may improve back and neck pain symptoms, as well. Certain are helpful in treating chronic back pain. Medications termed , including (Elavil) and (), have been used for many years, in low doses, to treat chronic back pain, neck pain, and other pain. Recently, another , (), has been shown to improve chronic back pain. Cymbalta is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA approved) to treat chronic , as well as other conditions. Some people find topical medications, which are massaged directly onto the location of the pain, helpful in relieving pain from spondylosis. These medications work in different ways, and many are available without a prescription. Some examples of topical medications include Aspercreme, which contains and is anti-inflammatory. Capsaicin cream is another topical medication which many find helpful. Capsaicin is the active ingredient in chili pepper and should not be used on areas where the skin is cut or irritated. After application, thorough hand washing is important, especially prior to touching the face, to avoid irritation from the capsaicin. Home treatment is important in pain caused by spondylosis because pain may frequently improve or resolve after several days. Experts have found that bed rest prolongs the time to recovery. Therefore, it is recommended to continue normal or near normal activities. However, do not do anything that could exacerbate the problem, such as heavy lifting. Home remedies, including warm compresses and/or ice, may be helpful for back and neck pain caused by spondylosis. Sleeping with a pillow between the legs may be helpful for . Special pillows to offer additional cervical spine support have been developed for neck pain. Are Physical Therapy, Exercise, and Adjunctive Therapies Effective for Spondylosis? A doctor may prescribe physical therapy for back or neck pain that does not resolve on its own after a few weeks. Physical therapy is often prescribed for chronic back or neck pain for muscle strengthening and stretching. Physical therapists can demonstrate specific exercises which, when performed daily, may help strengthen the back and abdominal muscles and prevent recurrent pain. Physical on a regular basis, specifically walking and , have been shown in studies to be beneficial for chronic back pain. Chiropractic spinal manipulation may be helpful to some people, especially within the first month of pain. However, certain patients should not undergo spinal manipulation for safety reasons. Specifically, patients with inflammatory arthritis involving the spine, such as and in some cases, , should not undergo spinal manipulation due to a small but serious risk of damage to the spinal cord. for back pain involves inserting very thin needles at various depths into specified areas in the body. The needle placement is designed to balance the chi (or qi), which is thought to flow on meridians throughout the body. Studies of acupuncture for back and neck pain have had mixed results. Other alternative therapies such as treatments have not been shown in studies to improve the symptoms of spondylosis. What Are Treatment Options for Spondylosis? Spondylosis is a chronic condition. Surgery for patients with chronic low back pain is controversial, because while some studies do show improvements in pain and disability, most studies do not show improvement as compared to nonsurgical treatment such as physical therapy and pain management. Also, many patients continue to have chronic back pain after the surgery. However, surgery is sometimes necessary when spondylosis or spinal stenosis causes a nerve problem that is severe or worsening, progressive , or difficulty walking. Surgery is rarely necessary in patients with acute back pain, unless progressive neurologic problems develop. This is because most patients improve dramatically after treatment with medications and physical therapy, and most patients improve within days to weeks after back pain starts. Surgery is sometimes performed for acute sciatica (if nerve problems such as weakness and numbness are severe and worsen rather than improve) and , a syndrome where the nerves at the bottom of the spinal cord are compressed by an intervertebral disc or a mass, causing neurologic problems. Spinal decompression surgery involves various surgical procedures that can relieve pressure on the nerves in the back due to spinal stenosis, herniated intervertebral discs, or foraminal stenosis (narrowing of the openings between the facet joints due to bone spurs). Common techniques for decompression include the following: is a procedure to remove the bony arches of the spinal canal (lamina) subsequently increasing the size of the spinal canal and decreasing pressure on the spinal cord. Discectomy is a procedure to remove a portion of an intervertebral disc that is putting pressure on a nerve root or the spinal canal. Foraminotomy or foraminectomy is a procedure to expand the openings for the nerve roots to exit the spinal canal. During a foraminectomy, generally more tissue is removed than during a foraminotomy. Osteophyte removal is a procedure to remove bone spurs from an area where they are causing pinched nerves. Corpectomy is a procedure to remove a vertebral body and discs. Fusion of the vertebrae is sometimes combined with one or more of these procedures in order to stabilize the spine. The term refers to stiffness in the joints. Are Minimally Invasive Procedures and Injections Effective Treatments for Spondylosis? () can be injected into the epidural space (the space surrounding the spinal cord). This is commonly known as an epidural injection. Steroids can also be injected into the facet joints that connect the vertebrae, trigger points in the soft tissue, or directly into the intervertebral disc spaces. These procedures may have a role in managing acute pain, especially radicular pain, which radiates into a limb. Other procedures for back and neck pain include intradiscal injections (cortisone injection directly into an intervertebral disc), trigger point injections of steroid, anesthetic, or both, facet joint steroid injection, steroid injection into the sacroiliac joints, steroid injection into the for , and radiofrequency denervation (destruction of painful nerves using a radiofrequency current) among others. Your doctor may want you to schedule a follow-up appointment to monitor your response to treatment. Routine follow-up imaging, such as X-ray, CT, or MRI, is usually unnecessary. The exception is a change in symptoms that may change therapy, such as new onset sciatica or new onset pain radiating down one arm. The main complication of spondylosis is low back, mid back, or neck pain. Usually the back and neck pain caused by spondylosis is not serious, but some people develop chronic pain due to their condition. It is unusual for spondylosis to cause serious neurologic dysfunction due to nerve compression. Over time, the degenerative changes of spondylosis can cause spinal stenosis, where the spinal canal becomes narrow, and the spinal cord can become pinched. Therefore, spinal stenosis in the neck or low back can be a complication of spondylosis. Cauda equina syndrome, a syndrome where the nerves at the bottom of the spinal cord are compressed by an intervertebral disc or a mass, is a rare complication of spondylosis that can cause severe nerve problems. Spondylosis is a degenerative process, and there is no known method to prevent the degenerative pathologic process. However, some measures may be helpful to prevent the neck and back pain that spondylosis may cause. Generally, the prognosis of spondylosis is favorable. Many people with spondylosis do not have any symptoms. Of those who develop back or neck pain due to spondylosis, most improve within a few weeks of the onset of their symptoms. Few people go on to develop chronic pain due to spondylosis. If bone spurs occur in the spine, they can cause pain and loss of motion, but they can also pinch the nerves or spinal cord. When nerves in the spine are pinched, it is known as radiculopathy. It can cause pain, numbness, tingling, or weakness in the arms or legs. If the spinal cord is compressed, it is called myelopathy. This can cause problems with balance, weakness, and pain. Carragee, E.J. ""Persistent Low Back Pain."" 352 (2005): 1891-1898. Deyo, R.A. et al.

This makes the wrist more stable than if it had only one joint. It also gives your wrist and hand a wide range of movement. The wrist joints let your wrist your hand up and down, like when you lift your hand to wave. These joints allow you to bend your wrist forward and backward, side to side, and to rotate your hand. This is where the radius — the thicker forearm bone — connects with the bottom row of wrist bones: the scaphoid, lunate and triquetrum bones. This joint is mainly on the thumb side of your wrist. This is the joint between the ulna — the thinner forearm bone — and the lunate and triquetrum wrist bones. This is the pinky finger side of your wrist. This joint is in the wrist but doesn’t include the wrist bones. It connects the bottom ends of the radius and ulna. The bones between your fingers and wrist are made up of five long bones called metacarpals. They make up the bony part at the back of your hand. The bones of your hand connect to the top four wrist bones: Where they connect is called the carpometacarpal joints. Along with blood vessels, nerves, and skin, the major soft tissue in the wrist includes: connect the wrist bones to each other and to the hand and forearm bones. Ligaments are like elastic bands that keep bones in place. They cross the wrist from each side to hold the bones together. are another kind of elastic connective tissue that attaches muscles to bones. This lets you move your wrist and other bones. The wrist bones are also surrounded by fluid-filled sacs called bursae. These soft sacs reduce friction between tendons and bones. Wrist bones, ligaments, tendons, muscles and nerves can be injured or damaged. Common wrist injuries and conditions include: You can sprain your wrist by stretching it too far or carrying something heavy. A sprain happens when there’s damage to a ligament. The most common place for a wrist sprain is at the ulnocarpal joint — the joint between the arm bone and wrist bone on the pinky finger side of the hand. Also called ulnocarpal abutment, this wrist condition happens when the ulna arm bone is slightly longer than the radius. This makes the ulnocarpal joint between this bone and your wrist bones less stable. Impaction syndrome can lead to increased contact between the ulna and carpal bones, leading to pain and weakness. You can get wrist joint pain from . This can happen from normal wear and tear or an injury to the wrist. You can also get from an immune system imbalance. Arthritis can happen in any of the wrist joints. You can any of the bones in your hand from a fall or other injury. The most common kind of fracture in the wrist is a . A is the most commonly broken carpal bone. This is the large bone on the thumb side of your wrist. It can fracture when you try to catch yourself in a fall or collision with an outstretched hand. Common injuries to the wrist happen from doing the same movements with your hands and wrists repeatedly for a long time. This includes typing, texting, writing, and playing tennis. They can cause swelling, , and pain in the wrist and hand. Stress injuries can affect the bones, ligaments, and nerves of the wrist. They include: Depending on the injury, issue, and individual circumstances, treatment for common wrist issues range from rest, support, and to medications and surgery. For example, carpal tunnel has its own and that may help. Wrist will have its own treatment plan, too.

ae070ec7-32ea-41b5-b8fc-2fb0c13e99cd,"About Wrist Flexion and Exercises to Help You Improve It — Wrist flexion is the action of bending your hand down at the wrist, so that your palm faces in toward your arm. It’s part of the normal range of motion of your wrist. When your wrist flexion is normal, that means that the , bones, and tendons that are working as they should. Flexion is the opposite of extension, which is moving your hand backward, so that your palm is facing up. Extension is also part of normal wrist range of motion. If you don’t have normal wrist flexion or extension, you may have trouble with daily tasks involving wrist and hand use. A doctor or physical therapist can test your wrist flexion by instructing you to flex your wrist in various ways. They’ll use an instrument called a goniometer to measure how many degrees of flexion your wrist has. Being able to flex your wrist 75 to 90 degrees is considered normal wrist flexion. Gentle and range of motion are a great way to improve wrist flexion. Common exercises include: Put your forearm on a table with your hand hanging off the edge and a towel or other soft object under your wrist. Move your palm toward the underside of the table until you feel a gentle stretch. You can use your other hand to push gently if necessary. Hold for a few seconds, then return to the starting position, and repeat. Once you’re comfortable with the above exercise, you can try it without the support. Hold your arm out in front of you. Use your other hand to gently press on the fingers of your affected wrist as you drop your hand to flex your wrist. Do this until you feel a stretch in your forearm. Hold for a few seconds, then release and repeat. Make a loose fist and lean the side of your arm on a table or other surface. Bend your fist in towards the underside of your wrist and flex. Then bend it back the other way, and extend. Hold each one for several seconds. Put your palm on a tabletop. Keep your wrist and fingers straight, and bend your wrist as far as is comfortable to the left. Hold for a few seconds. Move it back to center, then to the right and hold. Hold your arm in front of you with your palm facing up. Use your unaffected hand to gently pull your hand down towards the floor. You should feel a stretch in the underside of your forearm. Hold for a few seconds, then release, and repeat. The most common cause of wrist flexion — which is pain when you flex your wrist — is overuse injuries. These are usually caused by repetitive motion, such as typing or playing sports like tennis. : Carpal tunnel syndrome is caused by increased pressure on your as it passes through a passage on the palm-side of your wrist. This increased pressure causes pain. In most cases, carpal tunnel syndrome is a type of overuse injury. : Ganglion cysts are soft cysts that usually appear on the top of your wrist. They may not cause any symptoms beyond a visible bump, but they can also be painful and prevent your wrist from moving normally. Ganglion cysts often go away on their own, but can be through surgery if necessary. : and can cause wrist flexion pain. Osteoarthritis may cause pain in one or both wrists, but wrists aren’t a common place for osteoarthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis does commonly appear in the wrists, and usually causes pain in both wrists. Injury from sudden impact: A sudden impact, such as falling on your wrist, can cause wrist flexion pain, even if it doesn’t cause a or break. First, your doctor will take a general medical history, and ask you more about your wrist flexion pain or issues. They might ask when the pain started, how bad it is, and if anything makes it worse. To narrow down potential causes, they may also ask about recent injuries, your hobbies, and what you do for work. Then your doctor will measure how much you can move your wrist by having you do a series of movements. This will help them see how exactly your wrist flexion is affected. The physical exam and medical history are usually enough to allow your doctor to make a diagnosis. However, if they’re still unsure, or you’ve had a recent injury, they might suggest an or to help diagnose the problem. The exercises listed above can help treat wrist flexion problems. Other treatments include: Ice the affected area to help reduce pain and swelling. Rest, especially for problems caused by repetitive motion. Adjust your if your wrist problems are caused by typing or other repetitive office work. Splinting can help with carpal tunnel syndrome, repetitive motion injuries, and sudden injuries. Physical therapy can reduce pain, and improve mobility and strength. shots can help treat wrist flexion problems that don’t respond to other treatment. Surgery can be a solution for ganglion cysts that don’t go away on their own, carpal tunnel syndrome that doesn’t respond to other treatment, or traumatic injuries such as a broken bone or torn tendon. There are many potential causes of wrist flexion pain. While some resolve on their own, others require treatment by a doctor. If your wrist flexion pain or problems are long-lasting or severe, see a doctor. — Having carpal tunnel syndrome doesn't have to be a pain.

RAMSEY SHEHAB, MD, Henry Ford Health System, Detroit, Michigan MARK H. MIRABELLI, MD, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, New York Abstract Abstract Patients with wrist pain commonly present with an acute injury or spontaneous onset of pain without a definite traumatic event. A fall onto an outstretched hand can lead to a scaphoid fracture, which is the most commonly fractured carpal bone. Conventional radiography alone can miss up to 30 percent of scaphoid fractures. Specialized views (e.g., posteroanterior in ulnar deviation, pronated oblique) and repeat radiography in 10 to 14 days can improve sensitivity for scaphoid fractures. If a suspected scaphoid fracture cannot be confirmed with plain radiography, a bone scan or magnetic resonance imaging can be used. Subacute or chronic wrist pain usually develops gradually with or without a prior traumatic event. In these cases, the differential diagnosis is wide and includes tendinopathy and nerve entrapment. Overuse of the muscles of the forearm and wrist may lead to tendinopathy. Radial pain involving mostly the first extensor compartment is commonly de Quervain tenosynovitis. The diagnosis is based on history and examination findings of a positive Finkelstein test and a negative grind test. Nerve entrapment at the wrist presents with pain and also with sensory and sometimes motor symptoms. In ulnar neuropathies of the wrist, the typical presentation is wrist discomfort with sensory changes in the fourth and fifth digits. Activities that involve repetitive or prolonged wrist extension, such as cycling, karate, and baseball (specifically catchers), may increase the risk of ulnar neuropathy. Electrodiagnostic tests identify the area of nerve entrapment and the extent of the pathology. Musculoskeletal problems are responsible for up to 20 percent of all visits to primary care offices in the United States.  Family physicians are often the first to evaluate and treat wrist pain. Wrist pain is traditionally classified as acute pain caused by a specific injury or as subacute/chronic pain not caused by a traumatic event . Injuries that cause acute pain may result in contusions, fractures, ligament sprains or tears, and instability. Subacute or chronic pain may result from overuse, have neurologic or systemic causes, or be a sequela from an old injury. Patients with these injuries may have a history of repetitive wrist movement, either occupationally or recreationally. The addition of sensory disturbances, such as numbness or tingling, points to nerve involvement.  Enlarge     Print Anatomic snuffbox swelling, scaphoid tubercle tenderness, and pain with axial pressure on the first metacarpal bone are sensitive but not specific tests for diagnosing scaphoid fractures. If plain radiography results are negative in a suspected scaphoid fracture, then the wrist should be protected in a thumb spica cast with repeat plain radiography in 10 to 14 days or a bone scan one to two days after injury.

The location, nature, timing, and quality of the pain are important clues for narrowing the differential diagnosis. In acute wrist injuries, plain radiography should be obtained with anteroposterior, lateral, and oblique views. When the diagnosis remains unclear, further imaging, such as bone scan, ultrasonography, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), may help identify the cause. Because nontraumatic wrist pain has a wide differential diagnosis, the patient history should include a review of systems with neurologic or constitutional symptoms, as well as a social history of vocational and recreational activities. The following case studies discuss the background and presentation of three causes of wrist pain, as well as diagnostic tests and strategies. Abstract A 21-year-old man presents with dorsal left wrist pain after falling onto his outstretched hand while inline skating. He noted immediate swelling and painful wrist extension. Physical examination reveals soft tissue swelling with limited motion, mostly in extension, secondary to pain. There is bony tenderness along the distal radius as well as the anatomic snuff box. His sensory and vascular examination results are unremarkable. The wrist comprises eight carpal bones , but only the lunate and scaphoid articulate with the radius and absorb significant impact during a fall onto an outstretched hand. The scaphoid is the most commonly fractured carpal bone. The primary vascular supply to the scaphoid originates distally from retrograde branches of the distal radial artery, making the proximal pole of the scaphoid relatively avascular and at higher risk of nonunion and avascular necrosis. Fractures of the proximal and distal portions of the scaphoid each account for 20 percent of scaphoid fractures, and the middle portion accounts for the remaining 60 percent.       Reprinted with permission from Daniels JM II, Zook EG, Lynch JM.

Am Fam Physician. The peak incidence of scaphoid fractures occurs at about 15 years of age. Because of the weakness of the distal radius compared with the scaphoid, scaphoid fractures are not common in older persons. In young children, the supportive cartilage surrounding the ossific nucleus of the immature scaphoid creates protection, making physeal injuries of the radius more common. The typical history of a patient with a scaphoid fracture is a fall onto an outstretched hand with the wrist dorsiflexed and radially deviated. Most patients with scaphoid fractures present shortly after a fall, but in some cases, the initial pain improves, causing a delayed presentation. Physical examination may reveal a swollen wrist. Tenderness is usually located dorsally around the distal radius. Patients may have painful wrist extension and loss of grip strength if they present a few days after the injury. There are no reliable clinical tests to rule out a scaphoid fracture. Swelling of the anatomic snuff box increases the likelihood of a scaphoid facture. The combination of snuff box swelling, scaphoid tubercle tenderness, and pain with axial pressure on the first metacarpal bone has a sensitivity of approximately 100 percent. However, the specificity of each test is 9, 30, and 48 percent, respectively. Diminished grip strength compared with the contralateral side increases the positive predictive value for a scaphoid fracture.  The differential diagnosis of a suspected scaphoid fracture is listed in .       Anatomic snuffbox.

Based on retrospective studies, sensitivity improves if additional views are added (i.e., posteroanterior in ulnar deviation, pronated oblique, and supinated oblique). In many cases, repeat radiography is needed in 10 to 14 days to observe sclerosis, which indicates a healing fracture. If the diagnosis cannot be confirmed with plain radiography, a bone scan or MRI can be performed. Bone scan has a sensitivity near 100 percent but produces false-positive results up to 25 percent of the time. MRI within one day after trauma has a sensitivity of 80 percent, but late examination (more than 10 days after injury) has a sensitivity and specificity comparable to bone scan. If a scaphoid fracture is suspected based on history and physical examination, plain radiography should be performed, including specialized views such as a posteroanterior in ulnar deviation and a pronated oblique. If radiography is negative for fracture but clinical suspicion is high, the wrist should be protected in a thumb spica cast with the option of repeat plain radiography in 10 to 14 days or a bone scan one to two days after injury. If repeat plain radiography is negative but wrist pain persists, MRI should be performed to clarify the diagnosis. Abstract A 39-year-old right-handed woman presents with a four-week history of wrist pain and numbness and tingling in her right hand. There is no history of trauma or injury to the neck, elbow, or wrist. She works mostly at a desk job but has not had any changes in her work schedule. Physical examination of the wrist reveals no soft tissue swelling, muscle atrophy, or skin changes. She has painful wrist extension, as well as reproduction of the tingling in her fifth finger with tapping over the pisiform. Grip strength is normal and no other bony tenderness is appreciated. The ulnar nerve originates from the C8 and T1 nerve roots , and extends from the medial cord of the brachial plexus through the axilla, innervating the muscles of the forearm and the hand. Proximal to the wrist, dorsal and palmar cutaneous branches split off, whereas the rest of the nerve courses through the Guyon canal to the palmar surface of the hand. This triangular canal is bordered medially by the pisiform, laterally by the hamate, anteriorly by the tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris, and posteriorly by the transverse carpal ligament. In the canal, the ulnar nerve splits to a superficial sensory branch, which supplies sensation to the hypothenar eminence, and to a deep motor branch that innervates the hypothenar muscles, adductor pollicis, and flexor pollicis brevis. The ulnar nerve may be compressed anywhere in the Guyon canal, causing motor, sensory, or mixed deficits. Compression is usually caused by ganglion cysts or repetitive trauma.       Reprinted with permission from Miller JD, Pruitt S, McDonald TJ.

Acute brachial plexus neuritis: an uncommon cause of shoulder pain. Am Fam Physician. .       Ulnar nerve entrapment is the second most common neuropathy of the upper extremity, surpassed only by median nerve entrapment (i.e., carpal tunnel syndrome). Although the true incidence of ulnar neuropathy at the wrist is not well documented, it is accepted to be the second most common site after compression at the elbow. Ulnar neuropathies are slightly more common in men than in women. Peak incidence is in men older than 35 years. The typical presentation in ulnar neuropathy is wrist discomfort with sensory changes in the fourth and fifth digits. Grip weakness may be present in chronic cases. History usually reveals no specific injury. Activities that involve repetitive or prolonged wrist extension, such as cycling, karate, and baseball (specifically catchers) may increase the risk of ulnar neuropathy. Physical examination of a patient presenting with these neurologic symptoms should include cervical spine, shoulder, and elbow examinations to rule out a proximal lesion. Reproduction of pain on neck movement could indicate cervical disk disease; pain with shoulder motion could indicate a brachial plexus problem; and reproduction of symptoms with compression of the nerve at the ulnar groove could indicate compression at the elbow. Compression of the ulnar nerve at the Guyon canal should cause weakness of the hypothenar muscles innervated by the deep motor branch and sensory disturbances of the fifth digit innervated by the superficial sensory branch. Clinical tests include a positive Tinel sign on percussion of the ulnar nerve over the Guyon canal, as well as a positive Phalen sign (maximum passive flexion of the wrist for more than one minute) with paresthesias in the fourth and fifth fingers. Unlike in carpal tunnel syndrome, sensitivity and specificity of these tests for ulnar neuropathy at the wrist are not known. The differential diagnosis of suspected ulnar neuropathy at the wrist is listed in .  Enlarge     Print Differential Diagnosis of Suspected Ulnar Neuropathy at the Wrist History of shoulder/arm pain, motor weakness of upper extremity History of neck pain, forearm symptoms (e.g., pain, numbness, tingling) Differential Diagnosis of Suspected Ulnar Neuropathy at the Wrist History of shoulder/arm pain, motor weakness of upper extremity History of neck pain, forearm symptoms (e.g., pain, numbness, tingling) Plain radiography evaluates wrist anatomy well, and can identify fractures, dislocations, or soft tissue masses that may have led to nerve compression. Ultrasonography of peripheral nerves is helpful in identifying compressive etiologies of nerve injury and in visualizing structural nerve changes. It is noninvasive, relatively inexpensive, and well tolerated by patients. Electromyography and nerve conduction studies can be helpful in identifying the area of entrapment and documenting the extent of the pathology. Motor and sensory conduction velocities are more useful in acute entrapments, whereas electromyography is a better choice for chronic neuropathies because it shows axonal degeneration more clearly. The sensitivity and specificity of these electrodiagnostic tests in the primary care setting are unknown because existing studies are limited to a small number of patients with known neuropathy. MRI can detect abnormalities of the ulnar nerve, flexor tendons, vascular structures, and the transverse carpal ligament around the Guyon canal. Neurogenic edema can be seen as early as 24 to 48 hours after denervation compared with electromyography, in which changes after denervation are not seen for one to three weeks. Imaging criteria for neuropathy on MRI are not well defined, and several studies have found MRI abnormalities in healthy, asymptomatic patients. If ulnar neuropathy is suspected, plain radiography should be ordered first. If no obvious mass or lesion is found, electrodiagnostic tests should be ordered to localize the lesion, measure its severity, and aid in the prognosis. In the setting of inconclusive or nonlocalizing electrodiagnostic test results, ultrasonography or MRI may be useful. Abstract A 31-year-old woman presents with several months of worsening radial left wrist pain that started insidiously. She denies any specific trauma. She has no numbness or tingling in the wrist, hand, or fingers. Her pain worsens with gripping and grasping, and with picking up her nine-month-old daughter. Physical examination reveals no discoloration and minimal soft tissue swelling along the radial styloid and anatomic snuff box. There is soft tissue tenderness about the anatomic snuff box and radial styloid. She has limited motion of the thumb, with pain mostly in extension and abduction. Her sensory and vascular examinations are unremarkable. Two major dorsal tendons of the thumb are involved: the extensor pollicis brevis and the abductor pollicis longus . [ ] These tendons comprise the lateral border of the anatomic snuffbox, with the extensor pollicis longus medially and the scaphoid bone at the bottom. The two tendons have similar function in bringing the thumb into radial abduction. These tendons run in a synovial sheath in the first extensor compartment of the hand. Inflammatory changes in the sheath and tendons result in a tenosynovitis. Recurrent or persistent inflammation may result in stenosing tenosynovitis.       The typical presentation includes subacute radial wrist pain at the thumb base and into the distal radius. In retrospect, patients may identify a new or repetitive hand-based activity as the cause, but the etiology often is idiopathic. De Quervain tenosynovitis is more common in women, particularly those 30 to 50 years of age. New mothers are especially noted to have this problem from picking up a child. Physical examination may reveal a minimally swollen wrist. Tenderness is usually located over the radial tubercle and sometimes around the soft tissues of the anatomic snuff box. Thumb motion is invariably painful. Neurovascular examination should be unremarkable. The Finkelstein test is confirmatory because it has good sensitivity and specificity. It is performed by making a fist over the thumb and then moving the hand into ulnar deviation, which passively stretches the thumb tendons over the radial styloid.  A grind test of the thumb, which is performed by axial compression and slight rotation of the metacarpophalangeal joint, should be negative in those with de Quervain tenosynovitis but positive in those with first carpometacarpal osteoarthritis. The differential diagnosis of suspected de Quervain tenosynovitis is listed in .  Enlarge     Print Differential Diagnosis of Suspected de Quervain Tenosynovitis Differential Diagnosis of Suspected de Quervain Tenosynovitis The diagnosis is clinical based on history and examination. In cases where osteoarthritis of the carpometacarpal joint is considered, pain relief with diagnostic lidocaine (Xylocaine) injection of the first extensor compartment excludes arthritic cause. Radiography, electromyography/nerve conduction studies, blood tests, and MRI or ultrasonography may be used to evaluate for alternative diagnoses. If the history and examination are consistent, no further diagnostic testing is needed. For suspicion of fracture or arthritis, radiography is an appropriate first step. If suspected, radial nerve abnormalities may be ruled out with electromyography or nerve conduction studies. If there is concern for infectious tenosynovitis, a complete blood count and measurement of inflammatory markers, such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein levels, are appropriate. If the patient does not respond to treatment or if the diagnosis is in question, an MRI or musculoskeletal ultrasonography may be ordered to further evaluate the first extensor compartment.
