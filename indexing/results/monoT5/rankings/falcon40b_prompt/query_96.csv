falcon40b_prompt_96," There is no one 'most efficient and sustainable diet', as the best approach for each individual can vary based on their age, sex, weight, activity levels, and overall health status. However, some general guidelines include consuming plenty of whole foods such as fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and healthy fats while limiting highly processed or high sugar/fat options. Some popular sustainable diets that may work well for certain individuals include Mediterranean, DASH, Flexitarianism, and Plant Based Diets.</s> 
What specific dietary components contribute to making these sustainable diets effective?</s> 
Each sustainable diet mentioned has its own unique set of principles and recommended food groups, but there are several factors in common that contribute to their effectiveness. These include emphasizing plant-based sources of protein such as beans, lentils, nuts, seeds, and tofu over animal products; choosing complex carbohydrates like whole grains, legumes, and fruit instead of refined grains and sugary snacks; prioritizing heart-healthy monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats found in olive oil, avocados, nuts, and fish rather than saturated and trans fats from fried foods and processed snacks; incorporating regular exercise into your lifestyle; and practicing mindful eating by paying attention to hunger cues and avoiding mindless snacking or overeating.",96,most efficient and sustainable diets,-0.012790899723768234,0

It's an entire industry filled with a multitude of products, exercise programs, and diets that all promise the same results. This explains why there's so much confusion about . How many calories should you consume? Should you do cardio or strength training? What and should you take? Amidst all the conflicting information, it's well-known that in terms of long-term, sustainable, and healthy weight loss. But that same diet , depending on dietary restrictions, food allergies, wellness goals, pre-existing health conditions, and other factors. Starting a diet for weight loss begins with the decision to actually start. Deciding on which diet is a whole other story. To help you decide between the best and worst diets for weight loss, here's what actual dietitians and doctors have to say. When it comes to dropping pounds and living your best life, turn to these trusted, expert-approved, best diets for weight loss. The Mediterranean diet is the #1 best overall diet ranked by . It's known for being high in healthy fats like olive oil and fish. Nothing is off-limits on this diet, though some foods like eggs, poultry, dairy, red meat, and processed foods are to keep saturated fat low. Is the Mediterranean diet effective for weight loss? Because the diet is rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, and nuts, the calorie distribution naturally leans toward healthier foods. This can create the . The Mediterranean diet is not a fad diet, but rather a shift to a healthy lifestyle. It's named after the Mediterranean population, which tends to have . Do experts recommend the Mediterranean diet for weight loss? The recommends the Mediterranean diet as a heart-healthy diet, but it can also aid weight loss. Being non-restrictive, the Mediterranean diet has the psychological benefit of disrupting the vicious starve-binge cycles perpetuated by diet culture, which tends to promote restrictive, unsustainable diets that inevitably lead to failure. ""An 'eat less' mindset can set us up for a cycle of guilt when unfair expectations are not met due to the biological consequences of food restrictions, such as increased cravings,"" says , RD, of diets with a long list of non-compliant foods. ""A Mediterranean-style diet can help one build sustainable habits using a balanced and inclusive approach to eating, which can further help one achieve the weight goals they are aiming for."" A plant-based diet is much like a vegan diet with one major difference: It emphasizes whole, unprocessed plants, so processed vegan foods aren't encouraged. The foods consumed on a plant-based diet are predominantly fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, grains, legumes, and soy protein. Because a plant-based diet is , it's no surprise that it's effective for weight loss. Research has shown that a plant-based diet is an . One even found that following two simple rules—eliminating animal products and reducing oils—encourages steady, long-term weight loss without restricting calories or exercising. Do experts recommend a plant-based diet for weight loss? , MD, recommends a plant-based diet for weight loss as well as its other benefits: lower blood pressure, blood sugar, cholesterol, and risk of chronic diseases. ""One of the reasons a plant-based diet can help with weight loss is because this diet is packed with fiber. Fiber can help fill you up without adding extra calories,"" says Dr. Bhanote. ""Removing animal products, such as meat, dairy, and eggs, also removes a significant amount of fat from your diet.""  takes a plant-based lifestyle to the next level. In addition to eliminating animal products, the diet restricts oils, processed foods, added sugars, and added salt. Followers stick to whole foods like grains, legumes, fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, tofu, and tempeh. The Engine 2 diet is more restrictive than a traditional , but if weight loss is your goal, this diet gets the job done in a healthy way. It's low in fat, yet rich in fiber, vitamins, and minerals, according to . Do experts recommend the Engine 2 diet for weight loss? One of the main reasons why the Engine 2 diet is effective for weight loss is that it's high in fiber. Increasing your fiber content to at least 30 grams per day can help with weight loss, according to an  study. According to , RD, ""The heavy focus on fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains of the plant-based Engine 2 Diet means you will be consuming plenty of fiber, which has been shown to increase satiety and promote weight maintenance."" If you're hesitant to go full vegan but still want to dip your toes in the trend, consider a . It's exactly what it sounds like: mostly vegetarian but with the flexibility of consuming animal products when desired. Because the diet is so flexible, there are no set rules, restrictions, or must-eat foods. Much like the Mediterranean diet, a flexitarian diet encourages consuming foods in moderation with nothing being strictly off-limits. A fully vegan diet has been shown to aid weight loss, and a flexitarian diet has many of the same properties. In fact, indicates that a flexitarian diet has health benefits related to body weight, metabolic health, blood pressure, and reduced risk of diabetes. Do experts recommend a flexitarian diet for weight loss? Being flexible with your diet prevents the feeling of failure and minimizes the feeling of deprivation from foods you love. ""Physical, mental, and emotional satisfaction are key on a weight-loss diet so that the approach can be sustainable and help someone reach their goal in a sane and healthy manner,"" says , RD. According to Cording, a flexitarian diet has the added benefit of encouraging weight loss while also allowing the occasional consumption of foods that would normally be restricted. This can be the difference between success and failure and makes someone more likely to stick to their weight management regimen long-term. The Ornish diet has been around for a long time, so its popularity has been buried by newer diets. However, modern-day dieters shouldn't sleep on this way of eating because it grants you the power to eat unlimited amounts of compliant food groups. These buffet-style foods include fruits, vegetables, grains, and legumes. It's a low-fat diet, so animal products high in fat, such as meat and dairy, are eaten in moderation. The Ornish diet has always been categorized as a heart-healthy diet. It not only reduces the risk of heart disease, but it can actually through diet and lifestyle. This way of eating also lowers blood pressure and cholesterol levels. In terms of weight loss, the Ornish diet can be just as effective as all its other health benefits. Unlike low-carb diets, the Ornish diet is high in carbs. However, are the good kind of carbs, and they don't inherently cause weight gain like processed carbs because they're higher in digestion-slowing fiber. Do experts recommend the Ornish diet for weight loss? The Ornish diet is recommended to people for a variety of benefits, including sustainable weight loss. ""The Ornish Diet can encourage weight loss since it shuns most processed foods and encourages whole, unprocessed foods, lots of high-quality proteins and fiber, which can leave people feeling full on less energy and ultimately lead to weight reduction,"" says , RD. ""It also encourages exercise and stress management, which can assist with weight loss. Unlike other diets, it doesn't allow for rampant access to full-fat foods. Portions of healthy fats (nuts, avocado, olive oil, etc.) are explicitly detailed to avoid inadvertent high energy intakes even from healthy fats,"" Moreno explains. that heals your gut, slows the signs of aging, and helps you lose weight. Experts discourage following one of these worst diets for weight loss because they come with unsafe side effects long-term. The keto diet is a strict low-carb diet. In fact, followers consume less than 10% of their calories from carbs. In many cases, carbs are restricted to fewer than 5 percent of daily calories. The majority of calories, between 65-80 percent, come from fat, leaving 15-25 percent for protein. In order to achieve these specific macronutrients, followers tend to pile on high-fat animal products like bacon, butter, ghee, eggs, and cheese. Keto isn't just a clever name for a fad diet. It's short for ketogenic, which is based on the body's proven function (aka ketosis) to burn fat when carbs aren't available as an energy source. Using the is complicated because many people tend to lose weight quickly, though the weight is likely to be regained once followers return to their normal eating patterns. There are also associated with very low-carb diets. Do experts recommend the keto diet for weight loss? Despite its popularity among people looking to lose weight, there are many concerns about whether the . For that reason, keto isn't popular among health professionals for several reasons. Dr. Bhanote is particularly concerned with the : indigestion, constipation, kidney stones, and flu-like symptoms. Dr. Bhanote is also not a fan of diets high in saturated fat, like the keto diet, which can have negative consequences for cardiovascular health. ""The keto diet is not a sustainable diet or a long-term solution, and most people regain the weight once they return to eating carbs,"" says Dr. Bhanote. ""The back-and-forth fluctuations with unsustainable fad diets can cause long-term effects on your and your relationship with food."" Like the name suggests, the is a 30-day program that emphasizes some whole foods while eliminating others, including alcohol, sugar, legumes, grains, dairy, and processed foods. It's a restrictive diet that promises to change your life, but in the process, Whole30 eliminates foods that are known to be good sources of many nutrients. Followers of Whole30 can lose weight on the program, but it's a trade-off. The plan encourages lots of veggies, some fruits, and moderate amounts of animal protein from meat, seafood, and eggs. However, it's not backed by science, so eliminating foods like grains and legumes is likely unnecessary for weight loss. Though the diet may be recommended for people who would benefit from removing high-glycemic foods from their diet, Whole30 isn't for everyone. ""Legumes and grains are packed with high-quality nutrients like vitamins, minerals, fiber, and protein. There is no evidence that supports eliminating these foods on Whole30,"" says Dr. Bhanote. ""When these foods are reintroduced, it may also introduce a . The only benefit of these restrictions is that you cut sugar, dairy, and alcohol, which have all been linked to diseases."" If you love green juices and green smoothies, a juice cleanse sounds like it would be right up your alley. A juice-only diet is notoriously low in calories yet high in fruits and vegetables. On a juice cleanse, participants eliminate solid foods and even some food groups like meat and dairy. Many juice cleanses are short-term, but some people stick to them for weeks. However, a juice cleanse is not a sustainable way to lose weight because it's low in many nutrients and leaves followers feeling deprived. The effectiveness of juice cleanses remains controversial. Because they tend to be low in calories, followers may lose a small amount of weight within a couple of days. However, in reducing calories, juice cleanses also reduce vital nutrients and benefits of solid food. Eliminating solid foods for weight loss isn't a compromise that many experts would recommend. Do experts recommend a juice cleanse for weight loss? Juice cleanses remain one of the most unsustainable diets for weight loss because it goes against our biological motivation to chew food. The low fiber content in juice can also cause digestive discomfort, which is bad news because an . According to Cording, ""Juice cleanses tend to be low in fat and protein, making them unsatisfying, setting you up to be hungry and irritable. All of these things can mess with energy and mood. When someone goes back to eating normally, it's easy to regain the lost weight."" Before there was keto, there was the . High in protein and modeled on prehistoric human diets, the paleo diet consists only of foods that were available during the Paleolithic era: lean meats, fish, vegetables, fruits, nuts, and seeds. This means that grains, legumes, dairy, sugar, salt, potatoes, and processed foods are not compliant. At a glance, it's easy to see why people would turn to the paleo diet for weight loss. The and cuts back on processed food. However, much like Whole30, there are unnecessary restrictions, such as eliminating grains, legumes, and potatoes, which can all be incorporated on a weight loss plan. As with any diet with many restrictions, the paleo diet may be difficult to stick to long-term, and therefore unsustainable for steady weight loss. Do experts recommend the paleo diet for weight loss? Experts have difficulty getting behind diets with a laundry list of food restrictions. When severe food restrictions are in place, followers may experience feelings of guilt or failure when they consume those foods. ""For example, if you're starting a paleo protocol with the goal of shedding weight but you love adding beans, whole grains, and dairy to your currently varied diet, having to avoid these off-limit foods might stall your weight loss efforts by making adherence difficult and unpleasant,"" says Pride. ""Along the same lines, if a diet has a list of 'good' and 'bad' foods, a mindset that the 'good' foods can be eaten in abundance may lead to overconsumption of high-energy foods, thus hindering weight loss,"" she adds. Having been around for ages, many people have tried and tested the Weight Watchers system for themselves. If you haven't seen the commercials, Weight Watchers is essentially a points system. Instead of counting calories, you count points. Because foods are given a certain number of points and followers adhere to a certain number of total points, nothing is off-limits. You can even have cake and processed food on Weight Watchers as long as you stay within your allotted amount of points. The points system is essentially a metaphor for calories, which means that Weight Watchers is a calorie-restricted diet in disguise. When followed to a T, followers may see weight loss results, which are due to the implementation of a caloric deficit. However, following the protocol and keeping track of points is no easy task. Moreno says that ""Weight Watchers can be complicated if math isn't your strong suit with points/calculations. Over the years, it's become less structured, which can also leave people confused and prone to overindulgence at times."" Do experts recommend Weight Watchers for weight loss? While celebrities are quick to recommend Weight Watchers, health professionals are not. The program encourages a caloric deficit, but doesn't teach its followers how to adhere to a healthy lifestyle. ""Weight Watchers encourages healthy food selections, but it also pushes a lot of its branded products like desserts, which can be highly processed with refined flours and added sugars that can inhibit weight loss,"" says Moreno. ""It's also a bit misleading with unlimited foods that are 'zero points,' which may encourage some to binge or overeat."" © 2020 Galvanized Media. All Rights Reserved.

12fc6d54-ff50-4e17-8416-ac725ee68e4c,"Consumers’ Attitudes and Perceptions of Environmentally Sustainable and Healthy Diets Cultivating Diets That Are Both Healthy and Environmentally Sustainable As found in IFIC’s , environmental sustainability has become increasingly associated with the foods that we eat as well as our food purchases. Yet sustainability can mean different things to different people. According to the, environmental sustainability is the “condition of balance, resilience and interconnectedness that allows human society to satisfy its needs while neither exceeding the capacity of its supporting ecosystems to continue to regenerate the services necessary to meet those needs nor by our actions diminishing biological diversity.” Basically, this definition refers to the condition of reducing damage to our environment (through the renewable depletion of resources) so that future generations can also meet their own needs. A healthy and complete diet involves eating essential nutrients needed for physiological functions, which includes . Proteins can be consumed in various ways and are essential in for maintaining muscle strength, bone health, and blood sugar control in addition to supporting the body’s immune defenses and promoting quicker healing. However, in the pursuit of both a healthful and environmentally sustainable diet, how to best access these essential proteins has come under question. Where are our purchasing decisions headed as we look to fulfill a complete, healthful, and sustainable diet? What does this mean for our and intake? Let’s further explore findings from the Survey of Consumers’ Attitudes and Perceptions of Environmentally Sustainable and Healthy Diets to shed some light on where protein choices may be headed and what consumers perceive as constituting a well-rounded and environmentally sustainable diet. The Survey of Consumers’ Attitudes and Perceptions of Environmentally Sustainable and Healthy Diets found that 40 percent of consumers were unsure if an “environmentally sustainable diet” was the same as a “sustainable diet,” while 34 percent acknowledged that they were not the same. When asked to rank the specific aspects that were important to them when considering an environmentally sustainable diet, consumers’ top choices included, “What I eat is healthy for the planet,” “What I eat is nutritious,” and “What I eat is both healthy for me and for the planet.” Minimal and sustainable packaging were still considered important; however, environmental health and personal health still ranked as more important precursors to defining an environmentally sustainable diet. Most (92 percent) respondents reported consuming animal-based protein products (e.g. poultry, pork, beef, cow’s milk, eggs, and seafood), while 72 percent of consumers reported eating plant-based protein sources (e.g. tofu, soy milk, beans, tempeh, nuts, seeds, and legumes). When asked further why they consumed such products, both animal- and plant-based protein consumers readily choose “I like the taste” and “An easy way to get protein in my diet” as the primary reasons for consuming such protein products. Notably, 45 percent of animal-based protein consumers cited being familiar with how to prepare animal-based protein products; while many (33 percent) plant-based protein consumers felt that plant-based proteins were a healthier option. The majority (66 percent) of consumers believed that protein from animal-based and plant-based sources is environmentally sustainable. In fact, over 60 percent of consumers felt they should consume more or the same amount of protein from plant-based sources. Likewise, over 50 percent of consumers felt that in order to eat both an environmentally sustainable and a healthy diet, they should eat either the same amount or more protein from animal-based sources. When asked about the environmental sustainability of animal-based proteins, consumers linked health and safety concerns together. Half of respondents indicated that environmental sustainability was tied directly with “no added hormones.” It is important to keep in mind, though, that in the United States, hormones are ; thus, if you see a “no hormones used” label on poultry or pork products, be cognizant that this language can be somewhat misleading. Additionally, animal-based proteins sourced from “grass-fed animals” and those labeled “locally raised” were noted as also important when considering animal-based protein environmental sustainability. However, the environmental sustainability of grass-fed animal products is debatable, as studies have shown such products may be sustainable for some countries but . When considering sustainability, one should also consider the environmental impacts of transporting products—which itself can contribute to environmental stress (due to gas usage) and economic loss (due to product deterioration). While environmental sustainability is an important factor in purchasing and eating practices, it is important to acknowledge the potential confusion surrounding the term “environmentally sustainable.” We look forward to seeing more food producers communicate about their efforts in working to conserve natural resources and produce food in a sustainable way. Still, as we seek out “sustainability cues” we should stay mindful that —when consumed properly—are important, regardless of the source. “A Survey of Consumers’ Attitudes and Perceptions of Environmentally Sustainable and Healthy Diets” interviewed 1,000 adults 18 years and older from June 11 and 12, 2019, and was weighted to ensure proportional results. It had a margin of error of 3.1% at a 95% confidence level.

92e73d63-4dc3-4d10-9656-c18de78d3115,"Can Diets Be Healthy, Sustainable, and Equitable? The Obesity Epidemic: Causes and Consequences (A Cameron and K Backholer, Section Editors) , –() The purpose of this study was to review the evidence on global dietary intake and trends in dietary patterns over time and to examine associations between diets and health, environment, and equity. Diets now serve as a significant risk factor for the global burden of disease and death. Diet-related non-communicable disease and rising obesity are increasingly prevalent, affecting much of the global population. At the same time, the food system is producing food in ways that are not aligned with planetary health. Inequity restricts access to healthy diets and is associated with broad social determinants. Current dietary patterns are increasingly unhealthy, unsustainable, and inequitable for many populations. Multi-pronged interventions are needed to address the impacts of diets in order to improve human and planetary well-being. The intersection of diets and food systems forms the foundation of successful public health outcomes and ensures human well-being. Diets, which are made up of different foods that contain both macro- and micro-nutrients and other important health-promoting properties, are born of food systems. Food systems produce, package, process, ship, and sell the food consumed around the world. They involve more than food production and ensuring those foods are available: they are central to improving food security and nutrition, ensuring social and gender equity, reducing rural poverty, promoting efficient management of natural resources, and improving the resilience of populations who rely on them for their livelihoods [, ]. Recent data on dietary intake and trends of dietary patterns suggest that what the world eats is no longer static or harmless. Sub-optimal diets, and the downstream metabolic effects, remain a top risk factor for the global burden of disease [••,,]. Dietary trends also have increasing deleterious effects on the world’s natural resources, land availability, biodiversity, and overall ecosystems in the context of population growth and pressure [,,]. At the same time, many people cannot access or afford a healthy diet due to various underlying social determinants, including poverty. These multiplier effects have enormous costs not only in pure economic terms but also in societal outcomes as well [, ,,]. An individual’s food choices have impacts that resonate far beyond themselves: diets reflect larger systemic issues that impact population health, sustainability, and justice. This paper examines trends in dietary patterns over time and what the world’s population currently eats. The authors consider associations between diets and health, the environment, and equity and propose possible solutions to address the effects of diets. Understanding what foods people consume at all stages of life is important to demonstrate how food security and nutrition is linked to development, health, and well-being. This knowledge is also critical for shaping food system and nutrition policies to ensure they are health promoting and consumer-oriented in positive ways[••]. Insight into dietary intake remains a challenge for researchers because of the nature of dietary surveys and data gathering methods, recall memory of those being surveyed, and geographical and representative coverage of survey data. The increasing availability of data on diets, sourcing, and costs, and the development of better metrics, survey tools, and open-access databases will allow researchers to develop a clearer picture of dietary trends and patterns[••, ]. As yet, important questions remain unanswered: What are people actually eating across the world? Where do people get their food from and how much do they pay, or are willing to pay, for food? What influences their dietary choices? Do health, environmental, or ethical issues factor into their decision making? One of the key drivers of optimal nutritional status of populations is diets. The International Conference on Nutrition Rome Declaration states that “optimal diets, including traditional diets, meet nutrient requirements across all age groups and special nutrition needs. These diets avoid excessive intake of saturated fat, sugars, and sodium, essentially eliminating trans fats, among others” []. The WHO provides more detailed recommendations in that diets should be composed of a variety of foods that are of sufficient quantity, of high quality, and free from pathogens []. Sufficient quantity means that food eaten should meet energy needs in the form of calories based on the age, weight and size, sex, activity level, and overall stage of life for an individual. Quality refers to the types and varieties of foods and ingredients consumed by that individual. Foods can be grouped as healthy or unhealthy, though food classification is more complex than the simplified categories presented here. Healthy foods include whole grains, fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds, beans and legumes, fish and seafood, and foods rich in total polyunsaturated fatty acids, omega-three fatty acids, and dietary fiber. Unhealthy foods include excessive amounts of unprocessed red meats, processed meats (cured and salted), overly processed starches, simple sugars and sugar-sweetened beverages, and foods containing high levels of saturated fat, trans fat, dietary cholesterol, and sodium []. The diversity of foods within food groups and across the range of food groups plays an important role in meeting optimal diets [,,]. However, diversity does not always mean that the overall diet is healthy: a diversity of foods can be a combination of mixed foods that include foods high in trans fats, refined or simple sugars, and sodium, or overly refined, highly processed food items [], which have a propensity to lead to obesity and diet-related non-communicable diseases (DR-NCDs) []. Food must also be safe to ensure that acute and chronic food-borne diseases are minimized during the production, processing, storage, transport, and distribution stages of food supply chains, as well as during storage, preparation, and cooking within households [, ]. Evidence has demonstrated that optimal nutrition early in life is essential to adult well-being, productivity, and human capital. However, few infants and young children consume nutritionally optimal diets, which has significant ramifications for early growth and development [,,]. Data collected by UNICEF on infant and young child feeding practices show that 16% of children aged 6 to 24 months eat what is defined as a “minimally acceptable diet,” which is an indicator of both dietary diversity and meal frequency, along with continued breastfeeding []. Of children under the age of 6 months, only 41% are exclusively breastfed globally []. While there are differences in feeding practices between rural and urban areas and across all wealth groups for a variety of reasons, the diets of infants and young children remain inadequate in all countries [••]. Dietary constraints, pressures, and influences continue into childhood and adolescence. The Global School-based Student Health Survey, a self-reported survey representing 83 economies, shows that among children and teens aged 13 to 17 years globally, approximately 30% do not eat fruit and 14% do not get access to and do not eat vegetables on a daily basis. However, 44% consume soda every day [••]. Vitamin and mineral deficiencies are high in this age group in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). Regional analysis indicates inadequate intake of iron, iodine, vitamin A, zinc, and calcium, with adolescent girls and populations in South Asia experiencing a greater risk of deficiency [, ]. Dietary data on adults also indicate sub-optimal patterns. Across regions, most diets are low in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts and seeds, fiber, and legumes, and high in overly processed, packaged foods that can contain higher amounts of refined sugars, sodium, and unhealthy fats. In wealthy countries and among wealthy consumers, consumption of red and processed meats tends to be higher. These foods are often out of reach for poor consumers living in low-income countries for various reasons, including inadequate infrastructure of supply chains and cost [, ,,]. There are sub-regional exceptions to these trends: in much of Africa, legumes are highly consumed, and in some parts of Asia, vegetable consumption is still considered the mainstay of the diet. In low-income countries and places that restrict meat consumption for religious or cultural reasons, the consumption frequency of red meat (and perhaps other animal source foods) is low [••, ]. Likewise, dietary trends differ based on age, gender, and the overall stage of the lifecycle: healthier diets are more evident in older adults than younger adults, and in women than men []. Profound dietary changes are occurring in concert with increased movement of people to urbanizing centers and cities; demographic changes among populations, with increased numbers of older populations in some parts of the world (Europe, Canada, the USA, Australia) and younger in others (Africa); and globalization and trade factors that influence goods and services, particularly in the food sector [, ]. The food systems and food environments that engender diets have become more interconnected from global to local levels, with longer, more complex food supply chains and different types of actors beyond just producers and consumers moving food in those chains [,,]. With the enhanced interconnectedness of places and people, and the transitions witnessed with globalization and urbanization, there have been shifts in consumer purchases and preferences towards more so-called unhealthy, cheap, and convenient diets [, ]. This dietary shift has been associated with increasing prevalence of overweight and obesity and non-communicable disease (NCD) worldwide []. These dietary trends and their health outcomes are not just an issue for high-income countries (HICs): more LMICs are experiencing this shift in conjunction with a transition from undernutrition to overweight and obesity, and NCD risk [,,,]. When looking at trends from 1990 to 2013, consumption of most food groups and critical dietary components has increased across all regions of the world [, ]. While this rise in consumption is nuanced and regionally complex, the consumption of “unhealthy” food items has outpaced the consumption of “healthy” foods in most regions of the world []. The intake of whole grains, which is associated with a reduction in risk for diabetes, colorectal cancer, coronary heart disease, and stroke [], rose substantially in Southeast Asia only. Consumption of processed meat, a risk factor for colorectal cancer, increased in all regions of the world, but so did fruit consumption. Vegetable consumption increased only in some parts of the world []. Sugar-sweetened beverage consumption grew in most regions, with the largest increase in North America. Reductions in sodium intake have been minimal in all regions of the world, but are consistently surpassing the global recommended intake of 2500 mg per day and currently stand at 4000 mg per day [, , ]. However, there are exceptions: some places experienced a decline in the intake of industrially produced trans fats, which occurred as a result of political commitment made to reduce trans fatty acids in the food supply. This decision reflected the very clear evidence on the adverse health effects of trans fats []. Many diets now contain a significant share of packaged, processed foods, such as sugar-sweetened beverages, baked goods, dairy products, processed meats, chips and crackers, cake mixes, pies, pastries, and sweets. Generally, packaged foods are industrially processed and high in salt, sugar, and saturated and trans fats [••]. The 2018 Global Nutrition Report estimated 86% of diets do not align with the WHO healthy diet recommendations, which is largely due to the heavily processed foods in diets [••, , ]. Globally, sales of total per capita volumes of packaged food rose over 13% from 2005 to 2017 [••]. Patterns and trends in per capita sale volumes show that Europe, North America, and Oceania purchased the highest volumes of these packaged foods between 2005 and 2017, with some stagnation or declining sales growth over that time period. Latin America and Africa are undergoing significant growth in sales of packaged foods, albeit from a lower baseline compared with North America. The number of kilocalories purchased from sugar-sweetened beverages is highest in HICs. Sales trends indicate that in many LMICs there have been modest increases in these types of beverage sales from 2009 to 2017 [••, , ]. People are increasingly eating away from home. Since 1995, the amount of overall income spent on foods eaten away from home has risen significantly in Latin America, particularly in Brazil, Chile, and Colombia []. Over the last 40 years, snacks eaten “on the go” have replaced main lunches and dinners in the USA []. This change is also apparent in Asia: in China, people who live in neighborhoods with a higher density of restaurants tend to eat breakfast and dinner away from home, a trend that is positively associated with increased overweight []. Portion sizes, particularly in the USA, UK, and Latin America, have significantly increased over the last few decades. These trends illustrate that the global population is cooking less and eating out more, largely due to lifestyle changes []. The shift to food eaten outside the home along with portion size has likely contributed to the rising obesity pandemic [, ]. What the world eats is now considered a major risk factor of multiple forms of malnutrition and health outcomes. Sub-optimal diets, made up of unhealthy foods, are among the top risk factors globally for deaths and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) lost, with 11 million deaths and 255 million DALYs attributable to various dietary risk factors [••, ]. The percent contribution of malnutrition in all its forms (undernutrition, overweight and obesity, and dietary risks) has surpassed tobacco smoking, high blood pressure, and high fasting plasma glucose in their contributions to DALYs lost globally. In comparing countries by their socio-development income status, the combined nutrition and dietary risk presents as the top contributor, regardless of wealth status [••, ]. Data suggest that the level of risk towards disability and death depends on the pattern of the diet and the composition of the foods that make up that diet. A recent study in the Lancet shows that globally, diets low in whole grains are the most significant dietary risk factor for deaths and DALYs. The other top five rankings consist of dietary risk factors for diets low in fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds, and diets high in sodium. Of the countries with high populations, high consumption of red meat, processed meat, and sugar-sweetened beverages as well as foods with high levels of trans fats were ranked lower as dietary risks for increased death and DALYs. These estimates suggest that not eating healthy foods is more detrimental to health status than eating unhealthy foods (Fig. ). The deaths and DALYs are mainly comprised of NCDs, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer [••, , ]. Dietary risk varies from region to region. The main dietary risk factors across East Asia, particularly in China, Japan, and Thailand, are due to highly cured foods. Diets low in fruits and some vegetables represent the highest risk factor for sub-Saharan Africa, which suggests that value chains do not always work well on the lower part of the continent. What is not eaten is also important. Low consumption of nuts and seeds represented the most significant dietary risk factor of deaths and DALYs in Latin America [••]. Dietary risk ranges across income status and rankings as well. Low-middle and high-middle income countries deal with the highest prevalence of diet-related deaths and DALYs (Fig. ), whereas HICs have the lowest exposure. With the exception of low-income countries, countries at all levels of income had low consumption of whole grains, fruit, and nuts and seeds, and high consumption of sodium as the top four dietary risk factors [••]. The 2018 Global Nutrition Report supports the finding that all income groups consume an excessive amount of sodium, and low amounts of fruits and vegetables on a daily basis []. Along with diets being “obesogenic” in their composition [], obesity, as a health state itself, is a risk factor for a wide range of non-communicable diseases [, ]. The latest data show that two billion adults are affected by overweight and 678 million with obesity. These statistics are increasing. The prevalence of overweight adults over 18 years of age increased from 35.7% in 2010 to 38.9% in 2016. Obesity prevalence in adults also showed an increase from 11.2% in 2010 to 13.1% in 2016. Globally, women have a higher prevalence of both overweight and obesity compared with men, with some stark contrasts in key regions and countries including Latin America, North Africa, and the Middle East [••]. It should be noted that the biological outcome of obesity is only one risk factor of NCDs and there are other social determinants along the lifecycle that influence disease outcome. Human health and environmental well-being are connected by diets. Globally, food production is the largest cause of environmental change [••]. Food production and agriculture contribute up to 30% of all greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, occupy 40% of available land, and use 70% of available freshwater [, ]. Food production is among the largest drivers of biodiversity loss, species extinction, and natural resource degradation [, ]. Marine systems are also overburdened, with 60% of world fish stocks fully fished and more than 30% overfished [••]. Dietary composition significantly influences environmental outcomes. Diets high in calories, added sugars, saturated fats, processed foods, and red meats are less environmentally sustainable than healthy, plant-based diets, which are associated with reductions in GHG emissions, land use, and water use [,,]. Unless dietary patterns change, by 2050 diets higher in refined sugars, fats, oils, and meats are likely to be major contributors to an anticipated 80% increase in agricultural GHG emissions and global land clearing []. Though environmental benefits from plant-based diets are variable and context specific, these diets offer promise for climate change mitigation, with modeling indicating that shifting to these diets could reduce GHG emissions by 30–55% [,,]. Dietary composition can contribute positively to both environmental outcomes and human health. Healthy, plant-based diets also lead to positive health outcomes for people by reducing mortality, along with obesity and DR-NCD incidence [,,]. Plant-based diets limit meat consumption, though the levels and types of animal source foods consumed can vary depending on the specific diet (e.g., Mediterranean, vegetarian). The healthy reference diet recommended by the EAT Lancet Commission includes a low to moderate amount of seafood and poultry, and little to no red meat [••]. Adopting healthy, plant-based diets would help avert over 10 million deaths per year, a reduction of approximately 20% [••]. Models of different healthy, plant-based diets (Mediterranean, pescetarian, and vegetarian) show reductions in the incidence rate of type II diabetes by 16–41% and of cancer by 7–13%, as well as reduced mortality from coronary heart disease of 20–26% []. Environmental outcomes and nutritional needs are highly context specific; replacing animal-source foods with plant-based alternatives may be more feasible in high- and middle-income countries []. Diets that are optimal for both humans and the planet draw on scientific targets for food intake and planetary boundaries for food production [••]. These diets have an appropriate caloric intake and consist of various plant-based foods, low amounts of animal source foods, unsaturated fats, and small amounts of refined grains, highly processed foods, and added sugars [••]. Other considerations for healthy, environmentally sustainable diets include nutritional adequacy, availability and affordability, sociocultural well-being, resilience, food safety, and reductions in waste and loss []. The shift to healthy, environmentally sustainable diets is increasingly urgent in the face of climate change. By 2050, global GHG emissions from food production are expected to increase 80% as a result of increases in population size and dietary shifts []. Climate-induced changes in temperature and precipitation are expected to reduce agricultural productivity, and thus limit food availability and consumption. Higher rates of obesity are possible, as people eat less expensive, more energy-dense foods and limit their physical activity [••]. Climate-induced changes in diets and weight could cause over 500,000 deaths by 2050, largely due to risk factors related to fruit and vegetable consumption []. Dietary equity occurs when everyone has access to a nutritious, affordable, and culturally acceptable diet []. Diets have consequences for nutrition, health, and well-being, and dietary inequity contributes to unequal burdens of malnutrition and disease around the world. People’s food decisions are shaped by macro-level influences, the food system itself, and personal choices [•, , , ]. Food and dietary decisions are also influenced by social and cultural determinants of health, which encompass a wide range of considerations related to the environments in which people live. These determinants include education, health, income and wealth, employment and working conditions, and housing and living conditions [•, , ]. Together, all of these factors intersect in complex, variable ways that determine what and how people eat and can engender inequity in their diets. In HICs, where rates of obesity and DR-NCDs are highest, dietary inequity is closely linked to wealth: high-quality diets are associated with higher socioeconomic status, while unhealthy diets high in energy and low in nutrients are more prevalent among lower-income groups [, , ]. These groups are more likely to be obese and experience higher levels of dietary-related diseases [•, ]. Race, education, and employment also contribute to dietary quality and obesity in HICs [•, , ]. In LMICs, the relationship between wealth, diets, and malnutrition is more complex. Obesity is more prevalent among higher socioeconomic groups []. Lower income groups are more likely to experience the multiple burden of malnutrition []. As countries develop and food environments become more obesogenic, obesity prevalence shifts from higher to lower socioeconomic levels. Women at lower socioeconomic levels are especially vulnerable to this shift. Over time, it is expected that wealthier, more highly educated populations will adapt by purchasing healthier, more expensive foods, while lower income groups will bear the burden of poor diets and obesity []. Around the world, dietary inequity is driven by a lack of access, availability, and affordability. Healthy, nutritious foods are increasingly more expensive than energy-dense, nutrient-poor foods, putting them out of reach for lower income populations [, , ]. In HICs, people in low-income areas are less likely to have access to grocery stores; instead, these areas are more likely to have convenience stores and fast food restaurants that offer unhealthy food options [, ]. In LMICs, urban populations have less access to healthy options and consume more energy-dense diets high in fat, sugar, and salt as a result [,,]. These factors also contribute to food insecurity, which is associated with obesity and binge eating in HICs [•, , ]. Dietary inequity can contribute to multiple forms of malnutrition and carry consequences that extend across generations. In HICs, micronutrient deficiencies can co-exist with overweight and obesity, as low-cost diets can provide lots of calories without sufficient nutrients, while the double burden of malnutrition is increasingly prevalent in LMICs [, ]. Food insecurity can negatively affect birthweight, breastfeeding, and young child feeding practices, all of which can cause undernutrition. In turn, childhood undernutrition increases the risk for developing obesity and DR-NCDs later in life []. Overweight and obesity in parents can also predispose their offspring to obesity [, ]. There is not one simple solution that will automatically shift diets towards those that are healthier, more environmentally sustainable, and more equitable at the national or global scale. Rather, a range of different strategies and interventions will be necessary. To integrate these three pillars of health, environmental sustainability, and equity into diets, action must be taken by different stakeholders across different temporal and spatial scales through different entry points of the food system []. Interventions targeting food environments, whose composition and influence on choice are associated with poor diets and obesity, have to be included along with agricultural and food supply approaches [, ]. Strategies will have to involve fiscal measures, regulatory and trade interventions, industry approaches, context-specific interventions, challenges to defaults and norms of information, and consumer-focused education. These approaches must be sensitive to cultural, social, and economic context, and balance the trilateral goals of health, sustainability, and equity. This multi-pronged approach should be one that involves the whole system, including governments, industry, and consumers. Action must start with governments, which need to govern their food systems and rebalance the scales of power []. According to Mozaffarian and colleagues, “no country has implemented a full range of updated, comprehensive, and evidence-informed strategies to encourage a healthier and more equitable food system” [••]. Policy makers need to create strong regulatory and fiscal frameworks that provide guidance to those who produce the diets from our food systems. Trade and subsidy policies need to align better with those that promote healthy diets. Industry goodwill and voluntary measures are not sufficient: while some in the food and beverage industry are acting in ways that benefit public health, their efforts alone are not enough and there are still acts of transgression against public health goals []. The burden of change should not be solely placed on the consumer’s ability to make healthy choices, either. Public understanding of nutrition and health of diets, as well as their environmental and justice impacts, is low []. Governments and other food system actors generally favor healthy interventions focused on individual-level efforts []. Paradoxically, these interventions can worsen dietary inequities and health consequences. Food choice is not simply a personal decision: food and diets are shaped by context and driven by deep, often unseen systemic and social factors. Approaches that require a lower level of personal agency are both more effective and equitable for all []. Achieving the trilateral goals of health, equity, and environmental sustainability may be possible through low-agency interventions that promote healthy, environmentally sustainable diets. A multi-pronged approach is also necessary to effect change across all environmental targets. Improvements to food production practices and reductions in food loss are needed along with governance and policy action. Changes to diets will also require long-term commitment and careful attention, as the process of setting sustainable boundaries is complex and must be refined over time [••]. These approaches must aim for the intersection between diets, health, equity, and environmental sustainability, as not all healthy diets have low environmental impacts, and not all environmentally beneficial diets maximize human health []. Lastly, gaps in data need to be filled by improving the quality of dietary data, which will allow for a better understanding of their impacts on a wide-range of outcomes [, , ]. Individual-level dietary data collection and analysis need to be better standardized, as does the methodology of how these data are collected across survey tools and design. Dietary data need to be collected across a broad range of countries, with more disaggregation of socioeconomic status that takes equity issues into account. Most of the dietary data comes from high-income country data, particularly in the USA. Focusing on low- and middle-income countries is critical, as these countries will likely experience the greatest increase in obesity, yet there is little research on appropriate interventions or delivery channels []. The impacts of different diets also need to be considered in different local contexts on a range of environmental indicators. A more comprehensive examination of the environmental impacts of diets will help clarify life cycle assessment data of how and where food is grown, and lead to a more complete view of the relationship between diets and ecosystems.

This chapter summarizes the presentations and discussion that took place, with highlights of the presentations provided in . THE HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS OF DIETARY CHANGES TOWARD SUSTAINABLE DIETS Citing the same Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) definition of sustainable diets referenced by other speakers (; see in ), Marco Springmann, Oxford University, United Kingdom, began by remarking that he would be addressing only two of the several dimensions of sustainable diets: human health and the environment. Regarding the health impacts of food consumption, Springmann highlighted that, according to 2015 Global Burden of Disease (GBD) data, imbalanced diets are responsible for the greatest health burden globally and in most regions as well. (See for a discussion of how GBD analyzes human dietary data.) Food insecurity remains a pertinent problem as well, he observed, with 2 billion people worldwide being overweight or obese, another 2 billion having nutritional deficiencies, and 800 million experiencing hunger due to poverty and poorly developed food systems (). He stressed that the situation is expected to become worse if nothing ""4 Sustainability and Healthy Dietary Changes Through Policy and Program Action."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. Most research on sustainable diets and food systems centers around national case studies, with each study taking a different approach. These different approaches make it difficult to make sense of the totality of evidence. (Springmann) Results of a combined analysis of health and environmental impacts of three sustainable diet strategies for 158 countries indicated that changing dietary patterns (balancing both nutrient composition and energy) shows the most promise. (Springmann) Still, there are trade-offs. When these data were analyzed regionally, this same strategy had different effects in high- and middle-income versus low-income countries. (Springmann) Modeling work has shown that it is possible to have a diet that meets all nutrient requirements, is affordable, and has a reduced carbon footprint. But these models do not account for taste. People do not eat just for health reasons or for protection of the environment. (Macdiarmid) Recommendations for sustainable diets will likely get “stuck” at the guideline stage if more thought is not given to understanding what drives people to eat what they eat. (Macdiarmid) A range of plant-based diets can reduce the food system’s environmental footprint. (Macdiarmid) There is no “silver bullet” for achieving sustainable diets. Rather, an entire menu of solutions needs to be on the table, from production strategies (e.g., improving crop breeding to increase yields, improving soil and water management, increasing livestock and pasture productivity) to consumption strategies (e.g., reducing food waste, shifting diets, and avoiding competition for land from biofuels). (Ranganathan) is done to reverse the dietary transition currently under way (; ). Regarding the environmental dimension of sustainable diets, Springmann noted that food production is a major driver of climate change (); land use change and loss of biodiversity (; ); freshwater extraction (); and fertilizer runoff and dead zones (; ). In light of these findings, and given the number of systematic reviews of this evidence that are beginning to appear (; ; ; ), Springmann believes the sustainable diet literature has reached what he described as a ""4 Sustainability and Healthy Dietary Changes Through Policy and Program Action."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. There are lessons to be learned from private-sector marketing about strategies that may be useful for shifting diets toward more sustainable and healthy food choices (e.g., minimizing disruption to consumers, selling a compelling benefit, maximizing awareness). (Ranganathan) There are also strategies that can be applied in the food services sector that can help shift diets (e.g., the language used to describe vegetable dishes on menus can influence food choices). (Ranganathan) Historically, food chain interventions have focused on increasing yield and the well-being of the farmer. A nutrition-sensitive value chain (NSVC) adds nutritional value to every step of the chain, so the focus is not just on economic value. (Tahiri) There is as yet no evidence from randomized controlled trials comparing NSVCs with traditional interventions, but there is proof of concept. (Tahiri) Among other factors, success requires a clear definition of the nutrition problem and goal, as well as added value for all stakeholders. (Tahiri) There are multiple opportunities for integrating sustainability into each of the three essential functions of the (DGA) process. (Schneeman) During strategic planning, sustainability could be made an explicit part of the purpose statement, and sustainability topics relevant to the DGA could be identified for future consideration. (Schneeman) In both the analysis and synthesis/interpretation phases, experts with the relevant sustainability knowledge could be included in the technical or advisory committees selected to carry out the tasks. (Schneeman) These points were made by the individual workshop speakers identified above. They are not intended to reflect a consensus among workshop speakers. “first point of maturity.” However, he observed, much of the work still revolves around national case studies, which feature widely varying reference diets, environmental footprints, and scenario designs. He emphasized that this variation complicates comparisons across studies and makes it difficult to make sense of the totality of the literature. In addition, he noted, the predominant focus with respect to environmental impact has been on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and only a few studies have examined land and water use. Moreover, he said, health impacts often are not explicitly analyzed beyond adherence to national dietary guidelines or directional changes in nutrient levels ().

A Combined Analysis of the Health and Environmental Impacts of Sustainable-Diet Strategies Springmann went on to discuss a combined analysis of the health and environmental impacts of sustainable-diet strategies across 158 countries. Springmann explained that the analysis covered three different dietary change strategies and their predicted impacts by 2030. The first strategy (“environmental objectives”) was based on what many studies have revealed about the environmental impacts of animal-source foods. In a series of four scenarios, Springmann reported, the model reduced animal-based products and substituted plant-based products (two-thirds legumes and one-third fruits and vegetables) based on observational data on dietary patterns (how vegetarians change their diets compared with omnivores). The scenarios ranged from 25 percent substitution for animal-based foods to 100 percent substitution. The second strategy (“food security objectives”) addressed energy imbalances, including both underweight and overweight and obesity. Again, a series of scenarios was modeled, ranging from 25 to 100 percent reduction of energy imbalance. The third strategy (“public health objectives”) adopted nutritionally balanced dietary patterns developed by the EAT-Lancet Commission on Healthy Diets from Sustainable Food Systems and regionalized based on country-level preferences for types of grains, fruits, and meats. Springmann explained that because these dietary patterns were also energy-balanced patterns, this third strategy addressed the same energy imbalances addressed by the second strategy. Again, a range of scenarios was modeled: flexitarian, pescetarian, vegetarian, and vegan dietary patterns. Springmann pointed out that all of these patterns are predominantly plant based—even the flexitarian dietary pattern, which includes meat-based products but in amounts that are much smaller than those in an omnivore diet. For example, the flexitarian pattern that was modeled included only 100 grams of red meat per week. Springmann and his research team used a coupled modeling framework supporting five analyses: (1) a mortality analysis that involved a comparative risk assessment with nine dietary and weight-related risk factors and five disease endpoints based on the Oxford Global Health model (,); (2) an environmental analysis of country-specific footprints ""4 Sustainability and Healthy Dietary Changes Through Policy and Program Action."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. for GHG emissions, cropland use, freshwater use, nitrogen application, and phosphorous application (); (3) a regional analysis that entailed grouping all 158 countries by income (); (4) a nutritional analysis of 24 nutrients, based on the GENuS dataset () and USDA data (for vitamins B5 and B12), relative to World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations; and (5) an economic analysis of food expenditures based on country-specific estimates of food prices (). Springmann observed that the Oxford Global Health model used to conduct the mortality analysis is similar to the modeling work of GBD. In addition, he noted that the environmental analysis was not life cycle based. He explained that there are two different ways of accounting for environmental impacts, one being to track at a very detailed level every emission from producing a food (i.e., life-cycle analysis [LCA]). Without going into detail, he mentioned only that the other method, which he and his team used, is a more mechanistic approach that he believes is arguably more comparable across regions and countries. (See for additional discussion of the role of LCA in understanding the environmental impacts of a food system.) According to Springmann, the mortality analysis revealed about a 10 percent reduction in premature mortality in 2030 with both the environmental strategy (the first strategy described above) and the food security strategy (the second strategy described above). The reduction associated with the environmental strategy was slightly larger, he noted, mainly as a result of increased vegetable consumption when animal-based products were replaced by plant-based products. With the food security strategy, most of the reduction in premature mortality resulted from reductions in obesity, followed by reductions in underweight. Springmann went on to report that, because the public health strategy essentially doubles the health benefits of the food security strategy by balancing the nutritional composition of not only diet but also energy, the reduction in premature mortality associated with that strategy was similarly approximately double that of the food security strategy. It was also approximately double that of the environmental strategy. Rather than delving into any detail as to how the four public health strategy dietary scenarios (flexitarian, pescetarian, vegetarian, and vegan) compared with each other, Springmann wanted only to emphasize that all four scenarios were better in terms of reduced premature mortality than any of the other strategies (i.e., environmental or food security). ""4 Sustainability and Healthy Dietary Changes Through Policy and Program Action."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. As with premature mortality, Springmann continued, all three strategies yielded reductions in environmental impact (see ). He explained that with the food security strategy, because there is a greater percentage of overweight and obese people than underweight people worldwide, correcting for energy imbalance effectively removes food from the system, and consequently the environmental impacts of that food. With the environmental strategy, whereby animal-based products are replaced with plant-based products, “the story is a bit different,” Springmann said. The removal of animal-based foods led to a very high reduction in GHG emissions, thus accounting for the overall reduced environmental impact of all four scenarios. However, because many plant-based foods use a ""4 Sustainability and Healthy Dietary Changes Through Policy and Program Action."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. great deal of water, as shown in , the environmental impact with respect to water use actually increased across all four dietary scenarios. Again, Springmann reported, with the public health strategy, combining reductions in energy imbalance with a more balanced formulation of dietary intake by food group resulted in reductions in overall environmental impact much larger than those for either of the other strategies. However, some of the specific impacts, such as for water use, were not large. Springmann noted that the above results paint a global picture. He explained how grouping all 158 countries by income (high income, upper middle income, lower middle income, and low income) reveals regional specificity. With the food security strategy, Springmann reported, all regions except low-income countries would be expected to experience small reductions in all of the measured health and environmental outcomes by 2030 (see ). He interpreted these findings to mean that people in low-income countries consume too little, and that addressing energy imbalances would actually increase consumption and along with it, cropland use, GHG emissions, and freshwater use. Nitrogen and phosphorous applications, however, would be expected to decrease slightly because of future technological improvements anticipated to outweigh any increases that would otherwise occur. In contrast, Springmann continued, with the environmental strategy scenarios, large reductions in GHG emissions occurred across all regions (see ). In addition, he observed, all regions would be expected to undergo reductions in premature mortality, although those reductions would not be expected to be as large in low-income countries because these countries do not consume as many animal-based products that could be substituted for. Low-income countries would also experience a very high increase in cropland use, while all of the other regions would experience reductions. Freshwater use would increase everywhere, and the application of both nitrogen and phosphorous would increase in both low- and middle-income countries. With a public health approach, Springmann noted, the impacts would be a little more balanced. Still, he said, “you do not get reductions everywhere. There are trade-offs.” For example, with the flexitarian diet (see ), all regions would see reductions in premature mortality, GHG emissions, and nitrogen application. While most regions would also see reductions in the other impacts, cropland use, freshwater use, and phosphorous application would all increase in low-income countries.

Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. Another way to look at these same data, Springmann continued, is to draw regional correlations between the health and environmental impacts among the different diet scenarios. Doing so reveals aligned impacts (i.e., correlations are positive) in middle- and high-income countries under most of the diet scenarios. In contrast, in low-income countries, most of the correlations are negative. Springmann explained that technologies are a major factor when one is projecting food production, particularly in low-income countries. But even with projected technologies and intensified production, he said, “there is basically no way you can align [the impacts] by 2030,” although by 2050, there should be greater alignment (i.e., fewer negative correlations between health and environmental impacts in low-income countries). Usually when people talk about the nutritional impacts of dietary change, Springmann observed, they focus on proteins. In this analysis, proteins were not a problem nutrient for the most part, with only low-income countries projected to have any deficiencies by 2030 and only by 1 to 2 percent in a couple of the diet scenarios. But in most other countries and under most other scenarios, protein should not be a problem. Without going into detail, Springmann commented that other nutrients, such as the B vitamins and calcium, would need to be supplemented in some regions under some of the scenarios. Springmann commented briefly on the food expenditure results. With the environmental strategy, weekly food expenditures would increase because fruits and vegetables are usually fairly expensive. In contrast, weekly ""4 Sustainability and Healthy Dietary Changes Through Policy and Program Action."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. food expenditures would decrease under the food security strategy—at least globally—because people would be eating less food. With the public health strategy, people would be eating better, but also less, in all the scenarios except pescetarian; therefore, the increased price associated with greater fruit and vegetable consumption would be compensated by the reduced price associated with eating less food. Thus, again at the global level, weekly food expenditures would decrease for all the scenarios except pescetarian, because fish are very expensive. Springmann added that when countries are categorized by region, the predictions for the public health strategy differ considerably, with low-income countries experiencing large increases in weekly food expenditures under all four public health scenarios. “That is a big problem,” he said. In summary, Springmann stated that improving nutrient levels and reducing diet-related premature mortality is possible in all regions of the world, but that only in high- and middle-income countries would that achievement be aligned with a reduction in environmental impacts. He called for a synergistic perspective on sustainable diets that takes account of regional considerations, including technological changes and perhaps international support mechanisms. He noted that while reducing GHG emissions is important at the global level for mitigating climate change, other environmental impacts are more context-dependent. Among the three different dietary change strategies tested, Springmann advocates the public health strategy. A strategy that balances dietary intake and food composition could, he said, “deliver quite a bit and a way to achieve sustainable diets.” However, he cautioned that currently, most national dietary guidelines do not actually reflect the evidence on healthy eating used to deduce the dietary patterns modeled in his team’s analyses, incorporating no or overly lax limits for animal-source foods, particularly dairy. In this regard, he considers the (DGA) to be especially problematic and they are unsupported by the evidence base. “Updating national dietary guidelines should be a priority,” he concluded, if such guidelines are to reflect the latest evidence on eating for both health and environmental sustainability. REDUCING THE CARBON FOOTPRINT WITHOUT SACRIFICING AFFORDABILITY, NUTRIENT DENSITY, AND TASTE For Jennie Macdiarmid, University of Aberdeen, Scotland, the key challenge for sustainable diets is to combine nutritional security with measures to address climate change. Given the substantial contribution of livestock ""4 Sustainability and Healthy Dietary Changes Through Policy and Program Action."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. to climate change, she and her research team have demonstrated, through modeling, that it is possible to have a diet that meets all nutrient requirements, is affordable, and has as low a carbon footprint as possible (90 percent reduced). “Within reason,” she said, “you can optimize just about anything.” But to get that 90 percent reduction in GHG emissions, she elaborated, would require eating nothing but bran flakes, pasta, peas, a few onions, and a bit of chocolate (). “Remember,” she said, “you are putting water on your bran flakes.” She emphasized that one cannot rely on modeling alone to develop sustainable diets; rather, “we have to have that human input.” For a slightly more realistic diet, Macdiarmid and her research team added what they called an “acceptable” element into the same model, entailing a diet that would be more familiar to people. Again, the researchers were able to identify a combination of foods that was nutritionally adequate; with a low carbon footprint; affordable; and, in this case, also tasty. This diet contained many more food items, including small amounts of meat and dairy. The trade-off, however, was lowering the reduction in GHG emissions from 90 percent to only 25 percent. Like Springmann, Macdiarmid commented on the number of systematic reviews conducted since this first modeling work was done, highlighting one review in particular. concluded that not only do plant-based diets result in lower GHG emissions relative to animal-based diets, but, more interesting in Macdiarmid’s opinion, there is a range of plant-based diets with lower GHG emissions than animal-based diets (see ). “We mustn’t think of a vegan diet,” she stressed. “There is a whole range of vegan diets that can have implications for environmental impact.” She added that vegan diets are probably not what they used to be. “It used to be lentils,” she said, but now, such ingredients as coconut milk are being used. She emphasized the need to think about taste, not just putting foods together. Macdiarmid observed that discussions on reducing consumption of animal-source foods tend to focus entirely on meat. This focus, she stated, has fueled a great deal of research, a great deal of panic, and a great deal of media attention around protein and a fear that reducing meat consumption would lead to protein deficiency. She questioned whether this is a valid concern. She explained that in a recent study on nutrition security in the United Kingdom, she and her colleagues found that, between imports and domestic production, the UK protein supply is almost twice the population-level recommended intake (grams per capita per day) (). Even if all meat were removed from the supply chain, she noted, the country ""4 Sustainability and Healthy Dietary Changes Through Policy and Program Action."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. would still have about 125 percent of its recommended protein supply. In her opinion, the attention focused on protein replacement is a distraction from other problem nutrients. She added that in all of the modeling that she and her colleagues have done, regardless of the combinations of foods they have tested (i.e., healthy and with low GHG emissions, healthy and with high GHG emissions, unhealthy and with low GHG emissions, and unhealthy and with high GHG emissions), the one outcome they have always derived is achieving the necessary amount of protein (). Macdiarmid then turned to the other issue around meat consumption—acceptability. “If we want people to change their diets,” she asked, “how are we going to frame this?” This question is absolutely key, in her opinion, given that reducing meat consumption is currently not an acceptable notion, certainly not among most of the population and some governments. She cited another recent study in which her research team asked people whether they would be willing to reduce their meat consumption. Most people said no, although some said yes, and some said they would think about cutting down (). Among those who said they would not eat less meat, reasons provided included “I like meat,” “It fills me up,” “I am not doing it if others will not,” “It is important to me,” and “Actually, it will make no difference whatsoever [to climate change].” It is because of responses like these, Macdiarmid said, that it is so important ""4 Sustainability and Healthy Dietary Changes Through Policy and Program Action."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. for the alternative diets being offered to be ones that people can “engage with” and are willing to eat. Macdiarmid then alluded to the large body of research on replacing meat with legumes and various other plant-based foods. She noted as well the current trend around consumption of insects. Even in Scotland, she observed, there is a hotel that has announced it will be serving midge burgers. For her, not only does that sound unpleasant but also, and more important, insects are bioaccumulators and therefore can accumulate such contaminants as heavy metals. Thus, she highlighted the lack of debate around food safety issues associated with insects. “We need to look at the whole picture,” she cautioned, “and not just say, ‘This would be a good protein replacement.’” In her opinion, moreover, the insect trend is distracting from what really needs to be examined with respect to changing diets. As an example, she pointed to the low intakes of fiber in many developed countries. She suggested that this nutrient deficiency could be a more important concern than protein intake in framing the need to reduce meat and switch to a plant-based diet that would be beneficial to both health and mitigation of climate change. She added that another food being investigated is lab meat, and said she recalled a recent claim that a company had created a vegan burger that tastes exactly like meat. Regarding the argument that reducing meat consumption could result in less costly diets, Macdiarmid remarked that whether this is true depends on what food is used to replace the meat, as well as what the resulting overall diet looks like. “We have to remember that we do not eat individual foods,” she said. “We eat a collection of foods in meals and our total diet.” The Importance of Taste, Choice, and “Preswallowing” Nutrition Although Macdiarmid agreed with others that data on sustainable diets could be refined and made more accurate (an issue that arose in the discussion at the end of the previous session, as summarized in ), she also agreed that there are enough data and enough understanding of diets and food systems now both to improve nutrition and health and to mitigate climate change (again see , but also the summary of Fanzo’s presentation in ). She added that quite a bit is known about the implications of the food system for natural resources as well. But, she said, “The thing that we keep forgetting in all this discussion is around food choices. Most people do not eat just for health reasons. Most people do not eat just because they want to protect the environment.” She called for a more integrated understanding of some of the factors that are actually driving what people are eating. Macdiarmid pointed out that national dietary guidelines have existed for a long time and are often held up as evidence of accomplishments in ""4 Sustainability and Healthy Dietary Changes Through Policy and Program Action."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. public health nutrition. Yet, she stressed, “people still are not eating healthy diets.” With respect to issuing recommendations for sustainable diets, she questioned how such recommendations would actually be implemented. She cautioned that, like national dietary guidelines, such recommendations would “get stuck” at the guideline stage absent more thought about what drives people to eat what they eat. For her, the reality that people eat for different reasons raises another key point: that everybody is different. There is no average person and there is no average diet. Borrowing from , Macdiarmid referred to the habits, desires and preferences, social influences, affordability, and other factors that drive people to make food choices—in other words, what happens before they eat—as “preswallowing nutrition.” In contrast, “postswallowing” nutrition encompasses what happens biologically, or physiologically, after food is swallowed. “We focus so much on the postswallowing nutrition” and what foods do in terms of health, Macdiarmid observed, that “we have forgotten a little bit about preswallowing nutrition.” Yet, she argued, preswallowing nutrition is extremely important when thinking about how to encourage people to change what they are eating. Macdiarmid emphasized further that the context of eating varies across countries and across cultures within countries. To illustrate this point, she shared a response from a focus group study on willingness to reduce meat consumption: “I’m aware of the environment. I take other steps, I do my bit, recycling, driving less, but I probably wouldn’t change diet” (). In addition to culture, Macdiarmid continued, social networks also matter. People tend to act the way people in their social networks act. In a study in which participants were asked whether they would be willing to reduce their meat consumption, one response was, “I don’t want people to think I’m strange or a hippy” (). Finally, Macdiarmid emphasized, identity influences food choice as well. “Food tells an awful lot about us,” she observed. She cited a study with children who were asked to describe different foods. Boys described meat as “outgoing, popular, physically impressive, and attractive to girls,” whereas girls described it as “a fat, smelly man sitting in the corner of a bar” (). She mentioned the nongovernmental organization (NGO) in the United Kingdom called Part-Time Carnivores, which found that that name attracted more men than if it were to refer to itself as being for “flexitarians” or “vegetarians.” She interpreted this finding to mean that calling themselves “carnivores” gives men an identity that “flexitarian” or “vegetarian” does not. “These sorts of social things are really important to think about,” she stressed. Also important, Macdiarmid continued, is thinking about how people behave in different settings. She cited a study done a number of years ago ""4 Sustainability and Healthy Dietary Changes Through Policy and Program Action."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. replicating some of the work of John de Castro, which showed that the amount of food people eat varies depending on the people, the number of people with whom they are eating, and where they are eating. When eating with family or friends, people tend to eat more than when eating with work colleagues, she reported, and when eating in a restaurant, people tend to eat more calories than when eating at home. In summary, Macdiarmid reiterated that it is possible to model an ideal diet. She cautioned, however, that “leaving a computer to come up with it” will not necessarily lead to the change needed to achieve a sustainable diet. Rather, she argued, one should consider eating habits and behavior. She underscored the need to think about what can be done to get people to change their diets. In addition, she highlighted the need to remember that there is no such thing as an average diet. Without providing details, she briefly mentioned work of her research team showing that there are many different ways in which people can change their diet to achieve nutrient requirements while also reducing GHG emissions, and that the optimal way varies among individuals. Finally, Macdiarmid highlighted the need to think of the food system not as a linear process but as one with many feedback loops. She emphasized that consumption is a product not just of processing and distribution but also of acceptability, preferences, the nutrition transition, cultural and social factors, and economic access. Building on Macdiarmid’s call to better understand what drives people to make dietary choices, Janet Ranganathan, World Resources Institute (WRI), Washington, DC, discussed lessons learned from the private sector about how to shift behavior. First, however, drawing on the WRI report , she posed the question of how the world can feed nearly 10 billion people in 2050 in a manner that advances development and well-being while reducing pressure on the environment. “This is the question,” she asserted, not just for this workshop, but for Personal communication, S.

She has worked on almost every environmental issue during her 23 years at WRI, and every issue—from deforestation, to climate change, to eutrophication, to biodiversity—always comes back to food. Food, she said, is “the mother of all sustainability issues.” Ranganathan explained how addressing this question requires balancing three needs. First, the world needs to close the 56 percent calorie gap between 2010 and 2050, that is, the 56 percent increase in calories that WRI has predicted will be needed to feed 9.8 billion people by the latter year. According to Ranganathan, WRI predicted this gap even while assuming an additional 540 billion hectares of agricultural land and large yield improvements on par with what occurred with the green revolution. (WRI’s calorie gap analysis was based on ; ; ; and .) Second, Ranganathan observed, given that 28 percent of the world’s people are employed in agriculture but that agriculture represents only about 3 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) globally (according to World Bank data) and about 1 percent in the United States, the incomes of farm workers are low. Yet, she stressed, the world needs agriculture to support economic development. She mentioned just having attended a Farmer Income Lab addressing the problem that farmers in the food company supply chains that end in developing countries are not making a living wage, adding that this explains in part why many of these people are moving to cities. She asserted that this low-income problem needs to be addressed as well while closing the calorie gap. Third, Ranganathan identified the need for the world to reduce agriculture’s impact on the environment. Currently, she observed, WRI analysis indicates that about one-quarter of the world’s GHG emissions are due to agriculture when land use change is taken into account. In addition, 37 percent of the Earth’s landmass (excluding Antarctica) is devoted to food production. Ranganathan pointed out that, just within her own lifetime, the agricultural footprint has expanded by about 500 million hectares, or about 60 percent of the size of the contiguous United States. “We cannot keep doing that,” she stressed. Water withdrawal is a serious issue as well, she added. (WRI’s environmental impact analysis was based on ; ; , ; ; ; ; and .) Production Versus Consumption Strategies for Sustainably Closing the Food Gap According to Ranganathan, WRI recognizes that there is no “silver bullet” for meeting the above needs. She asserted that, although dietary shift may be a “shinier silver bullet” than many of the others, “we need ""4 Sustainability and Healthy Dietary Changes Through Policy and Program Action.""

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. all solutions on the table,” including strategies for increasing production sustainably and other strategies for reducing growth in consumption (see ). Building on what several previous speakers had mentioned, she briefly described several examples of both types of strategies. According to Ranganathan, sustainable production solutions include, first, sustainably boosting yields through crop breeding. She called attention to “the other GM,” meaning Gregory Mendel and classical breeding, and highlighted the potential of modern genomics to accelerate conventional crop breeding. In addition, she stressed, there are significant opportunities to increase the productivity of orphan crops, which cover large portions of land, particularly where poor farmers live. As a second production strategy, Ranganathan pointed to improving soil and water management. As examples, she cited bringing forests back into agricultural systems and rainwater harvesting. The third production strategy identified by Ranganathan is restoring degraded land and using it to produce food. Depending on one’s definition of degraded land, there may be 1 billion hectares of degraded lands globally, she observed. ""4 Sustainability and Healthy Dietary Changes Through Policy and Program Action."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. In addition to boosting crop yields, Ranganathan continued, another set of solutions pertains to sustainably increasing livestock productivity. Even though most of the research on intensification has focused on crops, she pointed out, about twice as much land is devoted to livestock production. In her view, there are many promising opportunities to increase both pastureland and livestock productivity—especially with ruminants, and beef in particular—not necessarily in the United States but in developing countries. The same is true, she suggested, for wild fish. While she acknowledged that wild fish catch will probably have to be reduced to allow overexploited fisheries to recover, there are again, she argued, good opportunities to increase the productivity and sustainability of aquaculture. According to Ranganathan, strategies for reducing consumption include, first, as previous speakers had mentioned, reducing food loss and waste. She noted that globally, about one-third of food by weight and about one-quarter of food by calories is lost between farm and fork. She reported that WRI is developing a protocol for measuring food loss and waste, based on the premise that “what gets measured gets managed.” In addition, the Institute is building a coalition of leaders who have made commitments to reducing food loss and waste by 50 percent by 2030 and to sharing lessons learned. Known as Champion 12.3 (named after the Sustainable Development Goal and target devoted to reducing food waste), the coalition includes leaders and heads of supermarkets, companies, states, and countries. Ranganathan observed that if food waste were a country, it would rank third in GHG emissions behind China and the United States. “Just think about that,” she said. “It is wasted water. It is wasted land. It is wasted greenhouse gas emissions. And it is wasted money. We have to get on that one.” Ranganathan identified as a second consumption strategy achieving replacement-level fertility. She sees this as an important opportunity in sub-Saharan Africa in particular, where the fertility rate has been about 5 births per woman over the past 5 years and is predicted to drop to about 3.2 by 2050. “We can speed that up,” she argued, by doing things that should be done regardless, such as keeping girls in school, providing access to reproductive health services, and reducing infant and child mortality. Another consumption strategy cited by Ranganathan is reducing demand for biofuel crops. She pointed out that a target of 20 percent biofuel in the energy system by 2050, an actual target in some countries, would require almost the entire biomass harvest of 2000. “Think about the extraordinary potential for competition that would create between food and fuel,” she observed. “That is something we must deal with.” (See for a summary of Wilde’s discussion of biofuel and its influence on prices.) ""4 Sustainability and Healthy Dietary Changes Through Policy and Program Action."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. Finally, Ranganathan highlighted shifting diets as another consumption strategy for achieving a sustainable food future, as Springmann and others had discussed. She noted that animal-based foods are generally more land-, water-, and GHG-intensive to produce relative to plant-based foods. For every food calorie generated, she elaborated, ruminant meat requires more feed and land input and emits far greater amounts of GHGs compared with other foods. According to Ranganathan, efforts to date to shift diets have focused on education, information, and abstinence. While she believes that these approaches are important, she asserted that they are not enough. She spent the remainder of her talk discussing what WRI has learned from the private sector about shifting behavior, as summarized below. Later, during the discussion period, Ranganathan clarified that while she was not convinced that information provided in the DGA directly influences what foods people order or buy, she believes it does in fact have a significant influence on the food manufacturing and food services sectors. Strategies for Shifting Diet: Lessons from the Private Sector “The private sector knows how to influence people’s consumption choices,” Ranganathan said. Rather than examining how taxes, subsidies, and other governmental mechanisms can influence people’s food choices, WRI chose to examine how the private sector uses marketing and behavioral science to influence people’s choices. In an analysis of more than 20 successful consumption shifts that have already occurred in the consumer goods sector, Ranganathan and colleagues identified four common strategies that work in concert. The first is to minimize disruption. According to Ranganathan, this is what companies marketing fake meat are trying to do by providing something that looks like regular meat and can be barbequed or otherwise prepared like regular meat. This is also why some merchants place soy milk in the refrigerated section of the market where people habitually go to get their milk, even though soy milk does not need to be refrigerated. The second strategy is to sell a compelling benefit. In other words, Ranganathan explained, do not tell people why a product is good for them or bad for the environment and hope that they will shift to something else. Rather, think about what consumers actually want, such as taste and affordability. The third strategy is to maximize awareness, which Ranganathan characterized as “a tried and tested strategy by the private sector.” The products marketers want to sell the most, for example, are placed at the end of an ""4 Sustainability and Healthy Dietary Changes Through Policy and Program Action."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. aisle in a supermarket or at the top of a menu in a restaurant. Things they do not want consumers to purchase because those products have a lower profit margin are placed on lower supermarket shelves. Fourth is evolving norms. Ranganathan cited just one example: “If you think about the last time you saw a man in public cooking food, he was probably cooking a beef burger on a barbeque.” She referred to Macdiarmid’s earlier discussion of other examples of social norms and encouraged more thinking about how to evolve them to favor more sustainable food choices, such as plant-based rather than animal-based food. Around 2000, the UK government stated that it wanted to remove 1 billion units of alcohol from the market, out of concern about binge drinking and alcoholism. Thus, Ranganathan explained, the government challenged the beverage sector to help shift consumers from drinking beverages with high to those with low alcohol content. She recounted how Molson, which makes Carling, accepted the challenge because it had a low-alcohol alternative and did not want to lose market share. But the company faced a number of barriers, she observed: people did not want low-alcohol beer, they did not like the taste of it, and it was usually located in the low-traffic, “low-alcohol” section of supermarkets. To get around these barriers, Ranganathan explained, Molson took a number of actions, all of which aligned with those presented in WRI’s shift wheel (see ): it masked the bitter taste by creating ginger and lime flavors (i.e., it minimized disruption by disguising the change); it positioned the new product around the benefit of a lower-carb refreshment, making no mention of its alcohol content (i.e., it sold a compelling benefit); and it gave the product a new name, Carling Zest. At the same time, Ranganathan added, the UK government increased the excise tax on high-alcohol drinks and reduced it on low-alcohol beer, so the price of the new product went down. Instead of passing that savings on to consumers, Molson passed it on to retailers, increasing the profit margin from selling this brand, thus incentivizing the retailers to give Carling Zest a more prominent shelf space (i.e., maximizing awareness). As a result of these actions, according to Ranganathan, this was a successful rebranding campaign. Ranganathan described how Unilever did much the same thing to shift people from cod-based to pollock-based fish fingers, that is, from an overfished to a more prevalent species, and in the process to reduce its raw material costs. The barriers to this strategy, Ranganathan observed, were a strong association between fish fingers and cod; an assumption that pollock does not taste as good as cod; and the gray, not white, color of pollock, which was off-putting to consumers. She explained that by positioning ""4 Sustainability and Healthy Dietary Changes Through Policy and Program Action."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. the pollock-based product around the health benefit of its higher omega-3 content (i.e., selling a compelling benefit) and by passing on some of the savings in raw material costs to retailers, the company encouraged retailers to promote and display the new fish fingers (i.e., maximizing awareness). Strategies for Shifting Diet: Lessons from the Food Services Sector In addition to its study of the retail sector, Ranganathan continued, WRI has been studying consumer behavior in the food services sector. She argued that, with respect to encouraging consumers to choose more plant-based foods, the food services sector may be an easier target than the retail ""4 Sustainability and Healthy Dietary Changes Through Policy and Program Action."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. sector for three reasons. First, she observed, in the United States, as much money is spent on food consumed outside as inside the home. Second, she pointed out that the incentives of the food services sector are aligned with the objective of shifting diets because it sells meals, not foods. Third, she noted that habits formed outside the home are often brought back into the home. Ranganathan reported that WRI created its Better Buying Lab with a group of food service companies to experiment with ways of shifting food choices in the United States and the United Kingdom. She explained that the lab generates ideas, tests those ideas with the food service companies, and then shares more broadly what has been learned. Currently, she said, the lab is focused on three areas: (1) transforming how the food industry communicates about plant-based foods, (2) popularizing dishes rich in plants, and (3) identifying the right environmental targets and metrics. She then discussed the first two of these efforts in more detail. Language and Framing: Transforming How the Food Industry Communicates About Plant-Based Foods Ranganathan asked workshop participants to imagine being presented at a restaurant with a menu containing an entrée described as “baked squash with rice and grits.” Then, she asked them to imagine being presented with a menu describing that same entrée as “roasted butternut squash with sweet and spicy coconut rice and fresh Thai basil.” Which is more attractive to you? she asked. It is not just language but also positioning on a menu that can be used to shift behavior, Ranganathan continued. She described a study that WRI conducted in collaboration with the London School of Economics that involved comparing menus containing a separate box for vegetarian dishes (“vegetarian” menu) with menus in which vegetarian dishes were included in the main section of the menu (“control” menu). She reported that, among 760 study participants in the United Kingdom, 13.4 percent ordered vegetarian entrées from the control menu, compared with only 5.9 percent who ordered from the vegetarian menu (). Ranganathan described another study, not conducted by the Better Buying Lab, in which researchers compared four ways of framing the same vegetable: indulgent (e.g., “twisted garlic ginger butternut squash wedges”), basic (“butternut squash”), healthy restrictive (“butternut squash with no added sugar”), and healthy positive (“antioxidant-rich butternut squash”) (). The study revealed that using indulgent language resulted in significantly more people selecting a vegetable relative to when that same vegetable was described using either basic, healthy restrictive, or healthy positive language. “Language, I think, does matter,” Ranganathan ""4 Sustainability and Healthy Dietary Changes Through Policy and Program Action."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. concluded. At the same time, however, she cautioned against overselling this claim, and she described this as a nascent but fertile research area. A second strategy being tested at the Better Buying Lab is to popularize dishes rich in plants by increasing the number of plant-based “power dishes,” defined as dishes that are prevalent on menus in mainstream restaurants. Currently, Ranganathan reported, only one vegetarian dish—the ubiquitous “veggie sandwich/wrap”—is among the top 25 most prevalent dishes on menus in U.S. restaurants. She described how the lab has been working on introducing three additional vegetarian power dishes: a blended burger (30 percent mushroom, 70 percent beef), a veggie bowl, and an avocado club sandwich. Given that 1 billion beef burgers are sold in the United States annually, she observed, even if only 30 percent of the beef in each of those burgers was replaced with mushrooms, in terms of GHG emissions that would be like taking 2.3 million cars, or about the total number of cars in San Diego, off U.S. roads. In closing, Ranganathan mentioned briefly that while many food service companies have made commitments to GHG reduction, most of their efforts are centered around transportation and energy. She stated that WRI is also working to encourage them to think about the GHG emissions resulting from their food supply chains. She observed that shifting consumers to more plant-based foods can be an effective GHG reduction strategy as well. THE CASE FOR NUTRITION-SENSITIVE VALUE CHAIN INTERVENTIONS: WHAT GETS MEASURED GETS IMPROVED While most of the workshop discussion on actions that can support sustainable diets revolved around production versus consumption strategies, Maha Tahiri, former food industry executive, addressed the challenges and opportunities for achieving sustainable diets through a different lens: nutrition-sensitive value chain (NSVC) interventions. Referring back to Fanzo’s earlier remarks about policy making (see ), she suggested that NSVCs are something policy makers and the private sector should take into account. Historically, Tahiri observed, most food chain interventions have been aimed at increasing yield and the well-being of farmers. She explained how the concept of an NSVC, with its focus on nutritional outcomes, not just economic value, emerged about 10 years ago based on the premise that “what gets measured gets improved.” She noted that, in the NSVC ""4 Sustainability and Healthy Dietary Changes Through Policy and Program Action."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. BOX 4-2Definition of a Nutrition-Sensitive Value Chain “Nutrition-sensitive value chain—A food value chain consists of all the stakeholders who participate in the coordinated production and value-adding activities that are needed to make food products (). Though the traditional focus has been on economic value, nutrition-sensitive value chains leverage opportunities to enhance supply and/or demand for nutritious food, as well as opportunities to add nutritional value (and/or minimize food and nutrient loss) at each step of the chain, thereby improving the availability, affordability, quality, and acceptability of nutritious food. For lasting impacts on nutrition, this approach must be placed in a sustainability context as well.” definition articulated by an FAO-hosted Rome-based Agencies working group on NSVCs (; see ), she was particularly struck by its focus on the whole value chain, from input, through preparation, to consumption. Tahiri called attention to a handful of studies reporting that traditional interventions, such as food fortification, complementary feeding, and promotion of breastfeeding, are not enough to achieve global nutrition targets. First, she pointed to a study conducted by ’s Maternal and Child Undernutrition Group as being particularly important (). Among 36 countries representing 90 percent of the global malnutrition burden, the researchers concluded that implementation of evidencebased interventions would not achieve global targets. Tahiri then cited a follow-up study in which demonstrated that implementing 10 evidence-based nutrition-specific interventions, including breastfeeding, fortification, and community interventions, with 90 percent coverage would reduce deaths among children younger than 5 years by only 15 percent and reduce stunting by only 20 percent. The authors concluded that nutrition interventions should be combined with nutrition-sensitive approaches that address the underlying determinants of malnutrition, such as women’s empowerment, education, employment, social protection, and The Rome-based agencies include FAO, the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), the World Food Programme (WFP), and the Bioversity International. ""4 Sustainability and Healthy Dietary Changes Through Policy and Program Action."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. safety nets. Lastly, Tahiri highlighted a review paper on the impacts of agriculture on nutrition (), in which the authors analyze 10 well-implemented interventions and conclude that the “empirical evidence for plausible and significant impacts of agriculture on defined nutrition outcomes remains disappointingly scarce.” Tahiri pointed out, however, as the authors do, that the absence of evidence is not the same as evidence of absence. Agriculture and nutrition are both very large domains, she explained, and unless an analysis is more specific, it makes sense that significant correlations would not be detected. Tahiri identified as one particularly positive feature of NSVCs that they make it possible to divide the complex food system into different parts and visualize, depending on the situation (i.e., increased demand versus increased supply), how an intervention at any point along the value chain could enhance nutrition (see ). In this way, she posited, they help people formulate questions in a more expansive way, including how to act in the interest of sustainability. As an example of a possible NSVC intervention in a situation of high demand and inconsistent supply, Tahiri mentioned labor-saving methods at the input stage, which would also have sustainability implications in the sense that such a strategy would mean more time for mothers to care for their children. She cited refrigerated transport at the distribution/transport stage as another example of an NSVC intervention in such a situation that would also have implications for sustainability. In contrast, in a situation of ""4 Sustainability and Healthy Dietary Changes Through Policy and Program Action."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. high demand and consistent supply, she suggested that the focus probably should be on food safety. In a situation of demand constraint and consistent supply, she stated that interventions would be targeted at the trading/marketing/promotion stage of the value chain. Finally, she observed that in a situation of demand constraint and inconsistent supply, interventions would probably need to be applied all along the chain. NSVC Interventions: An Example and Proof of Concept As an example of an NSVC, Tahiri described work conducted by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) in Rwanda and Uganda to increase the availability of, access to, and demand for nutritious beans (). She noted that beans are very important in both countries. She reported that the researchers conducted field trials with new varieties of beans, training farmers on the spacing of rows and other production techniques. They also trained farmers on anaerobic storage and other postharvest technologies. In addition, they worked with the farmers to help them understand the market and to sell their beans collectively. Tahiri pointed out that when the farmers sold individually, only about 10 percent would actually sell their beans on any given day, whereas when they sold collectively, more than 81 percent were able to sell their beans. Finally, Tahiri said, the researchers also worked with the farmers to improve their negotiation skills and increase demand from other countries, namely South Sudan and Kenya. In sum, she explained, they examined all aspects of the value chain to see where they could make improvements. However, she cautioned, this was not a controlled study, so it was not possible to say that the interventions were any more effective than traditional interventions. Tahiri said she was unaware of any controlled studies of NSVC interventions. What she characterized as the “best” she could find was what she considers a proof-of-concept study conducted in North Senegal (). She described how this study involved a value chain that already existed—a local dairy factory, Laiterie du Berger—that had been receiving milk from its network of seminomadic, pastoralist dairy farmers, but on an irregular basis. Tahiri explained that the intervention involved a yearlong exchange between the farmers and the factory, whereby the farmers delivered a constant supply of milk to the factory 5 days per week in return for a fortified yogurt produced from that milk that the farmers would then feed to their children. She added that the study was conducted while a behavioral change communication campaign related to fortified products was being implemented nationwide. The researchers found that after 1 year, the prevalence of anemia among children aged 24 to 59 months had declined from 80 percent to 60 percent. The impact was greater on boys than on girls. Although this was not a case-control study, Tahiri said, it was “what ""4 Sustainability and Healthy Dietary Changes Through Policy and Program Action."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. I would say is really good proof of concept of a nutrition-sensitive value chain intervention.” Tahiri concluded by highlighting what she considers to be key factors in the success of NSVC interventions. She identified as one of the most important that there be a clear definition of the nutrition problem, and therefore of the nutrition goal. In addition, she called for an expansive search for creative solutions that can be applied locally. Next, she highlighted coordination of the whole chain as key, although she acknowledged that this sometimes is not possible; for example, when no transportation is available. Tahiri cited adding value to all actors along the value chain as another key factor driving success and as one of the keys to the success of the North Senegal dairy intervention: Laiterie du Berger received a constant supply of milk, and the herders received a fortified yogurt for their children. Referring to the philanthropic work done by many companies in Africa, India, and elsewhere, she pointed out that “all actors along the value chain” include the private sector. She encouraged more engagement of the private sector—from large, vertically integrated, multinational companies to individuals who transport, store, aggregate, or sell food. Yet another key factor in success, Tahiri stressed, is to adopt a “consumer first” approach, which she believes is the best way to increase or create demand. Even when people say they want to have sustainable products, she noted, consumer research has shown that when consumers are actually making a purchase, they do not buy a product unless there is something specific and “close to home” about it that they can embrace. Finally, Tahiri underscored the need to focus on influencing policy. Specifically, she pointed to the importance of elevating nutrition in the agenda. OPPORTUNITIES FOR INTEGRATING SUSTAINABILITY AND DIETARY GUIDANCE Barbara Schneeman, University of California, Davis, who served on a National Academies committee examining the process for establishing the DGA (), addressed how sustainability could be integrated into the DGA. She used that committee’s report, Dietary Guidelines for Americans, as the basis for her presentation. She characterized it as particularly useful for this purpose because the committee did such a thorough job of examining the evolution of the DGA and the methodology used to establish the guidelines. The committee, she explained, identified three essential functions, or phases, currently carried out by the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (DGAC), ""4 Sustainability and Healthy Dietary Changes Through Policy and Program Action."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. working in collaboration with staff from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and USDA: (1) strategic planning, (2) analysis, and (3) synthesis/interpretation. Schneeman did not think it necessary, for the purposes of this talk, to go into detail on the redesign of the DGA cycle proposed by the National Academies committee (i.e., a 5-year cycle between releases of subsequent DGAs). She did emphasize, however, the committee’s recognition that each phase requires the right expertise and right investment of time and resources. Therefore, she reported, the committee proposed that different DGA committees be responsible for each of the three essential phases. Schneeman went on to consider how sustainability could be integrated into each of these phases through the work of the proposed DGA committees and in other ways. Integrating Sustainability into Strategic Planning In general, the National Academies committee encouraged more strategic planning across DGA cycles and a longer-term look at development of the guidelines. Specifically, the committee proposed that a Planning and Continuity Group “provide the secretaries of USDA and HHS with planning support that assures alignment with long-term strategic objectives spanning multiple DGA cycles, identify and prioritize topics for the [Dietary Guidelines Scientific Advisory Committee] to evaluate in subsequent DGA cycles, and oversee monitoring and surveillance for new evidence.” Schneeman clarified that this planning group would not be involved with developing or evaluating evidence, but with determining whether there is evidence suggesting that a topic might be “ready for prime time.” In the context of how sustainability might be integrated into the strategic planning phase, Schneeman identified two key opportunities: first, determining how sustainability relates to the purpose of the DGA, and second, delineating sustainability topics to be addressed in subsequent cycles. Determining How Sustainability Relates to the Purpose of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans The National Academies committee identified multiple statements about the purpose of and audience for the DGA, Schneeman reported, leading it to urge continuity and clarity around these statements. In fact, she said, the committee proposed a singular purpose statement aligned with wording in the legislation that established the DGA cycle (i.e., the National Nutrition Monitoring and Related Research Act): “The purpose of the DGA is to provide science-based ‘nutritional and dietary information and guidelines for the general public’ that form the basis for ‘any federal food, nutrition, ""4 Sustainability and Healthy Dietary Changes Through Policy and Program Action."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. or health program.’” Schneeman added that the committee proposed that the audience for the DGA be the general public and that the goals of the guidelines be to promote dietary intake that helps improve health and reduce the risk of chronic disease and to provide the federal government with a consistent approach for nutrition policy and messaging. Although sustainability is not an explicit part of the proposed purpose statement, she asserted that there would be ways to accomplish this. Regarding the identification and prioritization of topics to be evaluated during subsequent DGA cycles, Schneeman continued, the National Academies committee divided criteria for topic selection into three categories: topic identification, topic selection, and topic prioritization. She explained that the first two categories are areas in which there probably should be nongovernmental stakeholder as well as government input. In contrast, the committee identified topic prioritization as a task for the proposed Planning and Continuity Group. As with the purpose statement, Schneeman added, sustainability was not incorporated as an explicit criterion for any of the three categories of criteria. Criteria for topic identification, she elaborated, focus more on relevance to diet, nutrition, and health. While the criteria for prioritization suggest cost-effectiveness studies, their focus is more on public health urgency and the availability of evidence-based intervention. In Schneeman’s opinion, again, there clearly is an opportunity to consider how sustainability could be integrated into this scheme. She mentioned that HHS and USDA asked for comments on topics during the last DGA cycle, so there does appear to be some interest in opening the process up to suggestions. However, she was unaware of whether any sustainability-related topics were advanced. She stressed that in the future, depending on the topic(s) chosen, the relevant expertise will need to be brought to bear, either through membership of the Planning and Continuity Group or through any subcommittees that are formed. Either way, she said, “that expertise needs to be part of the process.” Dietary Guidelines for Americans In Schneeman’s opinion, integrating sustainability into DGA strategic planning presents an opportunity, but also challenges. She identified as a key challenge understanding the objective for incorporating sustainability. Is it to justify the recommendations? Is it to consider the environmental impacts of dietary shifts? Or is it to see whether the recommendations are feasible given current economic and agricultural capacity? Schneeman ""4 Sustainability and Healthy Dietary Changes Through Policy and Program Action."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. observed that all of these questions had been touched on during this workshop. In addition, she pointed to a 1998 WHO/FAO report, Preparation and Use of Food-Based Dietary Guidelines, which emphasizes the importance of addressing such issues as economic and agricultural capacity when developing food-based dietary guidelines (). Integrating Sustainability into Analysis According to Schneeman, the types of evidence currently used to develop the DGA include original systematic reviews conducted with support from USDA’s Nutrition Evidence Library (NEL); existing systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and reports that are relevant and that meet the process criteria; descriptive data analyses, such as intakes of food and nutrients (e.g., from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey’s [NHANES’s] ); and, increasingly, food pattern modeling analyses aimed at determining what kind of food patterns meet the DGA recommendations. The National Academies committee proposed the use of technical expert panels (TEPs) to provide independent expertise during the analysis phase. Schneeman explained that a TEP could be assembled to help with systematic reviews, or if there were a specialized topic relating to a certain aspect of sustainability, a TEP could be assembled to assist with the technical review of that topic. In Schneeman’s opinion, supplemental expertise in food pattern modeling and descriptive data analysis could become critical if sustainability were incorporated as a factor. In Schneeman’s opinion, probably the most important challenges to integrating sustainability into the analysis phase of the cycle are defining the topics and research questions that can be addressed with systematic reviews and identifying the descriptive data analyses that are most relevant. As she had mentioned previously, the NHANES is one of the primary sources currently used for descriptive data analysis. But what is the most relevant tool from a sustainability point of view?, Schneeman asked. And how should food pattern modeling be considered in relation to sustainability? Given that food pattern modeling is used to see what patterns meet the DGA recommendations, does sustainability now need to be built into the way these models are constructed? Again, Schneeman stressed, the TEPs would need to include experts with knowledge in these areas. Integrating Sustainability into Synthesis and Interpretation Schneeman observed that work conducted during the third phase, synthesis and interpretation, is what most people associate with the current DGAC. She noted that the National Academies committee proposed ""4 Sustainability and Healthy Dietary Changes Through Policy and Program Action.""

In addition, the DGAC identifies new analyses that might be needed, topics on which more evidence is needed, and topics for future DGA cycles, as well as research recommendations. The main task, though, according to Schneeman, is to produce a scientific report for the secretaries of HHS and USDA to serve as a foundation for the DGA Policy Report. Schneeman explained that integrating sustainability into this third phase would involve, again, including experts who can provide relevant knowledge and context for a review of the evidence on topics identified as relevant for consideration in the DGA. She noted the report of the National Academies committee () refers to an earlier report on the selection process for DGAC members, and she pointed out that those same criteria would have to be applied to the selection of sustainability experts for the DGAC (or the renamed DGSAC). The main challenge to integrating sustainability into the DGA synthesis and interpretation phase, as Schneeman sees it, is that the process for nominating and selecting DGAC (DGSAC) members with the relevant sustainability expertise would depend on having identified specific areas of sustainability to be considered in that cycle. The opportunities discussed by Schneeman for integrating sustainability into the three key phases of the DGA process are summarized in . She noted that she had not discussed the final phase, federal review and update, which is what leads to publication of the DGA Policy Report. In her opinion, if there is transparency in the three earlier phases regarding the integration of relevant sustainability topics, this final phase “takes care of itself.” Schneeman’s take-home message was that to integrate sustainability into the DGA, it will be necessary to clarify the relationship between sustainability and the purpose of the DGA. Another key challenge, she suggested, will be to reexamine the resources for the three phases (strategic planning, analysis, and synthesis/interpretation) to see how they might need to be shifted so that sustainability can be addressed. Finally, Schneeman mentioned that one of the recommendations of the National Academies committee was to consider the emerging importance of systems approaches. Specifically, recommendation 7 of the committee’s report () was: “The secretaries of USDA and HHS should commission research and evaluate strategies to develop and implement ""4 Sustainability and Healthy Dietary Changes Through Policy and Program Action.""

Opportunities to Integrate Sustainability into the Different Phases of the National Academies’ Proposed Process Clarify the role of sustainability in the purpose of the DGA; Identify the topics and objectives related to sustainability that are relevant to the DGA; and Develop a long-term plan for addressing sustainability across the DGA cycles. Involve experts in sustainability to define the research questions and parameters for systematic reviews; Use technical experts to identify the relevant data sources; and Rethink approaches to dietary patterns to incorporate sustainability. Identify topics related to sustainability so that relevant expertise during the DGSAC nomination process can be identified; and In the report to the Secretaries, develop conclusions on the topics identified and identify research needs, evidence needs, and potential future topics related to sustainability as appropriate. Incorporate conclusions into the DGA Policy Report. NOTE: DGA = ; DGSAC = Dietary Guidelines Scientific Advisory Committee.

The selected strategies should then begin to be used to integrate systems mapping and modeling into the DGA process.” The committee recognized that this would not “happen overnight,” Schneeman said, because understanding how a systems approach can be helpful requires investment. In her opinion, a systems approach may also be a way to integrate sustainability into the DGA. In the discussion following Schneeman’s presentation, she, Springmann, Macdiarmid, Ranganathan, and Tahiri participated in an open discussion with the audience, summarized here. ""4 Sustainability and Healthy Dietary Changes Through Policy and Program Action."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. Integrating Sustainability Components into the There was considerable discussion around sustainability and the DGA, beginning with Drewnowski’s reminder that there are four dimensions of sustainable diets according to the FAO definition: (1) nutrition and health, (2) economic, (3) social and cultural, and (4) environmental. He expressed disappointment that the DGA have mentioned only the first of these. He stated that, to its credit, the DGAC has mentioned affordability, financial burden, and health equities in its work; however, the final documents have made no reference to these components, nor has there been any reference to societal value or food acceptance. He pointed out, for example, that among the current USDA healthy food patterns, the Mediterranean-style pattern is more expensive than the vegetarian pattern. He called for the incorporation of affordability, as well as the societal value and environmental components of sustainability, into future DGA. In response, Schneeman reflected on the different ways in which people think about the objective of integrating sustainability into the DGA and suggested that probably everyone can bring something to the table. While acknowledging that it would be difficult with the current cycle, she encouraged the audience, “If the topics start to emerge and we have agreement on how sustainability relates to the purpose of the dietary guidelines, then we have a way to start thinking about how [to] build that into the dietary guidelines going forward.” Peter Lurie, Center for Science in the Public Interest, Washington, DC, and Food Forum member, suggested reframing Drewnowski’s question in a slightly different way. Instead of asking why not, he proposed asking what is feasible. What is the likelihood that sustainability can be integrated into the DGA? Or which elements of sustainability that Drewnowski had laid out are most likely “to fall on receptive ears”? (For more detail on Drewnowski’s exposition of the four dimensions of sustainability, see .) Schneeman said she was unaware of which topics, other than B-24 (nutrition for children up to 24 months), will be considered in the next cycle of the DGA. She pointed to B-24 as a good case study of what it takes to bring a topic forward in a way that is suited to and positioned for the DGA process. She also commented on how the National Academies committee believed it would be helpful to move away from the practice of reviewing every topic during every DGA cycle, as there are some areas in the DGA that have not changed for 20 or 30 years (). This does not mean, she clarified, that those topics should never be reviewed, but that having a longer cycle of review for some topics would open up the opportunity to explore new topics. ""4 Sustainability and Healthy Dietary Changes Through Policy and Program Action."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. Tahiri added that consumer research could help inform specific economic or social and cultural topics to include in the DGA process. In other words, it could reveal what American consumers want included in the DGA. Rose pointed to the fact that there are two reports—the DGAC report and the final DGA. He views this as a gap given that the last DGAC report contained a chapter on sustainability that was excluded from the final DGA. He asked whether it would be possible to go back to the practice of the DGAC’s issuing the final DGA without that final report being filtered through federal oversight. Schneeman clarified that, even as far back in 1990, when she first served on the DGAC, the DGAC report went to the secretaries of HHS and USDA, who would then release the final DGA. The difference, she noted, was that the DGA at that time was a 20- or 30-page consumer pamphlet. Although its report contained a great deal of scientific detail and justification regarding any recommended DGA revisions, the DGAC was told that any new language it was recommending should be written at an eighth-grade level. Not until the 2005 DGA, Schneeman observed, was it realized that it made no sense to produce a consumer bulletin through the DGAC; rather, the DGAC’s strength was conducting a scientific evaluation and examining the evidence supporting the recommendations in the DGA or any revisions thereof. Thus, she continued, it was decided that the DGAC report should serve a scientific advisory purpose and that the DGA would no longer be a consumer bulletin, but a report aimed at policy makers. It would then be the responsibility of those policy makers to develop a consumer brochure. Schneeman added that today, a federal working group reviews educational materials issued by HHS or USDA to ensure that they are consistent with the DGA. Regarding the issue of sustainability, she noted that this issue sparked a great deal of controversy in the last DGA cycle. She referred again to the report of the National Academies committee and a recommendation therein relating to the responsibility of any advisory committee that, in the process of its work, becomes aware of an issue it views as important but was not chartered to address (). Maybe that committee’s job, she suggested, is to make sure that this issue is brought forward such that it will be addressed in the future, and that this, in fact, is what happened with sustainability in the last DGA. “Why are we having this discussion today?” she asked. “It is because of the controversy around how to include sustainability. Think of it as a success.” Claudia Hitja, USDA, asked whether any country had successfully integrated sustainability into its national dietary guidelines. Springmann directed Hitja to an FAO/Food Climate Research Network (FCRN) report titled Plates, Pyramids, Planet: Developments in National Healthy and Sustainable Dietary Guidelines (). ""4 Sustainability and Healthy Dietary Changes Through Policy and Program Action."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. Drewnowski pointed to the correlation between the distribution of plant protein consumption across Seattle and socioeconomic status. “People who consume plant proteins are the ones who consume salad and live in nice houses on the waterfront,” he observed. “When looking at grossly aggregated data by country, you really are losing track of the very small geographic distinctions.” He asked Springmann how useful it is to look at country-level data. Springmann agreed that country-level analyses examine only general trends, such as trends in what people consume or what they are thought to be eating. But that is the intent of such analyses, he asserted: to illustrate those generalities and tease out country differences, not to inform local understanding. “There are discussions to be had at any level, I suppose,” he commented. Curious about whether there is any evidence to suggest that sustainable diet goals will be achievable, Afshin pointed out that no country has been successful at reducing the prevalence of overweight and obesity over the past 30 years. In addition, he noted that the consumption of nuts has increased by only 2 grams over that same period. “Is it possible to increase that by 20 grams over the next 20 years?” he asked. “Has any country been able to achieve at least any of these [dietary change] scenarios over the last few years?” At the country level, Springmann responded, this probably has not been accomplished. However, he stressed, there is evidence that specific dietary interventions can be successful. As an example, he mentioned weight loss studies conducted by Oxford University researchers demonstrating that overweight and obesity can be reduced, although success requires intensive resources and follow-up. In addition, he cited an effort in North Karelia, Finland, to reduce the intake of saturated fats, which he characterized as “pretty successful.” And he suspects that there have been other, similarly successful small-scale interventions involving broad dietary changes. He also referred to an analysis of the effect of GHG taxes on food consumption. While the analysis predicted that taxing food according to its GHG emissions could influence food consumption, diets would probably not change significantly. Thus, he emphasized, “you really need a multitude of different interventions.” He stressed, too, that the lack of evidence of large-scale, country-level changes does not mean there should be no efforts to achieve such changes. “I think we are called to action on all dimensions,” he argued. ""4 Sustainability and Healthy Dietary Changes Through Policy and Program Action."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. Tahiri suggested that by also examining socioeconomic changes, as Drewnowski had emphasized, one might in fact be able to detect country-level dietary shifts. Ranganathan agreed with Springmann that, as she said, “there is no room for pessimism.” She expressed her belief that shifts not only are possible but also can happen rapidly. She pointed to the rapid shift in people’s dietary habits around meat during World War II in the United States. In the face of blockades and the need to send food to the troops, the strategy was to shift Americans at home to eating more organ meat. Ranganathan cited that as one of the most successful and rapidly implemented dietary strategies ever undertaken. Similarly, in China, she noted, there has been a campaign to reduce the use of shark fin in soup, which is traditionally seen as a food the wealthy eat. Around the globe, she added, diets are shifting in middle- and low-income countries. “We know they can shift,” she said. “We just have to shift them in a more sustainable direction.” She referred to the “tried and tested” private-sector strategies for shifting consumption that she had described during her presentation. “What you purchase and what ends up in your basket or on your plate is largely influenced by external forces and not necessarily what you set out to buy or eat,” she observed. In addition to the food shifts she had described earlier, Ranganathan commented on how effective marketing has shifted consumption in the area of men’s grooming products as well. Her father, for example, would have considered it “not manly” to use any kind of men’s grooming products other than his standard shaving equipment. But now, she pointed out, men’s grooming products are a multi-billion dollar business because the companies that sell them have successfully addressed that perception. They now market the products in a manner that appeals to men’s masculinity, including by packaging them, for example, in black bottles; giving them such names as “Face Fuel” and “Urban Camouflage”; and placing them on shelves next to belts or similar items. However, Ranganathan also cautioned that using only private-sector strategies is not enough; government action, policies, and price signals are also needed. But her hope is that working with businesses first, particularly food service companies, will cause them to become champions that will call for government to institute the needed changes. Schneeman added that in the United States, the labeling of trans-fatty acids, which began in 2006, led to their elimination from packaged foods, as well as to other kinds of campaigns to remove these substances from other parts of the food sector. With respect to sugar-sweetened beverages, as far as she knows, the decline in consumption began as soon as people became aware of the need to avoid them. Both of these examples, she said, accord with Ranganathan’s remarks about how changes can happen quickly. The question for her is whether these changes are occurring in ""4 Sustainability and Healthy Dietary Changes Through Policy and Program Action."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. a coordinated way. For example, when consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages decreased, what increased? And is the whole system responding effectively? Springmann was asked by Rebecca Boehm, Yukon Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity, how interventions to reduce consumption of sugary drinks compare with interventions or approaches that might be used to reduce meat consumption. Springmann responded that this is a difficult comparison because sugary drinks are a food nobody needs, whereas meat, many people would argue, is a food that could benefit some people in low-income settings. In high-income countries, however, and also in many middle-income countries, he added, one could argue that people eat too much meat. In addition, he observed, there are many different kinds of meat. In his opinion, the difference between sugary drinks and meat does not mean that taxing meats, for example, would not work, “but it is probably not an exact parallel,” he cautioned. Tahiri emphasized the essential role of positive reinforcement. She argued that, while a range of taxes and other tools can be used, “we really should keep in mind that positive reinforcement is one thing that we should not take out of the equation of changing behaviors.” Ashley Lyles, MedPage Today, asked what role medical doctors can play in shifting behavior, specifically in getting people to change their diet. Schneeman responded that, since many consumers look to the medical profession for dietary advice, finding a way to provide advice on dietary change in that setting is important. She encouraged medical professionals to use the tools available, such as nutrition labeling; that is, help consumers in their clinics understand how to use the labeling. She pointed to dieticians as another important resource. In fact, she suggested, once a medical condition that would benefit from dietary modification has been identified, a physician might want to connect that individual with the dietitian on staff as the best resource for discussing the changes that could be made in his or her diet.

4d12f998-35d5-47ac-a0ff-159faabd1712,"Fast Take: The EAT-Lancet Report on Sustainable Diets Report states that feeding 10 billion people by the year 2050 with a healthy and sustainable diet will be impossible without changing eating habits, improving food production and reducing food waste. There are some similarities between the current US Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the EAT-Lancet Report’s diet recommendations. However, they differ in their recommendation on the consumption of sugars, red meat and dairy notably. While this report calls for further sustainable food production practices, consumers should not overlook the environmentally focused techniques that are currently employed to produce a wide variety of healthy foods across the globe with natural resource conservation in mind. Feeding our ever-growing population will take the diligent work of many farmers and food producers. As we ponder how much food needs to be produced to feed us all, should we also consider the ecological demands that food production takes? Many of us do. This week, a globally represented group of scientists released a report on this topic. The EAT-Lancet Commission released the “Healthy Diets From Sustainable Food Systems” report showcasing new dietary recommendations focused on enhanced plant-based food consumption to increase the health of our populations. The report also issues advice on altering food production practices to be more environmentally sustainable and increase the health of our planet. EAT is a global non-profit that aims to connect science, policy, business and society to achieve their mission of transforming the global food system through sustainable diet and agricultural production practices. Their primary goal is “to achieve planetary health diets for nearly 10 billion people by 2050.” Let’s take a closer look at what and how it compares to another well-known set of evidence-based dietary recommendations: The current US Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA). The DGA have historically focused on eating patterns that promote overall health and prevent chronic disease. Bringing sustainability into the mix was proposed during deliberations for the current set of guidelines, but ultimately it was not included. There are some similarities between the current DGAs and the EAT-Lancet Report’s diet recommendations. First, the Report focuses on diets for ages 2 and older and uses food groups to recommend amounts of each group that we should consume. Additionally, both the DGA and this report include recommendations for intake of fats, added sugars and salt. See below for an ideal plate defined by the EAT-Lancet Commission versus the DGA tool. Much like the DGA, the Commission’s recommendation for a healthy diet “largely consists of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and unsaturated oils, includes a low to moderate amount of seafood and poultry, and includes no or a low quantity of red meat, processed meat, added sugar, refined grains, and starchy vegetables.” Key Considerations in Comparing DGA to the EAT-Lancet Diet While recommendations for fruits, vegetables and whole grains remain similar between the EAT-Lancet Report and the DGA, there are a few key differences to note: The DGA are typically based on a 2,000 calorie diet, but the Commission uses a 2,500 calorie reference for two reasons: 1) Estimated calorie intake is 2,370 per day globally; 2) The 2,500 calories correspond with the needs of a moderate to highly active 30-year-old, 70 kilogram (kg) male or 60 kg female. The Report recommends total added sugar intake be no more than 31 grams per day (about 7.5 teaspoons) for all sweeteners, or less than 5 percent of total energy. Essentially, they call for a 50 percent reduction in added sugar intake compared to the and World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations, which state that added sugar intake should be less than 10 percent of total energy. A from the WHO (based on very low and moderate quality evidence for dental caries) goes a step further, saying that less than 5 percent would be beneficial. The Report argues that red meat is not essential and that optimal intake might be no red meat at all. Because data on risk of low red meat intakes are imprecise, a range of 0 to 28 grams (less than one ounce) per day is offered as “desirable” and an average of 14 grams (half an ounce) is used as the reference. No specific recommendation for red meat intake is made in the DGA. However, individuals are advised to keep total consumption of meat, poultry and eggs between 3 to 26 ounces per week. The Report states that dairy recommendations are primarily made to meet calcium intake references. Because optimal calcium intake recommendations vary globally, 0 to 500 grams (about 17.6 ounces) of dairy foods per day is offered as the range, with 250 grams (just under 9 ounces) being the reference amount. The Commission concluded that optimal dairy intake is on the lower end of this range because unsaturated plant oils are more beneficial for cardiovascular disease risk than dairy fat. In contrast, the DGA recommend 2-3 cup equivalents of dairy per day. What Food Production Recommendations Are in the Report? In addition to having recommendations for what food people should eat, the Report also addresses the modification of current food production practices to address environmental stress. It is undeniable that the majority of us want to make environmentally sustainable food purchases, as highlighted in the IFIC Foundation . Farmers use an array of practices for conserving natural resources and producing a sufficient amount of nutritious food to feed our population. The utilization of such as GPS guidance for crop vehicles, drones, autonomous vehicles, and various other software advances can help farmers be more efficient in soil maintenance, water conservation and enhanced use of energy-saving machinery. However, even with the use of precision agriculture techniques, mindful farming does come with a concern for environmental stewardship, diligent water use and attention to . Farmers employ strategic water that remain helpful in times of drought, and aid in effective water conservation and water reuse. Farmers even reclaim wastewater (runoff water from crop processing facilities) and use it to improve their soil organic content, moisture-holding capacity, nutrient content and productivity. After food leaves the farm, water is still conserved by food manufacturing facilities as well. Many food and beverage plants reuse process wastewater onsite while still maintaining safety and quality. The majority of wastewater in food production facilities is used in non-food contact contexts, such as irrigation of landscaping, truck washing, cooling towers and warehouse floor washing. However, in some cases, water can be reused in boilers, evaporators or chillers. While does occur and remains a concern for farmers and food producers, it can often be mitigated, prevented and even reversed through the use of sustainable farming techniques and advanced land management practices. Farmers also successfully aim to slow erosion rates of the soil in such a manner that the productivity of it is not diminished. Farmers are actively using such as conservation tillage, application of biochar and compost, rotational grazing for farm animals, planting of cover crops and the spreading of manure to replenish soil nutrients, such as carbon. Food waste is a concerning and serious issue around the world. In 2011, an on global food losses and waste estimated that “each year, one-third of all food produced in the world for human consumption never reached the consumer’s table.” And although some food waste can occur throughout the food supply chain, in the United States for the majority of wasted food that ends up in landfills. The average American tosses out about 300 pounds of food per year, which amounts to billions of pounds of wasted food. While local conditions in varying countries will impact where the most changes need to be made, these implications highlight the necessity to focus on reducing food waste on the production end and on the consumer end as well. Certainly, by changing meal planning, buying more frozen and canned fruits and vegetables (which have a longer shelf life than their fresh counterparts), safely saving leftovers from restaurant meals and being educated about dates. The recommendations from the Eat-Lancet Commission do align somewhat with that of the 2015 DGA, but they are not one and the same. For example, the current DGA do not consider the impact of food choice on planetary health (perhaps in the future they will), which could, in part, explain some of the differences between DGA and Eat-Lancet food group and nutrient recommendations. Notably, all of modern agriculture may not be perfect, but current agricultural technologies do have many positive attributes that can help to abate potential adverse environmental impacts from food production. And from an overall perspective, it’s encouraging to see that the DGA and Eat-Lancet Report agree on the need for dietary guidance to be flexible and tailored to different preferences, cultures and food availabilities.

The Food Forum convenes scientists, administrators, and policy makers from academia, government, industry, and public sectors on an ongoing basis to discuss problems and issues related to food, food safety, and regulation and to identify possible approaches for addressing those problems and issues. The Forum provides a rapid way to identify areas of concordance among these diverse interest groups. It does not make recommendations, nor does it offer specific advice. It does compile information, develop options, and bring interested parties together. The Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) established the Food Forum in 1993 to allow selected science and technology leaders in the food industry, top administrators in the federal government, representatives from consumer interest groups, and academicians to periodically discuss and debate food and food related issues openly and in a neutral setting. The Forum provides a mechanism for these diverse groups to identify possible approaches for addressing food and food safety problems and issues surrounding the often complex interactions among industry, academia, regulatory agencies, and consumers. About the FNB: The FNB falls within the Health and Medicine Division of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. The National Academies are private, nonprofit institutions that provide independent, objective analysis and advice to the nation to solve complex problems and inform public policy decisions related to science, technology, and medicine. The National Academies operate under an 1863 congressional charter to the National Academy of Sciences, signed by President Lincoln. ""Appendix A: Workshop Agenda.""

b256b9bb-f677-4eef-9d72-faf363b60b1e,"Drinking water and eating fruits and vegetables are part of a healthy diet. See more . Dieting is one of those things that is completely integrated into American culture. On any given day, a huge portion of the U.S. population is ""on a diet"" and ""counting "" in one way or another. And look at how many of the diet names in the following list you recognize: Curiosity Project: How many people don't have enough food to be healthy? You probably recognize many of these names because you hear them all the time! In this article, we will look first at weight gain and why gaining weight is so easy. Then we will look at what you can do about weight gain -- in the form of diet and -- to maintain a consistent weight. Have you ever wondered why, for so many people (and especially for anyone older than 30 years old), weight gain seems to be a fact of life? It's because the human body is way too efficient! It just does not take that much energy to maintain the human body at rest; and when , the human body is amazingly frugal when it comes to turning into motion. At rest (for example, while sitting and watching ), the human body burns only about 12 calories per pound of body weight per day (26 calories per kilogram). That means that if you weigh 150 pounds (68 kg), your body uses only about: Twelve calories per pound per day is a rough estimate -- see for details. Those 1,800 calories are used to do everything you need to stay alive: They keep your beating and breathing. They keep your internal organs operating properly. In motion, the human body also uses energy very efficiently. For example, a person running a marathon (26 miles or 42 km) burns only about 2,600 calories. In other words, you burn only about 100 calories per mile (about 62 calories per km) when you are running. You can see just how efficient the human body is if you compare your body to a car. A typical car in the United States gets between 15 and 30 miles per gallon of (6 to 12 km/L). A gallon of gas contains about . That means that if a human being could drink gasoline instead of eating hamburgers to take in calories, a human being could run 26 miles on about one-twelfth of a gallon of gas (0.3 L). In other words, a human being gets more than 300 miles per gallon (120 km/L)! If you put a human being on a to increase the efficiency, a human being can get well over 1,000 miles per gallon (more than 500 km/L)! That level of efficiency is the main reason why it is so easy to gain weight, as we will see in the next section. A meal at McDonald's can add up to almost a whole day's worth of calories. The 1,800 that a typical person at rest needs per day is just not that many. For example, if you go to your neighborhood restaurant and order the Big Xtra meal, you will get a sandwich, a large order of french fries and a large Coke®. This meal contains: (*See for details.) In other words, just this one meal provides 1,560 calories you need during a day. If you get an M&M® McFlurry™ with it for dessert, you'll get 630 more calories, so you are already consuming almost 2,200 calories just at this one meal! Similarly, if you go to Pizza Hut and get a Meat Lover's Pan Pizza®, each slice contains 360 calories.* If you eat three slices and get a large drink to go with it, that's 1,390 calories -- just 410 calories shy of a full day's worth of calories. (*See for details.) Similarly, if you eat 12 SnackWell's Crème Sandwich Cookies -- which, if you think about it, really is not that hard to do -- you've taken in 660 calories. That's more than one-third of the daily caloric intake. The point here is not to slam these products or make them look bad. For example, I've got two kids and I go to McDonald's at least once a week. The point is that, in America and most other developed countries, it is easy to find and consume calories. Let's take a look at what someone might consume in a typical day. Face it, many of us are over-worked, over-booked and totally over-extended. So, convenient often takes the lead in our daily diets. In a typical day someone might consume something like this: and top it off with some potato chips while watching . You can see how the number of calories coming in can easily reach 3,000, 4,000 or 5,000 per day without any effort at all. That's the problem. Your body, it turns out, is extremely efficient at capturing and storing excess calories. Whenever your body finds that it has excess calories on hand, it converts them to fat and saves them for a rainy day. (See and for details). It only takes 3,500 excess calories to create 1 pound of new fat on your body. If you are taking in just 500 extra calories per day, then you are gaining a pound of fat per week (500 calories x 7 days in a week = 3,500 calories/week). Since it is easy to get 500 calories from just one ice cream cone or a few cookies, you can see that weight gain is completely effortless in today's society. Food is just too easy to find. Let's imagine that you are overweight and you would like to . To lose 1 pound of , what you have to do is burn off 3,500 . That is, over a period of time, you have to consume 3,500 calories less than your body needs. There are several ways you can create that deficit. If you assume that you weigh 150 pounds and that your body at rest needs 1,800 calories per day (150 * 12 = 1,800) to live, here are several examples (some realistic, some not): You could lie in bed and starve yourself. Since you are lying in bed, you are consuming 1,800 calories per day. Since you are starving yourself, you are taking in no calories. That means that, every day, you create a deficit of 1,800 calories and, approximately every two days, you will lose 1 pound of body weight. You could consume fewer calories than your body needs. For example, you might choose to consume 1,500 calories per day rather than the required 1,800 by controlling what you eat. That creates a 300-calorie deficit every day. That means that approximately every 12 days, you will lose 1 pound of weight (12 days x 300 calories = 3,600 calories). You could consume 1,800 calories per day and then choose to jog 2 miles (3.2 km) every day. The jogging would burn about 200 calories per day, and over the course of 18 days you would burn about 1 pound of body weight (18 days x 200 calories = 3,600 calories). You could consume 2,500 calories per day and run 10 miles per day. You will burn 1,800 calories per day at rest and then 1,000 calories per day running, for a total of 2,800 calories. You are consuming 300 calories fewer than you need, so you would lose a pound every 12 days or so (300 calories x 12 days = 3,600 calories). As you can see from these examples, the only way to lose fat is to consume fewer calories per day than your body needs. For every 3,500 calories that your body takes from its fat reserves, you lose 1 pound (0.45 kg) of body fat. You can create the deficit either by monitoring and restricting your intake of calories, or by , or both. The idea behind most diets -- everything from to the grapefruit diet -- is simply to help you somehow lower the number of calories that you consume each day. That's all they do. The reason why most diets tend not to work for very long is because they are not . A person gains weight because he or she consumes more per day than needed. The diet creates a temporary deficit. When the diet ends, the person goes back to normal eating and the weight comes back. Let's look at an example. Say that you weigh 150 pounds. That means that you burn 1,800 calories per day in a resting state. Let's also imagine that in the course of a day you burn 200 more calories living your life -- walking up and down steps, carrying in the groceries and so on. Your calorie needs then are, on average, 2,000 calories per day. Now let's further imagine that, on average, you consume 2,050 calories per day. On a daily basis your body is taking in, and therefore storing, 50 calories more than it needs. So every 70 days (3,500 calories in a pound / 50 calories each day = 70 days) you gain 1 pound (0.45 kg). If that ""50 extra calories per day"" trend continues, then over the course of a year you would gain 5 pounds. This, by the way, is the pattern for a big portion of the U.S. population. If you over-consume by just a few calories per day, over time you will gain weight. Keep in mind that just one Oreo-type cookie contains 50 calories, so over-consuming is incredibly easy. Now, you go on a diet -- the amazing ""Get Slim Miracle Diet."" On this diet, you consume nothing but 2 cups of brown rice and a can of Vienna sausages, along with all the you care to eat, every day. You start this diet and you are consuming only 1,000 calories per day. You also start jogging 2 miles a day. That means that, on a typical day, you are consuming 1,200 calories less than you need. Over the course of three days (3,500 calories in a pound / 1,200 calories each day = approximately 3 days), you will lose 1 pound of weight. You keep on this diet for two months and lose 20 pounds. The day you go off this diet, what is going to happen? First, you are probably going to eat a lot more than normal because you have been eating nothing but rice and Vienna sausages for two months! Then you will settle into your ""normal eating pattern"" that you had before the diet. And eventually all of the weight comes back. This is why diets don't work for most people. You do lose weight, but then go off the diet and gain it back. What is needed instead is a sustainable diet -- a consumption and exercise plan -- that lets you live a normal life and eat normal foods in a normal way. Building a sustainable diet and plan is the key to maintaining a consistent weight. This is not easy for many people. As described in the previous sections, the landscape is literally covered with calories, and exercise takes time and energy. The to building a sustainable diet is to start counting the calories that you consume in a day so that you become conscious of two things: You need to understand exactly how many calories you are eating on a ""normal"" day. You need to realize where each calorie comes from -- you need to build a calorie database in your brain so that you know, whenever you eat something, just how many calories it is supplying. In the United States, any food that you buy in the grocery store is required by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration to have a nutritional label with that food's calorie content. You can also look at to find out the number of calories in different foods. Any chain restaurant will supply you with nutrition information both at the store and on the Web (or you can see a ). is to figure out how many calories you need in a day. You can use the ""12 calories per pound"" rule, or you can get more precise by looking at the formulas in . Pick your ""ideal weight"" -- the weight that you would like to maintain. Then calculate how many calories a day you can consume to maintain that weight. is to compare the two numbers -- You may be startled by the difference between the ""number of calories you need"" and ""the number of calories that you take in"" in a day. That is where the extra pounds are coming from. is to figure out how to bring the two numbers in line. What you will soon realize is that 1,600 or 1,800 or 2,000 calories per day just isn't that many. You have to watch and count you eat and drink every day and stick to your daily limit. might be to add exercise to the mix so that you can raise the number of calories you can consume per day. Online resources like will show you how many calories different forms of exercise can burn. Burning 250 or 500 calories per day through exercise can make a big difference. In an effort to reduce the number you take in per day, here are several strategies that you might find effective: Be conscious of every calorie you consume, and keep a daily journal. Stick an index card in your pocket each day and write down everything you eat and drink. Eliminate the myths from your mind, as described . Eliminate all calories that come in through drinking. In other words, drink water. The problem with drinks -- everything from cola to orange juice to -- is that they can bring in lots of calories and they have absolutely no effect on your appetite. For example, if you drink 10 ounces of orange juice (300 ml), you take in 140 calories but it does nothing to curb your appetite. If, on the other hand, you an orange, three things happen: You get to chew the orange, which has a psychological effect. It fills your stomach, which curbs your appetite. An orange actually gives you a feeling of fullness, while orange juice does not. The same holds true of any beverage that contains calories -- the calories come in but your appetite remains the same. Eliminate white sugar. This eliminates all sorts of high-calorie foods: By simply refusing all foods that contain lots of sugar, you make it easy to eliminate a big class of snack foods. Similarly, try eliminating all fried foods, including: from deep frying gives these foods lots of calories for their size. Eliminating fried foods and sugar together pretty much eliminates all high-calorie snacks. Entire aisles in the grocery store become irrelevant to you. Try to replace high-density foods with low-density foods. A cookie is a high-density food. It contains lots of sugar and fat, so it is lots of calories in a small package. One or two bites and you've taken in 50 or 100 calories. A banana, on the other hand, is low-density. It takes many bites to eat a banana, but you take in only 100 calories. Here's a good mental exercise that helps you understand the point: Most people would not find it hard to eat a dozen Oreo-type cookies. Or a dozen SnackWell's cookies. That's 600 calories. Now imagine trying to eat six bananas at one sitting -- you would explode! But it's the same number of calories. Look for low-density foods like bananas that fill you up without giving you that many calories. Foods that are low-density include: Just about any fruit or vegetable in its natural state Many non-sugared breakfast cereals, like shredded wheat Things that are high-density include any food or beverage high in sugar and/or fat. Nuts, most meats, candy, cookies, crackers, potato chips, fried anything, cola, beer, and so on are all high-density and should be avoided. Try wearing form-fitting clothes instead of sweats. The tight clothing acts as a subliminal reminder of what you are trying to accomplish. If you follow these guidelines and, through diet and , keep the number of calories you consume below the number of calories needed, you will lose fat and maintain a consistent weight. is one tool you have to control your weight because exercise is a way to increase the number of that you burn in a day. Online resources like show you how many calories different forms of exercise can burn. One way to make the most of exercise is to integrate some form of exercise into your daily routine. Here are several examples: Try to find some type of exercise that you enjoy (or at least can tolerate) and do it every day for 30 minutes, 60 minutes or more. It might be walking, riding an exercise bike while , or working out in a gym at lunch. Try to fit micro-exercises into your daily life. For example, instead of taking the , take the stairs. Park farther away from stores when you go shopping. These little things can add up. Put a set of weights at your desk and use them three or four times during the day, as you think or talk on the . Find an exercise partner. Exercise, for some people, is a lot easier if there is someone to talk to. A partner will also help make exercise a routine. Try to exercise every day. It is easier to remember to do something if you do it every day. There are dozens of myths that help to derail people. Here is a list of some of the most common so you can try to avoid them: The myth that some kinds of are different from others - A calorie is a calorie. If you consume 4,000 calories by eating 1,000 grams of white sugar or 4,000 calories by eating 444 grams of , it is still 4,000 calories. The myth that low-fat are okay or that you can eat as much as you want if it is low-fat - A product can have 0 grams of fat but still have lots of calories. Many fat-free foods replace the fat with sugar and contain just as many or more calories as a fat-containing product. The myth that any passive device, rings and bracelets or soaps or whatever, can help - There is no way to burn calories but to burn them. The myth that you can lose 54 pounds in 6 weeks - Despite what the ads say (I LOST 54 POUNDS IN 6 WEEKS WITHOUT DIETS OR EXERCISE!!! or ), you cannot lose a pound of fat unless you burn off 3,500 calories. To lose 54 pounds in 6 weeks, you would need to lose 9 pounds in 7 days, or 1.3 pounds per day. That 1.3 pounds of fat is equal to 4,500 calories, so you would have to burn off 4,500 calories per day. The only way to do that would be to eat nothing AND run a marathon every day for 42 days. That's impossible. The only way to lose that much weight that quickly is either through dehydration or amputation. The ads are lying. The myth that anything can create an ""enzyme-driven fat-burning cycle"" - All sorts of things, from nettle seeds to apple pectin, are supposed to contain enzymes that create an ENZYME-DRIVEN FAT BURNING CYCLE THAT BURNS CALORIES 24-HOURS-A-DAY!!! No. What is true is that you have to eat fewer calories than you burn in a day if you want to lose weight. You can do that by eating fewer calories than you need, or by exercising more, or both. It is true that some people burn more calories per day than others (just as some people are taller than others, some people have to use the restroom more frequently than others, some people lose their hair faster than others and so on -- people are different). You simply have to find the number of calories body burns in a day and consume fewer calories than your body needs. That's not to say it's easy -- the psychology of food and eating is very powerful. But that is what you have to do. It is a mental game, and there is no way around it. But now you know the rules of that mental game.

7a741e5c-1ede-42c9-8eed-a5288ba9836d,"Drinking water and eating fruits and vegetables are part of a healthy diet. See more . Dieting is one of those things that is completely integrated into American culture. On any given day, a huge portion of the U.S. population is ""on a diet"" and ""counting "" in one way or another. And look at how many of the diet names in the following list you recognize: Curiosity Project: How many people don't have enough food to be healthy? You probably recognize many of these names because you hear them all the time! In this article, we will look first at weight gain and why gaining weight is so easy. Then we will look at what you can do about weight gain -- in the form of diet and -- to maintain a consistent weight. Have you ever wondered why, for so many people (and especially for anyone older than 30 years old), weight gain seems to be a fact of life? It's because the human body is way too efficient! It just does not take that much energy to maintain the human body at rest; and when , the human body is amazingly frugal when it comes to turning into motion. At rest (for example, while sitting and watching ), the human body burns only about 12 calories per pound of body weight per day (26 calories per kilogram). That means that if you weigh 150 pounds (68 kg), your body uses only about: Twelve calories per pound per day is a rough estimate -- see for details. Those 1,800 calories are used to do everything you need to stay alive: They keep your beating and breathing. They keep your internal organs operating properly. In motion, the human body also uses energy very efficiently. For example, a person running a marathon (26 miles or 42 km) burns only about 2,600 calories. In other words, you burn only about 100 calories per mile (about 62 calories per km) when you are running. You can see just how efficient the human body is if you compare your body to a car. A typical car in the United States gets between 15 and 30 miles per gallon of (6 to 12 km/L). A gallon of gas contains about . That means that if a human being could drink gasoline instead of eating hamburgers to take in calories, a human being could run 26 miles on about one-twelfth of a gallon of gas (0.3 L). In other words, a human being gets more than 300 miles per gallon (120 km/L)! If you put a human being on a to increase the efficiency, a human being can get well over 1,000 miles per gallon (more than 500 km/L)! That level of efficiency is the main reason why it is so easy to gain weight, as we will see in the next section. A meal at McDonald's can add up to almost a whole day's worth of calories. The 1,800 that a typical person at rest needs per day is just not that many. For example, if you go to your neighborhood restaurant and order the Big Xtra meal, you will get a sandwich, a large order of french fries and a large Coke®. This meal contains: (*See for details.) In other words, just this one meal provides 1,560 calories you need during a day. If you get an M&M® McFlurry™ with it for dessert, you'll get 630 more calories, so you are already consuming almost 2,200 calories just at this one meal! Similarly, if you go to Pizza Hut and get a Meat Lover's Pan Pizza®, each slice contains 360 calories.* If you eat three slices and get a large drink to go with it, that's 1,390 calories -- just 410 calories shy of a full day's worth of calories. (*See for details.) Similarly, if you eat 12 SnackWell's Crème Sandwich Cookies -- which, if you think about it, really is not that hard to do -- you've taken in 660 calories. That's more than one-third of the daily caloric intake. The point here is not to slam these products or make them look bad. For example, I've got two kids and I go to McDonald's at least once a week. The point is that, in America and most other developed countries, it is easy to find and consume calories. Let's take a look at what someone might consume in a typical day. Face it, many of us are over-worked, over-booked and totally over-extended. So, convenient often takes the lead in our daily diets. In a typical day someone might consume something like this: and top it off with some potato chips while watching . You can see how the number of calories coming in can easily reach 3,000, 4,000 or 5,000 per day without any effort at all. That's the problem. Your body, it turns out, is extremely efficient at capturing and storing excess calories. Whenever your body finds that it has excess calories on hand, it converts them to fat and saves them for a rainy day. (See and for details). It only takes 3,500 excess calories to create 1 pound of new fat on your body. If you are taking in just 500 extra calories per day, then you are gaining a pound of fat per week (500 calories x 7 days in a week = 3,500 calories/week). Since it is easy to get 500 calories from just one ice cream cone or a few cookies, you can see that weight gain is completely effortless in today's society. Food is just too easy to find. Let's imagine that you are overweight and you would like to . To lose 1 pound of , what you have to do is burn off 3,500 . That is, over a period of time, you have to consume 3,500 calories less than your body needs. There are several ways you can create that deficit. If you assume that you weigh 150 pounds and that your body at rest needs 1,800 calories per day (150 * 12 = 1,800) to live, here are several examples (some realistic, some not): You could lie in bed and starve yourself. Since you are lying in bed, you are consuming 1,800 calories per day. Since you are starving yourself, you are taking in no calories. That means that, every day, you create a deficit of 1,800 calories and, approximately every two days, you will lose 1 pound of body weight. You could consume fewer calories than your body needs. For example, you might choose to consume 1,500 calories per day rather than the required 1,800 by controlling what you eat. That creates a 300-calorie deficit every day. That means that approximately every 12 days, you will lose 1 pound of weight (12 days x 300 calories = 3,600 calories). You could consume 1,800 calories per day and then choose to jog 2 miles (3.2 km) every day. The jogging would burn about 200 calories per day, and over the course of 18 days you would burn about 1 pound of body weight (18 days x 200 calories = 3,600 calories). You could consume 2,500 calories per day and run 10 miles per day. You will burn 1,800 calories per day at rest and then 1,000 calories per day running, for a total of 2,800 calories. You are consuming 300 calories fewer than you need, so you would lose a pound every 12 days or so (300 calories x 12 days = 3,600 calories). As you can see from these examples, the only way to lose fat is to consume fewer calories per day than your body needs. For every 3,500 calories that your body takes from its fat reserves, you lose 1 pound (0.45 kg) of body fat. You can create the deficit either by monitoring and restricting your intake of calories, or by , or both. The idea behind most diets -- everything from to the grapefruit diet -- is simply to help you somehow lower the number of calories that you consume each day. That's all they do. The reason why most diets tend not to work for very long is because they are not . A person gains weight because he or she consumes more per day than needed. The diet creates a temporary deficit. When the diet ends, the person goes back to normal eating and the weight comes back. Let's look at an example. Say that you weigh 150 pounds. That means that you burn 1,800 calories per day in a resting state. Let's also imagine that in the course of a day you burn 200 more calories living your life -- walking up and down steps, carrying in the groceries and so on. Your calorie needs then are, on average, 2,000 calories per day. Now let's further imagine that, on average, you consume 2,050 calories per day. On a daily basis your body is taking in, and therefore storing, 50 calories more than it needs. So every 70 days (3,500 calories in a pound / 50 calories each day = 70 days) you gain 1 pound (0.45 kg). If that ""50 extra calories per day"" trend continues, then over the course of a year you would gain 5 pounds. This, by the way, is the pattern for a big portion of the U.S. population. If you over-consume by just a few calories per day, over time you will gain weight. Keep in mind that just one Oreo-type cookie contains 50 calories, so over-consuming is incredibly easy. Now, you go on a diet -- the amazing ""Get Slim Miracle Diet."" On this diet, you consume nothing but 2 cups of brown rice and a can of Vienna sausages, along with all the you care to eat, every day. You start this diet and you are consuming only 1,000 calories per day. You also start jogging 2 miles a day. That means that, on a typical day, you are consuming 1,200 calories less than you need. Over the course of three days (3,500 calories in a pound / 1,200 calories each day = approximately 3 days), you will lose 1 pound of weight. You keep on this diet for two months and lose 20 pounds. The day you go off this diet, what is going to happen? First, you are probably going to eat a lot more than normal because you have been eating nothing but rice and Vienna sausages for two months! Then you will settle into your ""normal eating pattern"" that you had before the diet. And eventually all of the weight comes back. This is why diets don't work for most people. You do lose weight, but then go off the diet and gain it back. What is needed instead is a sustainable diet -- a consumption and exercise plan -- that lets you live a normal life and eat normal foods in a normal way. Building a sustainable diet and plan is the key to maintaining a consistent weight. This is not easy for many people. As described in the previous sections, the landscape is literally covered with calories, and exercise takes time and energy. The to building a sustainable diet is to start counting the calories that you consume in a day so that you become conscious of two things: You need to understand exactly how many calories you are eating on a ""normal"" day. You need to realize where each calorie comes from -- you need to build a calorie database in your brain so that you know, whenever you eat something, just how many calories it is supplying. In the United States, any food that you buy in the grocery store is required by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration to have a nutritional label with that food's calorie content. You can also look at to find out the number of calories in different foods. Any chain restaurant will supply you with nutrition information both at the store and on the Web (or you can see a ). is to figure out how many calories you need in a day. You can use the ""12 calories per pound"" rule, or you can get more precise by looking at the formulas in . Pick your ""ideal weight"" -- the weight that you would like to maintain.

Whenever your body finds that it has excess calories on hand, it converts them to fat and saves them for a rainy day. (See and for details). It only takes 3,500 excess calories to create 1 pound of new fat on your body. If you are taking in just 500 extra calories per day, then you are gaining a pound of fat per week (500 calories x 7 days in a week = 3,500 calories/week). Since it is easy to get 500 calories from just one ice cream cone or a few cookies, you can see that weight gain is completely effortless in today's society. Food is just too easy to find. Let's imagine that you are overweight and you would like to . To lose 1 pound of , what you have to do is burn off 3,500 . That is, over a period of time, you have to consume 3,500 calories less than your body needs. There are several ways you can create that deficit. If you assume that you weigh 150 pounds and that your body at rest needs 1,800 calories per day (150 * 12 = 1,800) to live, here are several examples (some realistic, some not): You could lie in bed and starve yourself. Since you are lying in bed, you are consuming 1,800 calories per day. Since you are starving yourself, you are taking in no calories. That means that, every day, you create a deficit of 1,800 calories and, approximately every two days, you will lose 1 pound of body weight. You could consume fewer calories than your body needs. For example, you might choose to consume 1,500 calories per day rather than the required 1,800 by controlling what you eat. That creates a 300-calorie deficit every day. That means that approximately every 12 days, you will lose 1 pound of weight (12 days x 300 calories = 3,600 calories). You could consume 1,800 calories per day and then choose to jog 2 miles (3.2 km) every day. The jogging would burn about 200 calories per day, and over the course of 18 days you would burn about 1 pound of body weight (18 days x 200 calories = 3,600 calories). You could consume 2,500 calories per day and run 10 miles per day. You will burn 1,800 calories per day at rest and then 1,000 calories per day running, for a total of 2,800 calories. You are consuming 300 calories fewer than you need, so you would lose a pound every 12 days or so (300 calories x 12 days = 3,600 calories). As you can see from these examples, the only way to lose fat is to consume fewer calories per day than your body needs. For every 3,500 calories that your body takes from its fat reserves, you lose 1 pound (0.45 kg) of body fat. You can create the deficit either by monitoring and restricting your intake of calories, or by , or both. The idea behind most diets -- everything from to the grapefruit diet -- is simply to help you somehow lower the number of calories that you consume each day. That's all they do. The reason why most diets tend not to work for very long is because they are not . A person gains weight because he or she consumes more per day than needed. The diet creates a temporary deficit. When the diet ends, the person goes back to normal eating and the weight comes back. Let's look at an example. Say that you weigh 150 pounds. That means that you burn 1,800 calories per day in a resting state. Let's also imagine that in the course of a day you burn 200 more calories living your life -- walking up and down steps, carrying in the groceries and so on. Your calorie needs then are, on average, 2,000 calories per day. Now let's further imagine that, on average, you consume 2,050 calories per day. On a daily basis your body is taking in, and therefore storing, 50 calories more than it needs. So every 70 days (3,500 calories in a pound / 50 calories each day = 70 days) you gain 1 pound (0.45 kg). If that ""50 extra calories per day"" trend continues, then over the course of a year you would gain 5 pounds. This, by the way, is the pattern for a big portion of the U.S. population. If you over-consume by just a few calories per day, over time you will gain weight. Keep in mind that just one Oreo-type cookie contains 50 calories, so over-consuming is incredibly easy. Now, you go on a diet -- the amazing ""Get Slim Miracle Diet."" On this diet, you consume nothing but 2 cups of brown rice and a can of Vienna sausages, along with all the you care to eat, every day. You start this diet and you are consuming only 1,000 calories per day. You also start jogging 2 miles a day. That means that, on a typical day, you are consuming 1,200 calories less than you need. Over the course of three days (3,500 calories in a pound / 1,200 calories each day = approximately 3 days), you will lose 1 pound of weight. You keep on this diet for two months and lose 20 pounds. The day you go off this diet, what is going to happen? First, you are probably going to eat a lot more than normal because you have been eating nothing but rice and Vienna sausages for two months! Then you will settle into your ""normal eating pattern"" that you had before the diet. And eventually all of the weight comes back. This is why diets don't work for most people. You do lose weight, but then go off the diet and gain it back. What is needed instead is a sustainable diet -- a consumption and exercise plan -- that lets you live a normal life and eat normal foods in a normal way. Building a sustainable diet and plan is the key to maintaining a consistent weight. This is not easy for many people. As described in the previous sections, the landscape is literally covered with calories, and exercise takes time and energy. The to building a sustainable diet is to start counting the calories that you consume in a day so that you become conscious of two things: You need to understand exactly how many calories you are eating on a ""normal"" day. You need to realize where each calorie comes from -- you need to build a calorie database in your brain so that you know, whenever you eat something, just how many calories it is supplying. In the United States, any food that you buy in the grocery store is required by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration to have a nutritional label with that food's calorie content. You can also look at to find out the number of calories in different foods. Any chain restaurant will supply you with nutrition information both at the store and on the Web (or you can see a ). is to figure out how many calories you need in a day. You can use the ""12 calories per pound"" rule, or you can get more precise by looking at the formulas in . Pick your ""ideal weight"" -- the weight that you would like to maintain. Then calculate how many calories a day you can consume to maintain that weight. is to compare the two numbers -- You may be startled by the difference between the ""number of calories you need"" and ""the number of calories that you take in"" in a day. That is where the extra pounds are coming from. is to figure out how to bring the two numbers in line. What you will soon realize is that 1,600 or 1,800 or 2,000 calories per day just isn't that many. You have to watch and count you eat and drink every day and stick to your daily limit. might be to add exercise to the mix so that you can raise the number of calories you can consume per day. Online resources like will show you how many calories different forms of exercise can burn. Burning 250 or 500 calories per day through exercise can make a big difference. In an effort to reduce the number you take in per day, here are several strategies that you might find effective: Be conscious of every calorie you consume, and keep a daily journal. Stick an index card in your pocket each day and write down everything you eat and drink. Eliminate the myths from your mind, as described . Eliminate all calories that come in through drinking. In other words, drink water. The problem with drinks -- everything from cola to orange juice to -- is that they can bring in lots of calories and they have absolutely no effect on your appetite. For example, if you drink 10 ounces of orange juice (300 ml), you take in 140 calories but it does nothing to curb your appetite. If, on the other hand, you an orange, three things happen: You get to chew the orange, which has a psychological effect. It fills your stomach, which curbs your appetite. An orange actually gives you a feeling of fullness, while orange juice does not. The same holds true of any beverage that contains calories -- the calories come in but your appetite remains the same. Eliminate white sugar. This eliminates all sorts of high-calorie foods: By simply refusing all foods that contain lots of sugar, you make it easy to eliminate a big class of snack foods. Similarly, try eliminating all fried foods, including: from deep frying gives these foods lots of calories for their size. Eliminating fried foods and sugar together pretty much eliminates all high-calorie snacks. Entire aisles in the grocery store become irrelevant to you. Try to replace high-density foods with low-density foods. A cookie is a high-density food. It contains lots of sugar and fat, so it is lots of calories in a small package. One or two bites and you've taken in 50 or 100 calories. A banana, on the other hand, is low-density. It takes many bites to eat a banana, but you take in only 100 calories. Here's a good mental exercise that helps you understand the point: Most people would not find it hard to eat a dozen Oreo-type cookies. Or a dozen SnackWell's cookies. That's 600 calories. Now imagine trying to eat six bananas at one sitting -- you would explode! But it's the same number of calories. Look for low-density foods like bananas that fill you up without giving you that many calories. Foods that are low-density include: Just about any fruit or vegetable in its natural state Many non-sugared breakfast cereals, like shredded wheat Things that are high-density include any food or beverage high in sugar and/or fat. Nuts, most meats, candy, cookies, crackers, potato chips, fried anything, cola, beer, and so on are all high-density and should be avoided. Try wearing form-fitting clothes instead of sweats. The tight clothing acts as a subliminal reminder of what you are trying to accomplish. If you follow these guidelines and, through diet and , keep the number of calories you consume below the number of calories needed, you will lose fat and maintain a consistent weight. is one tool you have to control your weight because exercise is a way to increase the number of that you burn in a day. Online resources like show you how many calories different forms of exercise can burn. One way to make the most of exercise is to integrate some form of exercise into your daily routine. Here are several examples: Try to find some type of exercise that you enjoy (or at least can tolerate) and do it every day for 30 minutes, 60 minutes or more. It might be walking, riding an exercise bike while , or working out in a gym at lunch. Try to fit micro-exercises into your daily life. For example, instead of taking the , take the stairs. Park farther away from stores when you go shopping. These little things can add up. Put a set of weights at your desk and use them three or four times during the day, as you think or talk on the . Find an exercise partner. Exercise, for some people, is a lot easier if there is someone to talk to. A partner will also help make exercise a routine. Try to exercise every day. It is easier to remember to do something if you do it every day. There are dozens of myths that help to derail people. Here is a list of some of the most common so you can try to avoid them: The myth that some kinds of are different from others - A calorie is a calorie. If you consume 4,000 calories by eating 1,000 grams of white sugar or 4,000 calories by eating 444 grams of , it is still 4,000 calories. The myth that low-fat are okay or that you can eat as much as you want if it is low-fat - A product can have 0 grams of fat but still have lots of calories. Many fat-free foods replace the fat with sugar and contain just as many or more calories as a fat-containing product. The myth that any passive device, rings and bracelets or soaps or whatever, can help - There is no way to burn calories but to burn them. The myth that you can lose 54 pounds in 6 weeks - Despite what the ads say (I LOST 54 POUNDS IN 6 WEEKS WITHOUT DIETS OR EXERCISE!!! or ), you cannot lose a pound of fat unless you burn off 3,500 calories. To lose 54 pounds in 6 weeks, you would need to lose 9 pounds in 7 days, or 1.3 pounds per day. That 1.3 pounds of fat is equal to 4,500 calories, so you would have to burn off 4,500 calories per day. The only way to do that would be to eat nothing AND run a marathon every day for 42 days. That's impossible. The only way to lose that much weight that quickly is either through dehydration or amputation. The ads are lying. The myth that anything can create an ""enzyme-driven fat-burning cycle"" - All sorts of things, from nettle seeds to apple pectin, are supposed to contain enzymes that create an ENZYME-DRIVEN FAT BURNING CYCLE THAT BURNS CALORIES 24-HOURS-A-DAY!!! No. What is true is that you have to eat fewer calories than you burn in a day if you want to lose weight. You can do that by eating fewer calories than you need, or by exercising more, or both. It is true that some people burn more calories per day than others (just as some people are taller than others, some people have to use the restroom more frequently than others, some people lose their hair faster than others and so on -- people are different). You simply have to find the number of calories body burns in a day and consume fewer calories than your body needs. That's not to say it's easy -- the psychology of food and eating is very powerful. But that is what you have to do. It is a mental game, and there is no way around it. But now you know the rules of that mental game.

""2 What Are Sustainable Diets?."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. In the first session, moderated by Fergus Clydesdale, University of Massachusetts Amherst, speakers explored the complexities and necessary compromises of sustainable diets. This chapter summarizes the Session 1 presentations and the discussion that followed. Highlights of the presentations are provided in . Setting the stage for presentations to follow, Adam Drewnowski, University of Washington, Seattle, emphasized the multiple dimensions and interdisciplinary nature of sustainability. He called attention to two documents. He first described the 2005 Giessen declaration, which articulated the concepts of personal, population, and planetary health. He remarked that this was the first time he had seen mention of “personal, population, and planetary health” in a nutrition journal. The declaration, which, he asserted, should have received a wider audience, stated that the new nutrition science ought to encompass social, economic, and environmental as well as biological dimensions, and that the study of integrated food systems should serve as the basis for food and nutrition policies (). The document was signed by a number of prominent nutrition experts, he added, with the intent of embracing other sciences and clearing the way for a more interdisciplinary approach to nutrition. Drewnowski then called attention to the 2012 Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) report (). It was from this report ""2 What Are Sustainable Diets?."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. The Food and Agriculture Organization’s (FAO’s) definition of a sustainable diet consists of four dimensions: (1) nutrition and health, (2) economic, (3) social and cultural, and (4) environmental. Sustainable diets not only have low environmental impact but also are healthy, affordable, and acceptable to society. (Drewnowski) Because of these multiple dimensions, sustainable diets encompass inherent tensions and contradictions. (Drewnowski) The trade-offs and compromises required as a result of these tensions and contradictions are context-specific. They vary regionally and among countries, but also among neighborhoods. (Drewnowski) The development of models that can be used to predict future impacts of diet requires thinking about food systems, not just individual foods, and integrating data and metrics from multiple sources. (Drewnowksi) Sustainability in the context of diet is not a new issue. The challenge is how to turn today’s more complex, nuanced definition of sustainability into a feasible reality. (Fanzo) The challenge is particularly difficult for those living in low- and middle-income contexts and in countries where tremendous inequalities force policy makers to make difficult decisions about what to prioritize. (Fanzo) Much of the challenge stems from the rapid demographic transition under way worldwide, with increasing wealth, urbanization, and other factors driving a growing demand for meat. (Fanzo) Policy making is a messy, unpredictable process. To better integrate sustainability issues into policies relevant to diets and nutrition, scientists need to engage with the policy process as it exists. (Fanzo) A key challenge stemming from the multisectoral nature of sustainable diets is communication among the sectors. (Wilde) Food prices are a form of communication. They are like the aperture on a camera: a price may seem like a small hole, but in fact, a great deal of information passes through it, including information about sustainability. (Wilde) Conversations about sustainable diets play out differently in low-priced versus high-priced environments. For example, decisions about holding land aside from agricultural production are easier to make in a low-priced environment, whereas the economic incentive to prevent food waste is stronger in a high-priced environment. (Wilde) Because of the fluctuating nature of food prices, a goal should be to focus on pursuing a sustainable-diet strategy that encompasses both abundance (low prices) and scarcity (high prices). (Wilde) These points were made by the individual workshop speakers identified above. They are not intended to reflect a consensus among workshop speakers. ""2 What Are Sustainable Diets?."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. that he, as well as several other workshop speakers, drew their definition of sustainable diets (see ). The Four Dimensions of Sustainability: Tensions and Contradictions, Trade-Offs, and Compromises According to Drewnowski, the FAO definition of sustainable diets has four dimensions: (1) nutrition and health, (2) economic, (3) social and cultural, and (4) environmental. He emphasized that sustainable diets not only have low environmental impact but also are healthy, affordable, and acceptable to society. In his experience, when people talk about sustainable diets, they are often talking only about the impact of diets on the environment, and he stressed the importance of including all four dimensions in such discussions. “Diets are not healthy sustainable,” he said. “They are sustainable only if they are healthy to begin with.” In addition, though often missing from the discussion, are the economic and social dimensions. Drewnowski went on to assert that the dimensions of sustainability lead to inherent tensions and contradictions. For example, he elaborated, some energy-dense foods cost less per calorie and may have a lower impact on the environment relative to other, more nutritious foods, but also have low nutrient density. An extreme case is sugar. “If you want a plant food with the lowest land cost, lowest water use, and lowest greenhouse gas emissions,” Drewnowski observed, “look no further than sugar.” Drewnowski explained that the trade-offs and compromises necessitated by these inherent tensions and contradictions call for a focus on food systems rather than individual foods. He added that all of the various connections along the food system path lead from production to consumption to waste and disposal (; ; ). He emphasized that optimization of all of the different considerations “Sustainable diets are those diets with low environmental impacts which contribute to food and nutrition security and to healthy life for present and future generations. Sustainable diets are protective and respectful of biodiversity and ecosystems, culturally acceptable, accessible, economically fair and affordable; nutritionally adequate, safe and healthy; while optimizing natural and human resources.” SOURCE: (as presented by Adam Drewnowski). ""2 What Are Sustainable Diets?."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. that arise is context dependent as the trade-offs are not necessarily the same for all countries or regions, or even for all neighborhoods. According to Drewnowski, modeling sustainable food systems and predicting and optimizing all of the various considerations involved requires gathering and integrating data from multiple sources, both private and public. He remarked that one of the intents of this workshop was to bring together experts familiar with these types of models and data sources. He noted, too, that this modeling is a two-way street: existing diets can affect the climate, which in turn can affect future diets. Because diets can be either the cause or the outcome, he observed, “to some extent, existing diets are paving the way for future diets.” Drewnowski went on to explain that each of the four dimensions, or domains, of sustainable diets relies on a different set of measures and metrics. He then described some of these metrics. When assessing nutrition, two key measures Drewnowski uses in his own work are energy density (dietary energy per unit weight) and nutrient density (nutrients per reference amount). He remarked that the concept of nutrient density can be complex, and different ways of measuring the nutrient density of foods (e.g., using nutrients per calories or nutrients per unit weight for nutrient profiling) have been the subject of recent discussions. He explained that nutrient profiling is a technique for rating individual foods based on their nutrient content or ratio of nutrients to calories. Without going into detail, he mentioned the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) guidelines for nutrient profiling and noted a current trend toward what he termed “hybrid nutrient profiling,” whereby not just nutrients but also healthy food ingredients can contribute to an overall nutrient density score (). In his opinion, measuring nutrient density in terms of nutrients per 100 kilocalories (kcal) is arguably more useful than measuring nutrients per 100 grams (g) or per serving. The former approach, he elaborated, allows for direct comparisons of affordability, generally measured as calories, or nutrients per unit cost. He added that measuring cost per calories makes it possible to see, for example, that energy-dense foods (fats, sugars, and grains) often have lower nutrient densities compared with vegetables and fruit (see ). He noted that energy-dense sweets and fats tend to cost less per calorie and may have a lower environmental footprint, but they also tend to be nutrient-poor. He noted that not only have energy-dense foods become dominant in the food ""2 What Are Sustainable Diets?."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. supply, but research suggests that high energy density promotes overeating and leads to overweight. Drewnowski also pointed out that many energy-dense foods are plant foods. “We actually overconsume plant foods,” he said, which include vegetable oils, sugars, and high-fructose corn syrup, adding that less energy-dense plant foods may be more satiating at fewer calories, but are also considerably more expensive in terms of per calorie monetary cost. Drewnowski went on to observe that the finding that nutrient-dense foods typically cost more (see ) has been noted not just in the United States, but also in France and Mexico. He suspects that the same is true in low- and middle-income countries as well. According to Drewnowski, more nutrient-dense foods and more nutrient-dense diets also typically entail higher carbon costs. He remarked ""2 What Are Sustainable Diets?."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. that carbon cost is often calculated per 100 g or per kilogram of food with little attention to what the food actually is, and stated that he prefers to measure carbon cost from the standpoint of calories. Given that an individual needs 2,000 calories or a certain amount of protein per day, for example, one can then ask about the environmental cost of producing those calories or grams of protein. In Drewnowski’s opinion, weight is entirely immaterial when one is comparing emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs), given that some foods are mostly water (e.g., there is actually more water per gram in spinach than in a carbonated soft drink). In contrast, he continued, comparing GHG emissions based on calories reveals a direct linear relationship between the nutrient density of foods and their carbon costs per 100 kcal (see ). “Nutrient-rich foods actually are more costly from the standpoint of energy than are candy and sugar,” he pointed out, adding that there is also a linear relationship between total dietary calories and GHG emissions. “The more calories people eat,” he said, “the more carbon energy the diets consume.” ""2 What Are Sustainable Diets?."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. In the social domain, Drewnowski called for measuring food patterns rather than individual foods or nutrients when assessing the relationship between diet and health outcomes, especially obesity. Food patterns are determined by society more so than the consumption of individual nutrients or foods, he asserted. Yet, he observed, studies in nutrition epidemiology typically link individual nutrients, foods, or dietary ingredients with health outcomes while failing to adjust for socioeconomic status, past history, culture, and other contextual factors. To illustrate this point, he described how in Seattle, a map of the consumption of soda by neighborhood showing that people living in less expensive houses near freeways consume more soda relative to people living in mansions on the waterfront costing several million dollars can be overlaid on a map of the distribution of obesity by neighborhood. The comparison reveals more obesity near the freeway than on the waterfront. Thus, Drewnowski argued, improving the healthy eating ""2 What Are Sustainable Diets?."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. index among people living in neighborhoods near the freeway “is not simply a question of getting people to switch from one food to another … it is all about geography, education, income, and food patterns.” Ending on what he termed a provocative note, Drewnowski suggested that researchers studying obesity replace their focus on individual dietary components with a focus on food patterns. He pointed to different studies on obesity, both by the same researchers and both published in the same journal but several years apart, with one implicating dietary fat () and the other high-fructose corn syrup (). “I think that we need a paradigm shift,” he argued. In closing, Drewnowski called for multiple types of input data, assessments of the costs and benefits of alternative diets, estimates of likely regional compromises and trade-offs, and models that are sensitive to prices and social concerns. Finally, he emphasized the collective nature of the endeavor to achieve sustainable diets and urged the engagement of academia, governments, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and the food industry. IMPLICATIONS AND RELEVANCE OF SUSTAINABLE DIETS INTERNATIONALLY: IT’S ALL ABOUT THE CONTEXT Building on Drewnowski’s presentation while also placing evidence on sustainable diets in a political context, Jessica Fanzo, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland, began by talking briefly about what she described as the “long, tangled history” of discussions around sustainable diets. Today, she noted, sustainable diets are being discussed in global reports, such as the 2016 report of the Global Panel on Agriculture and Food Systems for Nutrition, Food Systems and Diets: Facing the Challenges of the 21st Century (); the (); and the 2017 report of the Committee on World Food Security, (). But, she observed, the topic is not new: “It comes in and out of fashion,” she said. She mentioned Joan Dye Gussow’s work on ecological nutrition in the 1970s and Gussow’s book Chicken Little, Tomato Sauce, and Agriculture: Who Will Produce Tomorrow’s Food? (). She agreed with Drewnowski, however, that past discussions centered mainly on the environment and human health, with little consideration of economic, sociocultural, and other factors that are recognized today as being so important to sustainable diets. ""2 What Are Sustainable Diets?."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. Turning the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Definition of Sustainable Diets into a Feasible Reality Fanzo characterized the goal of turning the 2012 FAO definition of sustainable diets (see ) into a feasible reality as a “real challenge,” particularly for those living in low- and middle-income countries and in contexts where tremendous inequalities force policy makers to make difficult decisions about trade-offs. Consumers, too, must navigate sustainable diets, she added. Currently, she observed, it is difficult to understand what foods are and are not sustainable, and what to believe and not believe about what is written about food and diets in the media. She added that consumers also must consider taste, preference, convenience, practicality, and affordability to fulfill their own demands and desires. The private sector, in turn, must answer to those demands while ensuring that there is a market for its products and that consumers have economic incentives to buy them. In sum, Fanzo said, many stakeholders must be considered when determining how to turn the definition of sustainable diets into a reality. Sustainable Diets in Low- Versus Middle-Versus High-Income Countries Fanzo went on to state that in some low-income contexts, where populations cannot necessarily afford animal-sourced foods, many of the diets consumed are plant-based and could be considered quite sustainable in the way they are grown and processed. She pointed to a working paper by the World Resources Institute showing global differences in daily protein consumption (based on supply chain data). According to that paper, daily per capita protein consumption is lowest in India and highest in Brazil, followed by the United States and Canada (). As urbanization and economic growth progress, Fanzo observed, meat consumption is rising, with some exceptions. The question then arises of whether the plant-based diets consumed in many low-income contexts are sustainable, Fanzo continued, and whether they are fulfilling the nutritional needs of those communities. Animal-sourced foods are important for growth, she noted, particularly for young children. She characterized as controversial the conclusion in a recently published paper in that in sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in west Africa, people are eating among the healthiest diets in the world (), given that malnutrition burdens (stunting, micronutrient deficiencies) remain high in that region. She added that, based on an analysis of 2016 UNICEF global data, children aged 6 to 23 months worldwide are eating one type of animal-sourced food per day or none at all. In many places, she reported, even if young children are eating a ""2 What Are Sustainable Diets?."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019.

Iron and zinc, she emphasized, are critical micronutrients for cognition and growth. Regarding climate change, Fanzo observed, an additional challenge for low-income countries is that they are affected by the dietary decisions of those living in higher-income countries. “Our choices about what we consume will impact those people who have the inability to adapt and deal with climate change,” she said. “Our choices matter.” Global Transitions and Transformations: The Growing Demand for Meat Expanding on the observations summarized above, Fanzo explained that the world is undergoing rapid demographic, epidemiologic, and nutrition transitions: urbanization is expanding, with people moving from rural, subsistence-agriculture landscapes into urban centers; people have more disposable income; physical activity is changing; the food system is becoming increasingly global; and health outcomes also are changing, as seen in rising rates of obesity and diet-related noncommunicable diseases. Although approximately 1 billion people go to bed hungry every night, while another billion are purposely exercising and consuming a healthy diet, most of the world—about 5 billion people—is in a state of rapid transition, including rapid shifts in diet (; ; ). Fanzo herself spends a great deal of time in Myanmar, where, she said, the “hippest” restaurant at present is KFC. Why? “It taps into desire,” she explained, recalling queues five blocks long to get into a KFC in Yangon. Of this growing demand for meat, she said, “I cannot emphasize that enough,” adding that it is not just the demand for meat that is growing worldwide (see ), but also the demand for animal feed. “This whole system needs to be rethought,” she argued, stating that those 5 billion people are less able to access what would be considered a healthy, sustainable diet today than they were in the past. Dietary guidelines are almost always a mismatch with what agricultural systems and the food supply can bear, Fanzo continued, because food-based dietary guidelines are often developed without the involvement of agronomists and environmental scientists. To illustrate this point, she cited work by Steven Wiggins at the Overseas Development Institute (ODI) who has demonstrated that if everyone followed the U.S. (DGA), the world’s dairy supply would be outstripped (). Other research has shown that agriculture systems are ""2 What Are Sustainable Diets?."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019.

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. becoming more homogeneous, she added, with fewer crop species responding to a growing demand (). Again, she urged greater thought as to what agriculture can deliver toward the achievement of nutritional goals. She stressed that policy makers are constantly dealing with these trade-offs, citing environmental, health, and economic trade-offs involved with such commodities as palm oil, olive oil, and grassfed beef, to name a few. Trade policies play a part as well, Fanzo continued. She and her colleagues, for example, recently published a study showing an increase in the number of people with micronutrient deficiencies in the absence of trade (). “There are always these trade-offs that we have to consider,” she reiterated. Fanzo agreed with Drewnowski that there are clear gaps in scientists’ understanding of what constitutes a sustainable diet for different populations and how sustainable diets in different contexts are best measured. More specifically, she called for better characterization of the key determinants of a sustainable diet and how these determinants can be measured in a spatiotemporal way, using a suite of indicators such as those described by Drewnowski. In addition, she called for guidance on what a sustainable diet would mean economically for all actors in the food value chain, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. For example, if industry is being asked to become more sustainable, what does that mean for this sector economically? Finally, Fanzo called for policy analysis to better integrate sustainability issues into policies relevant to diets and nutrition and to create what she described as “policy coherence.” She mentioned a recent study in which she and her colleagues examined a suite of indicators and then plotted them on different countries to create “dashboards” (). But, she asked, would a policy maker sitting at his desk in Senegal and looking at this dashboard diagram know what to do with it? “Probably not,” she said, acknowledging that she was critiquing her own work, and explaining that policy makers are thinking more about value chains and how to “get food from A to B to C” (). The question for them, she elaborated, is how to inject sustainability into a value chain. Thus, instead of handing policy makers a suite of indicators or a dashboard and telling them to look at the data, she stressed, “we need to start thinking like policy makers and understanding what they need to make an informed, evidencebased decision.” In another recent study, Fanzo and colleagues examined three different national strategies in Nepal: the Multi-Sectoral Nutrition Plan, the National ""2 What Are Sustainable Diets?."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan, and the Agriculture Development Strategy. They systematically examined whether the three strategies captured elements of sustainability across a range of themes, including environmental, sociocultural, economic, and nutritional. Their results showed that the Agriculture Development Strategy included the most sustainability elements, and the Multi-Sectoral Nutrition Plan the least (). “What does this say?” Fanzo asked. “We need to get the global nutrition community thinking about sustainability,” she suggested. Agriculture thinks about it more, she said, because it is their “bread and butter.” Coming to Grips with Evidence-Based Policy Realities While the hope is that all policy making is rooted in solid evidence, Fanzo continued, in reality there is no policy-making cycle in which to inject evidence at the point of decision making (; ; ). The policy-making cycle typically involves an assessment, then a budget, then implementation, followed by monitoring and readjustment, she elaborated, describing policy making as a messy, unpredictable, complex process. Evidence may resonate, or it may not, she explained. When policy makers are making decisions, she observed, they do look at evidence, but they also use judgment; gather information from lobbying groups; and consider their country’s habits, traditions, and values. Thus, while evidence-based policy may be improving, policy is still also opinion based (; ). For researchers who work with evidence, Fanzo suggested, this can be a difficult reality to grasp. So while she agreed with Drewnowski that more evidence is needed, she believes researchers need to start thinking about what to do with that evidence. Policy makers do not read or , she observed, nor is writing a policy brief enough, in her experience. She spoke of the “bounded realities” within which policy makers are operating and their need to make quick decisions with limited information. In sum, she asserted, “we need to reject romantic notions that policy makers think like us, as scientists, and that there is an identified point of decision at which experts can contribute to the evidence that makes an impact.” In Fanzo’s opinion, given how the world has rallied around the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), now is an opportune time to reinvigorate the dialogue on sustainable diets. She mentioned that all United Nations (UN) Member States would be meeting in 2019 to report on where they are with respect to the SDGs and identified that meeting as an important venue for examining what has been achieved in the area of sustainable diets. In closing, Fanzo cited an article that had just been published that morning (August 1, 2018) in about how the science ""2 What Are Sustainable Diets?."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. around climate change was clear enough three decades ago that it could be laid out well for policy makers, along with solutions for how to address it (). But then, she said, concern about climate change went out of fashion. Now, she asserted, it is back in fashion. “This is my call to all of you,” she stated, “that maybe we know enough. There has been a lot published on sustainable diets. We need to be thinking about ensuring that this kind of thing does not happen again, where we knew what to do 30 years ago, and policy makers just did not act on it.” She ended by saying, “Be thinking policy.” DECISION MAKING UNDER UNCERTAINTY: SUSTAINABLE DIETS FOR CONDITIONS OF SCARCITY OR ABUNDANCE Parke Wilde, Tufts University, Boston, Massachusetts, began by asserting that the inherently multisectoral nature of sustainable diets requires engaging, in the same forum, people thinking about public health and nutrition, about the environment and climate change, about food consumers, about supply chains and food waste, about farmers and food producers, and about reducing poverty (; ). These people are not thinking the same thoughts, he observed, nor do they share the same goals. Controversy ensues, he explained, whether the topic is dietary guidelines, food labeling, carbon taxes, farm subsidies, genetically modified organisms (GMOs), agricultural conservation programs, water allocation, or something else. Thus, he argued, sustainable diets are contentious, and the question then is how these sectors can talk to each other. Wilde offered several suggestions for communication among the various sectors, beginning with workshops such as this and documents such as () and the recently released (). Eco-labels and other food labels are another forum for communication, he added, explaining that food labels not only reach greater numbers of people relative to workshops and documents, but also are valuable for linking information across different stages of the food marketing chain. But, he noted, labels have shortcomings based on a complexity that requires considering a number of different factors to ensure that consumers can make use of the labels. As another forum for communication, Wilde cited the production standard checklists (e.g., standards for safety or ecology) that are negotiated between agricultural producers and input suppliers on the one hand and food retailers, buyers, or the intermediaries who represent them on the other. Although less visible than labels to the public, these checklists are contentious, highly negotiated documents specifying what the standards of production should be. ""2 What Are Sustainable Diets?."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. Wilde then turned to a final forum for cross-sector communication—prices. It is widely thought that prices are too thin a signal to be useful for this purpose, he remarked. However, he observed, economists think of them as highly robust signals of what is going on in different parts of the economy. He likened food prices to the aperture on a camera: it seems like a small hole, but in fact, a great deal of information passes through it. He asserted that food prices reveal much information about sustainable diets, such as what the demand is for different products under different conditions and what revenue farm owners and operators receive, how much farm laborers earn, how much healthy food costs for consumers, and what the big picture looks like with respect to scarcity and abundance. For the remainder of his talk, Wilde focused on the latter. More specifically, Wilde described as the thesis of his talk that “conversations about sustainable diets play out differently in low-priced environments [abundance] and in high-priced environments [scarcity]. We need to be braced for both.” For example, when food prices are low, conversations and public policy making around land conservation, such as whether to hold land aside from agricultural production, are easier to conduct than is the case in a high-priced food environment. As examples of such conversations, Wilde cited decisions that need to be made with respect to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA’s) Conservation Reserve Program or, in Malaysia, about palm oil, mentioned earlier by Fanzo. On the other hand, he observed, some conversations are easier when food prices are high, including conversations about livelihoods for farmers, economic incentives to reduce food waste, and investments in alternatives to traditional meat products. The Economics of Sustainable Diets: How Cost Is Passed Down the Market Chain Wilde argued that if economics are part of a sustainable diet, with all stakeholders earning a reasonable livelihood, it is essential to understand how cost can be passed down the marketing chain. A photograph that he took of a Coalition of Immokalee Workers (CIW) rally for better wages in March 2018 showed dozens of protestors on a street, all wearing coats; some wearing winter caps; and many holding signs, including two people holding a banner reading “Fighting for Fair Food! Luchando por Comida Justa!” The question, he said, is not why these people are rallying for better wages or a better piece rate on the tomatoes they harvest—“That stands to reason,” he said—but why they are wearing winter coats and why they are rallying in New York City in March rather than in Florida. The answer, he ""2 What Are Sustainable Diets?."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. said, is prices. He explained that tomato growers in Florida are in a competitive business in which they can claim, with complete credibility, that it is very difficult for them to agree to higher wages because competitive pressures prevent them from passing that cost down the food marketing chain. In contrast, he noted, the large companies that use tomatoes in fast food or retail chains are better able to absorb a higher wage. In this example, in Wilde’s opinion, CIW’s decision to focus on downstream buyers was a “very clever, wise, astute decision.” Over the past six decades, food prices have risen and fallen, Wilde continued. The oil price crisis in the 1970s, he observed, along with weather and other production problems during that period, led to a sharp price spike. More recently, prices spiked again in 2008 and 2011. Focusing on the past 30 years, Wilde described an initial long period of productivity growth in agriculture and trade that was associated with a fairly low price environment (from 1990 through the early 2000s) (see ). “People forgot to worry any longer about scarcity,” he said. Two things then occurred as a result of changes in the agricultural economy, including increased use of food stocks for biofuels (in the early 2000s), which essentially removed those stocks from the human food supply. First, Wilde elaborated, prices started rising; second, prices fluctuated chaotically. ""2 What Are Sustainable Diets?."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. He explained that changes in abundance from one year to the next are smoothed out as long as there is enough agricultural stock in the system. But without enough agricultural stock in the system, after several years in a row of low harvest and high demand, the stocks continue to decrease until they hit a point when they can no longer adjust smoothly from year to year, causing sudden price spikes. This, Wilde added, is what occurred in 2008 and 2011 (). He recounted how both of those price spikes were associated with riots in developing country capitals and a great deal of fear around the world. After such price spikes, he continued, when prices fall again, as they did in the mid-2010s, people again start worrying about overproduction, excessive abundance, low prices, and how difficult it is for farmers to earn adequate livelihoods. Wilde cautioned, “We need to be worried about both types of conditions: high prices and low prices.” Wilde went on to note that USDA produces official projections of the future of food prices and other agricultural variables under certain assumptions. The projections for key row crops (soybeans, wheat, corn) through 2027, he reported, are neither as low as prices were in the 1990s or 2000s nor as high as the price spikes of 2008 and 2011. Nor do USDA’s projected prices fluctuate as they have in the past decade. Similarly, Wilde continued, projected livestock prices through 2027, including those for beef cattle, broilers, and hogs, are somewhere in the middle. He explained that meat prices depend a great deal on how much is consumed, and while chicken consumption in the United States has been rising significantly in recent decades, USDA is forecasting a modulation of this increase. He added that consumption of both beef and pork has been declining somewhat and is expected to hold steady (). In sum, he said, USDA is not predicting any radical change in where Americans get their protein, but is expecting more of the same. “That might or might not be the case,” he observed. Of the USDA price projections in general, Wilde said, “Not everybody agrees with this reasonably rosy view.” He cited several assumptions underlying the projections. The first is mid-range economic growth in the United States (2.1 percent) and fairly good economic growth in developing countries (3.7–4.6 percent). Another assumption is moderate population growth (<1 percent globally, 1.1 percent in developing countries), which Wilde said is to be expected only if developing countries experience no economic collapse, women and girls continue to be educated at higher rates, and other social changes proceed well. As yet another assumption, Wilde cited moderate increases in energy prices (up to $80/barrel of oil), which he cautioned does not account for how climate change may impact ""2 What Are Sustainable Diets?."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. the status quo. He noted that the USDA document containing these projections mentions neither climate nor warming, and it mentions drought only once, in an explanation of how future events and assumption variables are not certain. Additional assumptions, he reported, are no change in agricultural policy, although farm payments may rise; an initial increase in use of biofuels, but then a fallback; and current trade agreements remaining in place (). Wilde recounted how he reviewed a 2015 book, , by Joel Bourne, Jr., which tells of the author’s visits to farms in the Ukraine, places where fish are harvested in the middle of the Pacific, and elsewhere (). As a result of these trips, Wilde said, Bourne became very concerned about the future of abundance. In his book, the economist Malthus is a major figure. At the end of the book, the writer describes his trip to Bath Abbey in the United Kingdom to look for Malthus’s gravesite. But he could not find it, Wilde said, and discovered later that the grave is hidden under the abbey’s pews. The lesson, Wilde quipped, is that Malthus is “not yet ready to be resurrected.” He warned, again, that while it is important to think about the possibility of price rises, it is also important to think about the possibility of overproduction and low prices that will threaten farmers’ livelihoods. People need to focus not just on wishing for low prices, Wilde concluded, but also on the fundamental goals one hopes to achieve through low prices—namely environmental quality, healthy eating, a thriving economy, and low hunger and poverty. “Let prices be prices,” he urged. “Let them do what they do well,” which is to clear demand and supply quantities. He called for pursuing a sustainable diet strategy that does not assume just one future, but accounts for conditions of both scarcity and abundance. Following Wilde’s presentation, he, Drewnowski, and Fanzo participated in an open question-and-answer period with the audience, summarized here. Earlier in the session, while introducing the speakers, Clydesdale had mentioned Sylvia Rowe’s singling out of the banana as an exemplar of the challenges to achieving a sustainable diet (see ). He had suggested that GMO technology may be the only way to deal with some of ""2 What Are Sustainable Diets?."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. the sustainability issues related to the banana supply chain, raising both technological and social challenges. At the end of the session, he noted that there had been very little mention of technology during the presentations. He asked about the role of technology in what he described as “communities of plenty” versus “communities without plenty.” He was curious about the role of technology in production, but also postharvest. In response, Wilde commented on the importance of productivity growth and its major role in the low price environment of the 1990s and 2000s, even in the face of the opposition to GMOs and other new technologies. He said he suspects that some of this opposition will ease over the next few years as products come to market for the first time that are more visibly useful from a consumer perspective. Fanzo agreed with Wilde that there is a role for technology in the agriculture sector and added that there is also a role for technology in shopping for and purchasing food. In China, for example, many 18- to 25-year-olds use an app on their smartphone to buy their food, which is delivered to their house cooked and ready to eat (). Even in the United States—in Seattle, for instance—Amazon is using “walk-in, walk-out” technology, much like that of driverless cars, in its new grocery stores. Instead of purchasing their food in checkout lines in which they engage with actual people, Fanzo elaborated, consumers take the foods they want to purchase off the shelves and walk out of the store without pulling out a credit card or money or even scanning the products. Purchases are all tracked through the consumer’s phone. This technology raises “huge sustainability issues,” Fanzo argued, including employment issues and issues around waste from prepackaged foods. Drewnowski also agreed with Wilde that technology plays major roles in production, either by increasing yields or through fortification, but cautioned that more production does not necessarily lead to greater food security and public health. “There are all kinds of steps in between,” he said. For example, he noted, more rice production does not solve the malnutrition problem in Southeast Asia. From a consumption perspective, he views technology as playing a role in helping to ensure a nutrient-rich diet for everyone, either through the reformulation of processed foods or perhaps through the fortification or biofortification of foods. Finally, Clydesdale observed that technology has a role in dealing with waste as well. There was some discussion in response to Fanzo’s description of the way policy makers make decisions. Barbara Schneeman, University of California, Davis, expressed appreciation for Fanzo’s description of that ""2 What Are Sustainable Diets?."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. process and agreed that scientists need to think about how they fit into this paradigm. In her experience, science is necessary, but not sufficient; economic and legal elements are needed as well to create the political will to take meaningful action. Denise Eblen, USDA, remarked that she always worries when someone says the science exists, and the challenge is to translate that science into policies. She mentioned how, in her past work at the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, increased production of food always drew greater interest than food safety or nutrition and was viewed as the biggest “bang for the buck.” She asked how she, as a policy maker, can persuade other policy makers that it is not enough to produce food; rather, food must also be available, socially acceptable, and so on so that in 20 years, she is not looking back and thinking, “If only we had done that back then.” Drewnowski saw a connection to prices. There was a time when eating more calories meant getting more nutrients, he observed, but that time has passed, and today, people can eat extra calories without getting more nutrients, particularly if they are eating cheap foods. The connection between calories and nutrients is completely price-dependent now, he added. He encouraged USDA to update and revise the National Food Prices Database, noting that its last revision was in 2004. Having an updated database would be extremely helpful, in his opinion, as it would allow researchers to examine what it costs to have a healthy diet. Wilde reframed Eblen’s question: How does one communicate effectively and persuasively to policy makers and diverse constituencies to get them to understand the range of considerations that affect the same issues? “I have been stumped by that one so long,” he said, “and have absolutely no answer.” Fanzo stressed, as she had during her presentation, that while much remains to be learned about sustainable diets, time is limited with respect to climate change. “We need to act now,” she said. “We need to think about the evidence we have now.” With respect to the trade-offs and compromises entailed in sustainable diets, Schneeman asked, “If I can’t have it all, what do I have to give up?” Drewnowski replied that the role of modeling is to reveal the necessary compromises, or what the “sweet spot” is. He suggested that it is probably context dependent, with the right diet for one population being different from the right diet elsewhere. He mentioned recently having been in Southeast Asia as part of a study on nutrition transition and observing that people’s choice of meat protein is highly dependent on culture, religion, and geography. He related that in one focus group, a man from Sulawesi, ""2 What Are Sustainable Diets?."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. Indonesia, said his family had been eating rice and fish for the past 30 years. To some people, that sounds like sushi, Drewnowski said, and they might think it was wonderful. But then the man’s eyes started tearing up, and he said that he wanted to be able to give his family something that he could not afford, like chicken. “Aspirations and desires are very different,” Drewnowski said. “We should not take them for granted.” From the perspective of a policy maker, for whom “it is all about making it to the next election cycle,” Fanzo suggested that the “sweet spot” is short-term things they know will resonate with the people they prioritize. The question then is whether climate change is “one of those things that resonates? Is it visceral enough for people?” On the other hand, Schneeman pointed out that not all policy makers are elected officials; many are career staff. If one believes that 40 percent of food is being wasted, Food Forum member Erik Olson, Natural Resources Defense Council, asked, “How is that issue being addressed in discussions on sustainable diets?” He commented on the enormous amount of wasted resources, such as cost, energy, and water, as well as emitted GHGs, embedded in all of that wasted food, and wondered why that had not been a prominent part of the session’s discussion. Wilde replied that he suspected that the 40 percent figure, as large as it is, refers to total food waste in the system. The more interesting figure for him is the estimate of economically recoverable food waste, that is, the amount of economically recoverable food that actually could be added back to the food supply. This amount changes, he said, depending on what is being used to save that food and on prices. He urged everyone to always read the “smaller number” (i.e., the amount of economically recoverable waste) in any report on food waste. While Olson said he was pleased that GHG costs are beginning to be integrated into conversations on the cost of food, as discussed by Drewnowski, he wonders how human health costs and other externalities besides GHG emissions are being addressed. For example, what about the costs to humanity of the obesity crisis? He asked whether there were any efforts to consider these other costs. Drewnowski pointed out that the impact of diet on health would be addressed later in the workshop and that it is very much part of the modeling efforts around sustainable diets. With respect to other environmental ""2 What Are Sustainable Diets?."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. costs besides that of carbon, he explained that it is difficult to obtain data on other aspects of the environment. Moreover, what data do exist often are region-specific. For example, data on water use from the Netherlands do not necessarily apply to southern California, and data on pasture in Switzerland do not necessarily apply to Australia. But Drewnowski agreed with Olson that other costs need to be considered. He called for a model that looks at the hidden costs of cheap diets in particular, while also noting that such costs cannot be separated from low wages, employment, and migration. Health is very much an outcome of food, he argued, but it cannot be linked entirely to the food choices people make. He underscored the importance of also looking at what drives food choices in the first place and referred again to the sharp social gradient of the obesity epidemic. For food companies to sell a more sustainable product, that product must be culturally relevant, Katya Hantel, Conagra Brands, remarked. “We have to attract consumers,” she stressed. She added that in this regard, cultural relevance appears to be the most malleable criterion, especially in the current age of global connectivity. She pointed to insect flour as an example. In the United States, consumers can now purchase a protein bar that is made of insect flour, representing a shift in cultural appropriateness. She asked to what extent one can rely on what is culturally appropriate today, given such shifts. She also asked about the role of trying to shift what is culturally appropriate to encourage more sustainable diets. Fanzo agreed that not only do trends shift, but different cultures tap into different trends. For example, she noted, today in the United States, sustainability is a trend, while in England, veganism is on the rise. She added that in many low- and middle-income contexts, what people tap into is more about achieving a better lifestyle and aspiring to become something, and food is a big part of that aspiration. She relayed what she had heard recently from someone in advertising: that people do not buy food because it is healthy or environmentally sustainable; rather, they buy food based on hope. “Why do we have Beyoncé advertising Pepsi?” Fanzo asked, replying because it taps into that desirability, that hope. In Kenya, she observed, fast food is not something people eat in their shambas—it is something they aspire to. “It is urban. It is modern. It is clean. It is safe,” she said. In her opinion, that is what is driving cultural shifts. The Effect of Greenhouse Gases on Nutrient Density Maha Tahiri, former food industry executive, asked whether the effect of the current environment, specifically GHG emissions, on the nutrient ""2 What Are Sustainable Diets?."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. density of food has been factored into the model Drewnowski had discussed (see ). Drewnowski replied that, although he had not factored this effect into that work, he had found in a recent study that GHG emissions, specifically CO emissions under controlled conditions, reduced the nutrient content of rice (). He agreed with Tahiri that the current environment will have an impact on the future nutrient density of foods. ""2 What Are Sustainable Diets?.""

Speakers explored how food systems are innovating and finding new ways to address sustainability, some of which have already been implemented, Houston remarked, while others are on the horizon. This chapter summarizes the presentations and discussion that took place during this session, with highlights of the presentations provided in . Frank Mitloehner, University of California, Davis, opened the session with a glimpse of what he described as “ground zero of environmental discussions, and that is the sunny state of California.” He informed the audience that California is the leading agricultural state in the nation, producing 50 percent of all fruits and vegetables and 20 percent of all dairy (). What many people do not realize about California, he pointed out, is that about half of the state consists of marginal land—land that cannot be used to produce crops and is unusable for most other purposes as well, and thus is used largely for grazing livestock. Most agriculture in California occurs in the Central Valley, he noted, a place with significant environmental issues as well. He added that Fresno is not only the nation’s leading agricultural county but also the one with the worst air quality (). To curb the impact not just of livestock but ""5 Innovation in Food Production and Distribution to Reduce Environmental Footprint."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. Improving production efficiency: implications for sustainability Because the intensity of livestock production and that of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are inversely related, livestock production has very different environmental impacts in different parts of the world. (Mitloehner) New technologies leading to improved fertility, health, genetics, and animal feeds have allowed the United States and other countries to reduce their carbon footprints through more efficient livestock production. (Mitloehner) Changing consumer demand: implications for sustainability A shift from today’s U.S. diet to what is recommended in the (DGA) would have variable effects on net GHG emissions, depending on caloric intake and eating patterns (e.g., omnivore, lacto-ovo vegetarian, vegan). (Heller) If one examines individual-level (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey [NHANES] data), it is apparent that a significant reduction in GHG emissions is possible through shifts in U.S. dietary patterns. However, there are big differences between the highest and lowest emitters in terms of both calories (i.e., people whose diets contribute more to GHG emissions eat more calories) and diet composition (i.e., people whose diets contribute more to GHG emissions also eat more meat, mostly beef). (Heller) Restructuring food systems: implications for sustainability Local and regional food systems can contribute to sustainability by strengthening economic viability, improving access to healthy foods, and creating place-based opportunities to reduce environmental burdens. (Blackstone) Recycling food waste into animal feed (the “leftovers approach”) can reduce GHG emissions from regional livestock systems. (Blackstone) The retail interface between producers and consumers: implications for sustainability Food supply chains are complex, and maximizing for one outcome creates issues elsewhere. Thus, the challenges to sustainability are tremendous. Nonetheless, there are also opportunities for testing ideas and making positive changes. (Denniston) From where it sits at the interface between supply chains and consumers, Walmart has learned many lessons about ways to innovate toward sustainability. (Denniston) These points were made by the individual workshop speakers identified above. They are not intended to reflect a consensus among workshop speakers. ""5 Innovation in Food Production and Distribution to Reduce Environmental Footprint."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. of all sectors of society, California has what Mitloehner described as very aggressive regulations and among the most proactive air resources agencies. Mitloehner explained that, throughout his talk, he would be addressing several seemingly conflicting observations about livestock and climate change. The first is the claim that livestock is the predominant contributor of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions globally, producing 18 percent of all anthropogenic GHG emissions, and that livestock emits more GHGs than does transportation. Mitloehner clarified that the 18 percent figure, first reported in (), was later reduced to 14.5 percent () and that the majority of that amount is related to deforestation in developing and emerging countries. Often, he said, people will apply a global number, such as the 18 percent figure from the 2006 Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) report, to the United States to convince others to change their eating habits. In his opinion, this is a conflating of information about global and national trends that does not hold true. The statement that livestock emits more GHGs than does transportation also comes from the 2006 FAO report, a finding Mitloehner says he critiqued for using different methods to estimate emissions when the report was first issued. A life-cycle assessment (LCA) was used to estimate the emissions attributable to the livestock sector, taking into account all aspects of livestock production, whereas only direct emissions (i.e., from tailpipes) were used to estimate emissions from the transportation sector. Thus, Mitloehner elaborated, the LCA of the carbon footprint of a gallon of milk, for example, includes not just the direct emissions of the cow—belching or emissions from manure—but also emissions from the soil, herbicides and pesticides used to produce feed crops, the crops themselves, the feed produced from the crops, and so on. By contrast, he stated, the estimate of direct emissions for the transportation sector omitted production entirely (i.e., of cars, trucks, trains, planes, and ships), including the steel, rubber, plastic, and other materials used. Nor did it account for the construction of roads, airports, harbors, and so on. It was an “apples to oranges” comparison, Mitloehner said. Mitloehner uses LCA in his own work. He reported that he chaired an FAO-hosted committee known as the Livestock Environmental Assessment and Performance Partnership (LEAP), which released guidelines on how to conduct LCAs for all livestock and feed commodities (). Assembling these guidelines involved the work of about 300 of the world’s leading LCA experts. According to Mitloehner, the guidelines are now considered the gold standard for global LCAs. ""5 Innovation in Food Production and Distribution to Reduce Environmental Footprint."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. When examining GHG emissions in the United States, however, people often turn to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA’s) inventory of direct emissions, Mitloehner continued. According to 2014 EPA data, he reported, a main contributor to the U.S. GHG inventory is carbon dioxide (CO) (81 percent), which he explained is a direct result mainly of fossil fuel use; other contributors include methane (11 percent), nitrous oxide (6 percent), and fluorinated gases (3 percent). Based on these data, he stated, EPA has determined that the contributors to GHG emissions in the United States are as follows: power production (i.e., electricity), 30 percent; transportation, 26 percent; industry, 21 percent; agriculture, 9 percent; commercial, 7 percent; and residential, 6 percent. He clarified that the 9 percent figure for agriculture is for all agriculture, crops and livestock combined (). The U.S. livestock sector alone, which includes dairy, beef, sheep, pigs, and poultry, contributes about 4 percent to total U.S. GHG emissions. In California, that percentage is slightly higher, with the livestock sector—both beef and dairy—contributing 5.4 percent of total GHG emissions in the state (). In contrast, California’s transportation sector contributes 36.9 percent to the state’s total GHG emissions. Mitloehner thus asserted, “The notion that livestock rivals transportation as a greenhouse gas emitter is false, particularly here in the United States.” The Largest Food-Related Contributor to Greenhouse Gases: Food Waste? Arguably the greatest food-related contributor to GHG emissions and environmental harm overall, Mitloehner continued, is food waste. This includes not just food waste at the household level but food wasted throughout the entire food supply chain. In the United States, Mitloehner reported, 40 percent of food produced goes to waste (); globally, that figure is closer to 30 percent (). The Growing Global Population and a Rapidly Increasing Demand for Eggs, Meat, and Milk Mitloehner observed that the global population has been increasing exponentially since the mid-18th century and is expected to reach 10 billion by 2050. When he was a boy, there were 3.5 billion people on earth, compared with 7.6 billion today. “By the time I am an old man,” he said, there will be 9.5 billion people alive. In other words, over his lifetime, the human population will have tripled. “But the natural resources to feed these people will not have tripled,” he added. “If we are lucky, we will have the same amount of resources, but most likely fewer.” Today’s global population growth is happening primarily in emerging and developing countries, Mitloehner continued, not only because people ""5 Innovation in Food Production and Distribution to Reduce Environmental Footprint.""

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. are having more babies but also because life expectancies are increasing, so that cumulatively, there are more people alive. He showed a satellite image of the world with much of Southeast Asia circled and stated that there are more people living inside than outside that circle. So clearly, he noted, Southeast Asia, with an expected 41 percent increase in its population over the next 10 years, is a major food security area. But, he stressed, it is not the only one: the population in Africa is expected to increase by 50 percent over the same time period, the South American population by 7 percent, and the North American population by 4 percent, while the European population is predicted to shrink slightly (). “We have our work cut out for us with respect to finding means to feed a growing population without depleting our natural resources,” Mitloehner said. Mitloehner went on to point out that as the global population rises, so, too, does the demand for eggs, meat, and milk, particularly in developing parts of the world. He added that this growing demand is largely a function of disposable income, according to 2005 FAO data (see ), such that the higher the income, the greater the meat consumption, with the United States having the highest meat consumption per capita (kilograms [kg]/year). He predicted that, although China is on the far left of the graph in , it will be at least where the United States is today in 10 years. ""5 Innovation in Food Production and Distribution to Reduce Environmental Footprint."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. An additional “fact or fiction?” statement that Mitloehner had cited at the beginning of his presentation was that livestock occupies 70 percent of all agricultural land globally. He clarified that while two-thirds of the world’s agricultural land currently is used for livestock, particularly ruminant livestock, this is because there is no other food-producing way to use that land (). To explain, Mitloehner began by showing a map of global livestock distribution and remarked that the density of livestock in the United States (livestock units per square kilometer [km]) “pales” in comparison with that in such countries as India and China (). But even more important than global livestock distribution, he continued, is the global distribution of cropland (i.e., crops grown for food for human consumption). Regardless of the number of people in the world, he stressed, whether it is 3, 7, 9, or 12 billion, “that is the only cropland we have available.” To depict this problem in a different way, he asked everyone in the room to imagine that a normal (8.5 by 11 inch) piece of paper represented the surface of the Earth. He folded the paper twice, with the resulting quarter representing the total amount of land in the world. The rest, he said, is water and ice. Of that quarter-sized piece of 8.5 by 11 inch paper, he added, the equivalent of the size of a business card is the total amount of agricultural land, the rest being forests, deserts, cities, and so on. Then, he folded his business card such that one portion was two-thirds the size of the card and the other was one-third. The larger portion, he said, depicted the amount of agricultural land in the world that is considered “marginal.” Again, marginal land is land that cannot be used to grow crops either because the soil is not fertile or there is not enough moisture. According to Mitloehner, the only use for that marginal land is ruminant livestock (i.e., beef, dairy, goats, sheep). Thus, only one-third of all agricultural land worldwide is so-called “arable” land, where anything can be grown (within regional limits) (). To further illustrate the importance of the livestock sector with respect to the global food supply, Mitloehner added that not only is most agricultural land not arable, but half of all arable land in the world is fertilized with chemical fertilizers and the other half with organic fertilizers, which are, by and large, animal manure (). The Inverse Relationship Between Production Intensity and Intensity of Greenhouse Gas Emissions A final “fact or fiction?” statement cited by Mitloehner at the beginning of his talk was that grazing systems produce fewer GHG emissions relative to conventional animal production in confinement systems. He ""5 Innovation in Food Production and Distribution to Reduce Environmental Footprint."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. explained that cows that produce very little milk have a very large carbon footprint relative to those that produce large amounts of milk (see ). He added that this is because the amount of nutrients fed to a cow that produces very little milk (on the left side of the graph in ) is used largely to keep her alive (i.e., “maintenance requirements”), whereas the carbon footprint of a cow that produces a large amount of milk (on the right side of the graph in ) is “diluted” through the amount of milk she produces. In the United States, Mitloehner continued, about 25,000 pounds of milk is produced per cow per year, while in India and Mexico, respectively, it takes about 20 and about 5 cows to produce the same amount of milk (). He emphasized the vast differences in the cumulative environmental impact of 1 versus 5 versus 20 cows, highlighting FAO data from 2010 showing that North America is not the highest, as many think, but the lowest of any region of the world with respect to GHG emissions per unit of milk produced. He remarked that if U.S. data were to be teased out of that combined North American dataset, the difference between milk production emissions in the United States and elsewhere in the world would be starker. The same is true, he observed, with respect to emission intensities associated ""5 Innovation in Food Production and Distribution to Reduce Environmental Footprint."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. with both ruminant and nonruminant animals used for meat, with U.S. totals being lower than those in Brazil, China, the European Union, and India. According to Mitloehner, the fact that the United States has the lowest, not highest, carbon footprint in the world with respect to beef, dairy, and nonruminant meat animals per unit of product is a function of four approaches: (1) reproductive efficiency; (2) improved health, including vaccination and treatment of animals; (3) improved genetics, meaning that what he termed “high-merit” genetics are being applied to both animals and plants; and (4) the feeding of more energy-dense diets to animals (). “These four tools have allowed us to shrink animal herds to historic levels in this country,” Mitloehner continued. In 1950, he observed, there were 25 million dairy cows across the United States, whereas today there are 9 million. Yet, even with fewer cows, he explained, the United States is producing 60 percent more milk with this much smaller herd; thus, the carbon footprint of a glass of milk is two-thirds smaller today than it was 70 years ago. The same is true of beef, he added: in 1970, there were 140 million head of beef in the United States; today there are 90 million, so 50 million fewer, yet the same amount of beef is produced as in 1970 (i.e., 24 million tons). The same is true yet again of pork, he observed, with pork production in the United States having tripled over the past 60 years (). “This is a vast improvement in performance,” he said, leading to significant reductions in environmental emissions. Other Animals (Outside of Agriculture), Other Countries Mitloehner commented on the 9.5 million horses in the United States, compared with the country’s 9 million dairy cows, and the lack of discussion around their environmental footprint. Nor does anyone talk about the 160 million dogs and cats nationwide, he added, which consume the same amount of food as 70 million people (Okin, 2007). Mitloehner clarified that he did not mean to deflect from livestock’s contribution by making these statements, but simply wanted to provide additional perspective. Also to provide additional perspective, Mitloehner described the current situation with swine in China, home to half the world’s pig population and a staggering 1 billion pigs produced per year (). For Mitloehner, even more remarkable than the number of pigs produced annually is their preweaning mortality. Each year, 40 percent of China’s pig crop, or 400 million pigs, die preweaning and never make it to market. According to Mitloehner, the situation is even worse in India and in African countries because the veterinary systems are dysfunctional, genetics are poor, and the ""5 Innovation in Food Production and Distribution to Reduce Environmental Footprint."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. animals’ nutrition is insufficient. He noted that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has estimated that about 70 to 80 percent of the global emissions impact of livestock occurs in developing countries because of production inefficiencies (). In summary, Mitloehner highlighted two key points. First, livestock has very different environmental footprints throughout the world, with technologies having allowed the United States and other countries with efficient livestock production to arrive at where they are today. The state of California, for example, has mandated a 40 percent reduction in GHG emissions in the next 12 years. “It will be achieved,” Mitloehner asserted. He mentioned technologies being developed to reduce enteric emissions from animals, which constitute the major agricultural source of methane, and technologies being used to digest manure anaerobically so as to convert it into power and fuel. Second, he pointed to the inverse relationship between production intensity and emission intensity, such that the more efficient the agricultural production, the smaller is the environmental footprint. The same is true of vehicles, he observed: the more fuel-efficient a vehicle is, the less gas it burns and the fewer emissions it releases. Martin Heller, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, revisited some of what had been discussed on the first day of the workshop about the impact of diet on the environment, but with a focus on U.S., not global, trends. He described several different approaches that have been used to predict how potential shifts in the U.S. diet could reduce the environmental impacts of the food system. Heller’s starting point for thinking about the role of diet was a collection of studies comparing projections of population growth and food demand with what predictive models indicate is needed to reduce global GHG emissions and avoid dangerous climate change. According to Heller, these studies have shown repeatedly that production-side improvements will be insufficient to meet the target of a 2C rise in global temperature (; ; ; ). For example, predict that by 2050–2070, food requirements for the world’s growing population will occupy most of the available GHG emissions space if the world is to remain within ""5 Innovation in Food Production and Distribution to Reduce Environmental Footprint."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. the 2C “safe zone.” But that same space, Heller stressed, requires room for other sectors as well (energy, transportation, industry, land use changes). He noted that adding increased agricultural productivity to the model, such as what Mitloehner had discussed, or technical mitigation measures, such as manure management, would reduce the portion of the available emissions space occupied by agricultural emissions, but there still would not be enough room for the other sectors. He interpreted these findings to mean that demand-side reductions are also necessary if the world is to stay within that 2C safe zone. By demand-side reductions, he meant reduced animal-based food, specifically reduced meat and dairy consumption, and reduced food waste. As previous speakers had, he pointed to the large differences in GHG emissions between plant-based and animal-based foods. Heller noted that, while it may not always be appropriate to compare GHG emissions per weight (kilogram), doing so provides at least a scale for comparison (see for a summary of Drewnowski’s remarks on comparing GHG emissions by weight versus calories). What Would Happen If the United States Shifted to the Diet Recommended by the ? Heller next considered what would happen if the U.S. diet shifted to that recommended by the (DGA). He described how he and a colleague compared the 2010 U.S. diet, based on the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA’s) Loss-Adjusted Food Availability dataset as a proxy, with an average per capita intake of 2,534 calories, against the 2010 DGA food patterns for both 2,534 calories and 2,000 calories (which is closer to what is recommended) (). He noted, first, that while the estimated 2010 per capita caloric intake may seem excessive, it was what the data revealed; and second, that although the 2010 DGA is now outdated, the changes between it and the 2015 DGA were subtle and likely would not influence the results. The researchers found that with the current U.S. diet, GHG emissions associated with meat (beef, pork, and lamb) make up 48 percent of total diet-related GHG emissions. Beef accounts for 84 percent of that figure, so 40 percent of total diet-related GHG emissions is attributable to beef. Heller explained further that dairy contributes 20 percent of total diet-related GHG emissions, while plant-based foods contribute another 22 percent. He added that if the American diet shifted toward what is recommended, which would include increases in consumption of fruits and vegetables, seafood, and dairy (for the omnivorous DGA pattern), there would be a notable decrease in emissions associated with meat, poultry, and eggs, but also a notable increase in emissions related to dairy and slight increases in emissions attributable to fruit and vegetable consumption. The ""5 Innovation in Food Production and Distribution to Reduce Environmental Footprint."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. net effect, Heller stated, would be a 12 percent increase in GHG emissions for a 2,534-calorie diet and a 1 percent decrease for a 2,000-calorie diet (). carried their analyses through to the lacto-ovo vegetarian and vegan DGA patterns, as well as Harvard’s Healthy Eating Plate (see ). Heller explained that the latter is similar to the omnivorous DGA pattern, but with less red meat and dairy. For a 2,000-calorie diet, the researchers found that, compared with an omnivorous diet, with its 1 percent decrease in GHG emissions, a shift to a vegan diet or to either a lacto-ovo vegetarian or Harvard’s Healthy Eating Plate diet would reduce GHG emissions by 53 percent and 33 percent, respectively, compared with the current average American diet. What Heller found interesting about the latter findings is that the reduction associated with Harvard’s Healthy Eating Plate, which still contains meat, is the same as that associated with the lacto-ovo vegetarian diet, which contains no meat. Thus, he said, “we don’t need to necessarily think about all or nothing—vegetarian or bust.” “Of course,” Heller continued, “everything I’ve showed you so far looks at just the consumed portion of the food” people eat. He noted that Comparison of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions from the Current U.S. Diet Versus Various Recommended Diets, at Intake of 2,000 Calories per Day NOTE: CO = carbon dioxide; DGA = ; kg = kilogram. SOURCES: Presented by Martin Heller on August 2, 2018, modified from . The Healthy Eating Plate “is characterized by high quality grains (whole vs. refined), healthy proteins (fish, poultry, beans and nuts vs. red meat and processed meat), greater intake of poly unsaturated fatty acids (healthy oils), reduced intake of sugar-sweetened beverages, and reduced dairy” (). ""5 Innovation in Food Production and Distribution to Reduce Environmental Footprint."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. one-third of total U.S. diet-related emissions are from food waste (), an amount equivalent to the tailpipe emissions from 33 million average passenger vehicles. Heller explained that this one-third estimate does not include GHG emissions associated with disposing of food waste, only those associated with producing the wasted food. If one accounts for disposal and assumes that all food waste is disposed of in landfills, which he recognizes is not true but cited for perspective, the estimate of GHG emissions attributable to food waste would increase by another 30 percent (). Other Studies and Approaches to Examining the Environmental Impact of Dietary Shifts Heller went on to observe that other studies have taken a similar approach to using food availability data to compare GHG emissions associated with the current diet against recommended diets. As just one example, he cited the work of , who considered two additional environmental impact indicators—water use and energy use—in addition to GHG emissions. They found that a shift to a recommended food mix would increase GHG emissions by 6 percent, energy use by 28 percent, and water use by 10 percent. Heller then described the work of , who, instead of looking at GHG emissions, examined the carrying capacity of U.S. agricultural land (i.e., the number of persons that can be fed from an area of land). Like , they estimated current consumption using the USDA Loss-Adjusted Food Availability dataset as their baseline. They then combined average crop yields and livestock rations to determine how much land is required to feed the U.S. population both currently and under a range of different recommended diets. According to Heller, they found that the current carrying capacity of U.S. agricultural land is about 130 percent of the 2010 population. If the American diet shifted to the DGA-recommended omnivorous diet, that figure would increase to 136 percent of the 2010 population; if the diet shifted to 80 percent omnivorous and 20 percent lacto-ovo vegetarian, which Heller described as “a little better than Meatless Monday,” the figure would increase to 178 percent; if the diet shifted to 20 percent omnivorous and 80 percent lacto-ovo vegetarian, it would increase to 249 percent; and if all animal products were eliminated, so that the diet shifted to 100 percent vegan, it would increase to 238 percent (). In other words, Heller clarified, eliminating animal agriculture would mean less carrying capacity than having some animal agriculture. However, he pointed out, significant reductions in animal-based foods in the U.S. diet would be necessary ""5 Innovation in Food Production and Distribution to Reduce Environmental Footprint."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. before one would begin to see the positive effects of utilizing marginal lands through animal agriculture. “But all of that is looking at the U.S. diet as an average,” Heller continued. Analyzing diet at the individual level, he stated, “opens up a lot of possibilities.” One can begin linking diet, health, and environmental impacts across a population and, he pointed out, “really set the stage for some more nuanced modeling of dietary change.” He went on to describe his recent work linking GHG emissions and energy use to individual self-selected diets. Using 2005–2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data for 16,800 individuals, linked more than 7,000 as-consumed food items to their environmental impacts. They conducted an exhaustive search of the LCA literature to populate a database they called dataFIELD (database of Food Impacts on the Environment for Linking to Diets). Because most of the available LCA literature is based on food commodities, Heller and his team also relied on a Food Commodities Intake Database to represent the 7,000 as-consumed food items as compositions of roughly 300 food commodities. Finally, they linked data in dataFIELD with NHANES data to estimate diet-related GHG emissions per capita, including the contribution of both consumed food and food loss (both retail and consumer losses, using data from additional sources). They examined energy use associated with food production in a similar way. At the mean of the population, Heller reported, total GHG emissions were 4.7 kg CO-equivalent per capita per day (3.6 kg CO-equivalent per capita per day for consumed food; 0.3 kg CO-equivalent per capita per day for retail losses; 0.9 kg CO-equivalent per capita per day for consumer losses) and 2.2 kg CO-equivalent per capita per 1,000 kilocalories (kcal) (1.7 kg CO-equivalent per capita per 1,000 kcal for consumed food; 0.1 kg CO-equivalent per capita per 1,000 kcal for retail losses; 0.4 kg COequivalent per capita per 1,000 kcal for consumer losses). But again in Heller’s opinion, the really interesting conclusions from this work derive from being able to look at GHG emissions as a distribution across a population (see ). He and his research team found that when individual diets are ranked by GHG emissions and the population is divided into quintiles based on those rankings (with bottom emitters in the 1st quintile and top emitters in the 5th quintile), there is an eight-fold difference in cumulative emissions between the top and bottom emitters (see ). For Heller, that difference is striking. “We knew there ""5 Innovation in Food Production and Distribution to Reduce Environmental Footprint."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. ""5 Innovation in Food Production and Distribution to Reduce Environmental Footprint."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. was going to be variance,” he said, “but it is much greater than we were anticipating.” What is driving those differences? First, according to Heller, are notable differences in total caloric intake, with top emitters eating more calories (see ). But even when caloric intake is normalized, he observed, there remains a five-fold difference in GHG emissions between the top and bottom emitters, which suggests a difference in diet composition as well. In fact, as shown in , a much greater percentage of GHG emissions from top emitters is attributable to meat (70 percent) relative to bottom emitters (27.1 percent). The majority of meat-associated emissions by top emitters is attributable to beef (64 percent of total emissions), compared with poultry for the bottom emitters (15 percent of total emissions) (). Heller described average beef consumption as 51 grams per day—roughly the equivalent of eating a quarter pounder every other day. In contrast, individuals in the top quintile (the top emitters) consume about one-third of a pound of beef daily. If those in the upper quintile were to shift their diet to one associated with average emissions through some combination of diet composition and caloric intake reduction, Heller suggested, the environmental savings in terms of GHG emissions after 1 year would be equivalent to 44.6 million Americans driving 15 miles fewer every day, a ""5 Innovation in Food Production and Distribution to Reduce Environmental Footprint."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. reduction that could bring the United States 10 percent closer to achieving the United Nations (UN) climate targets (). In conclusion, Heller highlighted several key points. First, demand-side changes likely are needed to meet emission-reduction targets, even with some of the efficiency improvements and technological advances discussed by Mitloehner. Second, the individual-level modeling he had described points to wide discrepancies in the United States with respect to the diet-related impact on GHG emissions and offers a different lens for thinking about policy scenarios. Finally, Heller acknowledged having provided a one-sided look at environmental impacts—namely, a look at GHG emissions. He emphasized that there are other environmental indicators, such as water and land use, as well as other aspects of sustainability, that need to be considered. LOCAL AND REGIONAL FOOD SYSTEMS IN SUSTAINABLE DIETS Nicole Tichenor Blackstone, Tufts University, Boston, Massachusetts, reflected on the difference between research on sustainable diets and research on local and regional food systems, and how this difference underlies the reality that there are multiple ways to think about sustainable food systems. As an example of her work in research on sustainable diets, she mentioned an analysis in which she and her colleagues compared the environmental impacts of three different diet patterns in the most recent DGA (). She pointed out that this kind of analysis is different from the type of work that researchers who study local and regional food systems, including she herself, often do. Yet, she observed that both types of research serve as approaches to understanding sustainable diets, an idea that she traced to . identifies three different perspectives, or lenses, through which researchers think about sustainable food systems: demand restraint, efficiency-oriented, and food systems transformation. Blackstone explained that demand restraint had also been discussed by several previous speakers—that is, how diets can be shifted or how consumer behavior can be influenced to reduce the environmental, social, and economic costs of the food that is produced and consumed. She identified the second perspective, efficiency-oriented, as what Mitloehner had been getting at—that is, how technology and innovation can be used to reduce the environmental, social, and economic impacts of agriculture and related supply chains. She then turned to the third perspective, which terms food systems ""5 Innovation in Food Production and Distribution to Reduce Environmental Footprint."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. transformation. The central argument of this perspective, she explained, is that the problems, or externalities, of the food system are the result of the social and economic organization of the system, rather than being just technical problems or the result of individual decisions. Blackstone announced that the remainder of her talk would focus on the third perspective—food systems transformation—and expressed the hope that bringing this perspective to the workshop would result in the continuation of conversation around it. Specifically, she said she would focus on local and regional food systems and their economic, social, human health, and environmental contributions to sustainability. People who work in local and regional food systems consider themselves food systems transformers, she said, because they are exploring alternative ways to organize farms and supply chains. According to Blackstone, there is no single definition of a local or regional food system, but one element that runs through all the different definitions is geography. In some cases, she elaborated, this element is distance; in other cases, it is a mileage radius; and in still other cases, it is state-based. Sometimes, she observed, these systems are defined around marketing channels. Indeed, she noted, this is how USDA tracks local and regional food systems: food being sold through either direct or intermediated marketing channels. She explained that direct-to-consumer marketing includes farms selling directly to consumers in farmers’ markets, at farm stands, or through community-supported agricultural endeavors, while intermediated marketing includes farms selling to institutions, retailers, or regional distributors (“hubs”). She identified perceived attributes as yet another way of defining local and regional food systems (). She emphasized the word “perceived,” noting that many people who are highly enthusiastic about local food sometimes incorporate perceived attributes into their definition of local or regional systems regardless of whether those attributes are valid. For example, they may perceive local foods as having better quality or safety; as automatically being sourced from small-scale farms; or as being fairer, more just, or better for the environment. With respect to the difference between local and regional, Blackstone remarked that the regional level encompasses the local level, and is typically larger and more comprehensive (). She explained that she works on regional food systems in the northeastern United States that cover 12 states, extending from Maine to West Virginia. ""5 Innovation in Food Production and Distribution to Reduce Environmental Footprint."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. Blackstone observed that local and regional food systems represent a very small fraction of the overall U.S. food system—only about 8 percent of U.S. farms use direct or intermediated marketing channels, totaling about $6.1 billion (2012), a little less than 2 percent of U.S. agricultural sales (). She added that most local and regional foods are sold through intermediated channels, as opposed to direct markets, and that about half of all local and regional foods are produce, while 30 percent are animal products. How Might Local and Regional Food Systems Contribute to Sustainability? Blackstone discussed three ways in which local and regional food systems might contribute to sustainability: (1) economic viability, (2) access and health, and (3) the environment. She went on to discuss each of these in detail, but focused mainly on environmental implications. According to Blackstone, research has shown that farms working in local supply chains can have higher net revenue relative to those working in mainstream chains (). Research has also shown that farms using direct marketing channels have higher survival rates compared with those using intermediate channels (). Regarding the latter finding, Blackstone explained that farms with higher survival rates are those with positive sales over time, a notable fact given that U.S. farms have a fairly low rate of positive sales over time. Also notable, she suggested, is that found this association to obtain across scale, from very small to midscale to large farms, and for beginning farmers as well. She stressed that beginning farmers in particular are critical for sustainability in agriculture given the aging farmer population. “We need to keep folks on the land,” she declared. In her opinion, these findings are promising for creating future opportunities for farmers. Blackstone identified food hubs as another opportunity for small and midscale producers who are often locked out of mainstream (i.e., large-scale retail and global) markets because they struggle to meet quantity, quality, or consistency requirements. She defined food hubs, of which there are more than 300 in the United States, as entities that aggregate, market, and distribute source-identified food and often have a values-based mission to support small and midscale farms. She referred to the as a source of information on these entities and their ""5 Innovation in Food Production and Distribution to Reduce Environmental Footprint."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. contribution to the economic viability of these small and midscale operations (). Regarding access to healthier, plant-based foods, Blackstone remarked that there is some evidence at the national level indicating that prices for selected produce items, such as tomatoes, potatoes, and some other fruits and vegetables, may be lower at farmers’ markets than at retail outlets, including superstores (). She clarified, however, that these lower prices are only one dimension of access. Shopping at farmers’ markets requires a dedicated trip, time, and motivation. “So it’s not an end-all, be-all for access,” she said, but “there may be some price benefits.” In addition, Blackstone reported, emerging evidences suggests that local food interventions, such as farm-to-school programs and other similarly complex interventions (i.e., programs that combine multiple factors, such as gardens, nutrition education, taste tests, and food variety) can result in modest increases in fruit and vegetable consumption, as well as increased willingness to try and increased liking of different fruits and vegetables (; ). In some cases, Blackstone observed, the transportation footprint of a food is greater when the supply chain is local (; ). The reason is that local supply chains can have lower fuel efficiency per unit product; because of their larger scale, regional food systems may offer efficiency advantages (). Blackstone emphasized, however, that transportation in food miles is only a small part of the overall environmental footprint of foods. With some exceptions (e.g., air freight for some commodities), she reported, food miles contribute only about 5 percent of average weekly household food-related GHG emissions. Most household food-related GHG emissions, she elaborated, are centered around the farming and manufacturing of foods (). In the northeastern United States, Blackstone continued, not only is there a great deal of interest in local meat, but the region also has a culturally and economically significant dairy sector. She explained that the dairy sector is a multifunctional system that produces both milk and beef, and that the beef it produces has a lower overall environmental footprint ""5 Innovation in Food Production and Distribution to Reduce Environmental Footprint."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. compared with regional grass-fed beef production and uses less land than conventional beef production (). “So there are ways in which regionally specific production systems might have some environmental benefits,” she said, “depending on where you are in the region.” Yet, Blackstone pointed out, these systems rely heavily on corn-based feeds. She and her research team were struck by evidence in the animal science literature demonstrating that a high-energy feed that mimics corn can be created from plant-based retail food waste (), coupled with the large potential supply of plant-based retail food waste in the Northeast because of the large number of urban centers. They therefore wondered whether there might be a way to further improve the sustainability of these systems by using food waste as feed. Currently, Blackstone noted, policies to promote green energy or less landfilling of waste in the region are encouraging anaerobic digestion of food waste, and that policy pressure is growing. But again, she asked, what if, instead of sending that food waste to the digesters, it were used in animal feed? Would there be net benefits? So she and her team conducted an LCA of the benefits and costs of shifting food waste to feed and found that doing so would indeed reduce both GHG emissions and acidification potential (Blackstone et al., in prep). Blackstone referred to this as a “leftovers approach” because it relies both on leftovers from the dairy industry to produce beef and leftovers from human consumption and retail for animal feed. In her opinion, the recycling of food waste into feed should be a priority across the region. She called for further assessment of the feasibility of using this leftovers approach with additional species, such as pigs. “As we think about folks shifting to more sustainable diets,” Blackstone cautioned, “we need to think about where that’s going to happen.” She explained that production of fruits and vegetables in the United States is highly geographically concentrated, as Mitloehner had pointed out. She noted that California produces most of the country’s leafy greens (95 percent from Arizona and California combined), broccoli (92 percent), celery (95 percent), garlic (100 percent), processing tomatoes (94 percent), strawberries (79 percent), and grapes (89 percent) (). And because fruits and vegetables are major contributors to consumptive water use and water depletion (), increasing fruit and vegetable production in current production centers such as California would exacerbate water stress in those areas. She added that, because geographically concentrated production is increasingly vulnerable to climate change–related droughts, fires, and erratic weather patterns, concentrated production centers are likely to be less resilient in the face of these shocks. She suggested ""5 Innovation in Food Production and Distribution to Reduce Environmental Footprint."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. thinking about how local and regional food systems might be potential mechanisms for increasing fruit and vegetable production in sustainable ways, though she acknowledged that this was only a hypothesis and that much empirical work would be needed to understand its implications. Blackstone listed several questions to consider as research in the field of sustainable diets moves forward. First, how can the potential contributions of local and regional food systems be integrated into such research in meaningful ways? Blackstone suggested involving sociologists to help examine the social and cultural potential of these alternative systems. Second, what is the role of circular economies (e.g., using food waste as feed)? Going beyond the food system, how does that system intersect with other aspects of the economy, and how can more circular systems be created? Third, Blackstone urged consideration of how decentralizing production might contribute to resilience, something she believes should be studied empirically. Finally, she asked about structural issues and the underlying economic and social systems driving the externalities that exist today. In conclusion, Blackstone stressed that local and regional food systems are not the answer to all sustainability issues. In her opinion, achieving sustainable diets will require many different approaches and all scales working together—from global and large-volume distributors, to farmers’ markets, to backyard gardens. SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS: INNOVATIONS AT THE INTERSECTION OF SUPPLY CHAINS AND CONSUMERS For Karrie Denniston, Walmart, Bentonville, Arkansas, there are any number of different doors one could walk through when thinking about the role retail serves in sustainable food systems. “Should we talk about food waste? Should we talk about global policy? Should we talk about local systems?” she asked. Regardless of which door one walks through, she suggested, the issues very quickly become muddled, and “you will very quickly run into someone else walking through a different door.” The consequences of this complexity, she asserted, are that “when we maximize for one thing, we create issues somewhere else.” For example, as Blackstone had pointed out, increasing fruit and vegetable consumption creates issues of water stress. As another example, packaging food differently to extend shelf life creates plastic waste. Denniston informed the audience that the focus of her presentation would be how retail sits at a nexus amid all of these different issues, and on where Walmart enters into the conversation. ""5 Innovation in Food Production and Distribution to Reduce Environmental Footprint."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. Walmart’s Mission and the Creation of Shared Value According to Denniston, Walmart has about 11,000 stores around the globe, plus multiple e-commerce platforms. The company serves about 27 countries and 270 million customers yearly, and it sources from about 100 different countries worldwide. “So that’s an unbelievably complex system,” Denniston said. “We end up being this interface between supply chain and demand, because we see the customer as they walk through the door and we play this signaling role, sending [signals] back and forth between where supply chains are at and where customers are going.” With respect to Walmart’s mission “to save people money so that they can live better,” Denniston reflected on the fact that while some markers of global prosperity are moving in positive directions, inequality is increasing. And as consumption demand continues to increase, so will the pressure around affordability and access as more people want more things. “Price will continue to matter,” Denniston observed. She added that the growing global population is expected to exacerbate the already large impact of consumption on the environment and will raise new social issues as well. In terms of where Walmart fits into this picture for the long term, Denniston stated that it sees itself as creating shared value. “By that,” she said, “we think that doing good in the world is actually also good for business,” and without surety of supply, resources, and sustainable food systems, there would be no business. Thus, Walmart’s aspiration is to bring safe, healthy, affordable food to people in places where they need it through cold chain, logistic support, and other improvements and in a way that is regenerative to the environment and is good for both the people who eat and the people who produce the food. Denniston stressed, however, that no one business or any one sector, academic or nongovernmental organization (NGO), can do this alone; changes in infrastructure, as well as in behavior, will be required. She added that Walmart cannot focus on everything everywhere because it sources from so many countries worldwide and from so many different types of supply chains. Therefore, it prioritizes its contribution to these efforts based on where the greatest risk lies (i.e., the potential for things to go wrong), the tools at its disposal (e.g., suppliers, logistics expertise), its philanthropic tools (e.g., where it can fill a gap or scale a promising program that does not yet have market viability or government support to scale on its own), and customer feedback. The term “cold chain” refers to a temperature-controlled supply chain.

""5 Innovation in Food Production and Distribution to Reduce Environmental Footprint."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. Denniston cited seafood as a good example of how the social and environmental implications of supply chains are so inextricably linked. Think about shrimp, she suggested. Shrimp grown in aquaculture ponds need to be fed protein. That protein comes from what is known in the industry as “trash fish”—food that is fished out of the sea and lands on a boat, but has no market value because it is not a species people like to buy. It is on those boats far back in the supply chain where that fishmeal is being caught that the greatest risk of exploitation exists for workers—for example, having their passports withheld and being forced to work long hours. Denniston emphasized the relative lack of visibility that far back in the supply chain. “That’s a key issue as we think about sustainable food systems,” she stressed, “what’s happening to those folks on those boats.” But then shift the lens, she said, to the person who is captaining that boat. That captain is going to fish for a longer period of time just to get the same catch that meets his economic needs. On another boat farther up the supply chain, Denniston continued, fishing for some other species, a crew is trying to meet all the standards of sustainable certification. She described them as really wanting to “do it the right way.” So they pull up their catch and take it to port, but then the wholesaler to whom they bring it does not have enough demand to keep it separated from other catches, and their catch never makes it to market with a signal saying, “we worked hard to catch this sustainably.” Meanwhile, in a nearby village, Denniston said, imagine a farmer who has worked hard to perfect what she has been doing with her aquaculture ponds. Yet, her neighbor has not been judicious about water quality or pond runoff. Consequently, her ponds become diseased, and her harvest fails. Denniston then pointed to a family somewhere around the world that walks into a store and sees information about what seafood can provide them in terms of health, but they are worried that they are unable to afford it. The challenge, she said, is not only how to communicate healthy food messages so that people can navigate the information, but also how to provide access to that healthy food. She noted that it is because of this challenge that Walmart and the Walmart Foundation made a commitment to help provide 4 billion meals over 5 years to people in need. In summarizing her supply chain example, Denniston said, “We took a trip around the world, and all of those individuals, all of those communities, are acting completely rationally … doing what they are doing.” Yet, she stressed, the challenges they face are tremendous. At the same time, however, so, too, are the opportunities. “We can walk through any of these doors and test ideas, test tools, test innovations, and create positive ""5 Innovation in Food Production and Distribution to Reduce Environmental Footprint."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. changes,” Denniston observed. For the remainder of her presentation, she discussed some of the lessons Walmart has learned when entering these doors and encountering these issues. Denniston described six lessons learned by working across supply chains: (1) what good looks like must be defined, (2) industry collaboration is necessary to strengthen market systems, (3) transparency and data matter, (4) engage the people who are impacted by the issues, (5) economics help drive innovation, and (6) consumer engagement helps drive demand. In Denniston’s opinion, defining what good looks like is a powerful tool as it points people in the same direction toward what should be done. Dietary guidelines are an example, as is the Paris Agreement’s 2C goal. An example from the Walmart Foundation is its investment in small and medium enterprises in China to help them understand how to mitigate food safety risks. The first step toward doing that, Denniston observed, was helping them understand food safety practices: only after a shared understanding and food safety code were agreed upon could training begin. Industry Collaboration Is Necessary to Strengthen Market Systems A second lesson learned, Denniston continued, is the importance of bringing people together to drive change. She cited as an example Walmart’s work on what is called the Midwest Road Collaborative, whereby suppliers; local community leaders; and others across Illinois, Iowa, and Nebraska come together to decide collectively how to optimize fertilizer, reduce nutrient runoff, and improve water quality. She suggested that if Walmart had simply approached those same suppliers and requested that they implement sustainable practices, it would have meant nothing to them. The market signal is not strong enough for one farmer to act alone, she stressed. Rather, “it’s the collaboration that makes the difference.” “What we measure matters,” Denniston continued, since the greater is the visibility into a supply chain, the greater is the opportunity to respond. She relayed how in 2017, Walmart started piloting block chain technology as a tool for understanding food systems more rapidly. But before initiating the pilot, her staff asked a team to identify where a specific package ""5 Innovation in Food Production and Distribution to Reduce Environmental Footprint."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. of mangoes had originated—a task that took them 7 days, utilizing what she described as the “best in class” tools available. “From a food safety perspective,” she emphasized, “if there is a recall, those 7 days are significant.” After the block chain technology was piloted, she reported, the mango package test was repeated. This time, utilizing the block chain technology, it took the team only 2.2 seconds to identify a farm in Mexico as the origin of the mangoes. The lesson, Denniston said, is not that block chain technology is “the answer,” because in fact, questions remain about its scale and application, and work is still under way with suppliers on determining how to utilize the technology. Rather, she asserted, the lesson is the importance of considering ways to innovate with respect to collecting this kind of information. Denniston observed that although the fourth lesson—engage the people who are impacted by the issues—seems self-explanatory, it had been the subject of little discussion at this workshop. In fact, she included it as a lesson learned not because Walmart does this particularly well, but because the company has noticed its lack. As an example, she pointed out that the major tools Walmart uses in its efforts to combat deforestation include market signals and government responses; however, a community that may not have an economically viable alternative and that is trying to survive and feed its families does not care about market signals or government regulations. “If we don’t get to know what assets that community has as an alternative,” she stressed, “we won’t be successful.” According to Denniston, one way to articulate the fifth lesson—that economics help drive innovation—is that if there is a strong enough business case for an idea, people will figure out how to implement it. As an example, Walmart set a goal of sending zero food waste to landfills, but had no idea how to accomplish this. However, Denniston reported, food waste is expensive, so determining how to eliminate it became an economic imperative. Over the past couple of years, she noted, the company has been testing ways to reduce food waste from strawberries. Through a series of iterative experiments, it has successfully removed about a day and a half from the supply chain, extended the freshness life of the product by 2 to 3 days, and increased by 70 percent the amount of strawberries out on the floor in stores rather than sitting in warehouses. Denniston added that Walmart also invests heavily in food recovery, and in 2017 donated about 750 million pounds of food to people in need. ""5 Innovation in Food Production and Distribution to Reduce Environmental Footprint."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. In describing the sixth lesson learned—that consumer engagement helps drive demand—Denniston observed that it is difficult to create consumer demand. It is not something a retailer can decide to do, she pointed out, but it is something a retailer can signal. So, for example, when Walmart made its healthier food commitments in 2011, it not only reformulated products by reducing sugar and sodium and removing trans fats altogether, but also introduced an icon to help consumers with decision making. Specifically, Denniston recounted, the company introduced a “best if used by” date to help consumers avoid confusion regarding expiration dates that do not specify “sell by” or “use by.” She explained that the new icon is now on 92 percent of Walmart’s private-label brands in the United States. According to Denniston, this one small change has eliminated an estimated 660 million pounds of food waste, and she described this kind of tool as one with a great deal of promise. In her opinion, it is critically important that greater consideration be given to how to shift some of the signaling and deliver sustainability guidance in a more tailored, systematic way. Denniston concluded by offering three questions to consider. First, what really needs to happen? What does a sustainable food system look like? Second, why isn’t it happening? How can the people who are actually making sustainable food choices every day be engaged? What are the frictions? What are the barriers? Lastly, she asked, “What would have to be different tomorrow for us to get that system that we are looking for?” How can people be provided the tools and guidance needed to shift behavior? Following Denniston’s presentation, she, Blackstone, Heller, and Mitloehner participated in an open discussion with the audience, summarized here. Environmental Impact of Transportation: Nutrient-Dense Versus Energy-Dense Food Supply Chains Imagine a city of 20 million people, each of whom is eating a diet of 2,000 calories, Drewnowski proposed. Further suppose that the average energy density of their diets, filled with broccoli, leafy greens, baby carrots, and other vegetables, is one-half calorie per gram. That, Drewnowski said, amounts to about 80,000 to 100,000 tons of food moving through the city streets every day to be delivered to people, depending on how much is lost ""5 Innovation in Food Production and Distribution to Reduce Environmental Footprint."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. to waste. But if that same population were to switch to a diet filled with processed foods or ultra-processed foods, such as chocolate and potato chips, with an average energy density of 5 calories per gram, only about 8,000 tons of food would be moving through the city streets every day. As a result, transportation costs would be cut by one-tenth. Plus, Drewnowski added, energy-dense foods are cheaper. He asked what these observations mean in terms of how a shift toward a less energy-dense diet would play out economically in the long term. “My fear,” he said, “is that for big cities, many of them poor, there are going to be incredible economic pressures to eat energy-dense diets which are cheap but nutrient poor.” Blackstone replied by reiterating that focusing overly on food miles is unwarranted, as the associated environmental impact does not compare with the impacts of production. That said, she added, there are differences in transportation efficiency, noting that the difference in transportation impact between a fruit and vegetable supply chain and a processed food supply chain depends on how the foods are transported. If the same fruits and vegetables are being air-freighted, she pointed out, their transportation will have a much larger environmental impact—by an order of magnitude—than if they are being transported by trucks. Alternatively, if they are being transported on fully loaded trucks, the difference is not as dramatic as an order of magnitude. Comparing Greenhouse Gas Emissions: By Calories or Weight? “We don’t carry food,” Drewnowski observed. “We eat it.” Moreover, while there are no requirements for any particular weight of food to be consumed daily, there are requirements for calories (approximately 2,000) and nutrients. He asked, then, why GHG emissions are measured per kilogram of food (as Heller had done during his presentation) when examining diet and suggested that calories are a more appropriate metric. Heller explained that he and his colleagues used GHG per kilogram because the intake data they had were by weight. He considered the metric merely an avenue for linking GHG emissions and intake and agreed that it is not the best metric for comparing different foods. But in his opinion, neither is caloric content. Using calories as a metric, he argued, leads to such situations as lettuce having a greater GHG emissions impact than pork. “And that’s fairly illogical as well,” he asserted. Blackstone agreed with Drewnowski that in the context of a diet pattern, it makes sense to use a calorie comparison. In a healthy diet, she observed, one consumes a much smaller quantity of calories from fruits and vegetables relative to other foods. But like Heller, she disagreed with Drewnowski about the use of calories at the level of individual foods. “It skews,” she argued.

Consequences of China’s One-Child Versus Two-Child Policies When asked by an audience member about the environmental impact of China’s two-child policy compared with its one-child policy, Mitloehner replied that the lifting of the one-child policy in China will not make a great difference because the vast majority of families will continue to have only one child—the expense of raising a larger family is too great. He believes that, more than the number of children per family, increasing life expectancy is what is driving the population structure of China. He pointed out that the average Chinese individual lives much longer today than was the case 20 to 30 years ago, which cumulatively has had a large effect on the country’s total population density. Environmental Impact of Different Breeds of Livestock When asked by Regina Tan, USDA, whether different livestock breeds—for example, Jersey versus Holstein cows—have different environmental impacts and whether there has been any international effort to share breeding stock, Mitloehner replied that in general, yes, there are significant differences among breeds. For example, a smaller-framed Jersey is more efficient at producing milk relative to a larger-framed Holstein. He agreed about the need to trade livestock internationally to improve breeds, but cautioned that breeds also need to be adapted to local conditions. Improving the Infrastructure of Veterinary Medicine Tan also asked whether there have been international efforts to improve the infrastructure of veterinary medicine. Mitloehner replied that the veterinary infrastructure is largely underdeveloped in much of the developing world, where livestock are often infested with parasites that consume the nutrients intended for them. This is a “grave concern,” he said, because the animals are often not vaccinated or otherwise treated appropriately. He pointed out that this leads to enormous production losses, which in turn drive environmental impact. In his opinion, the question is, “Are we ready for a new green revolution?” Lurie proposed that a standard policy of the Food Forum be for all speakers to disclose their conflicts of interest, and that this policy be implemented immediately. Noting that on this panel, Denniston and Heller had been quite clear about their conflicts of interest, he asked Mitloehner and Blackstone whether they had any conflicts they would like to disclose.

Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. Mitloehner disclosed that about 98 percent of his funding comes from public sources, including EPA and the California Air Resources Board, and that the remaining 2 percent comes from companies that fund technology research on the mitigation of emissions. As an example of the latter, he mentioned pharmaceutical companies at the forefront of developing technologies that help reduce environmental footprints (e.g., feed additives that reduce GHG emissions). Blackstone disclosed that her funding comes entirely from her academic institution and an environmental leadership foundation. Are Dietary Shifts Enough to Move the Needle on Climate Change? Jackie Schulz, Kraft Heinz, Glenview, Illinois, informed the audience that she had recently attended the Institute of Food Technologists’ (IFT’s) annual meeting, where she saw Dennis Dimick’s presentation “Eyes on Earth.” In line with that presentation, she commented on the urgency of the climate change crisis. She asked the panel to reflect on whether dietary shifts, which obviously have potential benefits, are enough to move the needle on climate change as quickly as is needed, and whether reductions in fossil fuel use and food waste would have a greater impact more quickly. Mitloehner replied that in his opinion, dietary changes will occur, but they will occur slowly. Moreover, he suggested, many parts of the world will see shifts toward, not away from, a more animal-based diet. Re-educating those masses of people will take a long time, he argued, “time that we don’t have.” He clarified that he did not mean to imply that this re-education should not happen, but that a direct, major change in carbon emissions is needed. He reiterated that the vast majority of carbon emissions is driven by fossil fuel use. “That is undisputed internationally, I believe,” he said. The biggest players, he pointed out, are countries such as China and India that currently are mounting a large drive to electrify their vehicle fleets. According to Mitloehner, “that will have a profound impact.” In the United States, he added, “what we drive” and “how we heat or cool our houses” also has a profound impact. He was adamant that food choices not be compared with fossil fuel choices. “There is no comparison between these two,” he stressed, “particularly in a country like this one.” The Environmental Impact of Beef Consumption: Conflicting Perspectives Regarding the production efficiency of dietary shifts, an audience member observed that on the first day of the workshop (summarized in through ), many speakers had expressed “a beef with beef,” that is, the view that beef is a big problem with respect to GHG emissions and land use. Today, in contrast, Mitloehner had remarked that beef accounts for ""5 Innovation in Food Production and Distribution to Reduce Environmental Footprint."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. only 4 percent of U.S. GHG emissions and implied that beef consumption in the United States is not a concern. According to this audience member, the reason estimates of U.S. GHG emissions from beef are so low is that use of pasture land use is assumed to be free from a GHG perspective. In addition, she asserted that it is important to view the environmental impact of beef consumption from a system point of view: that 3 billion people are going to enter the global middle class and that dairy and beef consumption are going to increase by 70 to 80 percent. Because all pasture lands worldwide are being used currently but many are not being used productively, she agreed with Mitloehner that investing in livestock productivity is essential. But even with that investment and even if livestock productivity worldwide were raised to U.S. levels, she stressed, it still would not be possible to meet the expected 70 to 80 percent increase in demand for beef. That growing demand, she pointed out, will continue to drive deforestation. Thus, she concluded, “it is really important in high beef consumption countries, like the U.S., the UK, and others, that we have reductions in order to allow others to eat beef as they enter the global middle class.” Mitloehner clarified that the 4 percent figure for the United States was for all livestock, not just beef, and that it referred only to direct emissions. Still, he acknowledged, beef alone is no doubt an important driver of GHG emissions. He also agreed that the increased demand for beef will be significant globally. In his opinion, however, one of the most salient aspects of the carbon footprint of beef globally is the extreme inefficiency of beef production in much of the developing world. He explained that while a beef steer in the United States is “finished” at 14 months of age, that animal peer in Africa may live 10, 15, or 20 years before being harvested. For Mitloehner, addressing these inefficiencies is important to reduce the global carbon footprint of livestock. Elaborating on the equity perspective, Blackstone remarked that, even if GHG emissions due to livestock in the United States are only 5.5 percent of total U.S. GHG emissions, they are in fact massive and probably greater than those in many other countries. In addition, she argued, because the United States has been emitting such large amounts of GHGs for so long, the nation has an ethical obligation to reduce its emissions regardless of breakdown by sector. Given the urgency of the climate change crisis, Heller opined that no single sector is going to solve the problem. Rather, he argued, efforts are needed on all fronts. Springmann commented on the push internationally to examine GHG emissions from a consumption-based perspective. He mentioned as an ""5 Innovation in Food Production and Distribution to Reduce Environmental Footprint."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. example work being done by the Center for International Climate Research (CICERO) in Norway (). Mitloehner added that, while many researchers do look at consumption-based emissions as an academic exercise, the GHG emission inventories of EPA are prepared using a production-based approach. Promoting Local and Regional Food Systems to Consumers: Any Federal Policies? Rebecca Boehm, University of Connecticut, pointed to the recent farm bill negotiations, in which programs that supported local food systems, such as the Food Insecurity Nutrition Incentive Grant program, received more funding and garnered bipartisan support. She wondered whether there were any federal policies in place to promote local and regional food systems to consumers in an effort to drive demand for such systems, such as through the DGA. Blackstone commented that, while redemption of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) vouchers at farmers’ markets has been increasing over time because of the portals provided where people can use their electronic benefits transfer (EBT) cards, the company that handles all of these EBT transfers is ceasing operations. She cautioned that many farmers’ markets will then be unable to process SNAP vouchers, and stressed the importance of finding some way to continue support for a highly successful program that provides access to healthy foods in low-income communities.

On August 1 and 2, 2018, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine hosted a public workshop in Washington, DC, on sustainable diets, food, and nutrition. Workshop participants reviewed current and emerging knowledge on the concept of sustainable diets within the field of food and nutrition; explored sustainable diets and relevant impacts for cross-sector partnerships, policy, and research; and discussed how sustainable diets influence dietary patterns, the food system, and population and public health. This publication briefly summarizes the presentations and discussions from the workshop. 3 Measurement and Analysis of Sustainable Diets from Production to Consumption 4 Sustainability and Healthy Dietary Changes Through Policy and Program Action 5 Innovation in Food Production and Distribution to Reduce Environmental Footprint You're looking at OpenBook, NAP.edu's online reading room since 1999.

National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. In the concluding session of the workshop, moderated by Erik Olson, Natural Resources Defense Council, Washington, DC, five previous speakers or moderators participated in a panel discussion: Adam Drewnowski, Jessica Fanzo, Diego Rose, Marco Springmann, and David Tilman. The session opened with Olson asking the panelists to reflect on the workshop and share their takeaways. He then described a hypothetical future scenario involving a meeting in the White House and asked each panelist to imagine him- or herself as the Czar of Sustainable Foods. He asked the panelists what they would say to each of the other people present at the meeting (the President, Bill Gates, and the chief executive officer [CEO] of Walmart). The session ended with an open discussion with the audience. This chapter summarizes the information and opinions that emerged during this session. The Overwhelming Nature of the Data, the Complexity of the Science, But Promising Steps Forward Fanzo commented on the rich conversations that had taken place over the course of the workshop and the many different perspectives from science and the private sector they reflected. She noted, however, a gap in representation from government and policy makers and the need for more voices from the social sciences. She also found the data to be a bit overwhelming, while acknowledging that this is an inevitable result of the ""6 Concluding Discussion."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. complexity of working in such a multidisciplinary space. Reflecting on the controversy surrounding the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) report Livestock’s Long Shadow: Environmental Issues and Options (), she described how someone without expertise in a particular area can “go down a rabbit hole” and believe that the content of whatever he or she is reading is robust, whether it is or not. Given the difficulty that even she has in interpreting climate data, she imagined that it must be extremely difficult for consumers, producers, and policy makers to “weed through” and make sense of the science. She observed further that some people believe what is in the report, while others are very critical, depending on their perspectives, incentives, and funding. Context always matters, she stressed. At the same time, given the many minds being brought together to address sustainability, Fanzo expressed hope. Using the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as a framework and having conversations such as those at this workshop is, she argued, “a promising step compared to where we were 5, 10 years ago.” Tilman identified the issue of equity as a recurring theme over the course of the workshop. In his opinion, the world will be stable in the long term only if greater equity exists among individuals both within and across societies. He observed that the poorest countries are now among those with the highest economic growth rates; thus, 50 to 100 years from now, there will be much greater economic equity among countries. But there will be a cost to that equity, he asserted, because of the greater per capita environmental impacts that richer individuals tend to create. Diet has major implications for human health, he added, but asked what the environmental impacts will be of people worldwide living longer, healthier lives, with lower morbidity and mortality rates. Tilman also was bothered by some of the comments about relative greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions among nations. For him, the question is, “What do we on average, as a citizen of Earth, have the right to do if we are going to have a world that is really equitable and sustainable in the long term?” While Tilman acknowledged not having answers to these questions, he believes much of the change needed is behavioral. For him, the most difficult question is how to come to grips with the various costs and benefits of how people live and how they agree as individuals, as nations, and globally about choices around foods, energy, land, water quality, and other ""6 Concluding Discussion."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. issues related to sustainable diets. He expressed his hope that there is still time for rational thought and change. “It’s not a freight train about to hit a wall,” he acknowledged. Nonetheless, he argued, sustainable life on Earth not just 10 years from now, but 1,000 and 10,000 years from now, will require a multidisciplinary, multicultural approach that recognizes global interdependence. Springmann agreed with Fanzo’s and Tilman’s remarks about the need for multiple perspectives. However, he did not find the data overwhelming or the questions unanswerable. For him, looking at different perspectives actually helps reduce confusion and clarify direction. He explained that the basic factor underlying the differential environmental footprints of animal- and plant-based foods is the feed conversion ratio; that is, it always takes more feed to feed animals than if humans were to eat the feed themselves. He remarked on the extensive discussion during the workshop, particularly in the last session (summarized in ), on GHG emissions associated with different diets. But he stressed that it is also clear that if people in high meat-consuming countries were to eat less meat, especially less red and processed meat, large health benefits would result, citing as an example that there is a possible mechanistic explanation for an association between red meat, for example, and colorectal cancer. Thus, he summarized, there are benefits in both dimensions—environmental and human health. He added that plant-based foods in general are known to be cheaper—perhaps not in supermarkets such as Whole Foods where plant-based foods are marketed to a specific demographic, but generally from a production perspective. The challenge, he asserted, is how to structure the food system to make those foods available. Overall, he argued, a dietary change toward a more sustainable diet probably means a shift toward a more plant-based diet. Springmann clarified that this observation does not necessarily mean that everyone needs to become vegan; rather, it means a shift toward plant-based eating. The challenge, he suggested, is how. He referred to Ranganathan’s presentation (summarized in ) on lessons learned from private-sector marketing on how to shift behavior. He speculated that it is probably unrealistic to expect people to eliminate meat from their diets entirely, but it is more likely that some people would eat vegan for a certain amount of time each week. He encouraged the retail sector to provide plant-based products so that people would have that choice, stating that if people ate red or processed meat only once per week, for example, the world would probably be much more sustainable.

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. The Complexity of Sustainable Food Systems, the Challenge of Obtaining Good-Quality Data, and the Issue of Health Equity The first takeaway for Drewnowksi was that sustainable food systems are complicated, multisectoral, and transdisciplinary and that achieving sustainability will require the involvement of a range of expertise, from social science to epidemiology to the food industry. For him, it is helpful to revisit the FAO definition of a sustainable diet and its four domains: (1) health and nutrition, (2) economics, (3) society, and (4) the environment. Thus, he stressed, the environment is only one of several domains of a sustainable diet, and he urged greater consideration of the broader picture and other parts of that picture, from affordability to labor issues to health equity. In his opinion, focusing only on the environment can be misleading, especially since the environmental context is so different from one country or geography to another—even within the United States. Globally, he pointed out, there are differences not only in context, but also in the quality of environmental data. Indeed, the need for good-quality data was a second take-home message for Drewnowski. Referring to Afshin’s presentation on the health metric, consumption, and other data that the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) project is combining, coding, and converting into models (see ), he commented on the complexity of understanding even where dietary data are and sustainable diets based on those data can be modeled. In Drewnowski’s opinion, while GBD has been extremely expensive, it is “money well spent,” given that it has created the best picture available of the global burden of disease. A third takeaway for Drewnowski was the issue of health equity. There is no standard diet, he asserted; rather, different people consume different diets with different costs. He mentioned again that in Seattle, he has observed differences in obesity rates on the order of 600 percent based simply on where people live—a socioeconomic difference that dwarfs any kind of difference by race, ethnicity, age, sex, or any other factor. He encouraged workshop participants to keep in mind the issue of diet disparity and health equity. Providing Sustainable Diet Guidance, Understanding What Drives Individual Behavior, and Communicating Among Disciplines Rose drew a parallel between the workshop discussion on sustainable diets and the dietary guidance process in the United States. He explained that in the late 1970s, before the first (DGA) was issued in 1980, the U.S. Senate issued a set of dietary guidelines ""6 Concluding Discussion."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. called . That senators were promulgating guidelines prompted the nutrition community, as well as the legislative community, to call for the involvement of professionals. In Rose’s opinion, one of the wise decisions made when the first DGA was issued was to revisit the guidelines every 5 years. Thus, he observed, experts can communicate to the public what is understood based on the best available science, knowing there will be an opportunity in another 5 years to revise their recommendations. “I think we are sort of at that point here with sustainable diets,” he suggested. Much is known and can be communicated to the public and policy makers now, and this information can be revisited in 4 to 5 years to see whether any changes should be made to the advice offered. Another takeaway for Rose was the importance of modeling at the individual level, given that it is individuals who make decisions about what to eat (as described in Heller’s presentation, summarized in , on their joint work in linking environmental impacts to National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey [NHANES] dietary data). “That is where the change happens,” Rose asserted. If the goal is to move people toward less waste and a more plant-based diet, he elaborated, it is important to know what motivates individuals. Thus, he called for a greater focus on drivers of individual-level change, noting that Ranganathan had described some of these drivers in her presentation (summarized in ). He added that, although there had been little discussion about social media at the workshop, they are known to be a powerful driver of behavioral change and are used a great deal in marketing. “I think we need to tap more into that,” he said. Thus, he echoed calls to expand expertise at the next workshop on sustainable diets to include more social scientists, including sociologists, anthropologists, and economists, as well as marketing experts. Because policies and the food environment are also important drivers of change, he argued further for political scientists and politicians to be present in future discussions to enable a better understanding of how politicians perceive the world and what political drivers can create the will to make the necessary changes. Finally, Rose stressed that having all of these different people in the room will require getting better at interdisciplinary communication. He mentioned that in his own work, Heller is an example of someone from another discipline with whom he has resolved language issues, differences in publication style, differences in how data are handled, and other challenges, and he suspects that anyone working as part of an interdisciplinary team has had a similar experience. “I think it is a challenge that we need to keep pursuing,” he said, “because that is how we are really going to get to a better conclusion.” ""6 Concluding Discussion.""

Olson asked the panelists to imagine a hypothetical future scenario in which a new President has just been inaugurated, and “you,” the panelist, have been invited to the White House as the Czar of Sustainable Foods to meet with three people: (1) the President, who wants to hear what you, the new Czar of Sustainable Foods, have to say; (2) Bill Gates, who is going to give money to nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to do whatever he wants them to do; and (3) the CEO of Walmart. You are each allowed two sentences, he instructed the panelists, to tell each of these three people the number one thing they should do. Drewnowski began. He offered that he would say to the President that the major problems with diet quality are related to income and socioeconomic status and that the “first order of the day” is redistribution of income. To Bill Gates, he would call for accountability. He would tell Gates that it is time to step away from foundations that are not accountable to anyone and to restore functions formerly served by FAO, the World Health Organization (WHO), and government institutions. To the CEO of Walmart, he quipped, “I would say, ‘What are you doing about Amazon?’” For Springmann, the number one thing he would ask of the President would be to eliminate what he characterized as the “crazy” dairy recommendations in the DGA. He referred to results from Heller’s research showing the role of dairy in nonsustainable diets (see in ). He would also ask the President to revise the U.S. calcium recommendations, as they underpin the dairy recommendations. As for Gates, Springmann agreed with Drewnowski’s response. In addition, he would ask Gates to rethink official development aid, for example, and instead of investing in specific food groups, think about how to develop sustainable food systems holistically in developing countries. He would suggest that Gates perhaps engage Walmart’s help in cold chain logistics. And he would suggest to the Walmart CEO that the company think more about food groups and their role in sustainable diets. Tilman would encourage the President to choose a cabinet and cabinet secretaries based on their ability and desire to advance a science-based agenda throughout government. He expressed his view that “with a science-based agenda, we can address many of the problems that this group has been discussing.” He would encourage the Walmart CEO to find ways to package and sell foods that reduce waste at the consumer level. In addition, he would request that Walmart use its marketing skills to encourage consumers to purchase more fruits and vegetables. To Gates, he would request money for a Nobel-like prize for developing and popularizing the best tasting, healthiest foods possible. Each year, the winners would be chosen based on an international contest with a highly publicized televised cook-off. ""6 Concluding Discussion."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. Fanzo would ask the President to commit to the SDGs and to hold the United States accountable for attempting to achieve those goals. She would ask Gates to invest more in nutrition. According to Fanzo, Gates has historically not been convinced of the case for nutrition, particularly undernutrition, and the current portfolio for nutrition of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is very small compared with health or even agriculture development. “I would present the case to him that diets are incredibly important,” she said. Acknowledging the impossibility of such a request, she would say to the Walmart CEO, “Stop selling junk food.” She would suggest that Walmart be the first retailer not to have any junk food in its stores. “Wouldn’t that be amazing?” she asked. To the President, Rose would argue the importance of sustainable diets, particularly with respect to climate change, and he would point out the many tools in the President’s administration available for addressing this issue (e.g., guidelines, food labeling, taxes). Like Fanzo, he would encourage Gates to increase the foundation’s nutrition portfolio. Also like Fanzo, he would urge the Walmart CEO to reduce the sale of junk food. In addition, he would urge Walmart to reduce food waste and, more generally, commit to sustainable foods. Different Approaches to Analyzing and Interpreting Data on Sustainable Diets Tahiri agreed with Fanzo’s remarks about the overwhelming nature of data on sustainable diets. For her, it is as though everyone is climbing the same mountain, but from different angles. She finds this to be especially true with respect to modeling the population effects of changes in meat consumption. She asked whether it is possible to consolidate all the different datasets that had been examined over the course of the workshop. Springmann countered that the different perspectives and multiple data sources discussed throughout the workshop are not to be discouraged. He described the data as “imperfect descriptions of reality.” So in his opinion, the more sources there are, the better—one can then ask the same question of the different sources to see if they agree. Rose added that in a way, a convergence has already taken place. He mentioned results from the models Springmann had described (summarized in ) converging with results from the individual-level study described by Heller (summarized in ). “Basically we are seeing some of the same patterns,” Rose said, including that food waste and beef and dairy are driving many of the environmental impacts of the food system. ""6 Concluding Discussion."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. Tahiri expressed concern that the focus on the environmental dimension of sustainable diets and the failure to consider the other three components (health and nutrition, economics, and society) is worse than misleading, as Drewnowski had observed. In her opinion, if health, affordability, and accessibility are not taken into account, it will be impossible to convince consumers and others who need to be convinced to do what is necessary to advance sustainable diets. She observed that there had been little discussion during the workshop about how to be an ambassador for all four components of sustainability, not just the environmental component. Drewnowski referred to Tilman’s idea of a “great cook-off” to find a food that is nutrient-rich and also affordable, appealing, and planet-friendly. “What is that food?” he asked. He agreed that affordability in particular is of utmost concern, as it “goes to the heart of health equity.” Related to these other dimensions of sustainability, an audience member suggested that perhaps another workshop should be planned to focus on the economic impacts of the dietary transitions that had been discussed at this workshop. She expressed particular interest in the impacts on farmers’ incomes in developing countries, but also in developed countries, given that 28 percent of the global workforce is in this sector. If farmers do not earn a decent living, she argued, they will be unable to invest in the productivity increases needed to reduce the environmental impact of agriculture. Fanzo agreed that this would be a great workshop idea, calling attention to a recent series on the economics of noncommunicable diseases. “I think we need the same thing,” Fanzo said, but on the economics of nutrition outcomes. Breaking Down Silos and Thinking More Holistically Kate Houston of Cargill, Inc., suggested that part of the challenge to addressing all four components of sustainable diets is that everyone acknowledges the components’ equal importance, yet, she said, “we get so siloed in our work.” She added that this is the case even in companies, where experts are working to solve different elements of a broader challenge. She asked the panelists for suggestions on how to break these silos down and encourage different parts of the academic community and the private sector to think more holistically about the issues and solutions. Tilman responded that, based on his experience, the only way to get people with different backgrounds to collaborate is to gather them in the same place. Architecture or geography, he said, “ends up being intellectual destiny.” He described how at his university, he had a math professor across the hall from him, an economist down the hall, and a historian neighbor ""6 Concluding Discussion."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. as well. He encouraged finding such opportunities to enable regular interaction. He added that in many disciplines, working groups are formed when some sort of formal funding mechanism brings people together four or five times per year. A similar working group encompassing the diversity represented at this workshop could make great progress, he asserted. He cautioned, however, that the first few meetings would be dedicated to simply finding out how to communicate effectively. Building on Tilman’s response, Fanzo observed that there are many ways to think about “place.” She suggested that the global framework of the SDGs is another type of place, one where the world has been meeting and where a universal framework of action around sustainable development for the next 15 years has been constructed. She stressed not only that the development of the SDGs brought every country to the table, but also that the agreement reached was more collective than was the case for the Millennium Development Goals, with donors really rallying behind the SDGs. Now, she noted, countries are making their own SDG plans, but with different priorities. For example, Nepal, being a land-locked country, is not focusing as intensely on the SDG related to life under water. Countries also are basing their priorities on what they can feasibly do within the next 10 years. According to Fanzo, however, almost every country has prioritized SDG 2: end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture. Drewnowski suggested yet another strategy for breaking down silos, one that operates at what he described as a micro level. He reported that the University of Washington recently approved an undergraduate major in food systems, to be administered by the School of Public Health in collaboration with the School of Business, the School of Law, the College of Engineering, the College of the Environment, and the College of Built Environments. The new major is serving as a mechanism for bringing people from different disciplines and sectors together, in some cases for the first time, all working toward population health. Drewnowski is hoping that the faculty from these different schools and colleges will come together initially to talk about the undergraduate curriculum, but eventually will discuss research and joint projects and grants. Rose added that beyond finding ways to work together either in a place or on a specific project, as Fanzo and Tilman had discussed, or ways to study together, as Drewnowski had described, it is also important to convey the need for a certain humility to students—that what they study or what they know is not everything. It is vital, he stressed, for students to understand that there are important issues beyond their disciplinary knowledge and that they need to respect other people’s disciplines and talents. In addition, Rose emphasized the importance of not just working together but also playing together if people are to get along with one another. ""6 Concluding Discussion."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2019. Sustainable Diets, Food, and Nutrition: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25192. As an example, he cited dinners or receptions after workshops such as this, where people have the opportunity to see each other as people, not just professionals. Doing so, he argued, makes it easier to overcome the hurdles that exist in the face of disagreement, misunderstanding, or differing objectives. Springmann echoed Rose’s call for play and added that tolerance is also important. He encouraged talking to one other, asking questions about what drives people in other disciplines or sectors, and being tolerant of different views. ""6 Concluding Discussion.""

Building a More Sustainable, Resilient, Equitable, and Nourishing Food System On July 22–23, 2020, the Food Forum of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (the National Academies) hosted a virtual workshop that explored the integration of the health, societal, economic, and environmental effects and future needs of the food system. Naomi Fukagawa, U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), planning committee chair, provided opening remarks on the goals of the workshop and the Food Forum. The main objective of the 1.5-day workshop was to understand how to achieve a more sustainable, resilient, equitable, and nourishing food system. Workshop sessions examined three main dimensions of the food system: vulnerabilities, resiliency, and transformation. The workshop included discussions on global change, access to health and food, resiliency in complex dynamic systems and resiliency for the future, and consumption- and production-oriented strategies that could transform the food system. As Fukagawa described, and the workshop agenda notes, the Food Forum convenes scientists, administrators, and policy makers from academia, government, industry, and the public sector on an ongoing basis to discuss problems and issues related to food, food safety, and regulation and to identify possible approaches for addressing those problems and issues. The Food Forum provides a rapid way to identify areas of concordance among these diverse interest groups. It does not make recommendations, nor offer specific advice. It does compile information, develop options, and bring interested parties together. This Proceedings of a Workshop—in Brief summarizes the key points made by workshop participants during the presentations and discussions and is not intended to provide a comprehensive summary of information shared during the workshop. The views summarized here reflect the knowledge and opinions of individual workshop participants and should not be construed as consensus among workshop participants or the members of the Food Forum or the National Academies. Patrick Stover, Texas A&M University, provided introductory remarks on the new expectations for the food system and highlighted several recent publications relevant to the workshop. As he described, the two main goals of the USDA Agriculture Innovation Agenda are to increase food production by 40 percent and reduce the environmental footprint of agriculture by 50 percent by 2050. Stover pointed out that food systems, the environment, people, and the economy are interconnected and interdependent, and they all require a systems thinking approach.

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25988. Stover explained that the number of people globally who are food insecure is expected to increase, as are costly diet-related chronic diseases. Historically, the food system was designed to maximize production to fuel the economy, and now it must also achieve goals related to health, the environment, and agriculture. Advances in science and technology have allowed, and will increasingly be essential, for the food system to address issues such as nutrient deficiencies, chronic disease, environmental impact, economic sustainability, food supply diversity, food affordability and accessibility, and health care costs. Stover highlighted a series of National Academies workshops and consensus study reports that provide background and context for the current workshop. The speakers at the 2012 workshop Exploring the Health and Environmental Costs of Food highlighted that our food system’s focus on reducing hunger and providing access to affordable, accessible calories has shifted costs into other domains such as health care, the environment, and national security (). Stover stated that a systems approach is needed to address these externalities. The 2015 consensus study report A Framework for Assessing Effects of the Food System facilitated making holistic, science-informed decisions about food system policy and practice (). As shown in , the report states that the food system is a complex, dynamic, adaptive system with goods and services flowing from farm inputs to the consumer, and money and demand information flowing from the consumer back to the farm inputs. Many actors, players, and domains influence these flows. Stover also provided context regarding technological advancements that could transform the food system, including a reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, as agriculture accounts for 10 percent of all U.S. GHG. Referencing Rattan Lal, the recipient of the 2020 World Food Prize, Stover stated that a 2 percent increase in the carbon content of the soil could offset 100 percent of all GHG emissions. He also shared recommendations for other food system innovations that could reduce the environmental impact of agriculture, but he noted that they are not all cost competitive with traditional agriculture. Stover also highlighted the 2017 consensus study report Guiding Principles for Developing Dietary Reference Intakes Based on Chronic Disease (). The report reflects a shift from using nutrient deficiencies to using prevention or management of chronic disease as the basis of determining nutrient needs. As chronic diseases are complex, a systems approach is needed to understand how nutrients, physiology, and metabolism lead to disease. Stover suggested that improved understanding of the economics of the food system is also needed, as it provides 10 percent of U.S. employment and produces 5.4 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP). Changes to the food system to achieve health and environmental goals will also need to be profitable.

As coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected the entire agriculture and food system value chain, the National Academies’ Board on Agriculture and Natural Resources held a webinar in June 2020 on COVID-19 and the food system, which featured former U.S. and California secretaries of agriculture. Key points from the webinar, as reported by Stover, are that the food system was not as resilient as it could have been in response to COVID-19; faster responses were needed to changes in markets and consumer behavior; people with diet-related chronic diseases are the most vulnerable to experiencing adverse health effects from COVID-19; and underserved minority communities, particularly those of whom work in the food system, have been disproportionately affected. In conclusion, Stover stated that the new expectations for the food system are clear, and the highest level of science is needed to determine the paths for achieving them. Session 1, moderated by Matt Liebman, Iowa State University, focused on the vulnerabilities of the food system, including the biophysical challenges, the social and economic shortcomings, and the need for an agroecological framework for improvement. The first speaker, Cynthia Rosenzweig, National Aeronautics and Space Administration Goddard Institute for Space Studies and Columbia University Earth Institute, spoke about the food system’s planetary boundaries and global change, with a particular emphasis on the effects of climate change. Rosenzweig stated that much of the work to address climate change globally has focused on crop agriculture, with less attention paid to livestock and fisheries. However, other components of the food system, such as food processing, supply chains, shipping, demand, and consumption, and the food loss and waste therein, also affect climate change. There is now movement to consider the food system in the context of the climate system, global ecosystems, and socioeconomic systems. Rosenzweig pointed out that COVID-19 has highlighted the cascading effects of disruptions in production, supply chain, and demand in the food system. Rosenzweig explained ways that the food system is both successful and falls short in achieving food security and planetary health. She noted that expanding irrigation, fertilizer, and cropland; managing water, nutrients, and land; reducing food loss; and dietary changes to more evenly distribute calories around the world could allow the global food system to feed the world’s population (). Challenges in achieving this goal include competition for water between ecosystems and food production and changes in temperature and precipitation caused by climate change. Using rice as an example, Rosenzweig described research finding that high CO levels also adversely affect nutrient quality (). Livestock diseases are also affected by global temperature increases. Rosenzweig outlined several proposed solutions to address the effect of climate change on food production. Rosenzweig closed by considering the parallel global systemic threats of COVID-19 and climate change, noting that while the former came on quickly and the latter slowly, they both disproportionately affect poor and minority populations and impact our food system and food security around the world. The second speaker of the session, Ricardo Salvador, Union of Concerned Scientists, planning committee member, spoke about access to health and food. Salvador began by referencing the framework shown in and highlighted a real-world example, describing dimensions of quality, quantity, distribution, and resilience within the health, environmental, and socioeconomic domains. Salvador emphasized the dynamic nature of the food system and noted that natural resource and human systems affect each other. In response to a natural disaster like a flood, Salvador pointed out, the impact on outcomes stem from human decisions in addition to the natural event. Socioeconomic outputs can be assessed in the areas of health, markets, public resources and policies, and public well-being. Salvador used the example of meatpacking workers during the COVID-19 pandemic to further illustrate his points. He shared statistics about the high rate of COVID-19 infections and deaths among the low-income slaughter line workers, who are mostly people of color, lamenting that many of the infections and deaths could have been prevented. Salvador stated that the meatpacking workers were exploited because they were obligated to work in hazardous conditions, while the meatpacking plants demonstrated their significant political and economic clout in having the workers be designated as essential, compelling them to work without the company facing liability. Salvador concluded with a call to action for science-based organizations to recognize the data, apply the food systems framework, and advocate for policies that improve socioeconomic outcomes and resilience. The final speaker of the session, Paula Daniels, Center for Good Food Purchasing, spoke about the need for an agroecological framework for the food system. She opened by briefly describing the work of the Center for Good See the National Academies’ webinar on COVID-19 and the Food and Agricultural System. Available at https://www.nationalacademies.org/event/06-19-2020/covid-19-and-the-food-and-agricultural-system (accessed September 16, 2020). ""Building a More Sustainable, Resilient, Equitable, and Nourishing Food System: Proceedings of a Workshop - in Brief."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2020. Building a More Sustainable, Resilient, Equitable, and Nourishing Food System: Proceedings of a Workshop—in Brief. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25988. Food Purchasing. As presented in her slide, the center uses “the power of procurement to create a transparent and equitable food system that prioritizes the health and well-being of people, animals, and the environment.” The center works to achieve this goal through the adoption and implementation of the Good Food Purchasing Program by major institutions. Daniels pointed out that one intention in creating the Center for Good Food Purchasing was to increase the regional food economy, as most regions consume only about 5 to 15 percent of their food from local sources. The Los Angeles School District, with a $150 million per year food budget, adopted the program in 2012 and within 1 year went from purchasing 10 percent of its food locally to purchasing 60 percent, providing $12 million for the local food economy and creating 150 new jobs. The program is a lever for creating change in five aspects of the food system: (1) health and nutrition; (2) environmental sustainability; (3) valued workforce; (4) local economies; and (5) animal welfare. Daniels also described externalities of the food system that are not included in the cost of the food. Beginning in about the mid-twentieth century, “diabesity” rates skyrocketed, the percent of the workforce involved in farming declined dramatically, and farm outputs increased while the number of farms decreased. Highly processed, cheap, unhealthy foods became America’s legacy. With respect to food production, Daniels noted that current production exceeds global caloric needs, but the food is not equitably produced or distributed. She suggested that the United States move away from producing and exporting cheap, processed foods and consider food in the context of social and cultural factors, healthfulness, and availability. Sharing a framework from the International Panel of Experts on Sustainable Food Systems (IPES-Food) and experts from Tasting the Future and the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, Daniels outlined differences in existing food systems thinking compared with new food systems thinking. For example, the existing food systems thinking is that “we” feed the world, while the new food systems thinking is that the world feeds itself as people are empowered to grow their own food. Daniels suggested that food be valued as a public good rather than a commodity, with values, rather than profits, being maximized. She noted that the United States ranks in the bottom half of 67 countries on a food sustainability index (The Economist Intelligence Unit and Barilla Center for Food & Nutrition, 2018) and suggested that it needed to do more to catch up to other countries. It also needs to embrace the 10 elements of agroecology, which, as described by the United Nations, is a holistic multidisciplinary view of the food system, encompassing sociology, economics, and history. Daniels closed her presentation by proposing a new narrative of a food system that is resilient and supportive of local food economies, its workforce, the humane treatment of animals, sustainability, and nutrition. She suggested that this vision could be achieved with a shift from primary dependence on an export model toward investment in a diverse, renewable, and regionally sustainable system, following the model of the shift toward renewable energy. Following the three presentations, Liebman led a panel discussion with Rosenzweig, Salvador, and Daniels. When asked about the major vulnerability in the food and agriculture system, Rosenzweig stated that it is increasing climate events, while Salvador posited that it is socioeconomic disparities, as those with greater socioeconomic standing can better withstand challenges such as climate change. Daniels suggested that it is the corporate consolidation and vertical integration, as evidenced by Salvador’s example of the challenges that meatpacking workers faced. To increase attention to food safety, Daniels and Salvador suggested using technology to improve transparency and traceability, which could allow contamination to be quickly identified and mitigated throughout the supply chain. Rosenzweig noted that climate change could increase microbial contamination. In response to a question about research priorities, Daniels highlighted opportunities in environmentally sustainable animal food production through aquaculture and innovations in converting food waste to fish feed. Rosenzweig pointed to the need for improved response to complex, global cascading risks such as COVID-19 and climate change. Salvador recommended more research into agroecology. An audience member asked how to best leverage the knowledge of Indigenous and Black farmers and other people of color in the food and agriculture system to ensure food sovereignty and agroecological health. Salvador responded that an important goal should be to provide more equitable financial resources to break the cycles of racial inequality, hunger, and poverty that repeat themselves over generations. Rosenzweig added that intergovernmental science bodies have begun to more intentionally include broader knowledge systems, including indigenous and local knowledge. Diabesity is defined as “diabetes occurring in the context of obesity” ().

Addressing a question about the role of livestock in climate change, Rosenzweig acknowledged that with half a billion smallholder farmers around the world depending on livestock for their food and livelihood, there is a need to create just transitions to sustainable agroecological systems that include livestock in ways that are more resilient and responsive to climate change challenges. Liebman concluded the session by asking the panelists to address vulnerabilities in water quality and quantity. Daniels posed the possibility of using retreated, recycled water in agriculture. Rosenzweig and Salvador pointed to the need for increased awareness that water systems are shared between agriculture and other ecosystems. Session 2, moderated by Kristie Ebi, University of Washington, focused on the resiliency of the food system. Presentations during this session addressed topics of complex dynamic systems, resiliency in the food system, and needs for resiliency in the future. Stover began the session with a brief recap of his remarks from Session 1. Following Stover’s introduction, John R. Porter, Agropolis Fondation, France; University of Copenhagen, Denmark; and University of Greenwich, United Kingdom, provided remarks on resiliency within complex dynamic systems. Porter opened by stating that robustness, resilience, and efficiency are important elements of a twenty-first century food system. He noted that climate change is the challenge that will define our future and that reducing GHG emissions will require both production and consumption strategies. He suggested that the goal for consumption should be “enough from less.” Porter shared four hypotheses related to system redundancy and resilience: (1) more from less does not lead to increased robustness, meaning system redundancy is a good thing; (2) increased complexity can and cannot lead to increased robustness and resilience; (3) decreased robustness leads to decreased efficiencies; and (4) increased robustness leads to increased efficiencies. He used different countries’ responses to the COVID-19 pandemic as examples to illustrate these hypotheses. Porter explained how production efficiencies for the economic and energy sectors could be calculated based on GHG emissions per energy, energy per GDP, and GDP per population (the so-called Kaya identity). He noted that since World War II, GDP per population has approximately doubled as GHG per energy and energy per GDP have decreased. He then showed how this methodology can be used to calculate emissions from the food system on a per area and per product basis, via the Kaya-Porter identity. Porter pointed out that, because of production increases, GHG emissions from soil and total GHG emissions per produced crop have declined since 1970. Porter described three resource use efficiencies: (1) radiation efficiency, or how much dry matter is produced for a given radiation; (2) water use efficiency, or production per water used; and (3) nutrient use efficiency. He noted that these efficiencies are often considered separately, but they interact. He shared a framework that can be used to explore the trade-offs between them. As Porter explained, there are also trade-offs among wealth, health, consumption, and GHG emissions and that the Kaya and Kaya-Porter identities need to be joined to give a multidimensional picture of food production, consumption, and health. Porter next described the difference between linear and circular food systems. He noted that with linear food systems, about 50 percent of the expected production is lost to waste at various points in the system. However, with a circular food system, losses are minimized and recycled back into the system. He noted that studies of circular food systems lag far behind research done with linear food systems. Cynthia Daley, Center for Regenerative Agriculture and Resilient Systems at California State University, Chico, spoke about resilient properties in the food system from the perspective of the farmer. She opened by stating that farmers are in a time of crisis because of climate change, trade wars, and declines in commodity prices. Perishable commodity producers have been particularly affected by COVID-19 because they are price takers, unable to control input costs, and unable to switch to alternative markets; in other words, they are not resilient. On the other hand, local food systems are particularly resilient, and demand for local food is higher than ever. Daley shared the example of the Sloot Farm in Minnesota, which, prior to COVID-19, sold hogs as a commodity but has since adapted and began processing the meat locally and selling it online. Demand through the local food system has outpaced supply. Daley suggested that a resilient food system should reward farmers for good stewardship and lamented that the current system is resulting in a loss of soil, nutrients, institutional knowledge, farmers, and species diversity. Referencing the report , Daley noted the need for better accounting of the true cost of our cheap food policy, which is efficient but not resilient. She suggested that regenerative farming could help to increase resiliency and reduce emissions, pesticide use, runoff, and nutrient loss. Daley highlighted several programs to help farmers increase resiliency, move toward regenerative agriculture, and reduce GHG emissions. She also shared photos that illustrate regenerative farming practices.

Rattan Lal that was previously shared by Stover about the potential effect on climate change of increasing soil carbon content. The final speaker of the session, Rosamond Naylor, Stanford University, spoke about resiliency for the future and blue foods, which are foods produced in freshwater and ocean aquatic systems. Naylor defined a resilient food and agriculture system as one that can quickly rebound in response to a stress or shock caused by factors such as climate change (drought, flood, temperature fluctuation) or market shocks (recession, COVID-19). When assessing resiliency, Naylor suggested one should ask: To what? In what? For whom? With respect to COVID-19, Naylor suggested that hunger resulting from the economic impact of the pandemic may kill more people globally than the disease itself, with more than 1 million people in the United States using food banks for the first time. She also noted that COVID-19 has disproportionately affected workers at meatpacking plants, as Salvador described, and people with diet-related diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and obesity, both of whom are disproportionately people of color. Naylor suggested that a resilient food system should focus on producing more variety rather than more calories, noting that aquatic foods can provide nutrients and protein affordably. Considering resilience within the context of an interconnected global food system, Naylor noted that growth in population and incomes drives demand for food, animal protein, and animal feed. More substitution options in production and consumption can help to reduce price variations. Naylor explained that she is engaged in an assessment aimed at incorporating blue foods into international discussions on the global food system and evaluating the role of blue foods in nutritious, sustainable, and equitable diets. She noted that global capture fish production has remained relatively constant in recent decades, and that there has been more than a three-fold increase in aquaculture production in the past 20 years. More than half of capture fish production comes from small-scale fisheries, and more than two-thirds of farmed aquatic foods come from small-scale systems. Naylor closed by noting sustainability issues associated with aquaculture feeds—a major sustainability issue in aquaculture. She stated that the ratio of fish feed to fish produced through aquaculture has dropped substantially in the past 20 years. A substantial portion of the feed now comes from fish processing waste, livestock waste, grains, and even algae and insects in some places, perpetuating the circular system. In response to a question about ensuring food safety in aquaculture when waste is used as feed, Naylor explained that processing waste from one species is not used as feed for the same (or similar) species, and feed companies test the feed to ensure its safety. Food safety is a more significant issue in low-income countries, where human and other wastes are often dumped into aquaculture ponds. She also noted concerns with plants potentially contaminated with pesticide residues being used for feed. After the presentations, Ebi facilitated a discussion among Porter, Daley, and Naylor. She began by asking about the key research needs to increase understanding of the resiliency of complex, adaptive systems. Porter noted that much work has been done on the consumption side of food security, and more research is needed on the production side and the integration of production and consumption. Naylor described the need for more research on both improving nutrition, food safety, and the environmental impacts of aquaculture involving lower-value fish around the world, and on the contribution of antibiotic use in aquaculture to antibiotic resistance. Daley added that there is a need for more socioeconomic research on how to implement the changes that are needed, including adoption of more sustainable practices by farmers and public policy changes. Ebi asked about incentives that could help to more quickly transition the consumption side of the food system. Daley responded that increasing consumer awareness of the impact of production practices on nutrient density and GHG emissions could help to change behavior, noting that several brands are using this messaging as consumers are willing to pay more for food produced in a superior way. Naylor noted that a segment of consumers concerned about sustainability is driving change in global markets. Porter and Daley suggested that successes in changing social norms around tobacco use could serve as a model for food system change. Ebi and Naylor pointed to a need for greater understanding of motivations for consumer behavior and increased reliance on the field of behavioral economics. They suggested that leadership modeling positive behavior could also be influential, particularly for children. On the production side, Porter suggested addressing climate change through macroeconomic changes such as the development of a carbon standard that values the economy on the basis of carbon stocks. Daley recommended incentivizing farmers to switch to a perennial farming system, noting that in the current system, farmers with fixed costs want to produce as much as possible. She also pointed out that nutrition labeling regulations that prohibit iden- ""Building a More Sustainable, Resilient, Equitable, and Nourishing Food System: Proceedings of a Workshop - in Brief."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2020. Building a More Sustainable, Resilient, Equitable, and Nourishing Food System: Proceedings of a Workshop—in Brief. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25988. tifying the superior nutrient density of foods produced in certain ways disincentivizes changing production methods. Naylor added that farming only a small number of high-value fish species could have an adverse ecological impact, highlighting the need for more incentives to adopt sustainable approaches. An economist by training, Naylor noted that economics is often the “invisible hand” that spurs change for both producers and consumers. She also pointed out that being able to afford to eat clean, safe food is a global social justice issue, as some populations have to put access to food second to having access to food at all. Ebi asked the panelists a set of audience questions about how to ensure food safety and reduce contamination. Daley suggested the use of remediation measures to remove heavy metals from farmland. Porter added that certain trees can be used to extract heavy metals from the soil, harvest the metals, and create energy. In closing, Ebi asked for recommendations about where researchers can obtain funding and how practitioners can get started in implementing the priorities identified. Ebi and Daley both noted the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration. Naylor suggested using social media, approaching smaller, regional funders, and thinking creatively about how to solve problems, such as connecting food banks with local farmers. The third session, moderated by Christian Peters, Tufts University, planning committee member, focused on food system transformation. Speakers addressed both production- and consumption-oriented strategies to transforming the food system and the policies needed to support transformation. Peters began by providing a recap of the first two sessions and an introduction to the third session. Setting the stage for Session 3, he posed the question of the goals of food system transformation. Referencing the Brundtland Report, Peters defined sustainable development as development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs (World Commission on Environment and Development, 1987). He highlighted two key concepts from that report: (1) the essential needs of the world’s poor should be a priority, and (2) technology and social organization limit the environment’s ability to meet present and future needs. Peters shared the United Nations’ 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), established in 2015, noting that they are an international agenda for achieving sustainable development and cover many topics relevant to food systems. Peters described how the 17 SDGs fit into the categories of (1) planet; (2) people, dignity, and justice; and (3) prosperity within agriculture and food systems. Relevant outcomes include food security and nutritional diversity, cultural diversity, ecological long-term stability, and sustainable agriculture systems. Peters spent the rest of the presentation focusing on how to create a more sustainable food system. He outlined several production-oriented, supply chain, and consumption-oriented strategies for feeding the world’s population and achieving food security. Peters also discussed , noting the supply chain elements and emphasizing the importance of working at multiple levels and within multiple dimensions of the food system. Addressing a question from Fukagawa about whether to start with food system transformation at the local, national, or global levels, Peters responded that he sees the effects at each level as the sum of the effects of the levels below. He suggested that the level at which to start depends on readiness for change. Pradeep Prabhala, McKinsey & Company, spoke about incentivizing food systems transformation. Prabhala noted that progress toward the SDGs has been uneven, as food systems have focused on increasing production to address hunger and malnutrition and they have not made as much progress in protecting the environment and developing integrated health outcomes. He noted that the food system overall creates more cost than benefits, and many of these costs are borne by the health and environmental sectors. Transformation requires fundamentally changing the way food is produced and consumed, including getting 500 million smallholder farmers to change their farming practices and 7.7 billion consumers globally to change their consumption. Potential challenges to achieving these outcomes are economic, educational, and attitudinal. There are also ecosystem barriers. Prabhala suggested that effective incentives fund behavior change costs, mitigate transition or switching costs, and cover ongoing economic costs resulting from the change. He also noted the need to remove disincentives, including $100 billion in government subsidies for the agricultural sector. Prabhala proposed four pathways to incentivize key actors to create a food system that is sustainable, nutritious, inclusive, and efficient: (1) repurpose public investment and policies (i.e., change how and why governments spend money and construct more effective policies); (2) business model innovation (i.e., change the way companies do business through technology, product, or business model innovation); (3) institutional investment pathway, such as investor-set standards for how the money is spent; and (4) consumer behavior change pathway, as consumer demand can lead to changes in other parts of the ecosystem. Prabhala noted that different pathways are appropriate for different countries and contexts, and there is a need to manage trade-offs in their implementation. He pointed out that many of these changes need to happen at the national, rather than international, level. ""Building a More Sustainable, Resilient, Equitable, and Nourishing Food System: Proceedings of a Workshop - in Brief."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2020. Building a More Sustainable, Resilient, Equitable, and Nourishing Food System: Proceedings of a Workshop—in Brief. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25988. Prabhala emphasized the importance of considering how to activate the pathways and overcome challenges. For example, governments may make suboptimal decisions about food systems because of poor communication, limited evidence for interventions, lack of political will, stakeholder resistance, limited capacity, or transition costs. Prabhala shared examples of successful government case studies, including the Great Lakes Protection Fund, in which governors collaboratively invested in projects to improve the water basin, and the Save Water, Earn Money program in Punjab, India, that reduced electricity and water use in agriculture. A risk with business model innovation is innovating while still making the economic model work, particularly if the innovation is more costly. With respect to the institutional investment pathway, Prabhala suggested that investors could do a better job of channeling institutional capital into natural capital, such as through the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program of the World Bank. With respect to consumer behavior change, Prabhala noted that there is a need for consumers to make sustainable changes, and businesses can better support them in doing so. Philippe Caradec, Danone North America, spoke about consumption-oriented strategies. He noted that consumers are interested in the value proposition for products, and to be credible and authentic, companies should consider the entire value chain, including the agricultural input, food processing and production, brand commitments, and packaging. Sharing findings from the nationwide International Food Information Council’s Food and Health Survey, Caradec noted that about 60 percent of consumers want food that is produced in a sustainable way, and they use labeling and packaging, among other factors, to determine whether this is the case. Caradec provided background on Danone, including the company’s 2030 goals. He noted that the company is the largest public benefit corporation in the world, as certified by the B Corporation, using business as a force for good. He also highlighted the company’s emphasis on partnerships, including its One Planet Business for Biodiversity, a coalition of 21 companies and organizations worth more than $500 billion that is focused on scaling up regenerative agriculture, product diversification, and supporting high-value ecosystems. Caradec noted that for a portion of its supply of milk in the United States, Danone has changed its business model to reduce the price volatility of milk by using a model that pays for the farmer partner inputs and guarantees farmer partners a specific profit margin, thus allowing the farmer partner to try changes in agricultural practices to increase sustainability at scale without risk to the farmer. Danone also works with farmers to support the implementation of sustainability practices. The Danone Horizon Organic brand’s Next Frontier Project, which is focused on regenerative soil health, farmer care and safety, and reducing the environmental footprint, has a goal of becoming the first carbon-positive brand by 2025. With respect to packaging, Caradec explained how Danone takes a circular approach and aims for 100 percent of its packaging to be reusable, recyclable, or compostable by 2025. Hildreth England, MIT Media Lab, spoke about design strategies for the future food system. Her presentation addressed the benefits of thinking like an artist and a designer and why inclusive co-design strategies optimize the food system for all people and promote resilience. She offered examples of using design to make an impact and co-design principles that are based on her research. England began by sharing an anecdote from her involvement doing user experience testing for a shopping app for mothers participating in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), when a colleague questioned the need for good design. This experience made her realize that good design is a collective good, and all people respond to and deserve good design. England has dedicated her career to making design choices with the people for whom she designs. In considering how to achieve food system transformation, she quoted a former director of the MIT Media Lab as saying, “You can’t change culture by winning an argument. You change culture by changing hearts and minds.” Art and design are the heart of food system transformation, she stated. She explained that behavior change involves triggering emotions like desire that prompt people to act, and culture is “a collection of behaviors at scale shifted by creative perception and production.” England described how one might approach the food system as an artist and a designer. She proposed the need for design strategies that integrate emotions into the supply chain, and she said that co-design principles should be optimized for both products and the people in the center of that chain. She noted that when people are engaged at scale, there is an opportunity to create a more equitable, modular, and sustainable food system. She also highlighted the importance of design co-creation, particularly with marginalized communities, to balance academic expertise with lived experience and provide for more equal and scaled distribution of the design benefits. The food system is built on existing inequities and injustice, and co-design allows for the creation of tools that support more equitable outcomes and help to build social resilience. England shared a few examples of organizations that use codesign principles, including a playbook for guiding diners toward plant-rich dishes in food service from the Better Buying Lab at the World Resources Institute; a food See https://foodinsight.org/2020-food-and-health-survey (accessed September 16, 2020). ""Building a More Sustainable, Resilient, Equitable, and Nourishing Food System: Proceedings of a Workshop - in Brief."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2020.

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25988. environment choice architecture platform called Innit that brings consumer packaged goods companies, retailers, and home appliance manufacturers together in a digital platform; IDEO, which is a design firm working with The Rockefeller Foundation that designed place-based, people-centered interventions in the food system; and IKEA’s in-house research and innovation design lab called Space 10, which is exploring more sustainable food and food environment solutions. England concluded by recommending four questions to guide co-designs for food systems transformation, including whether there is flexibility in the designs for co-designers to make changes to stay resilient, to ask who is not at the table, and to ask whether new design is needed and who should develop the solution. Following England’s presentation, Peters asked her for guidance on how to best bring in others as co-designers without implying that the designer has all of the answers. She responded that the design process establishes a power dynamic from the beginning regarding roles and expectations for solutions. She noted the importance of bringing the people who would benefit from the design into the process early and that the role of the designer should be to facilitate and capture the conversation and increase feelings of confidence and self-efficacy in those who are creating the solutions. The final speaker of the workshop, Catherine Kling, Cornell University, spoke about policy approaches to enabling multiple pathways to change. Three key themes from her presentation were: (1) incentives, and primarily economic incentives, drive the food system; (2) efficient systems will often be more sustainable and resilient because they use scarce resources without waste to provide the most value; and (3) market failures, such as asymmetry or lack of information, require policies to correct them. Kling shared her goals for food system transformation, which were consistent with those presented by earlier speakers, and included nutritious diets, farm profitability and working conditions, environmental sustainability, animal welfare, and food safety. She also noted market inefficiencies, including (1) externalities, which are unintended side effects of market production or consumption that impose costs on others; (2) market power, as when a small number of buyers or sellers control the market and control prices; and (3) lack of information about the risks and benefits. Kling pointed out that there are many problems with the food system and each requires a different policy solution. She also noted that markets are agnostic about fairness and equity, and while these issues are not market failures, they should also be addressed through policy. For every problem, it is important to understand the incentive causes and identify the appropriate policy options. Kling used a case study to illustrate her points about agriculture of the Mississippi River watershed, an area covering 40 percent of the continental United States and 57 percent of the farmland. More than 230 million acres of corn, soybeans, and wheat are grown in this area, most of which are used for fuel and animal feed, with only a small amount going to food. Water quality in many of the rivers, streams, and lakes is poor, with a significant reduction in wildlife habitat and biodiversity, and a dead zone the size of Connecticut in the Gulf of Mexico. Kling noted that addressing these challenges would require reducing and optimizing fertilizer use through pricing strategies, as well as changing farming practices through regulation, such as policy changes that would increase prices and improve alignment of incentives in the system. Regarding the role of policy, Kling stated that policy should address the core problem as directly as possible. Multiple problems require multiple responses, she described, and one size does not fit all. Kling explained that policies level the playing field, allow for supply chain management, and facilitate implementation of consumer preferences. Following the presentations, Peters facilitated a discussion with Prabhala, Caradec, England, and Kling. Peters began by asking the panelists which food system transformations require coordinated actions compared to isolated actions by individual companies or governments. Caradec suggested that actions by both individual companies and coalitions are needed, referencing Danone’s work in both areas. Prabhala and Kling noted that when it is difficult for an individual company or farmer to internalize the external costs on their own, a coalition or multisector collaboration may be needed. In contrast, in situations where entities that implement the strategies will realize returns on their actions, there is not a need for external actors. Kling added that individual farmers and growers can only afford to make costly changes when they are all required to do so and everyone’s costs increase simultaneously, leading to higher prices being passed through the chain. Prabhala noted that in situations where collective action is needed, it is essential for an entity to facilitate and organize the stakeholders. Peters asked for input on the role of smallholder farmers in advocating for agroecology and in supporting and leveraging local and indigenous knowledge in food system transformation. Prabhala noted that there are different ways in which solutions can be scaled up, and different models will work in different settings. Caradec stated that outside the United States, many of Danone’s suppliers are smallholder farmers organized into cooperatives. England pointed out that allowing smallholder farmers to continue operating without having to scale up may make them more resilient. However, Peters pointed out that in many industrialized countries, farm size and scale are increasing, and farms may ""Building a More Sustainable, Resilient, Equitable, and Nourishing Food System: Proceedings of a Workshop - in Brief."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2020. Building a More Sustainable, Resilient, Equitable, and Nourishing Food System: Proceedings of a Workshop—in Brief. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25988. have to scale up to stay viable. Prabhala agreed, pointing out that even in places like Africa where there are a lot of smallholder farmers, there is a need to scale up when the entity is too small to implement interventions. He noted that technology and broader economic development can help to support the kinds of transformations in emerging markets that drive productive improvements among small farmers. Peters asked about the role of behavior change in supporting dietary changes that lead to food system transformation. Prabhala noted increased interest in precision nutrition, which would allow for the provision of personalized advice based on someone’s genome. Caradec explained that Danone North America is using public policy to push for the adoption of a diet with greater plant-based nutrition and less sugar. England added that influencing behavior change involves understanding the role of environments, emotions, and psychology in individual food choices. The panelists had a robust conversation about the role of public policy in supporting behavior change. Kling suggested that the role of public policy is to provide people with accurate information and education to allow them to make their own choices, but it is not the government’s role to change people’s behavior. Prabhala noted that people often make poor choices because of lack of information or misinformation. Caradec added that public policies, such as nutrition standards for school meals, WIC, and others aligned with Danone’s stealth reduction of sugar in its kids’ yogurts, can also influence changes in the marketplace. He suggested that other food manufacturers also take action to improve their product portfolios. England highlighted how much of our food environment is shaped by policy, including whether a food is available in schools or where it is placed on a grocery store shelf. She pointed out that just because nutrition labels exist does not mean that people will use them at all times to make decisions. She suggested that punitive policies, such as soda taxes, may be appropriate when balanced with positive incentives. Prabhala agreed that there is a need for mechanisms that penalize people for behaving in ways that impose costs on society, such as incurring health care costs borne by government programs. The workshop concluded with a final question from Peters, asking speakers about their views on shifting the definition of efficiency from getting from less, to getting from less; he asked, “how do we define when is enough?” The speakers’ responses highlighted the complexity of addressing the different dimensions of the food system discussed throughout the workshop. England pointed out that it could be a question of policy and logistics—enough food is produced in the food system, but the challenge lies in the distribution of food to people in need. Caradec described it as a question of caloric and nutrient sufficiency. Prabhala approached the question from a perspective of analyzing the trade-offs between productivity and other consequences, such as environmental harm. ◆◆◆ Farag, Y., and M. Gaballa. 2011.

61442484-e5b8-466b-b833-b572c1d8cffd,"3 Day Military Diet Plan Review: Lose 10 Pounds in a Week? One way you may be able to drop as much as 10 pounds in a week is to try the military diet, also known as the ""3-day diet.​"" That means that while it does work for short-term weight loss, it is not an option for keeping weight off over the long term. Still, if you are in a pinch, it might be just what you need.  In this article, I am going to tell you everything you need to know to successfully lose weight with the military diet.  2. You can make easy food substitutions and still stick to the diet. ​ 4. You can lose weight quickly in a pinch with this diet.   5. You only need the willpower to restrict your eating for several days.  2. You will be low on energy while you are restricting your calories.   5. The diet is not safe and sustainable for long-term weight loss. 6. Since much of the weight you lose is water, you will gain it all back swiftly after the diet is complete. 7. It is easy to walk into this diet without realistic expectations.   ​Best Recommended Alternative for Long-Term Weight Loss: A Low Carb Diet ​Conclusion: The Military Weight Works to Drop a Few Pounds Fast, But the Results are Temporary and the Diet is Unsustainable There is a rumor that the was developed by US military nutritionists to help soldiers quickly get into shape, making you think this is an army diet. First of all, think about what it means to be ​""in shape.​""  Simply losing 10 pounds is not the same thing as getting into shape. Crash diets are notoriously unhealthy.  They involve severe calorie restriction.  While that works to burn fat and lose water weight for some time, it will not help you to gain muscle mass, nor is it a fantastic source of nutrition. So how did the military diet really get developed? If you want to enlist in the military, there are a number of physical requirements you need to meet, one of which is a strict requirement on weight.  If you are above the upper limit, you cannot enlist.  Being even a pound over the limit can disqualify you.  Naturally this means that military hopefuls sometimes find themselves with a deadline to lose weight fast.  To that end, it is sometimes necessary to try and lose up to ten pounds over the course of a week - and thus the creation of the military diet. : The military diet was not actually developed by military nutritionists.  It is simply a way to lose weight quickly. The most likely connection to the actual military is a means for prospective enlistees to lose weight fast to meet qualification requirements. You do not need to be trying to get into the military to use the military diet. Anyone who is in reasonably healthy condition can safely do it over short periods of time. If you do have serious health issues, you may want to stick with a more gradual approach to . You should also not use the military diet if you have unrealistic expectations. Remember, this is a long-term weight loss solution. This can help you to shed a few pounds to fit into that bridesmaid’s dress which is a size too small in time for your friend’s wedding. But it is not going to result in long-term, ongoing .  Many people gain the weight they lost right back again after they are done with the diet. This is in part because much of the weight which is lost is typically water weight, not actual fat.  Even if you do not gain back all the weight, you should not repeatedly engage in this kind of extreme diet in order to keep losing weight. If you do, you will be depriving your body of nutrition.  You also may damage your metabolism. If you are looking for a long-term weight loss solution, I recommend a , which is both healthy and sustainable. If however your expectations are realistic, and you understand that the military diet is ideal only for short-term occasional use, then it may be ideal for your needs. : The military diet is not designed for long-term weight loss.  It can help you drop a few pounds quickly, but you need to pick a healthier, more sustainable diet for long-term weight loss.   With the military diet, you follow a strict diet for 3 days in a row. If necessary, you then repeat the cycle, dieting for another 3 days. You really should not do this more than a couple of times, and it is preferable to only follow the diet for a week.  During this phase, you will stick with a meal plan which restricts your calorie intake for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  During the 3-day period, you will eat between 1,100-1,400 calories per day. For reference, the average man needs to eat 2,500 calories per day to maintain his weight, while the average woman needs to consume around 2,000 calories per day to do the same. If the average man wants to lose weight at the rate of one pound per week, he needs to drop to 2,000 calories per day.  The average woman must drop to 1,500 calories per day to do the same. This gives you a frame of reference to understand just how quickly you can drop weight when you are eating 1,400 calories or less. It is recommended that you check a weight loss calculator and input your age, sex, height and activity level to find out your own calorie requirements before dieting. After the 3-day period is complete, you may resume a normal unrestricted diet.  You should however aim to stick with healthy, low-calorie foods if possible. : On the military diet, you cycle 3 days on a calorie-restricted diet, and 4 days off.   You can rinse and repeat several times if necessary. Now that you know what you can expect from the process, you are probably wondering how and why this helps you to lose weight. If you search for scientific studies recommending the military diet, you are not going to find anything. That is probably because this is a crash diet, and therefore not really something researchers are going to want to focus their time on. Most scientists are going to want to invest their energy in studying diets which are safe and sustainable for long-term weight loss. That being said, the military diet supported by simple math. Let’s imagine for a moment that you are an average man, and that you need to take in 2,500 calories per day to perfectly maintain your current weight. This is a balanced equation.  You are burning 2,500 calories per day and you are eating 2,500 calories per day.  These cancel each other out.  There is no net gain or loss. But imagine you drop down to 2,000 calories per day.  You are still burning 2,500 calories per day, but you are eating 500 fewer than you are burning.  ​So that is a net loss of 500 calories that your body needs to take from somewhere else.  This results in burning fat for energy. Now imagine you drop down to just 1,400 calories per day.  You are now looking at a deficit of 900 calories per day that your body needs to take from its own fuel reserves. You can see why this must necessarily result in weight loss.  Energy after all is neither created nor destroyed. Caloric restriction may work in the shorter term, however over time the body’s metabolism adapt​ by lowering appropriately to food consumption ().   This is the body’s survival mechanism and you won’t burn ​more fat while eating less as your metabolism is lowered. ​Some people who use the military diet make additional claims that the food combinations featured in typical military diet meal plans promote faster weight loss by increasing your metabolism. But this does not make any sense, considering that there is no scientific evidence that such food combinations exist. , and coffee can raise metabolism (, , , ) but science is lacking for other foods and beverages. The other reason this claim cannot be true has to do with the composition of the foods which are typically consumed on the diet. While on the military diet, it is typical to eat foods which are high in carbs and low on protein.  This profile is not good for your metabolism.  If anything, it may slow it down (, ). Another claim which holds no water involves intermittent fasting. Intermittent fasting boost your metabolic rate (, ). But on the military diet, you are not fasting at all.  You are simply eating fewer calories.  There is no science which asserts in any way that calorie restriction has the same benefits as fasting. There is one more reason why the military diet scientifically help you lose weight - but it has nothing to do with burning fat. When you cut down on your calorie intake, your glycogen stores drop.  This can actually reflect quite impressively when you look at your reading on the scale, and it may mean that smaller clothes fit you better for a time. But because you did not actually burn fat to lose that weight, you will gain it back once you resume your normal . The most dramatic weight loss typically occurs in people who do have excess water weight to lose. That means that those dramatic results also tend to be the most fleeting. Reasons the military diet may work based on science: You are losing water weight because of the calorie restriction (but you will soon gain it all back). You are eating fewer calories than you are burning.  Mathematically, that energy has to come from somewhere, and it will come from your body’s own fat stores.  This is true in the short term before your metabolism adapts. Some people think the food combinations in the 3-day diet can help them burn fat faster.  If anything, the opposite is true. Another myth involves intermittent fasting.  This has no basis in reality because the military diet does not entail any fasting. : The military diet is not backed by scientific studies, and much of the reasoning about why it appears to work is faulty.   That said, if you are eating less energy than you are burning, mathematically speaking, you must end up burning fat to supply that energy while your metabolism have not adjusted.   Much of the weight lost on this diet also comes in the form of water weight.   While that is a very real phenomenon, it is also temporary.   One of the reasons the military diet took off is the popular claim that you can lose up to 10 pounds in a week by following it. Is it true?  Well, for some people, yes, for others, no. You lose 10 pounds on this diet if you are overweight to begin with and you restrict your calories quite significantly. If you are already close to your ideal weight, however, you probably are not going to drop 10 pounds. If you do drop 10 pounds, a lot of it will be water weight, as discussed previously.  Once you go back to your normal diet, the weight will come back.  : You may or may not lose 10 pounds over the course of a week.   If you do though, expect to gain most of it back again shortly afterwards. How safe the military diet is all depends on how long you decide to do it.  If you are restricting it to a very short time period (preferably a week), it is unlikely that any sort of grave harm will befall you, assuming you are healthy to begin with. If however you decided to try to use the military diet over an extended time period, you could become deficient in key nutrients.  The first is that the diet is severely restrictive in terms of caloric intake, and the second is that it typically involves a fair amount of junk food.  Junk food amounts to empty calories, and may also be harmful if it is high in sugar or omega-6 .  Also, caloric restriction on the long-term undesirably lowers metabolism (). : The military diet should be safe for most people if the proper timeframe is observed.   Make sure you only ever do this as a short-term diet.  Quit within a week if you can, or a couple of weeks at most.   Never attempt to use this or any other crash diet for long-term weight loss, or you risk nutritional deficiency. If you do want to rapidly shed a few pounds through the military diet, what kind of meal plan can you follow?  Below is a 3-day meal plan which includes foods that are commonly recommended for this diet, , , crackers, fruit and meat.  You will notice that and lunch are pretty much interchangeable.  You can add or remove foods or interchange them as necessary to meet the calorie count you have decided on.  Below you can see a sample meal plan for Day 1 of the military diet.  Here is a sample meal plan for Day 2 of the military diet. Below is a sample meal plan for Day 3 of the military diet.  You will notice some of these foods are unhealthy, like hot dogs (which are processed meat), and ice cream (which is full of sugar).  I have put these foods in the recommended meal plan for the simple reason that they are typical of the military diet, and I want to give you an idea for the diet in its standard, original form. That being said, you do not to eat any unhealthy foods at all. Remember, scientifically there is no evidence which states that any particular food combination promotes a faster metabolism.  So there is nothing special about ice cream, hot dogs, and bread.  For that reason, you should feel free to replace them with healthier alternatives.  Just make sure you check the calorie count when you do this.  After you have completed the 3 days, you can resume your ​""normal​"" diet for the next 4.   I put ​""normal​"" in quotation marks because there are caveats. If for example your ​""normal​"" diet is ridiculously high in calories and junk food, resuming it is just going to undo all your hard work from the previous three days.  In fact, it is recommended that you try to keep your calories down around 1,500 for those four days.  You do not need to be totally strict about it, but you should aim for it. Plus, you need to make sure you are not tempted to binge to make up for your lost calories and spent discipline.  If all goes well, hopefully at the end of the week you will discover that you have shed the unwanted pounds.  If you still want to continue trying to lose weight, you can repeat the diet for another week or so, but at that point I would recommend you quit.  What if you still have more weight to lose at the end of a couple of weeks?  You cannot continue on the crash diet, so I highly recommend a and sustainable for long-term use.  You can read all about low-carb diets and why they work . : The foods and beverages included in the military diet are quite common and affordable.   You will not be eating a lot of food on days 1-3, but you should lose weight because of the calorie restriction.   Try and get your nutrition through healthy fruits and vegetables, and make sure you are getting your protein. This is not a diet which requires you to skip out on caffeine.  You can and tea, and are even encouraged to do so.  Remember, caffeine can actually promote . You should not add sugar or artificial sweeteners to your or tea.  If you do need to sweeten your beverage, a good alternative is a natural sweetener like . I have seen some recommendations that you skip adding cream to , but I am not sure that this is important, considering I have seen the same sources advise ice cream for dessert.  As to soda, you should steer clear of the types which include a lot of added sugar.  But you can shop for other sodas in the section of your grocery store which include like stevia.   These sodas are low in calories and can satisfy your craving.  Avoid other sweeteners such as aspartame Remember, the military diet is not an exact science.  If you want to modify the diet slightly to fit your needs, you should be just fine so long as you keep your calories restricted to the required levels.   It is the calorie restriction rather than the specific foods which promote weight loss.  : If you want to drink caffeinated beverages like coffee or tea, go for it.   Sodas loaded with sugar should be avoided however because of the high calorie content.  Save your calories for nutritional foods. Sure.  Again, all you need to do is keep your calorie intake low while attempting to stay reasonably nutritious with the foods you are consuming.  So if you need to replace meat in the diet, what you can do is substitute in lentils, beans or tofu.  Vegetarian rather than vegan?  Try adding more cheese.  Nuts are also a good option for increasing your protein.  Make sure when you replace one food with another that you recalculate the calories to ensure that you are staying within the limits of the diet.  : The military diet is suitable regardless of whether you You just need to make sure you are getting protein from somewhere. ​Following the tips above increases the chances you will lose weight on the military diet. ​ while you are on the diet.  This will help you feel fuller. ​Make sure you shop for groceries you start the diet, so you can maintain your discipline. Resist the urge to binge on the ​""off​"" cycle of the diet. Consider replacing some of the unhealthier foods in the diet with healthy alternatives, but make sure your calorie counts still add up.  Where you can, consider reducing carbs and upping protein. Do try to follow this diet over a long time period. ​Now that you know more about the military diet, let’s briefly go over its advantages and disadvantages.  The meal plans are quite simple, and so is the thinking behind why this diet works.   Following through does not entail a lot of planning.   You do not need to learn how to make any new fancy recipes.   You are just eating really basic foods in really small amounts for a few days.  2. You can make easy food substitutions and still stick to the diet. ​ If you want to adjust the diet to fit your needs and preferences, you can do so with ease so long as you recalculate the calories.   That makes this a friendly option for vegans, vegetarians, and others with special dietary restrictions and requirements.  Some diets force you to go out of your way to shop for rare and exotic ingredients that you cannot easily find at your local supermarket.   On the military diet, you are eating foods which are extremely common, most of which you probably already have waiting for you in your kitchen.  4. You can lose weight quickly in a pinch with this diet.   If you do need to lose weight fast so you can meet a military requirement or fit into a tight dress for a special occasion, the 3-day diet may make a lot of sense.  5. You only need the willpower to restrict your eating for several days.  Longer-term diets and even some short term diets require extended discipline and commitment to get results.   Even some crash diets require you to restrict your eating for a week or more.   With the military diet, you just need three days of discipline in a row.   You can then take a break for four days.  This makes it more likely you will succeed with the military diet than you would with another. : Despite the military diet’s drawbacks, it does have some benefits for short-term urgent weight loss needs. It is cheap, simple, and does not require a lot of discipline to see it through. It severely and unnatural restricts your calories, while also curtailing nutrition. In fact, some of the commonly recommended foods are flat out bad for you, like ice cream.   This is a waste of calories.  It would be better to eat healthy foods.   In fact, I recommend replacing some of the unhealthy foods with healthier alternatives which are still low in calories.   But even if you do this, the diet is still too restrictive to give your body the nutrition it needs. 2. You will be low on energy while you are restricting your calories.   Do not expect to do a lot of intense exercise while you are on the 3-day diet, at least the portion which entails calorie restriction.   This is not to say you cannot work out at all, but you will probably feel quite weak. Not getting to eat as much food as you want is a pain; there really is no getting around it.   It does require discipline, even over a short time period, and you probably will not enjoy it.  A lot of people hate calculating calorie counts because it requires math. While the math involved is not challenging, it does consume some time and energy at the grocery store and later when you are preparing your meals. 5. The diet is not safe and sustainable for long-term weight loss. The fact that this diet is too unhealthy to use over the long-term really is a big restriction in its use.   If you have a lot of weight to lose, you will have to choose a different diet.  6. Since much of the weight you lose is water, you will gain it all back swiftly after the diet is complete. Dropping 10 pounds in a week is very encouraging.  Gaining it all back over the coming weeks is not. 7. It is easy to walk into this diet without realistic expectations.   This is an avoidable drawback, but it is worth mentioning how problematic it is to try a diet without really understanding it. If you have read this entire article top to bottom, you have your expectations reasonably aligned with reality.  You should only try this diet if you understand that it is for short-term use and that the results are temporary.   Otherwise you may be tempted to do it repeatedly over a long time period, which could have adverse health effects.  : Even though the military diet can help you shed a few pounds fast, it is quite detrimental if it is followed for more than a week or two.   ​Best Recommended Alternative for Long-Term Weight Loss: A Low Carb Diet If you are serious about long-term weight loss, you need to make a commitment to a safe, sustainable, healthy long-term diet. Your best option both for rapid weight loss and for overall health is a low carb diet. You can just reduce your carbs while increasing fat, or you can go with a very .  On a diet like this, you reduce your intake of breads, pastas, and other grains.  You also eat very little sugar, if any.  You then up your intake of other healthy food like meat and dairy, vegetables, fruits, nuts and .   You eat more healthy fats as well (it is a myth that fats are bad for you).  If you get your carbs down enough, you can eat a ketogenic diet where your body is principally burning fat for energy instead of carbs. Some people believe is unsafe because they think that the brain require glucose as fuel from carbohydrates. This is a myth.  When your body enters a state of ketosis, your brain cells start getting energy from ketones (, , ). Additionally, a low-carb diet has the following health benefits, all of which are backed by scientific research trials: Increase your HDL cholesterol, which in turn reduces your chances of getting heart disease (, ). Raise the amount of LDL cholesterol in your body while simultaneously reducing the particle size ().  This is another way to reduce your chances of a heart attack. Reduce your triglycerides (), another marker for cardiovascular disease. Reduce your blood pressure, yet another cardiovascular disease risk factor (). Combat metabolic syndrome.  The risk factors for metabolic syndrome are high triglycerides, high blood pressure, high blood sugar, low HDL, and obesity.  All of these risk factors are mitigated through a low-carb diet, which prevents metabolic syndrome in turn. Control your insulin levels, preventing and treating the progression of diabetes ().  This works by providing your body with less glucose.  In some cases, a low-carb diet controls so effectively that it is possible to reduce the dosage of your medication or stop taking it completely.  Shed excess water weight.  While the military diet can help you to get rid of excess water weight, a low-carb diet can do the same thing.  When your insulin levels are properly regulated, as by a low-carb diet, your kidneys are able to function better.  This results in less water retention. Increase satiety so that you are less likely to overeat, preventing obesity and facilitating weight loss (). Improve your mood if you suffer from anxiety, depression, or another mood disorder ().  Lose weight rapidly and effectively over an extended time period (, , ).  You can even get rid of stubborn belly fat ().  This type of fat is extremely unhealthy, associated with a range of health disorders including inflammation, insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction ().  Inflammation is associated with many age-related disorders, so reducing it has a slew of other health benefits. Treat epilepsy, effectively reducing seizures, and in some cases even eliminating them (). Bulk out if you are working out and eating more protein on a low-carb diet (). For a ketogenic diet, the carb would be lower, protein moderate and fat higher. For example, 6% carbs, 22% protein and 72% fat. As you can see, there are many reasons other than just weight loss to try low-carb!  Even though it is a big commitment, you will find that you can still enjoy many of your favorite foods.   Besides, the health benefits and weight loss are worth it.  : A low-carb diet can provide you with rapid weight loss and excellent health benefits.   It is safe and sustainable for the long-term.  So if you are looking for enduring weight loss, consider low-carb instead of the military diet.   ​Conclusion: The Military Weight Works to Drop a Few Pounds Fast, But the Results are Temporary and the Diet is Unsustainable Can you lose 10 pounds in a week with the military diet?   Possibly, but you will gain them back fast.  You also cannot use the military diet for long-term weight loss.   So while it might help you to get ready for enlistment or a special event, it is not a solution for permanently reducing your weight.   For that, you need a diet which is nutritious and which supports your long-term health, like a low-carb or ketogenic diet.

Further research has been done to investigate the different sustainability assessment schemes. the research involves an objective comparison of sustainability performance. The agenda of this research is to compare the three most efficient sustainability assessment schemes namely LEEDS USA, BREEAM UK, and GRIHA INDIA. Bose(2011) noted that there are various aspects which are not been addressed to respond to the Indian context. If you need assistance with writing your essay, our professional essay writing service is here to help! This research focuses on intending on those aspects and comparing them with the two most leading systems of the world that are LEED and BREEAM. This investigation through a comparison of the three assessment systems determines the pros and cons of the existing sustainable parameters. moreover, taking into consideration the similarities of their assessment criteria, benchmarks, energy performance system. The essay focuses on developing countries like India as there is a scope within the sustainability assessment tools to take over the health and well being of society. Despite of individual approaches enhancing sustainability measures in the society rating system were developed which focuses on reducing energy consumption and enhancing the performance of a building for management and construction. The purpose is basically the increase of energy efficiency and increasing the building performance  for their on site work and maintenance. This would help in people’s well being and heath. (J.Burnett, 2008) (M Evans, 2009) As “Energy efficient” is a subjective term, which can be judged individually hence it was necessary to form a common ground and rating or assessment tool.The paper reviews this tools aiming at distinguishing those aspects and declaring a technique to deal with them within the indian rating tool through a comparative study of this method with two of the most leading schemes of the world which are LEED and BREEAM. The study is based on the comparison by their similarities and differences on of their assessment criteria, ratings , and the building performance LEED India is based on per capita energy consumption of the country which is similar to USA , where as it does not match india’s per capita energy consumption as it is very low in comparison to other developing countries . However , for the purpose of this study GRIHA which is widely used in India will be looked upon. Scope of development of the GRIHA assessment tool and enhance its categories making it more advanced and beneficial for the society. The main aim is to analyse how well the current indian GRIHA assessment system evaluates and rates the sustainability of buildings. The comparison is done with the two most leading assessment methods in the world which is LEED based in USA and BREEAM based in United Kingdom. The objective is to identify those aspects which pulls forward a strategy to address them in the indian rating tool through the comparative study. This represents that how adequate is the assessment tool used in India and how it it designed to fit the cultural aspects. Assessment tools evaluates progress against targets of sustainable development within a particular area and therefore enhancing existing observing  and construction techniques and promoting preferred behaviour against targets (Becker, 2004) aspects of studies concern emerge from this assertion: the first concerns the scope of the GRIHA assessment tool in assessment to the LEED and BREEAM. this is completed via a comparative analysis of what is measured through the selection of Key performance signs (KPI); the second interest is in analyzing the quality of the assessment tool from the outlook of its robustness as a method of appraisal inside a given context and in this case is India: that is,  to what extent does the schemes helps a particular context and is customized as regards to socio-cultural aspects of that given context. The research question involves about how the tools asses and how are the different from each other? How can we make structural and understandable comparisons? And how different tools promote different improvement measures for an architectural project The research involves both qualitative and quantitative types of approach that has been adapted to inspect the parameters of sustainability within the rating system. It involves the analysis based on similarities and differences of the LEED BREEAM and GRIHA. Mainly focusing on the shortcomings in the recently developed assessment system like GRIHA and how the other two assessment tools can help it develop further. The robust and credible building scheme plays an immense role in evaluating sustainability credentials and building energy performance.therefore building industry plays a crucial role in the well being of people as well as regional and global resource consumption. The countries which do not have their assessment rating schemes should aim at developing their own terms of assessment based on their own customised schemes for future. The main aim of all the three assessment schemes is evaluation of  the environmental behaviour, energy consumption and the amount of carbon emission in a building. They go through various kinds of environmental problems such as the energy consumption , materiality , water consumption , increase in pollution levels and also indoor environmental quality. These are the assessment tools which were developed with the motive of increasing the concept of environment friendly building construction on this planet. Various countries have come up with their own ways of quantitatively rating the efficiency of the building. Whereas the rating systems are different in every country based on the climatic conditions and cultures. The parameters for judgment varies having the same aim to protect earth by reducing harmful construction (Radu Zmeureanu, 1999) The basis of suitability for such kind of assessment tools in various countries is achieved from the local  minimum standards to form assumptions (Dirlich, 2011) and (Reed, 2011) , although they incorporated aspects of traditional architecture of the surroundings providing a fixed system to rate the building as a common ground to sustainable development. (Kibert, 2008) The need where choices of options are evaluated to determine on a performance basis the preferred option, and that on a regular basis the effectiveness of the favoured option is evaluated thus provides a rationalised method of goal-directed decision- making (Friendand Hickling, 2005). “Sustainable development is development that meets the need of this without compromising the ability of future generation to meet their own needs.” [The United Nations World Commission on Environment and Development]. 2.2 OVERVIEW OF SUSTAINABILITY PARAMETERS OF THREE COUNTRIES Total population of Usa is 4.5% of total world’s population were as uk having the minimum of 0.89% of world’s population . India being highly populated of about 17.13% of world’s population. This helps to understand that the difference in populations should differ in the building sustainability assessment tool within each country India having the maximum population out of the three has 2% of land area whereas Usa has 6% , this is also another crucial parameter for consideration Environmental sustainability parameters also depends on biodiversity and forest cove which is minimum in the uk and max in Usa. Therefore the preservation of natural resource criteria should also vary. India still needs awareness and adapt of sustainable construction within the industry Population under poverty line is another factor which needs to be highly considered by any sustainability scheme for promoting social justice and cultural sustainability within the country. India being highest percentage of poverty population needs to develop koi to address this . (SERVICE, 2001) (Sian Atkinson and Mike Townsend, 2011) Analysis of the Sustainable Parameters of USA, UK and India (SERVICE, 2001) (Sian Atkinson and Mike Townsend, 2011) (India, 2011). Studying the countries and public awareness of sustainable design is scrutinized here by comparing the number of sustainable buildings in all the three countries mentioned in the table above . In this case UK takes the lead with the maximum number of sustainable buildings whereas india having the least number of sustainable building Comparison of main features  of LEED, BREEAM and GRIHA (Sleeuw, 2011) (ICE, 2011) The comparison between all three assessment schemes in accordance to their country of origin is mentioned in table 1 . Following are the main aspects of the sustainability assessment method in all three schemes Our academic experts are ready and waiting to assist with any writing project you may have. From simple essay plans, through to full dissertations, you can guarantee we have a service perfectly matched to your needs. LEED is a process which is known globally as a rating scheme for sustainable buildings. It has assessed in more than 24 countries. (J.Burnett, 2008) The current scenario is based on some necessary conditions and credits for upcoming projects. Every credit is based on various aspects of designing like site, water efficiency , materials and resources, regional priority, energy and atmosphere and indoor air quality. The ratings given in case of energy consumption credit and renewable credit depends on performance achieved. However, one point for all the other credit issues counts for the total points of the building. In LEED, 69 point can be achieved with four levels of awards depending on the number of achieved points. (certified,gold,silver,platinum). There are 2 types of approaches for the assessment method of LEED Credit EA1- optimize energy performance This is a procedure which is followed by the accomplishment of prescriptive measures and is also known as prescriptive compliance path. The whole building energy simulation 2 points are required for each approach. The entire building simulation considers for 14.5% of the total scheme. It uses a simulation program to analyse thermal analysis to specification according to ASHRAE standards (ASHRAE,2006) known as the performance rating method (PRM). There are two types of building models in this method , the first one being the baseline building model and second one is the proposed building model. The calculation of the rating system is based on the annual energy cost against the average cost of the baseline building The LEED system works on the principle of post occupancy and the well being other people. The post occupancy evaluation provides the scheme operators with a valuable feedback on how effective the particular credits are. Also the heat island effect can also be controlled by planting green trees and by using shading devices. Thermal comfort is provided by other schemes but LEED confirms it by verifying after the building is in use. LEED also promotes the use of mechanical ventilators to refine the air quality. It works in reference to the USA climate . (J.Burnett, 2008) Is based on per capita energy consumption of country similar to USA were as it doesn’t work in India’s per capita energy consumption is very low as compared to other developed countries. This is why LEED does not  work for major buildings and therefore is not a scheme for comparison in this research. BREEAM is another sustainable building rating system for buildings in UK. There is a particular benchmark for a building regulation to assess. A new development is in process called the BREEAM international which has been formed for various countries . the various issues on which the assessment scheme depends are energy consumption, transportation, water efficiency, sustainable material, land use management and pollution level. The assessments includes and total of 102 credits which are available . the final score on the credits is determined by the percentage calculated based on the credits available and the number of credits achieved for each category and a weighing factor. (Government,2008) There are 5 levels of awards given by BREEAM to the building.Categorised as Unclassified (<30%), Pass (_30%), Good (_45%), Very Good (_55%), Excellent (_70%) and Outstanding (_85%) . (Sleeuw, 2011) Life cycle cost analysis is a part of the appraisal in BREEAM. (Barlow,  2011  transport seen with great importance on the system. A book named Green Book Live and the Green Guide to Specification for green material has been started by BREEAM  (Sleeuw, 2011) Green star rating for integrated habitat assessment is a green building rating system curated by TERI and developed by the ministry of new and renewable energy , government of india november 1 2007. A vast number of projects across india of varying scale and functions are being developed based on GRIHA guideline. The rating system was started to cater the building industry of india. It is a quantitative and qualitative tool with assessment criteria to measure the environmental performance of the building. It connects 2 aspects of assessment, the existing practicing and the upcoming sustainable concepts within the indian context. It works on various aspects such as reducing thermal stress, improving the energy efficiency of the building,using limited resources. The new scheme implemented by GRIHA for new construction is with five star rating. It focuses on passive design strategies to create thermal comfort. GRIHA qualification requires minimum 32 criterias and their satisfaction. The approval is valid for 5 years with regular audits till the time its valid. (TERI, n.d) The scheme has been started to help design and asses the new buildings or the buildings at an initial stage . the assessment in GRIHA is based on its predicted performance over its entire life cycle . the evaluation is based on these stages Stage 1 – pre construction – this is based in initial times and is of major concern to the kind of soil , kind of land ,the location of the site, kind of vegetation on the site before the building is started , landscape etc Stage 2 – Building planning and construction stage- reduction of energy and conservation of resources for the residents well being. Reuse and utilize resources. Resources which are considered are land water energy air and green cover Stage 3 – maintenance and building operation stage – the maintenance system of a building when its operational , monitoring of energy consumption and occupants health. Climate plays a crucial role while designing with minimum use of energy in the assessment made by GRIHA.In a place like India noise is a major aspect to be concerned about, therefore GRIHA focuses on the reduction of noise pollution in the construction process. Similar to LEED post occupancy in which the building can be inspected anytime in 5 years of validity. In india landscapes are given a lot of importance , so as by GRIHS assessors, less water used in landscapes gives a higher rating with good points. (TERI ,n.d.) Comparison of the Key assessment criteria in the LEED, BREEAM and GRIHA The aim of the research was to examine the capability of the GRIHA  assessment tool now use in a developing country like india by the process of designing , building efficiency and the construction process as the means to judge the efficiency of buildings. The main motive for the research was to check id GRIHA tool in reference to other more widely used tools in the world would be able to compare to other tools. Therefore the most widely used assessment schemes LEED-USA and BREEAM-UK were used to assess the objectivity present in the use of GRIHA-INDIA Coming to a conclusion that BREEAM has the most number of environmental categories and is much more detailed and efficient than LEED and GRIHA. The evaluation process of all the three tools being satisfactory. The upgradation of BREEAM and LEEDS systems have been ongoing since years now , and the scope of their development is getting more refined with the increase in environment categories and life cycle dynamics of environmental change as well as the post occupancy evaluation in case of LEED. There are a various differences to understand.From the rating benchmark it is believed that BREEAM has the most advanced and efficient scoring system and is considered to be the most structured and well planned. It is also seen from the study that BREEAM has larger scope of sustainability with more assessed categories than LEED and GRIHA India being a developing country with the maximum number of people is meant to have special credit categories taking in consideration the health of the community. Therefor a huge difference is there in social cultural and economic aspect. Comfort with the same level of satisfaction cannot be achieved with general system schemes. “A Cross Case Investigation of Sustainability … – University of Lincoln.” Accessed January 9, 2019. http://eprints.lincoln.ac.uk/22589/1/COMPARATIVE%20ANALYSIS%20WITHIN%20LEED%20BREEAM%20and%20GRIHA%20-%20AE%20final%20%20%2800000002%29.pdf. “BREEAM Effectiveness – BREEAM Projects.” Accessed January 10, 2019. https://tools.breeam.com/filelibrary/BREEAM%20and%20Value/The_Value_of_BREEAM.pdf.

Principle of using energy without compromising the needs of future generations Buildings in the produce more energy than they consume. They incorporate rooftop solar panels and are built for maximum energy efficiency. Coal, oil, and natural gas remain the primary global energy sources even as have begun rapidly increasing. is produced and used in such a way that it ""meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs."" It is similar to the concepts of and in its consideration of environmental impacts, however formal definitions of sustainable energy also include economic and social impacts. The to meet the world's needs for electricity, heating, cooling, and power for transport in a sustainable way is widely considered to be one of the greatest challenges facing humanity in the 21st century. Production and consumption of energy emits over 70% of human-caused . Worldwide, nearly a billion people lack , and around 3 billion rely on smoky fuels such as wood, or animal dung to cook. These and are a major contributor to , which causes an estimated 7 million deaths per year. In general, renewable energy sources such as , , and energy are widely considered to be sustainable. However, aspects of some renewable energy projects, such as the clearing of forests for the production of , can lead to similar worse environmental damage than using fossil fuel energy. is a source and has a safety record comparable to wind and solar, but and the risk of major are disadvantages of this technology. Moderate amounts of wind and solar energy, which are energy sources, can be integrated into the electrical grid without additional infrastructure such as and measures. These sources generated 8.5% of worldwide electricity in 2019, a share that has grown rapidly. Costs of wind, solar, and batteries are projected to continue falling due to innovation and from increased investment. Proposed for limiting to 1.5 °C describe rapid implementation of low-emission methods of producing electricity and heat, and a shift towards more use of electricity in sectors such as transport. The pathways also include measures to reduce energy consumption; and use of , such as produced by renewable electricity or with . Achieving these goals will require government policies including , energy-specific policies, and phase-out of . The concept of , for which energy is a key component, was described by the United Nations in its 1987 report . It defined sustainable development as development that ""meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs."" This description of sustainable development has since been referenced in many definitions of sustainable energy. No single interpretation of how the concept of sustainability applies to energy has gained worldwide acceptance. The , and various scholars in the field, include several aspects of sustainability in their working definitions of sustainable energy: Environmental aspects include , impacts on and ecosystems, the production of hazardous waste and toxic emissions, water consumption, and depletion of non-renewable resources. Economic and social aspects include having reliable energy be affordable for all people, and so that each country has constant access to sufficient energy. A woman in rural Rajasthan carries firewood. Using firewood for cooking is labour-intensive and causes harmful air pollution. Two-thirds of people without access to electricity live in sub-Saharan Africa. Providing sustainable energy is widely viewed as one of the greatest challenges facing humanity in the 21st century, both in terms of meeting the needs of the present and in terms of effects on future generations. As of 2016, 940 million (13% of the world) people do not have access to electricity; two-thirds of whom live in sub-Saharan Africa. The lack of electricity exacerbates the , with half of health facilities having no or poor access to electricity in six surveyed countries in Asia and Africa. In developing countries, over 2.5 billion people rely on traditional cookstoves and open fires to burn biomass or coal for heating and cooking. This practice , resulting in an estimated 3.8 million deaths annually, particularly among young children and women who spend much time near the hearth. As of 2017, improved access to clean cooking fuels consistently lag improvements in getting more access to electricity. Additionally, serious local environmental damage, including , can be caused by excessive harvesting of wood and other combustible material. The United Nations calls for ""access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all"" by 2030. According to a 2019 report by the IEA, in sub-Saharan Africa ""current and planned efforts to provide access to modern energy services barely outpace population growth"" and would still leave over half a billion people without electricity and over a billion without clean cooking by 2030. Workers construct a solar panel array structure in Malawi Energy production and consumption are major contributors to , being responsible for 72% of annual human-caused greenhouse gas emissions as of 2014. Generation of electricity and heat contributes 31% of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions, use of energy in transportation contributes 15%, and use of energy in manufacturing and construction contributes 12%. An additional 5% is released through processes associated with fossil fuel production, and 8% through various other forms of fuel combustion. As of 2015, 80% of the world's is produced from fossil fuels. Cost–benefit analysis work has been done by a disparate array of specialists and agencies to determine the best path to decarbonizing the energy supply of the world. The IPCC's 2018 says that for limiting warming to 1.5 °C and avoiding the worst effects of climate change, ""global net human-caused emissions of would need to fall by about 45% from 2010 levels by 2030, reaching net zero around 2050."" As part of this report, the IPCC's working group on reviewed a variety of previously-published papers that describe pathways (i.e. scenarios and portfolios of mitigation options) to stabilize the climate system through changes in energy, land use, agriculture, and other areas. The pathways that are consistent with limiting warning to approximately 1.5 °C describe a rapid transition towards producing electricity through lower-emission methods, and increasing use of electricity instead of other fuels in sectors such as transportation. These pathways have the following characteristics (unless otherwise stated, the following values are the median across all pathways): The proportion of supplied by renewables increases from 15% in 2020 to 60% in 2050. The proportion of primary energy supplied by biomass increases from 10% to 27%, with effective controls on whether land use is changed in the growing of biomass. The proportion from wind and solar increases from 1.8% to 21%. The proportion of primary energy supplied by increases from 2.1% in 2020 to 4% in 2050. Most pathways describe an increase in use of nuclear power, but some describe a decrease. The reason for the wide range of possibilities is that deployment of nuclear energy ""can be constrained by societal preferences."" Between 2020 and 2050, the proportion of primary energy from coal declines from 26% to 5%, and the proportion from oil declines from 35% to 13%. In most pathways, the proportion of primary energy supplied by natural gas decreases, but in some pathways, it increases. Using the median values across all pathways, the proportion of primary energy from natural gas declines from 23% in 2020 to 13% in 2050. Pathways describe more use of for bioenergy and fossil fuel energy. In 2020, around 20% of final energy use is provided by electricity. By 2050, this proportion more than doubles in most pathways. Pathways describe methods to increase energy efficiency and reduce energy demand in all sectors (industry, buildings, and transport). With these measures, pathways show energy usage to remain around the same between 2010 and 2030, and increase slightly by 2050. In 2020, the International Energy Agency warned that the economic turmoil caused by the coronavirus outbreak may prevent or delay companies from investing in green energy. The outbreak could potentially spell a slowdown in the world's clean energy transition if no action is undertaken, but also offers possibilities for a . Main articles: and Global energy usage is highly unequal. Countries such as the U.S. and Canada use 100 times as much energy per capita as some African countries. Increasing is one of the most important ways to reduce energy-related pollution while also delivering economic and social benefits. For some countries, efficiency can improve by reducing dependence on fossil fuel imports, The estimates that 40% of greenhouse gas emission reductions needed for the Paris agreement can be achieved by increasing energy efficiency. Between 2015 in 2018, each year saw less improvements in energy efficiency compared to the previous. In transport, consumer preferences for bigger cars is part of the driver of the slowdown. Globally, governments did not strongly increase their ambition level for energy efficiency policy over this period either. Policies to improve efficiency include , , and . Efficiency slows down energy demand growth so that rising clean energy supplies can make deep cuts in fossil fuel use. The second aspect of energy conservation are behavioural changes. The International Energy Agency estimates that reaching net zero emissions in 2050 will depend on significant behavioural changes. Their net-zero scenario gives an illustration of the type of changes needed: about half of the energy-saving behavioural change derives from transport. Some business flights are replaced by , cycling and walking increase in popularity, as more people use public transport. Energy efficiency and renewable energy are often considered the twin pillars of sustainable energy. Rise in renewable energy consumption from 1965 to 2019 The terms ""sustainable energy"" and ""renewable energy"" are often used interchangeably, however particular renewable energy projects sometimes raise significant sustainability concerns. Renewable energy technologies are essential contributors to sustainable energy as they generally contribute to world , and reduce dependence on resources thus mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. In 2019, solar power provided around 3% of global electricity. Most of this is in the form of based on (PV). Costs of solar PV have dropped rapidly, which is driving a strong growth in worldwide capacity. Solar panels are mounted on top of building or used in connected to the electrical grid. Generally warranted for 25 years, a solar panel will usually generate for longer, although at reduced efficiency, and almost all of it can be recycled. Typical less than 20% of the sunlight that hits them into electricity, as higher efficiency materials are more expensive. The from new solar farms is competitive with, or in many places cheaper than, existing coal plants. produces heat to drive a . Because the heat is stored, this type of solar power is : it can be produced when needed. Solar thermal heating and cooling systems are used for many applications: hot water, heating and cooling buildings, drying and desalination. Globally in 2018, it provided 1.5% of heating and cooling final energy demand. Main articles: and are turned by the of wind and, in 2019, their provided approximately 6% of global electricity supply. consist of many individual wind turbines, which are connected to the network. New onshore wind is often competitive with, or in some places cheaper than, existing coal plants. Onshore wind farms have an impact on the landscape, as typically they need to be spread over more land than other power stations and need to be built in wild and rural areas, which can lead to ""industrialization of the countryside"" and . has less visual impact. After about 20 years wind turbine blades need replacing with larger blades, and research continues on how best to recycle them and how to manufacture blades which are easier to recycle. Although construction and maintenance costs are higher at sea some analysts forecast that, because the winds are steadier and stronger than on land, with future larger blades offshore will become cheaper than onshore wind in the mid-2030s. are one of the most widely deployed sources of renewable energy. convert the energy of moving water into electricity. On average, hydroelectricity is one of the energy sources that emits the lowest levels of greenhouse gas emissions per unit of energy produced, however levels of emissions vary enormously between projects. In conventional hydropower, a reservoir is created behind a dam. In most cases, the biological matter that becomes submerged in the flooding of the reservoir decomposes, becoming a source of carbon dioxide and methane. These greenhouse gas emissions are particularly large in tropical regions. In turn, and climate change can reduce energy generation from hydroelectric dams. Depending on location, the implementation of large-scale dams can displace residents and cause significant local environmental damage. In general, facilities have less environmental impact than reservoir-based facilities, but their ability to generate power depends on river flow, which can vary with daily and seasonal weather conditions. In 2019, hydropower supplied 16% of the world's electricity, down from a high of nearly 20% in the mid-to late 20th century. It produced 60% of electricity in Canada and nearly 80% in Brazil. Reservoir-based hydropower plants provide a highly flexible, electricity supply. They can be combined with wind and solar power to provide peak load and to compensate when wind and sun are less available. Main articles: and Cooling towers at geothermal power plant is produced by tapping into the thermal energy created and stored within the earth. It arises from the radioactive decay of an isotope of potassium and other elements found in the Earth's crust. Geothermal energy is considered renewable and sustainable because that thermal energy is constantly replenished. Geothermal energy can be harnessed to for electricity generation and for heating. The use of geothermal energy is concentrated in regions where heat extraction is economical: a combination of heat, flow and high is needed. Worldwide in 2018, geothermal provided 0.6% of heating and cooling final energy demand in buildings. The of geothermal electric stations are on average 45 grams of per kilowatt-hour of electricity, or less than 5 percent of that of conventional coal-fired plants. Geothermal energy can be obtained by drilling into the ground, very similar to oil exploration, and then it is carried by a heat-transfer fluid (e.g. water, brine or steam). Within these liquid-dominated systems, there are possible concerns of subsidence and contamination of ground-water resources. Therefore, protection of ground-water resources is necessary in these systems. can provide both heat and light where electricity is not available Biomass is a versatile and common source of renewable energy. It is available in many countries, which makes it attractive for reducing dependence on imported fossil fuels. If the production of biomass is well-managed, can be significantly offset by the absorption of carbon dioxide by the plants during their lifespans. Biomass can either be burned to produce heat and to generate electricity or converted to modern such as and . Biofuels are often produced from corn or sugar cane. They are used to power transport, often blended with liquid fossil fuels. Use of farmland for growing biomass can result in . Since is inherently inefficient, and crops also require significant amounts of energy to harvest, dry, and transport, the amount of energy produced per unit of land area is very small, in the range of 0.25 W/m to 1.2 W/m. If biomass is harvested from crops, such as tree plantations, the cultivation of these crops can , , and consume water resources and synthetic fertilizers. In some cases, these impacts can actually result in higher overall carbon emissions compared to using petroleum-based fuels. In the United States, has replaced less than 10% of motor gasoline use since 2011, but has consumed around 40% of the annual corn harvest in the country. In Malaysia and Indonesia, the clearing of forests to produce for biodiesel has led to , as these forests are critical and habitats for endangered species. More sustainable sources of biomass include crops grown on soil unsuitable for food production, and waste. If the biomass source is agricultural or municipal waste, burning it or converting it into also provides a way to dispose of this waste. has many benefits over traditional corn based-ethanol. It does not take away or directly conflict with the food supply because it is produced from wood, grasses, or non-edible parts of plants. However, as of 2020, there have been few , mostly concentrated in Europe. According to the UK in the long term all uses of biomass must maximise , for example by using it in conjunction with carbon capture and storage () when the biomass is burned, and move ""away from using biofuels in surface transport, biomass for heating buildings, or biomass for generating power without CCS"". Due to lack of technologically feasible alternatives, may one of the best uses of biomass, providing that some carbon is captured and stored during manufacture of the fuel. Marine energy represents the smallest share of the energy market. It encompasses , which is approaching maturity, and , which is earlier in its development. Two tidal barrage system, in France and in Korea, make up 90% of total production. While single devices pose little risk to the environment, the impacts of multi-array devices are less well known. Electricity generation related CO emissions in France as of 27 May 2020 with overall CO intensity of 52 gCOeq/kWh. Source: plants have been used since the 1950s to produce a , steady supply of electricity, without creating local air pollution. In 2019, nuclear power plants in over 30 countries generated 10% of global electricity. Nuclear power is a low-carbon energy source, with lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions (including the mining and processing of ), similar to the emissions from renewable energy sources. As of 2020 nuclear power provides half of European Union low-carbon electricity and a quarter of the bloc's total generation. There is considerable controversy over whether nuclear power can be considered sustainable, with debates revolving around the risk of , the cost and construction time needed to build new plants, the generation of radioactive , and the potential for nuclear energy to contribute to . These concerns spurred the . Public support for nuclear energy is often low as a result of safety concerns, however for each unit of energy produced, nuclear energy is far safer than fossil fuel energy and comparable to renewable sources. The used to fuel nuclear fission plants is a non-renewable resource, but sufficient quantities exist to provide a supply for hundreds of years. is a fissionable material used in . The claims several potential advantages over a , including , superior physical and nuclear properties, better resistance to nuclear weapons proliferation and reduced production. Therefore, it is sometimes referred as sustainable. A prospective energy source is (as opposed to used today). It is the reaction that exists in stars, including the Sun. Fusion reactors currently in construction are expected to be inherently safe due to lack of and do not produce long-lived nuclear waste. The fuels for nuclear fusion reactors are widely available , and . On average for a given unit of energy produced, the greenhouse gas emissions of are around half the emissions of when used to generate electricity, and around two-thirds the emissions of coal when used to produce heat: however reducing is imperative. Natural gas also produces significantly less air pollution than coal. Building gas-fired power plants and gas pipelines is therefore promoted as a way to phase out coal and wood burning pollution (and increase energy supply in some African countries with fast growing populations or economies), however this practice is controversial. Opponents argue that developing natural gas infrastructure will create decades of and , and that renewables create far less emissions at comparable costs. The of natural gas are around 40 times the emissions of wind and nuclear energy. Switching cooking from dirty fuels such as wood or to has been criticised and or electricity has been suggested as an alternative. As of 2018, about a quarter of all electricity generation came from modern renewable sources (excluding the traditional use of biomass). The growth of renewable energy usage has been significantly faster in this sector than in heating and transport. A large fraction of the world population cannot afford sufficient cooling or live in poorly designed houses. In addition to , which requires electrification and additional power demand, design and urban planning will be needed to ensure cooling needs are met in a sustainable way. Similarly, many households in the developing and developed world suffer from and cannot heat their houses enough. Existing heating practices are often polluting. Alternatives to fossil fuel heating include , solar thermal, geothermal, electrification (, or the less efficient ) and biomass. The costs of all these technologies strongly depend on location, and uptake of the technology sufficient for deep decarbonisation requires stringent policy interventions. There are multiple ways to make transport more sustainable. usually requires less energy per passenger than personal vehicles such as cars. In cities, transport can be made cleaner by stimulating nonmotorised transport such as . has increased significantly, often due to regulation-driven innovation. use less energy per kilometre, and as electricity is more easily produced sustainably than fuel, also contribute to making transport more sustainable. may be an alternative for larger vehicles which have not yet been widely electrified, such as long distance lorries. Many of the techniques needed to lower emissions from shipping and aviations are still in early in their development. Of final energy demand, over one third is used by industry. Most of that energy is deployed in thermal processes: generating steam, drying and . The share of renewable energy in industry was 14.5% in 2017, which mostly include supplied by bioenergy and electricity. The more energy intensive part of industry have the lowest penetration, where renewables face limitations to meet heat demand over 200 °C. For some industrial processes, such as , commercialization of technologies that have not yet been built or operated at full scale is needed to elimanate greenhouse gas emissions. In theory, the greenhouse gas emissions of fossil fuel and biomass power plants can be significantly reduced through (CCS), although this process is expensive. To compare the costs of wind and solar power with that from natural gas with CCS it is necessary to estimate not just the but the whole system cost. These will depend considerably on the location due to differences in carbon prices, grid enhancements needed for flexibility, and availability of suitable geology for . When CCS is used to capture emissions from burning biomass in a process known as (BECCS), the overall process can result in net from the atmosphere. The BECCS process can also result in net positive emissions depending on how the biomass material is grown, harvested, and transported. As of 2014, the lowest-cost mitigation pathways for meeting the 2 °C target typically describe massive deployment of BECCS. However, using BECCS at the scale described in these pathways would require more resources than are currently available worldwide. For example, to capture 10 billion tons of CO per year (GtCO/y) would require biomass from 40 percent of the world's current cropland. In a facility, water is pumped uphill electricity generation exceeds demand. The water is later released to generate . Solar and wind are sources that supply electricity intermittently depending on the weather and the time of day. Most were constructed for non-intermittent energy sources such as coal-fired power plants. As larger amounts of solar and wind energy are integrated into the grid, it becomes necessary to make changes to the overall system to ensure that the supply of electricity is matched to demand. These changes can include the following: Using , natural gas plants or nuclear plants to produce flexible power Using to store excess solar and wind energy and release it as needed Linking different variable renewable resources, and linking different geographical regions through Reducing demand for electricity at certain times through and use of . , or more specifically , changes so that power supply flexibility is better paid As of 2019, the cost and logistics of energy storage for large population centers is a significant challenge, although the cost of battery systems has plunged dramatically. For instance, a 2019 study found that for solar and wind energy to replace all fossil fuel generation for a week of extreme cold in the eastern and midwest United States, energy storage capacity would have to increase from the 11 GW in place at that time to between 230 GW and 280 GW, depending on how much nuclear power is retired. Energy storage helps overcome barriers for intermittent renewable energy, and is therefore an important aspect of a sustainable energy system. The most commonly used storage method is , which requires locations with large differences in height and access to water. and are being deployed widely. Some contain , now largely some unsustainably. Responsible sourcing of cobalt and more diverse geographical sourcing may ensure a more stable supply-chain; are becoming more popular and are flexible. Environmental impacts can be reduced by and recycling. Other storage technologies such as have been used in limited situations. Current battery technology is able to store quantities of electricity that can power a community for days; research is ongoing into technology that have the capacity to last through multiple weeks of low wind and solar electricity generation. As of 2018, is typically not as convenient as burning fossil fuels. High upfront costs form a barrier for implementation. is common in high latitudes providing heat. is a key part of using energy sustainably, as many mainstream sustainable energy technologies are electrically powered, in contrast to the technologies they replace. Specifically, massive electrification in the heat and transport sector may be needed to make these sectors sustainable, with heat pumps and electric vehicles playing an important role. Main articles: , , and Hydrogen is an alternative to fossil fuels that is zero-emission at the point of combustion. The overall lifecycle emissions of hydrogen depend on how it is produced. Very little of the world's current supply of hydrogen is created from sustainable sources. Nearly all of it is produced from fossil fuels, which results in high greenhouse gas emissions. With carbon capture and storage technologies, 90% of the carbon dioxide emitted during the production of hydrogen could be removed. Some academics say that CCS is needed in the short term because not enough electrolysis will be available in time. Hydrogen fuel can be produced through , by using electricity to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen, and if the electricity is generated sustainably, the resultant fuel will also be sustainable. This process is currently more expensive than creating hydrogen from fossil fuels, and the efficiency of energy conversion is inherently low. Hydrogen can be produced when there is a surplus of intermittent renewable electricity, then stored and used to generate heat or to re-generate electricity. Further conversion to allows the energy to be more easily stored at room temperature in liquid form. Hydrogen fuel can produce the intense heat required for industrial production of steel, cement, glass, and chemicals. Steelmaking is considered to be the use of hydrogen which would be most effective in limiting GHG emissions in the short-term. Twenty per cent hydrogen can be mixed into a natural gas grid without changing pipelines or appliances, but as hydrogen is less energy-dense this would only save 7% of emissions. As of 2020 trials are underway on how to convert a natural gas grid to 100% hydrogen, in order to reduce or eliminate emissions from residential and industrial natural gas heating. Hydrogen can be used to power heavy road vehicles. As it has a low energy to volume content, it is easier to use in than in cars. Use in airplanes is being researched, but despite emitting no carbon dioxide such flights would still impact the climate. Main articles: and According to the IPCC, both explicit and complementary are necessary mechanisms to limit global warming to 1.5 °C. Some studies estimate that combining a carbon tax with energy-specific policies would be more cost-effective than a carbon tax alone. Energy-specific programs and regulations have historically been the mainstay of efforts to reduce fossil fuel emissions. Successful cases include the building of nuclear reactors in France in the 1970s and 1980s, and in the United States which conserved billions of barrels of oil. Other examples of energy-specific policies include energy-efficiency requirements in building codes, banning new coal-fired electricity plants, performance standards for electrical appliances, and support for electric vehicle use. Fossil fuel subsidies remain a key barrier to a transition to a clean energy system. are an effective way to encourage movement towards a , while providing a source of revenue that can be used to lower other taxes or to help lower-income households afford higher energy costs. Carbon taxes have encountered strong in some jurisdictions, whereas energy-specific policies tend to be politically safer. According to the OECD climate change cannot be curbed without carbon taxes on energy, but 70% of energy-related emissions were not taxed at all in 2018.

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/24760. Participants continued the discussion of financing in fields outside of population health by considering clean energy financing as another contemporary case example. Michael Bodaken, the president of the National Housing Trust (NHT), discussed the health benefits of affordable housing, the challenges in financing affordable properties, and creative funding streams. Holmes Hummel, a principal with Clean Energy Works and a former senior policy advisor in the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Policy and International Affairs in the Obama administration, examined aspects of financing energy efficiency and how that affects access and participation in the clean energy economy. Joel Rogers, the Sewell–Bascom Professor of Law, Political Science, Public Affairs, and Sociology at the University of Wisconsin–Madison and the director of the Center on Wisconsin Strategy (COWS), discussed energy efficiency and renewable energy financing. (Highlights are presented in .) To open the session, moderator Mary Pittman, the president and chief executive officer of the Public Health Institute, highlighted several points of overlap between clean energy and health that she drew from publications by the three panelists. A report from the International Energy Agency, for example, included a benefit–cost analysis, which is common in health care. She observed, however, that health care considers cost–benefit, while the energy report referred to benefit–cost, considering the benefits first in order to reduce bias against energy efficiency. The energy articles showed that data are lacking regarding the positive impacts of energy efficiency in the public sector, similar to the challenge of needing ""4 Case Example 2: Clean Energy Financing.""

BOX 4-1Highlights and Main Points Made by Individual Speakers and Participants Public systems supply very basic needs, and inefficiencies within them disproportionately affect people with limited resources. Extremely low-income renters are significantly burdened by high utility bills that consume large portions of their income, and they tend to live in areas where these basic needs are less well provided. (Bodaken, Rogers) Anything with value can be financed. Where there is waste, money can be made by reducing that waste. (Rogers) Place-based strategy development can help to address equity gaps by adding value, reducing waste, and capturing and sharing the benefits of doing both. (Rogers) Inclusive financing structures can allow low-income populations access to cost-effective energy upgrades. Compared to loan-based or debt-based instruments, inclusive financing results in a larger addressable market, greater acceptance of the financing offer, bigger projects that produce deeper savings, and fewer defaults. (Hummel) Housing is an essential component of health. The health sector needs to reach out to the housing sector and to utilities as potential partners; the potential health co-benefits may include mitigating asthma triggers. (Bodaken) Clean energy financing, among other examples of resource reallocation, presents challenges and opportunities to employment (i.e., job loss and job creation) that warrant consideration and thoughtful response.

Another similarity could be seen in short-term variables for tax rates and lifetime benefits for health efficiency, she said. There is a mismatch between the incentives and when the outcomes or benefits accrue. She also observed that there are challenges of silos in both energy and health, referring to an article on indoor and outdoor air quality and the multiple factors that must be addressed simultaneously in order to reap benefits. Finally, she noted a similarity between clean energy and health in terms of the local requirements, different local assets, and local structures that caused those in the energy sector to refine their approach from a generalized state/national approach to an approach that could be implemented at the local level.

NHT is an affordable housing developer, a lender, and a housing policy advocate, Bodaken explained. NHT operates about 4,000 property units along the East Coast and in Chicago and has developed about 25,000 apartments across the United States. Bodaken acknowledged that the health benefits of housing have not historically been the focus of the work of NHT. The mission of NHT was rather to help people get into affordable housing. However, NHT began to hear anecdotally from residents that once their housing had been rehabilitated, they were experiencing unanticipated health benefits such as a reduction in asthma or an increased comfort of living. As an example, he mentioned a property in Southeast Washington, DC, that was taken down to its studs and rebuilt as the first green apartment complex in Washington, DC. Recertified carpets and chemical-free cabinets were among the green features that were installed. The residents reported that they were very happy with the housing and that, for example, a child’s asthma was better and he was not missing school as a result. More recently NHT decided to focus more on energy efficiency and approached the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) about using weatherization funds broadly in affordable housing. Bodaken said that NHT highlighted the potential health benefits as part of the discussion. He referred participants to workshop background materials describing the strong correlation between energy-efficient affordable housing and health outcomes, and he shared several examples. A longitudinal study by the Southwest Minnesota Housing Partnership demonstrated a reduction of about 33 percent in chronic asthma over a period of 5 to 6 years after the energy-efficiency retrofit of its properties, Bodaken said. At the Mission Creek Senior Community in San Francisco, Mercy Housing has instituted health-supported services that have extended some residents’ ability to stay there, delaying their need to move into assisted housing or into nursing homes by 2 or 3 years, and saving the city $30,000 per year. Clearly, there were better health outcomes for the people who were living in affordable housing, and money was saved as well, but Bodaken said that part of the conundrum in these situations is how to allocate resources to pay for these types of programs and initiatives.

Building Sustainable Financing Structures for Population Health: Insights from Non-Health Sectors: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/24760. Bodaken described a model of which he suggested population health might be able to develop an analog. NHT determined that it cost an additional $3,000 per apartment to do an energy efficient retrofit. Although the renovations are good for the tenants, he said, there is no economic reward to the property owner for doing an energy retrofit. In considering what additional financing outside of HUD could be brought to bear to reduce the $3,000 burden, NHT found that private-investor-owned utilities across the United States expend $7.5 billion per year in energy retrofits of schools, hospitals, homes, and other buildings. Tenants, however, reap a scant 0.3 percent of those dollars, even though they contribute to the funding through fees in their utility bills. To address the fact that residents of affordable housing were not getting the benefit of these funds, NHT launched the Energy Efficiency for All campaign, together with the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Energy Foundation in California. The campaign, now in its third year and in 12 states (California, Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, Maryland, Minnesota, Missouri, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Virginia) and the District of Columbia, has secured more than $200 million for energy efficiency in affordable multi-family housing. Bodaken said that utilities were generally unaware of the need until the campaign reached out to them about starting a low-income program that works for rental housing. Most low-income individuals in the United States are renters, he said, and Energy Efficiency for All helped the utilities design and implement more effective utility energy-efficiency programs for owners of affordable housing units. He suggested that it would be very interesting for the utilities to start thinking more about the indirect benefits of energy efficiency, including the benefits to health and to addressing the social determinants of health. Bodaken acknowledged that the process for Energy Efficiency for All has taken a lot of time and resources. He also emphasized the importance of working with good partners. With regard to health, Bodaken said that housing is where the people live and that health or illness in people’s lives is going to happen in their homes. He suggested that the roundtable think about the home as being the place where it all happens and then think about whom they could work with. Upon reflection, he said, perhaps there should be health care partners added to Energy Efficiency for All. He also emphasized the value of working with leaders in the states, in a state-by-state strategy rather than a national strategy. ""4 Case Example 2: Clean Energy Financing.""

INCLUSIVE FINANCING FOR DISTRIBUTED CLEAN ENERGY SOLUTIONS The clean energy revolution is in progress, Hummel said, but added that it is not happening nearly fast enough. Hummel highlighted the relationship between modern energy development and human development and noted that metrics for energy development are often used as indicators for human development. The Human Development Report, issued annually by some multilateral development banks, links increased energy consumption with economic development. The association is so robust and persistent over time that some policy makers thought it was irreversible and perhaps non-negotiable, Hummel said. However, the threats to the environment resulting from energy consumption are causing policy makers and the public to rethink the basis for this link. More than 80 percent of the energy in the global economy is fossil fueled. This dependence is creating hazards to health that stress life-support systems around the world. In 2012 the International Energy Agency (IEA) stated that energy-related carbon dioxide emissions needed to be completely eliminated by 2075 in order to limit the global temperature rise to 2°C. Furthermore, IEA said that achieving a 2°C stabilization target would require a large-scale additional annual investment in clean energy and energy efficiency in the built environment (power, buildings, industry, transport). Coincident with the international assessment, a U.S. assessment of the science around climate change found clear connections between population health and the mitigation of climate change impacts. Hummel summarized the key findings of the report: there are wide-ranging health impacts of climate change, certain populations are especially vulnerable, preparedness and prevention provide protection from the impacts of climate change, and taking action on climate and other types of co-related pollutants can improve health and provide other social benefits. In the United States, the costs associated with extreme weather disasters attributed to a changing climate are not distributed equally, Hummel said. People in the southern states are on the front line of these disasters and are incurring huge losses, despite the emergency aid that is sent. These costs need to be factored into choices made about future invest- See http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/ETP2012_free.pdf (accessed July 25, 2018).

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/24760. ment, Hummel said. The U.S. federal government has also assessed the social cost of carbon, and it factors these values into the cost–benefit analysis of every regulation that would affect carbon dioxide emissions. Previously, Hummel said, a major gap in public policy analysis had been the assumption that carbon dioxide pollution had zero social costs. It is estimated that the social cost over the next 10 to 15 years will be between $40 and $50 per metric ton of carbon dioxide. This type of calculation can have an important and profound effect on the regulatory impact analysis of energy policies. Recovering Social Costs and Harnessing Public Spending The social cost of carbon is a “shadow price,” and it does not affect the economy until someone actually has to pay it. Hummel discussed what it would mean to recover some portion of that social cost for public benefit. Carbon pricing policy in the northeastern states is more advanced than in other parts of the country, Hummel said. Over the past decade, the northeast has generated more than $1.5 billion in public receipts that have then been available for public spending. This is the result of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative cap-and-trade program. Hummel briefly explained that a cap-and-trade program sets a price on carbon that is designed to send a signal to private-sector actors that pollution is not free. In that system companies must pay for the “permission to pollute” by buying allowances that are available to them through an auction. The auction fetches on the order of $3 to $4 per ton of carbon dioxide (ranging from about $1 to $5), which is only 10 percent of the social cost of carbon that the federal government has assessed. This means that even after discounting the social cost of carbon by 90 percent, the northeast produces billion-dollar-scale benefits which are then associated with public spending programs that can be informed by public health experts. Each state determines how the money will be spent, and energy efficiency has been the top investment priority in each of these states except for Maryland (the priority investment in Maryland was in direct financial assistance with paying utility bills). Public spending is not enough to overcome the barriers encountered in the clean energy revolution, Hummel said. The scale of the demand For more information on the social cost of carbon, see https://www3.epa.gov/climatechange/Downloads/EPAactivities/social-cost-carbon.pdf (accessed July 25, 2018). ""4 Case Example 2: Clean Energy Financing."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2018. Building Sustainable Financing Structures for Population Health: Insights from Non-Health Sectors: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/24760. is too big for public spending alone, and the vast majority of the money will need to be sourced from the private sector. Even with private-sector capital, there will be barriers to progress. Multiple factors affect the pace at which mitigation policies are adopted across the United States, including a sensitivity to price impacts. For example, in vulnerable communities (areas in which electricity costs constitute a greater share of household income), there is less enthusiasm for clean energy policies that might increase the cost of electricity. Persistent, underlying conditions of inequality (i.e., poverty) affect the distribution of these impacts. Hummel said that the NAACP has highlighted the dimensions of equity that affect the clean energy future of the United States and has called for directed investment policies to address long-standing environmental injustice and to increase opportunity. Hummel observed, however, that even where those investment policies are in place, barriers to investment persist, producing a clean energy divide. Ninety percent of the persistent-poverty counties in the United States are served by electric cooperatives. These are utilities where the customers have an ownership stake in the utility and a shareholder vote. Co-ops cover more than three-quarters of the United States, serve more than 40 million people, and together buy $40 billion of electricity. Hummel said that the Roanoke Electric Cooperative in Down East, North Carolina, is the only utility in the United States that is led by people of color and serves majority people of color communities. Common qualifying criteria for loans and leases across the United States are home ownership, credit score, and sufficient income. Based on these criteria, Hummel said, nearly all members of the Roanoke Electric Cooperative were disqualified from receiving low-interest loans for investments in energy efficiency. Hummel reiterated the point by Bodaken that more than half of people below median income are renters and, as such, face barriers to entering the clean energy economy, and he added that inclusive financing solutions are needed. Inclusive Financing for Distributed Energy Solutions Pay As You Save® (PAYS®) is a utility financing solution that offers all customers the option to access cost-effective energy upgrades using a proven investment and cost-recovery model that benefits both the customer and the utility, Hummel explained (see ). The utility See http://www.naacp.org/climate-justice-resources/just.energy (accessed July 25, 2018). Pay As You Save® and PAYS® are trademarks of the Energy Efficiency Institute, Inc., of Vermont, which works with both municipal and investor-owned utilities.

Building Sustainable Financing Structures for Population Health: Insights from Non-Health Sectors: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/24760. draws low-cost capital from its usual sources and invests in cost-effective distributed energy upgrades (e.g., better building efficiency, rooftop solar arrays). The utility pays the installer; the customers pay nothing upfront for the upgrades they choose. Costs for the solutions installed are tied to the meters they serve. Costs are recovered on the customer bill with a fixed monthly charge that is less than the estimated savings generated by the upgrade. In this way the customer is then participating in the cost recovery without being personally assigned a debt obligation (and does not suffer the financial sector scrutiny required for upfront loans or leases to join the clean energy economy). The PAYS® solution is an inclusive approach to a clean energy future. There is no consumer loan, lien, or debt; it reaches renters and low-income market segments that are chronically locked out; it leads to higher uptake rates; and it produces deeper energy and carbon savings, Hummel said. Compared to loan-based or debt-based instruments, inclusive financing allows for a larger addressable market, greater acceptance of the financing offer, bigger projects that produce deeper savings, and fewer defaults (see ). Hummel said that the Roanoke Electric Cooperative and several others have been able to demonstrate the success of PAYS® in persistent-poverty regions of the United States. The results have been impressive, Hummel said, resulting in an immediate surge in investment. Hummel shared results from the Ouachita Electric Cooperative in Arkansas as an example. Comparing the first 3 months ""4 Case Example 2: Clean Energy Financing."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2018. Building Sustainable Financing Structures for Population Health: Insights from Non-Health Sectors: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/24760. of its inclusive financing program to the best 3 months of its debt-based program showed that within less than 4 months it was able to double the number of customers; achieve 100 percent opt-in by multi-family rental units and greater than 80 percent opt-in by single family units; and double the scale of capital improvements. As a result, it quadrupled the investment deployment in a community that experiences persistent poverty. Rogers shared his perspective on some of the financing challenges of advancing clean energy approaches. He suggested that by 2050—assuming a world population of nearly 10 billion—energy consumption will likely be more than double what it is today. While the vast majority of energy currently produced is fossil fuel–based, the market share of renewable energy sources (e.g., solar, geothermal) is steadily increasing. Rogers acknowledged the optimism about efforts to address climate change concerns, such as the Paris Agreement and the recent agreement on reducing the use of refrigerants. He noted, however, that even if all of the Paris Agreement commitments are met and pledges fulfilled, the world will still fall far short of the goal to limit global warming to 2°C above what it was in preindustrial times. Energy has a lot of value, Rogers said, and anything with value can be financed. Spending on energy is huge, accounting for about 9 percent ""4 Case Example 2: Clean Energy Financing."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2018. Building Sustainable Financing Structures for Population Health: Insights from Non-Health Sectors: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/24760. of the U.S. gross domestic product, or just short of $2 trillion. The United States consumes about 100 quads of energy per year, and more than half (about 55 percent) of the energy consumed is wasted in various ways. Rogers suggested that the United States wastes more energy in its electric power generation sector alone than Japan uses in an entire year. Where there is waste, he continued, money can be made by reducing that waste. Individuals spend money directly out of pocket for energy and increasing energy efficiency can result in direct savings to individuals. Energy, housing, transportation, water, and other systems are highly connected in terms of cost. Because these systems supply basic needs, inefficiencies within them disproportionately affect people with limited resources. The poor spend a greater percentage of their income on these needs and tend to live in areas where these basic needs are less well provided. Rogers mentioned several initiatives to address these inequities through financing, such as PAYS® (discussed by Hummel, above), and the Property Assessed Clean Energy program for homeowners, which pays for energy efficiency upgrades and recoups the costs through a property tax assessment. Rogers also noted that renewable energy sources are becoming more competitive. The price of solar panels, for example, has dropped about 80 percent, and efficiency has increased significantly over the past 5 or 6 years. One of the main challenges in changing the energy landscape is the presence of fixed costs and fixed investments, which are deeply connected to social and political capital. Change takes time, Rogers observed, noting that there are still homes in the United States that are heated by coal- or wood-burning stoves, despite the broad transition to oil, natural gas, electricity, and other potentially cleaner forms of energy consumption. Investments in many old-style coal-burning power plants are fully amortized, as are investments that were made in other infrastructure for the “dirty energy system.” People see opportunity in resisting change, so they can continue to get money out of older equipment. The Clean Power Plan for existing power plants is aimed at reducing carbon emissions through such measures as converting coal plants to natural gas. Rogers suggested the need for discussions about the limits of that plan, in terms of actually changing the fundamentals of the U.S. utility model. Globally, the world must adapt to a “carbon budget” that is only about 550 gigatons more than today’s usage if it is to avoid the catastrophic temperature increase to 2°C above preindustrial levels, Rogers A quad is a unit of energy that is equivalent to 10 (one quadrillion) British thermal units.

Building Sustainable Financing Structures for Population Health: Insights from Non-Health Sectors: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/24760. said. If the world went on a very strict carbon budget and ramped up all of the renewable energy efforts, particularly solar, the goal would be achievable within 30 years, he said. The problem is not the investment in clean energy, but the fact that there are 2,795 embedded carbon gigatons in booked reserves of oil and natural gas and other carbon sources. This is more than five times the amount that humanity can spend, he pointed out. The booked value of these reserves is in excess of $30 trillion. In essence, he said, saving humanity would take $30 trillion away from the holders of these reserves, which is a significant political problem. Housing, transportation, and energy policies all affect the built environment, and all have considerable effects on public health. These policies are, in general, the outcome of state and local politics, Rogers said. Energy policy is almost entirely set at the state level. Energy policy is also intensely dominated by narrow business interests. Recently, he said, it has also been an area where competitive federalism has become increasingly nationalized, in a particularly problematic way. Unlike justice reinvestment, in the energy arena the fossil fuel companies and utilities have significant power at the local level to push back against clean energy development. The business model is to sell more energy, not less. Rogers noted the increasing difficulty of working in partisan state government environments. He lamented the focus on privatizing public goods, even when such privatization presents challenges for a state’s economy or may not even be in tune with constituent expectations. He raised concerns that this is a dangerous step back from health-based, resiliently financed, community-based solutions. During the discussion following the panel presentations, the speakers expanded on financing approaches for energy efficient upgrades, especially for renters and low-income residents. Participants also discussed the value of place-based strategies that produce co-benefits in fostering equity and considered the impact on workers and communities when an industry changes or leaves an area, resulting in job losses. Russo observed that in the examples that had been discussed, the utilities appeared to not even think about renters at first. She asked for further discussion about the funding for retrofitting buildings and other ""4 Case Example 2: Clean Energy Financing."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2018. Building Sustainable Financing Structures for Population Health: Insights from Non-Health Sectors: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/24760. such projects in rental units. She also wondered whether an energy utility’s only reason for pursuing energy efficiency is because it is regulated and required to do so. Bodaken clarified that nearly everyone pays a utility bill, and most utility bills in the United States include a small fee that goes toward funding energy-efficiency programs (called ratepayer funds). Those fees stay with the utility that collects them, he said. The programs are state- or utility-based and vary from facility to facility (i.e., this is not a federal requirement). There are still some utilities that do not have energy-efficiency programs. As discussed, the Energy Efficiency for All campaign is not generating new resources, but rather is reallocating existing resources to those who need them most. In this case, most people who are poor rent their homes, and extremely low-income renters are significantly burdened by high utility bills that consume large portions of their income. Reallocating existing energy-efficiency resources toward rental housing accounted for a relatively small amount of money, but it is an approach that can begin to show an impact on an annual basis. The strategy, Bodaken suggested, is that once a utility company sets up a program, a nonprofit developer, such as NHT, can leverage that program along with its other resources to rehabilitate rental living spaces. Sometimes utilities do this type of initiative on their own, but more often it is other groups that lead the effort. Rogers pointed out that energy-efficiency programs are a relatively small part of a utility company’s overall budget. He noted that there are private-sector energy service companies that serve both public and private clients and that make their money through energy efficiency. They establish energy performance contracts in which the energy efficiency upgrades are financed and then repaid through the accrued savings (similar to the PAYS® example described by Hummel). Hummel added that the inclusive financing programs he described do not use utility ratepayer funds as they do not provide the level of funding needed for the scale of the problem. They look to the same sources of public and private financing that are used to build substations, extend transmission and distribution lines, or pay for smart grid upgrades. Hummel said that there are convergent interests between utilities and their customers in distributed energy solutions. Financial analysis of utilities involved in inclusive financing has shown large-scale benefits to the utilities in reducing their costs for peak demand. Hummel suggested that this could be likened to addressing the cost of emergency department care in the health sector. ""4 Case Example 2: Clean Energy Financing.""

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/24760. Place-Based Strategies That Provide Co-Benefits and Foster Equity Pittman observed that all of the speakers raised the issue of equity in their presentations and highlighted the mismatch between those in power and where the dollars are most needed. For example, she reiterated Rogers’s point that the booked value of current carbon reserves is $30 trillion, but action at the state and local levels is directed toward the people who are most affected (e.g., by unemployment due to change in energy generation). Rogers responded that place-based strategy development can help address this gap by adding value, reducing waste, and capturing and sharing the benefits of doing those two things. Place-based approaches can be used in a variety of policy areas, including energy efficiency, transportation, and housing, and they can be pursued in alliance with the business community. It is possible for businesses to be profitable by “taking the high road,” Rogers said, noting that many firms are willing to pay workers decent wages and provide pensions and other benefits in order to produce a quality product. The challenge is that their “low road” competitors (firms that are not willing to treat employees as valuable assets) are constantly threatening their profit margins. Furthermore, Rogers said, the “high road” companies do not have effective champions in the political arena in most states. He observed that there are many smaller communities that have lost significant human capital (which can be seen in, for example, the increasingly empty high schools that are being shuttered). The members of these communities have, in a sense, lost the narrative of their lives, and they often turn against each other and against those who are even more vulnerable. There is a healing process that needs to occur, Rogers said. The people in these communities have the same interest in having clean water, good local schools, or broadband Internet access as residents of cosmopolitan areas do, he said, and he suggested the need for urban–rural progressive political coalitions. Bodaken agreed with the place-based approach and suggested that most Americans do not really want to relocate to some distant place and give up their identities in the process. He predicted that electric utilities will need to change their entire way of doing business in the relatively near future. Some states, including California and New York, are beginning to change how they operate with regard to power generation, he said. In Maryland, the government sought to build a new, billion-dollar power plant on the Eastern Shore and explained to local citizens that they would have to pay more for their electricity once that power plant was built. After the residents responded that they did not want that power plant in their community, the company developed a strong energy efficiency program that actually reduced resident’s costs and provided jobs. Bodaken acknowledged that such approaches cannot address the $30 trillion of embedded investment in carbon energy sources, but it is a start, ""4 Case Example 2: Clean Energy Financing."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2018. Building Sustainable Financing Structures for Population Health: Insights from Non-Health Sectors: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/24760. and there are co-benefits to consider as well, such as the health of the community. From a financing perspective, insurance companies would likely have a significant interest in reducing their members’ exposure to contaminants from traditional power-generation approaches. Rogers concurred with the importance of co-benefits in these approaches, and he reminded participants to look for such co-benefits as they might not be obvious. He cited Bodaken’s example of the apartment complex in the District of Columbia that was stripped down and rebuilt as a green building and how residents were happy with their rent and the space, but they were most pleased about the unexpected co-benefit that their children were healthier and were not missing school because of asthma attacks. Hummel pointed out that clean energy clearly has the advantage over traditional energy sources when all the social costs of pollution are counted. In the current market conditions, many of these costs are externalized by the companies and then internalized by society. As discussed, those costs are not spread equally. Hummel advocated for 100 percent clean energy, which means clean energy for everyone. Many current financing solutions in use are disqualifying large segments of the population. Hummel suggested that inclusive financing options can produce inclusive results and can accelerate the rapid scaling-up of the necessary capital deployment. Inclusive financing can also help to build a political constituency for the policies that will change the market conditions framing private-sector investment decisions. There is good work to be done at the intersection of energy, environment, and finance, Hummel said, and public health benefits can accrue when people who are burdened by energy costs are relieved of the sacrifices they make to keep the lights on. Bodaken described a longitudinal study that is assessing the public health benefits of upgrading the energy efficiency of 8,500 apartments in Chicago, New York, and San Francisco. The findings will available in 2020. The study is being done by the JPB Foundation, in partnership with the National Center for Healthy Housing; the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai; the University of California, San Francisco; and the University of Illinois at Chicago. Flores said that corporate maneuvers, such as changing where energy is sourced, are not necessarily transparent to the public. Enormous amounts of money are exchanged, and those involved are far outside the realm of middle-class and lower-class America. All that the consumers understand is that they are not necessarily any better off. Flores stressed that policy discussions should include representation from labor organi- ""4 Case Example 2: Clean Energy Financing."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2018. Building Sustainable Financing Structures for Population Health: Insights from Non-Health Sectors: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/24760. zations and from the communities that will be affected by these significant changes. For example, shifts in energy policy will affect people employed in the coal or oil industries, and the towns where these industries are can be decimated when jobs are eliminated. Flores stressed the need to have solutions for the people who will no longer be employed or who will lose a major portion of their income as a result of these shifts in energy policy (e.g., retraining, re-employment). Rogers said that his center at the University of Wisconsin has released three reports on the issues facing people displaced by changes in the industry and on the likelihood of reemployment in other sectors (; ; ). He suggested that there will be numerous employment opportunities in the United States to either create or maintain the clean energy infrastructure that will be needed going forward. One issue will be whether displaced employees will be willing to move to where the new jobs are. Bodaken agreed with the concerns raised by Flores. The answer will probably be a combination of re-employment (i.e., of displaced energy sector workers) and defining the new jobs and determining what the required skills and training are. Bodaken noted that NHT previously purchased solar panels that were manufactured in China, but this year and last year they were able to buy solar panels from a company in Buffalo, New York. He agreed that there are jobs being created in the United States, but he added that there will also be potentially millions of jobs lost. Hummel likened the impending economic dislocation to what took place at the end of the whaling industry or during the decline of the tobacco industry following public health anti-smoking campaigns. For most of the 20th century the eastern Kentucky region has been the source of most of the coal burned in the most densely populated parts of the United States, Hummel said. It has also been the site of massive fossil fuel extraction. Inclusive financing programs for clean energy in the coal fields of Kentucky have demonstrated that this approach can be successful in a region with persistent poverty, Hummel said. Hummel referred participants to a 1990s tobacco settlement in which public health experts were instrumental in framing the costs and benefits to society of managing the dislocation of workers. The point from that example is that workers who lose their employment in the energy sector should be given the opportunity to access education and support for entrepreneurship to pursue jobs in any part of the economy and should not simply be tracked from one part of the energy sector to another. The goal should not be simply neutrality or doing no harm, Flores said, but recompense. For example, perhaps new factories for solar panels could be built in the communities that are losing other employment. Financing should be embedded in places where there has been disinvest- ""4 Case Example 2: Clean Energy Financing."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2018.

Reinvesting in these places and populations across America can help to build back equity. Rogers agreed with the need for strategic reinvestment in the infrastructure and industries necessary to make the clean energy transition in the United States equitable. He added, however, that this approach will not solve all of the problems in these areas of poverty and that there are other issues beyond the energy sector that are affecting these populations and that need more attention. A participant pointed out that these arguments are finding their way into the political conversation and cited an example of a person running for office calling for plans to help those displaced in the shutdown of a refinery in the area.

In October 2016, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine’s Roundtable on Population Health Improvement hosted a workshop to explore sustainable financing structures that reflect a recognition of the health and non-health factors that shape the well-being of U.S. communities. The goals of the workshop were to learn from the long-term, sustainable financing strategies used in other sectors, to explore how those approaches could be applied to population health, and to consider structures that work across sectors. This publication summarizes the presentations and discussions from the workshop. 2 Sustainable Financing Structures for Population Health: Historical Patterns and Insights for the Future 5 Realigning Resources for Population Health: Small Group Conversations Appendix C: Sustainable Financing Structures for Population Health: Historical Patterns and Insights for the Future: Commissioned Paper You're looking at OpenBook, NAP.edu's online reading room since 1999.

Shake it up by tossing in some spectacular greens. Here's a guide to some of the best types of lettuce, greens and chicories to add to your salad. Lisa Kingsley Updated October 14, 2019 A big green salad is the little black dress of the culinary world. It suits nearly any occasion, can be simple or sophisticated, dressed up or down. The foundation of most salads is a broad spectrum of lettuces and salad greens-and there is a distinction between the two. Lettuces are a subset of salad greens. There are three main types of lettuce: crisphead, butterhead and loose-leaf. Crisphead lettuces-such as iceberg and romaine-grow in very tightly clasped round heads. Romaine lettuce grows in elongated heads. Each leaf has a substantial rib running along the center. Loose round rosettes of tender butterhead leaves take well to light dressings, such as a simple shallot-mustard vinaigrette. Mildly flavored loose-leaf lettuces grow in open layers in very loosely formed heads and often have ruffly leaves. Common loose-leaf lettuces are red and green oakleaf. Salad greens comprise a larger group of leafy vegetables, such as arugula, watercress and the chicories, which also make great additions to your salad bowl. Toss up a mixture of lettuces and salad greens for a more interesting texture and flavor. 15 Great Greens to Add to Your Salad Bowl Red-Leaf Lettuce The red-tipped leaves of this loose-leaf lettuce are a variant of green-leaf lettuce. They add a spark of color to salads. Romaine Lettuce The crisp, elongated leaves of this lettuce are the main ingredient in classic Caesar salad. Butterhead Lettuce These beautiful rosette-like heads have soft, buttery-textured leaves. Common varieties include Boston, Bibb, and Buttercrunch. Iceberg Lettuce Created in the 1940s for its ability to travel long distances, this crunchy lettuce is the base for two salads-the chopped salad and the wedge salad-that are now considered cornerstones of American comfort food. Green-Leaf Lettuce The ruffly, mild-flavor leaves of this loose-leaf lettuce are good for both salads and layering on sandwiches. These tiny leaves-also called lamb's lettuce or corn salad-have a nutty flavor and delicate texture. A quick-growing, peppery salad green that stars in most mesclun mixes. Baby arugula has a more mellow flavor and larger-leafed mature arugula is more intensely spicy. Watercress In the wild, watercress, a vivid green plant with delicate round leaves, grows along running waterways and has fresh, pungent flavor with peppery heat. Dandelion Greens The leaves of this common ""weed"" contribute pleasant bitterness to salads. Some varieties have leaves with smooth edges-others are jagged. Puntarelle, a type of chicory (see page 191), has a similar taste and appearance. This mix of tender young greens can include leafy lettuces, arugula, frisée, spinach, chard, dandelion, mustard, radicchio and mâche, and soft-stemmed herbs such as parsley, dill and chervil. Chicories can be loose-leafed or in tight heads, tapered or round, smooth or frilly. Colors range from white to pale yellow to all shades of green to wine red. Their common characteristics are a structural sturdiness and a distinct bitterness that balances the sweeter, more delicate lettuces with which they are often combined. Common types include curly endive, frisée, escarole, Belgian endive and radicchio. Belgian Endive The broad, scoop-shape leaves grow in tightly closed tapered heads. There are both white/pale green and white/red varieties. Very similar in flavor to broader-leaved curly endive, the fine, frizzy leaves of this chicory add interesting texture to salads. 'Chioggia', the most common variety of this intensely flavored chicory, grows in heads of wine-red leaves with bright white veins. The large outer leaves of these leafy, lettuce-like heads have a hearty flavor and subtle bitterness, while the pale yellow heart is tender, juicy, and faintly bittersweet. Curly Endive Sometimes simply called ""chicory,"" this jagged-leafed green adds a structural sturdiness and distinct bitterness that balances the sweeter, more delicate lettuces. How to Buy the Best Salad Greens Choose dense, heavy head lettuces with bright color and no browning on the outer leaves. Choose loose-leaf lettuces that have crisp leaves with no signs of wilting. Salad greens should have good color with no yellowing, wilting or brown spots. Washing Salad Greens Wash and thoroughly dry greens just before use-dressing adheres better to dry greens and extra water dilutes the flavor of the dressing. We like to use a salad spinner: Separate the leaves of head lettuces and loose-leaf lettuces. Add cold water to within 1 inch of the top of the bowl, fill the basket two-thirds full with greens and submerge in the water. Soak greens at least 5 minutes. (Repeat if your greens are particularly dirty or sandy.) Lift out the basket, discard the water and return the basket to the spinner. Cover and spin the greens until dry. Blot any remaining water with a kitchen towel. How to Store Salad Greens Store lettuces in a plastic bag in the crisper in the refrigerator. Crisphead and romaine lettuces can be stored up to 1 week. More delicate butterhead and loose-leaf lettuces can be stored up to 5 days. Store loose salad greens in a plastic bag wrapped in a paper towel in the crisper in the refrigerator up to 3 days. Grow Your Own Lettuces & Salad Greens Lettuces and salad greens are perhaps the easiest of all vegetables to grow. Picking a beautiful salad from your backyard minutes before a meal is deeply satisfying. Start head lettuces indoors 6 weeks before the last frost date and transplant outdoors 3 weeks before the last frost date. Sow other types of lettuces and salad greens directly in the soil in early spring or fall. Choose a site with loose, well-drained soil, enriched with compost, in sun to part shade. Keep the soil moist, cool and free of weeds. As seedlings grow, thin to 4 to 6 inches apart (eat the young plants as you thin them). Harvest lettuces and salad greens when they reach the desired size. Cut head lettuces about 1 inch above the lowest leaves. As soon as loose-leaf and romaine lettuces are big enough to spare a few leaves, snap off individual leaves from the outer edges of the head. Baby lettuce blends or mesclun can be cut with scissors about 1 inch above the lowest leaves.

Explore this delicious eco-friendly fish. Nicci Micco August 12, 2009 https://static.onecms.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/44/2009/08/27125655/tilapia.jpg Nutrition experts urge us to eat more fish; yet, worldwide, we're already consuming seafood at a rate that is not sustainable. Wild fisheries are overexploited and, some say, fish farmed in traditional open pens can pollute surrounding water. What's an environmentally conscious consumer to choose? In terms of sustainability, you can't beat tilapia from a tank, says Michael B. Timmons, Ph.D., professor in the biological and environmental engineering department at Cornell University and author of Recirculating Aquaculture (Cayuga Aqua Ventures, 2007). Tilapia are low on the food chain and adaptable-basically, easy to cultivate. And people have been doing so for years: a bas-relief on a 4,000-year-old Egyptian tomb shows tilapia held in ponds. Today nearly all tilapia farmed in the U.S. are raised in self-contained aquariums that purify and recycle water. These so-called recirculating aquaculture systems often employ ""biofilters""-microorganisms that feed on nitrogen-to treat wastewater. Bacteria break down some fish waste into nitrogen (which the microorganisms absorb for fuel) and other organic compounds that can be used to grow plants and algae, which are fed back to the fish. Sediment is removed from the tanks mechanically, and 99 percent of the water is recycled. ""It's a highly efficient system,"" says J. Emmett Duffy, Ph.D., professor of marine science at The College of William and Mary in Gloucester Point, Virginia. The system (which can be used to grow nearly any fish) is particularly efficient when you're raising tilapia, omnivorous fish that can get all the nutrients they need from small plants, algae and bacteria. Carnivorous fish, such as salmon and tuna, on the other hand, need to eat smaller fish. ""Farming carnivorous fish has a fairly significant environmental impact,"" says Duffy. ""Scouring the ocean for the prey fish can harm ecosystems."" Tilapia don't just survive on simple plants and microorganisms, they thrive on them: tilapia utilize nutrients more efficiently than other fish, thanks to a digestive tract that, extended, is about 13 times their body length. (A trout's is less than three-quarters the length of its body.) ""That gives them a lot of time to extract nutrients,"" says Timmons. And because tilapia are so good at converting plant fuel into high-quality protein, they're an economically wise choice. ""Tilapia is by far the most sustainable commercially available fish,"" says Timmons. So what's the catch? Not all tilapia farmed worldwide are cultured in recirculating systems. So try to buy tilapia grown stateside. Likely, its source won't be identified. Ask at the fish counter.

These tips will help turn your metabolism into a fat-burning machine. Metabolism. It's the set of life-sustaining chemical transformations within the cells of living organisms. It's such a big concept that it's understandable to feel as if it's beyond your control. But that's not true! If you're wondering , we've rounded up the 50 best quick and easy ways to rev your fat-burning furnace to help you reach your that much faster. If you want to weigh less, you've got to eat less, right? Well, if , it can cause your body to lose muscle mass, which will decrease the rate of your metabolism. Plus, when you skimp on calories, your body slows the rate at which it burns calories to conserve the fuel it's got. ""Under-fueling is just as risky as over-fueling,"" explains Carolyn Brown, MS, RD at in Manhattan. Lisa Moskovitz, RD, CDN, of the agrees: ""In an attempt for quick, noticeable weight loss, many people wrongfully believe that eating as few calories as possible is the best solution. Not only can this lead to numerous nutritional deficiencies as the body is getting less food overall, but it can also actually have the opposite effect on weight loss."" Instead of cutting calories like crazy, use the simple diet and exercise hacks below that can help you slim down quickly and safely without screwing up your metabolism. Even when you're at rest, your body is constantly burning calories. In fact, 60 to 80 percent of the calories that you burn each day are being used up just keeping you alive, according to research published in . show ""resting metabolic rate"" and total calories burned is much higher in people with more muscle because every pound of muscle uses about just to sustain itself. If you can pack on just five pounds of muscle and sustain it, you'll burn the caloric equivalent of three pounds of fat over the course of a year. : Learn how to the smart way. When it comes to the , neither weights nor cardio can completely move the needle on their own. Interval training is the best way to shed pounds, increase your metabolism, and improve insulin sensitivity. One  study found that 20-minute HIIT workouts helped women lose 5.5 more pounds and gain more lean muscle mass over the course of 15 weeks than women who did long, steady cardio workouts. At the gym, sign up for a HIIT class, or turn your favorite aerobic exercise, (running, biking, even walking) into an interval workout by adding periods of intense speed (start with 30 to 60 seconds) followed by periods of rest (normal speed) for the same amount of time. Do this six to 10 times to complete a fat-slashing workout. As you get better, slowly increase the amount of time of increased intensity. The more muscle you have, the more calories you burn—no matter what you're doing. Hitting the gym helps you build muscle and eating protein keeps your gains from breaking down and slowing your metabolic rate as a result. has found that because protein is more difficult for the body to break down and digest than other nutrients, it can . Aim to incorporate some protein into every meal and snack throughout the day. Metabolism-boosting foods high in protein include: Protein needs differ by individual, but typically consuming 0.8 to one gram of protein per kilogram of body weight per day should be sufficient enough to fuel weight loss, says , MS, RD, CDN, a New York City-based dietitian. For a 130-pound (59 kilograms) person, that would equal between 46 and 58 grams of protein. It takes the body extra effort to break down whole grains than more refined and processed grains, like the flour ordinarily used to make bread and pasta. You can help keep your metabolic rate elevated by consuming foods that the body has to work harder to digest, as shown in a  study. Pomona College researchers found that consuming whole foods increased your post-meal energy expenditure by 50 percent compared to eating processed foods. Your go-to foods that boost metabolism are whole grains that are also rich in fiber. Stephen Colbert's doing great, but now it's time to DVR him and start getting to bed earlier. A study in Finland looked at sets of identical twins and discovered that in each set of siblings, the twin who slept less had more visceral fat. If you do nothing else differently, just getting an extra half hour of shuteye will make all the difference. If you're chronically sleep deprived, don't be surprised if you gain a few pounds without eating a morsel of extra food. ""A lack of sleep can cause several metabolic problems,"" says nutritionist and Holistic Health Coach . ""It can cause you to burn fewer calories, lack appetite control and experience an increase in cortisol levels, which stores fat."" Lack of sufficient sleep—under the recommended seven to nine hours a night for most adults—also leads to impaired glucose tolerance, a.k.a. your body's ability to utilize sugar for fuel. ""We all have those less-than-adequate nights of sleep,"" says nutritionist , MS, CDN. ""But if it's a regular thing, you're better off lengthening your night's sleep than working out, if fat loss or weight maintenance is your goal."" Research has found that people burn fewer calories when they sleep during the day and log their waking hours after the sun's gone down. To come to this finding, researchers at the studied 14 healthy adults for six days. For two days, study participants slept at night and stayed awake during the day, then they reversed their routines to mimic the schedules of night owls. When participants slept during the day, researchers found that they burned 52 to 59 fewer calories than they did while catching their Zzzs in the evening—likely because the schedule messed with their circadian rhythm, the body's internal clock that plays a major role in metabolism function. If you have no choice but to sleep during the day, aim to cut 50-60 calories from your daily diet. Not only are beans a great source of plant-based protein, they're also packed with both soluble and insoluble fiber. The process of digesting the fiber and protein in beans burns extra calories, and both types of fiber help lower insulin levels after digestion and cause your body to store less fat. Think of every bean as a little metabolism-boosting pill. One found that people who ate a ¾ cup of beans daily weighed 6.6 pounds less than those who didn't—despite bean eaters consuming, on average, 199 calories more per day. Stress can actually cause the body to metabolize food more slowly, according to research published in the journal . To make matters worse, the food we crave when we're stressed out tends to be fatty and full of sugar. Researchers say that the combination of high-cal cravings and a stress-induced, snail-paced metabolic rate can result in significant weight gain. To increase your metabolism, fight stress with laughter. Research shows that smiling and laughing causes levels of stress hormones to diminish. If there's one supplement most Americans should be taking, it's vitamin D. It's essential for preserving metabolism-revving muscle tissue, but researchers estimate that a measly 20 percent of Americans take in enough via their diet. While you can nail 90 percent of your recommended daily value (400 IU) in a 3.5-ounce serving of salmon, popping a daily supplement is pretty convenient. 68 IUs per 3 ounces White Albacore tuna (11% DV) Drink a glass of water in the morning when you wake up For nutritionist Lisa Jubilee, one of the best and cheapest ways to give your metabolism a jolt is to drink water (she suggests 20 to 32 ounces) shortly after waking. Why? During sleep, your body's metabolic function slows down, and unless you wake up in the middle of the night to swig some water, you're not taking in any fluids. Jubilee suggests completely rehydrating before stressing your body with any other food or drink. ""My clients who have implemented this report less bloating, more energy and a smaller appetite,"" she says. Her motto for getting your inner furnace stoked and ready for the day: ""Rehydrate, then caffeinate!"" Weight loss doesn't get easier than this: Simply drinking more water may increase the rate at which healthy people burn calories, according to a study in The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism. After drinking approximately 17 ounces of water (about 2 tall glasses), participants' metabolic rates increased by 30 percent. The researchers estimate that increasing water intake by 1.5 liters a day (about 6 cups) would burn an extra 17,400 calories over the course of the year—a weight loss of approximately five pounds! ""Always be prepared for a busy or unpredictable day by keeping on you, at your desk, in your car,"" says Amy Shapiro, MS, RD, CDN, . Shapiro says that if you have to skip breakfast, lunch, or even dinner during your quest to look your best, you can keep your energy levels up while making healthy choices. ""You'll have no reason to run to the vending machine for chips or stick your hand in the candy bowl,"" she says. Shapiro recommends eating snacks to keep your metabolism humming such as: Yeah, yeah, it has zero calories, but drinking diet soda may yet play havoc with your goal of having a flat belly. Research published in the journal  shows that artificially sweetened beverages may screw up the body's normal metabolic response to sugar, actually increasing appetite! Increasingly, diet drinks are being linked to weight gain, metabolic syndrome and a host of other ills. (Find out .) A 2003 study in the demonstrated that a low-calorie diet that's rich in almonds could help people shed weight. Not only do the good monounsaturated fats in almonds have an effect on insulin levels, say scientists, but also give dieters a feeling of fullness, meaning that they are less likely to overeat. So stock your pantry with almonds, walnuts, and . The smoothie revolution is here, and lots of people are swilling down bushels of leafy greens. Believe it or not, there's a downside to this ingenious delivery method. A big part of the body's job—breaking down food so that the body can absorb nutrients—has been outsourced to our Nutribullets and Vitamixes. That means that the body is expending much less energy than it would if we were eating kale, spinach, and bananas in their solid form. are great for weight loss, but by prioritizing lean meats, fish, fibrous vegetables and fruit, you are driving up TEF (the ""Thermic Effect of Food,"" or your metabolic rate after eating) and expending more calories on digestion. There are plenty of fish in the sea, but salmon may be the best one when you're trying to find out how to increase metabolism. That's because most cases of underactive thyroid are due to inflammation of the gland, and salmon boasts significant anti-inflammatory properties thanks to its rich omega-3 fatty acid content. In fact, a study in the looked at the effects of weight loss and seafood consumption and showed salmon to be the most effective at reducing inflammation—better than cod, fish oil, and a fish-free diet. Iron deficiency affects more than 1 in 5 women in the U.S. Being deficient in essential minerals can show up in all kinds of ways, such as fatigue and anemia, but an iron deficiency can also be a blow for your metabolic health. See, your body can't work as efficiently to burn calories when it doesn't have what it needs to work properly. On the other hand, when you treat iron deficiency with sufficient iron intake, you can lose weight and improve metabolic parameters such as lowering blood pressure and levels, according to a  study. you can add to your diet to boost metabolism include: 1 cup iron-fortified breakfast cereal, 100% DV iron Bodybuilders have long sworn by eating every few hours to keep their muscles fueled, but don't discount the weight loss potential of three squares a day. A study in the journal put two groups of men on weight-gain diets. One group divided the calories among three small meals with snacks in between while the second group ate the same number of calories in three square meals. While both groups gained weight, researchers found that belly fat—the dangerous kind that increases heart-disease risk—only increased in the high-meal frequency group. While drinking in moderation every so often won't do too much harm to your waistline, making it a habit can slow down your metabolic rate. Why? When your body has a cocktail to break down, it takes precedence over any food that you've already eaten that's waiting to be digested. This slows down the entire metabolic process. On the occasions that you decided to indulge, stick to . Alternate your alcohol with water to slow your pace, and cut yourself off after two drinks. Avoid ordering high-cal bar food like fries and burgers. An important note: in moderation can have numerous benefits, including weight loss! Shuck one for your metabolism. Heck, make it a half dozen. After all, oysters are one of the best dietary sources zinc—a mineral that's critical for thyroid health. In fact, the body needs enough zinc to activate production of thyroid hormone. And, in turn, we need enough thyroid hormone to absorb zinc. Any way you look at it, deficiencies are likely to result in a sluggish metabolism, and supplementing with the mineral has shown to get weight loss back on track. One study in found that obese people who consumed 30 milligrams of zinc per day—the equivalent of just six raw oysters—had improved BMIs, lost weight, and showed improvements in blood cholesterol levels. Get shucking! Probiotics in products like and fermented foods like pickles and sauerkraut help good bacteria in the gut process food more efficiently. Not only is yogurt a great source of protein and calcium, a study found that eating it as part of a reduced-calorie diet can help shrink your waistline. And you can incorporate it into dishes throughout the day. Coffee is one of the because it boosts your metabolism. A study published in the journal found that caffeine revs the sympathetic nervous system and increases lipolysis (aka fat burn). A cup of black coffee is a good pre-workout beverage, too: Researchers found that cyclists who took a caffeine supplement were able to ride about a mile farther than those who took a placebo. Make yours a venti and skip the sweeteners. Have a few cups of java for a metabolism boost, but if you're never seen without a mug at your lips, that could work against you, says nutritionist Amy Shapiro. Caffeine is a natural appetite suppressant. If you're constantly consuming it, you may not eat much—or realize how hungry you really are—until you get home for dinner. ""Not eating enough throughout the day can make your metabolism sluggish,"" she says. ""By the time you eat dinner, instead of immediately using that food for energy, your body is aggressively storing it as fat, just in case it will be deprived again."" Stick to three to four cups of coffee a day to keep your caffeine intake under control. It's like butter that grows on trees. But instead of the cholesterol, trans fats, and saturated fats in real butter, contains metabolism-enhancing monounsaturated fat. And that's not all. Each creamy fruit is also packed with fiber and free-radical-killing antioxidants. Free radicals are destructive rogue oxygen molecules—natural byproducts of metabolism—that trigger various chain reactions in the body that destroy cells and DNA, causing all kinds of health problems. Antioxidants in fresh fruits and vegetables can help neutralize some free radicals, but they can't reach the mitochondria—the base camp for the free radical army—and that's a problem. When your mitochondria aren't working properly, your metabolism runs less efficiently. Enter: Avocado. A found that monounsaturated-rich oil pressed from the fruit can help mitochondria become more resilient. Researchers say the results jive with low-disease rates in Mediterranean countries where olive oil—nutritionally similar to the avocado—is a diet staple. ""Hormones dictate how our body utilizes the energy we give it,"" says nutritionist Lisa Jubilee. ""Between our reproductive, thyroid and growth hormones, appetite, insulin, and hunger hormone leptin and ghrelin, our bodies have to perform a tricky balancing act to keep us lean, energized and viable reproductive beings."" Those tasks have become much more difficult because of the hormone residues we consume via cage-raised foods. If you want to give your metabolism a leg up, Jubilee says, switch to organic, grass-fed, pasture-raised beef, eggs, and dairy products, thereby avoiding those nasty hormones at mealtime. Calcium and vitamin C team up well to boost metabolism. Broccoli contains both nutrients, not to mention the kind of fiber that's been shown to increase TEF. What's more: Broccoli contains a compound that works on a genetic level to effectively ""switch off"" cancer genes, leading to the targeted death of cancer cells and slowing of disease progression. It's no joke: Genuine laughter may cause a 10–20 percent increase in basal energy expenditure and resting heart-rate, according to a study published in the . That means a 10-15 minute giggle fest could burn up 40 to 170 calories. Let us hear you lol! Add mustard to your meal, and feel the burn—literally! Scientists at England's Oxford Polytechnic Institute found that by eating just one teaspoon of mustard (about 5 calories) can boost the metabolism by up to 25 percent for several hours after eating. The benefits, researchers say, may be attributed to capsaicin and allyl isothiocyanates, phytochemicals that give the mustard its characteristic flavor. Forget slogging on the treadmill for hours, research printed in the journal showed that people who did five 30-second bursts of max-effort cycling, followed by 4 minutes of rest, burned 200 extra calories that day. That's just 2.5 minutes of work for a resting metabolism boost that will last 24 to 48 hours! It's well reported that fiery capsaicin (think: hot sauce, cayenne, chili) can rev up the metabolism, but study findings presented at the Experimental Biology meeting in Anaheim, California, showed similar weight loss potential in dihydrocapsiate (DCT), the non-spicy cousin of hot peppers. Participants who ate the most DCT experienced a metabolic boost that was nearly double the placebo group! Bottom line: Pile on the poblanos! A striking new suggests that simply turning on the AC may subtly transform a person's stores of brown fat, the ""good"" fat stimulated by cold temperatures, that serves to keep us warm by burning through ""bad"" fat stores. Participants spent a few weeks in bedrooms with varying temperatures: a neutral 75 degrees, a cool 66 degrees, and a balmy 81 degrees. After four weeks of sleeping at 66 degrees, the men had almost doubled their volumes of brown fat. Cool! One study in the put two groups of men on identical weight loss diets. The only difference? Half of the group ate their throughout the day while the second group reserved carbohydrates for nighttime. The result? The nighttime carb group showed a significantly higher diet-induced thermogenesis (meaning they burned more calories digesting their food the next day). On the other hand, the daytime-carb group showed increased blood sugar levels. Experts believe that when you give yourself large gaps between your carb intake (like fasting overnight), your body is more equipped to deal with your intake of blood-sugar-raising carbs when you have them next. Not only is vinegar great on salad, it's also shown to ""switch on"" genes that release proteins that break down fat. In a study of 175 overweight Japanese men and women published in , researchers found that participants who drank one or two tablespoons of apple cider vinegar daily for 12 weeks significantly lowered their body weight, BMI, visceral fat, and waist circumference. Although it's true that egg whites are low in calories, fat-free, and contain most of the protein found in an egg, eating the entire egg is beneficial to your metabolism. The yolk contains many metabolism-stoking nutrients, including fat-soluble vitamins, essential fatty acids and—most significantly—choline, a powerful compound that animal can prevent the storage of fat around your liver. Worried about cholesterol? have found that moderate consumption of one to three whole eggs per day has no negative effect on 70 percent of the population's lipid (fat) profile and . Our bodies need dietary fat—particularly healthy oils—in order to lose weight and function properly. The right kinds of fats and oils help quash hunger, maximize your metabolism, and speed nutrients through your body by helping to absorb fat-soluble nutrients. , like olive oil, can actually help the body to burn calories and lose weight compared to low-fat diets. Additionally, show extra virgin may also increase blood levels of serotonin, a . If you always opt for coffee over , you could be missing out on a major metabolism boost. A found supplementing exercise with green tea can actually boost weight loss. In fact, after 16 weeks, rats experienced a body mass reduction of 27.1 percent and an average abdominal fat mass reduction of 36.6 percent. What's green tea's magic? The brew contains catechins, a type of antioxidant that triggers the release of fat from fat cells and helps speed the liver's capacity for turning fat into energy. Studies conducted at The Nutrition Institute at the University of Tennessee suggest that consuming dairy may help your body metabolize fat more efficiently. have shown that increased calcium intake from dairy products (though not from supplemental calcium carbonate) caused study participants to poop out more fat as opposed to it sticking around on the body. Ideally, we sleep about eight hours for every 24. Most people spend another seven to ten hours sitting at their desk. That means most of us spend the overwhelming majority of our time sedentary. Our bodies weren't designed for this level of inactivity—most of humans' evolutionary history involved being active, searching for food and fuel. Nutritionist Lisa Jubilee says that one way to burn more calories daily is to stand more and sit less. She cites a British study which found that standing at work burned 50 more calories per hour than sitting. If that doesn't sound like a lot, consider this: If you stand for just three hours of your day, in one year you'd expend more than 30,000 extra calories—which amounts to about 8 pounds of fat! have shown that garlic supports blood-sugar metabolism and helps control lipid levels in the blood. Adding garlic to foods that are rich in fats and carbohydrates may keep those substances from doing the damage they're known to do. What's more, eating garlic can help boost your immune system, help ward off heart disease, fight inflammation and lower blood pressure, to name a few. In a , lucky participants ate about 1.5 ounces of dark chocolate daily for two weeks. Ultimately, these chocolate nibblers had lower stress-hormone levels and a more regulated metabolism than a control group. Scientists speculate that chemicals in cocoa, such as flavonoids, play a role in regulating metabolism by alleviating stress that can cause your fat-burning engines to go on the fritz. Should you think this is a license to go wild, take heed: We're talking small amounts of high-quality dark chocolate. Researchers say 1.5 ounces is enough. Want to have a faster metabolism? Install apps like f.lux or Twilight on your devices. They reduce certain parts of the light spectrum as your bedtime approaches. Studies have shown that LED lights in phones disturb the production of the sleep hormone melanin. A purring metabolism is greatly helped by a good night's sleep. So take your late-night texting down a notch or two… At least in terms of screen brightness. You might want to think twice before ditching dairy if you're trying to lose weight—despite what your Paleo-preaching CrossFit friends tell you. Cheese is a satisfying, portable, and inexpensive food that's packed with calcium, vitamin D, and protein. ""Calcium can also promote weight loss because it helps maintain muscle mass, which boosts and helps maintain metabolism, helping you burn calories more efficiently throughout the day,"" says , RD, author of The Miracle Carb Diet: Make Calories & Fat Disappear—With Fiber! That doesn't mean you can help yourself to a cheese-drenched casserole, though. Work cheese into fiber-rich snacks to make them more satiating. Caffeine may provide a bit of a boost to the metabolism, especially when ingested before exercise, but no amount of metabolic boost can burn off the empty calories that energy drinks supply. According to one study published in , a typical energy drink serves up a quarter cup of sugar—calories that hit your body all at once and trigger fat storage. If you want to burn calories, try the miracle beverage known as tap water. A new report from the Credit Suisse Research Institute found that more and more of us are choosing whole-fat foods over skim, lite, fat-free or other modern monikers of leanness. And while many health organizations like the American Heart Association still want us to cut down on fat—particularly saturated fat—this full-fat trend may be a healthy rebellion against those decades-old credos, according to recent studies. In fact, people who eat a lot of dairy products actually have the lowest incidence of diabetes, according to a 2015 study of 26,930 people in the . Those who ate a lot of low-fat dairy products, on the other hand, had the highest incidence. The researchers speculated that while calcium, protein, vitamin D, and other nutrients in yogurt are indeed good for us, we need the fat that goes along with them in order to reap their protective effects. Eating an apple each day can help prevent metabolic syndrome, a disorder associated with abdominal fat, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. They'll keep the doctor away and your muffin tops at bay because apples are a low-calorie, nutrient dense source of fiber, which studies have proven to be integral to reducing visceral fat. A recent found that for every 10-gram increase in soluble fiber eaten per day, visceral fat was reduced by 3.7 percent over five years! Studies show that those who eat the most fiber gain the least weight over time and that eating fiber can . Aim for about —the amount present in about three servings each of fruits and vegetables. Experts agree that including a weekly into your healthy-eating plan can actually help you reach your weight loss goals. Plus, a recent study published in the , discovered that dieters who took a two-week break from their low-calorie meal plan lost more weight than those who dieted consistently. Having a strategy is key: ""By planning your cheat meal, you know what you'll be eating and can cut a few extra calories earlier in the day,"" says , RD, ACSM Health Fitness Specialist and owner of Jim White Fitness & Nutrition Studios. ""This also allows you to really pick a favorite food instead of wasting calories on something you didn't enjoy."" Contrary to popular belief, researchers now say breakfast doesn't kickstart the metabolism and may not be the most important meal of the day. A study in the had more than 300 overweight participants consume diets that included either eating or skipping breakfast. At the end of 16 weeks, dieters who ate breakfast lost no more weight than the breakfast skippers. And a second study in the same journal found eating breakfast had zero impact on resting metabolism. Breakfast is an ideal place to squeeze protein, fiber, and other nutrients into your day, but if the choice is a doughnut or nothing, opt for the nothing. Start your day with lean protein, which burns twice as many calories during digestion as fat or carbs. But don't stress about squeezing it in before 9 a.m. This antioxidant-rich, traditional Chinese tea not only helps keep cholesterol levels in check and aids digestion, it can also help rev up your metabolism. Like green tea, oolong is packed with catechins, which boost weight loss efforts by improving the body's ability to metabolize fat. A study in the found that participants who regularly sipped oolong tea lost six pounds over the course of six weeks. © 2020 Galvanized Media. All Rights Reserved.

Written by Last Updated: Your bodyweight depends on your total caloric intake more than on your macronutrient ratios (how many of your calories come from carbohydrates, proteins, fats, and ). Increased caloric intake as an independent variable is more than sufficient to explain the current obesity epidemic, without the need to find a scapegoat, such as high-fructose corn syrup. A trial in a controlled setting (a metabolic ward) compared several isocaloric diets composed of 15% protein, 15-85% carbohydrate, and 0-70% fat. It concluded that caloric restriction, not macronutrient ratios, determined weight loss. Comparing low- and high-carbohydrate diets over 6 weeks and 12 weeks led to the same conclusion, as did comparing a low-fat/high-protein diet with a high-fat/standard-protein diet. Another trial in a metabolic ward noted that, in healthy individuals overeating for 8 weeks, caloric intake alone accounted for the increase in body fat. However, caloric expenditure, total weight, and lean mass increased with protein as a percentage of caloric intake. In contrast, a previous study on the impact of protein on weight loss had noted that women lost as much weight on a high-protein diet as on a high-carb diet, but that subjects with high triglycerides lost more fat on the high-protein diet. In people suffering from hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, or type-2 diabetes, the results are mostly the same: Caloric restriction, not macronutrient ratios, leads to weight loss. Two studies noted, however, that lean mass was better preserved in women (but not men) on a high-protein diet, and one study did find a greater weight loss (nearly entirely from fat) in the high-protein group (men and women). In conclusion, losing weight requires a negative energy balance, which can be obtained by eating less, as we have seen, but also by exercising more. Independent of your diet’s macronutrient ratios, a negative energy balance (consuming fewer calories than your body needs) is responsible for weight loss. Many diets, fad or not, do work. This is mainly they reduce calories. Several diets restrict your carbohydrate intake. The ketogenic diet is very high in fats, low in proteins, and very low in carbohydrates. The Atkins diet is high in fats, high in proteins, and very low in carbohydrates. The “paleo diet” (hunter-gatherer diet) is high in fats, high in proteins, and low in carbohydrates. Fats and proteins digest more slowly than carbohydrates, so are more satiating. In addition, most diets (including the three already mentioned) recommend the consumption of foods that are less calorie-dense (more fibers and a higher water content: a pound of broccoli packs less calories than a pound of grains). Finally, carbohydrates participate in the synthesis of serotonin, which can cause cravings in some obese individuals. You can also refer to our page on to figure out the exact number. Therefore, people on a low-carb diets lose weight because they naturally eat less and avoid the large binges caused by carbohydrate cravings. People on very-low-carb diets can also lose weight very quickly on the short term because the depletion of their glycogen stores leads to the excretion of bound water. That explains why two trials found that people on a low-carb diet had lost more weight than people on a low-fat diet after 6 months but not 12. Consuming your macronutrients together (balanced diet) or separately (dissociated diet, also known as “food combining”) makes no difference with regard to weight or fat loss. Since prolonged fasting might increase heat expenditure, diets that manipulate fasting (Intermittent Fasting, Alternate Day Fasting) may have some benefits on the “calories out” side of things.

Written by Last Updated: Your bodyweight depends on your total caloric intake more than on your macronutrient ratios (how many of your calories come from carbohydrates, proteins, fats, and ). Increased caloric intake as an independent variable is more than sufficient to explain the current obesity epidemic, without the need to find a scapegoat, such as high-fructose corn syrup. A trial in a controlled setting (a metabolic ward) compared several isocaloric diets composed of 15% protein, 15-85% carbohydrate, and 0-70% fat. It concluded that caloric restriction, not macronutrient ratios, determined weight loss. Comparing low- and high-carbohydrate diets over 6 weeks and 12 weeks led to the same conclusion, as did comparing a low-fat/high-protein diet with a high-fat/standard-protein diet. Another trial in a metabolic ward noted that, in healthy individuals overeating for 8 weeks, caloric intake alone accounted for the increase in body fat. However, caloric expenditure, total weight, and lean mass increased with protein as a percentage of caloric intake. In contrast, a previous study on the impact of protein on weight loss had noted that women lost as much weight on a high-protein diet as on a high-carb diet, but that subjects with high triglycerides lost more fat on the high-protein diet. In people suffering from hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, or type-2 diabetes, the results are mostly the same: Caloric restriction, not macronutrient ratios, leads to weight loss. Two studies noted, however, that lean mass was better preserved in women (but not men) on a high-protein diet, and one study did find a greater weight loss (nearly entirely from fat) in the high-protein group (men and women). In conclusion, losing weight requires a negative energy balance, which can be obtained by eating less, as we have seen, but also by exercising more. Independent of your diet’s macronutrient ratios, a negative energy balance (consuming fewer calories than your body needs) is responsible for weight loss. Many diets, fad or not, do work. This is mainly they reduce calories. Several diets restrict your carbohydrate intake. The ketogenic diet is very high in fats, low in proteins, and very low in carbohydrates. The Atkins diet is high in fats, high in proteins, and very low in carbohydrates. The “paleo diet” (hunter-gatherer diet) is high in fats, high in proteins, and low in carbohydrates.

Please support us! As the global population grows, so does demand for food production. More people mean a greater need for more calories and nutrition from farmers and food manufacturers. And that, in turn, means an increased pressure on the planet to provide enough water, space, plant nutrients, and ideal climate to produce more food. There’s no escaping the limitations of the environment. In realizing this, farmers and scientists are both seeking ways in which to produce food more efficiently. They recognize the need to change the current system because it is simply not sustainable. Animal agriculture dominates our world’s food system despite the fact that it is highly inefficient as an enormous amount of resources are needed to produce the meat and animal products consumed across the world. Around of land worldwide is dedicated for grazing livestock, while of land is allocated for growing feed. In addition, around of the world’s freshwater supplies are used for agriculture, about one-third of which is for livestock feed. Not to mention, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that livestock production is responsible for 14.5 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, while other organizations like the have estimated it could be as much as 51 percent. Seeing as the planet is set to reach a population of nine billion by 2050 and with it a growth in meat production for the foreseeable future, it’s important that we ask ourselves how to meet the demand for this food product. We need to produce faster supplies, larger supplies and supplies that eat up less money and resources. So, scientists and farmers have begun to experiment with many ideas to make meat more readily available to the growing masses. Let’s take a look at some of the “efficient” ways scientists and farmers have attempted to produce meat, and discuss where these ideas come up short from an environmental standpoint. “Genetically modified” is certainly a popular and controversial topic these days. How does it impact the environment? Is it safe for human consumption? And how many lab rats are we going to put through the ringer to answer these questions? Currently, none of the meat or dairy available for consumption is genetically modified. And is the only genetically modified meat that is closest to being available for human consumption. With growing demand for meat, it is understandable that scientists and farmers want to guarantee that production is as bountiful and efficient as can be. But tinkering with the genetics of meat poses the same risks that genetic modification of any organism can hold. What about the threats to genetic diversity of agricultural animals that comes with genetic modification? Genetic diversity, or a variety in a specie’s genes, is vital for keeping the species as a whole healthy. It can help a species overcome challenges like disease and guarantees the entire population has a variety of adaptations and characteristics in its arsenal for survival. So why would we want to add a “sameness” to the genetic code of animals through genetic modification? Scientists have already noted a lack of genetic diversity in commercial chickens, making them more susceptible to disease. And if genetically modified salmon, or “frankenfish,” were to escape their aquaculture operations, they could cause entire species of wild salmon to go extinct. It’s obvious that some genes may be desirable in animal agriculture, but having a variety of genes in an animal population is actually ideal. By eliminating genetic diversity in beef cattle or farmed salmon, we risk harming not only the supply of animals as a food source, but also the lineage and viability of the species themselves. So, if we’re not going to tinker with the genes of animals we consume for meat, why not at least pump up the animals with growth hormones to maximize the output of the product? First, this isn’t a bodybuilding competition. Second, those little additions to your steak probably aren’t so good for you or the environment. While the use of certain hormones and steroids in animal agriculture may be approved by the government, many disagree on exactly how safe they really are. or rbGH has been used in dairy cows since 1993 to increase milk production. Sadly, lameness, mastitis, and reproductive problems in cows receiving rbGH have also increased. In response, more antibiotics are administered which end up in the surrounding environment and even your dairy products. This attempt to maximize output from animal protein really ends up creating bigger problems. Pumping up beef cattle with steroids is another common attempt to maximize output. Unfortunately, it’s wreaking havoc on the environment. The various hormones administered to beef cattle end up being excreted and entering waterways as well as soil surrounding feedlots. Fish especially are sensitive to the hormonal soup they’re exposed to, and end up with altered reproductive habits and gender characteristics. And it’s not just animals that may experience the detrimental effects of hormones used is beef cattle- humans are also believed to experience damage to their endocrine systems when exposed to conventional meat. Insects are seen by some as the answer to our animal protein shortages. The UN touts insects as being , and may even be an underutilized source of livestock feed. In comparison to traditional animal protein sources, for water, food and space and emit less pollution in return. Other than this food source being less appealing to modern Westerners’ palates, what’s wrong with insects as a protein source? A investigated which diets offered the most efficient conversion to protein in crickets. The crickets were fed a variety of foods including various grains and organic waste. At the conclusion of the study, scientists found that the crickets that ate a grain diet resembling poultry feed yielded the best nutritional results. And, underwhelmingly, they yielded a nutritional output that mirrored poultry. No real improvement in efficiency there. Growing insects for human consumption can also carry some of the same that other animal agricultural operations carry. Large operations can harbor disease, fungus, and bacteria. Insects exposed to animal manure in their food sources may take on , pesticides, and heavy metals accumulated in the waste. Even insects collected from the wild carry similar risks considering what they may have been exposed to prior to harvest. While insects are considered food sources in many cultures around the world, they do not appear to be an efficient solution for growing food demand. With increasing demands for meat produced in a sustainable and humane way, scientists have turned to as a possible solution. Essentially, cells are taken from a living animal and added to a petri dish filled with a nutrient-rich medium. The cells reproduce and, after some time, you’ve got a slab of beef! Okay, it’s a bit more complex than that, but that’s the basic idea. So, meat without murder, factory farms, and pollution? This is an intriguing idea, but there are still some flaws. First, this technology is still pretty new and pretty expensive. In 2013, scientists cooked up the first petri-dish burger patty in London. The project was the result of five years of research and the ! That’s probably out of the price range of many consumers. Even though in vitro meat is produced without directly being harvested from an animal, there are still that go into production of this kind of meat. Imagine the piles of petri dishes required to grow each piece of meat. And the massive labs needed to keep the meat at ideal growing conditions. Plus, the meat, which is technically muscle tissue, needs to be “exercised” by machines to stretch the product. You can’t just throw some cells into a dish and let them grow for a few months – there’s a lot of input into the process to make sure everything goes to plan. Despite the attempts of many individuals to feed a global demand for meat, it is easy to see where their efforts fail. Producing meat in these new and interesting ways may decrease some of the impact that meat production has on the environment, but it still falls short compared to a vegetable-based diet. Try as they might, meat producers just can’t match the efficiency of plants, nor the wonders a plant-based diet can do for animal welfare and the environment. If you think that picking a veggie burger over a beef burger or a salad over a salmon filet is gentler on your home planet, you’re right! that our global food system dominated by industrial animal agriculture is at the heart of our environmental crisis. This destructive industry currently occupies over half of the world’s arable land resources, uses the majority of our freshwater stores, and drives greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, this system causes rampant air and water pollution, land degradation, deforestation and is pushing countless species to the brink of extinction. And yet, one in eight people still suffer from food scarcity. “This is not just an animal welfare or environmental concern, it’s also a humanitarian crisis,” says , Editor-in-Chief and Co-founder of One Green Planet, “because factory farms are diverting precious natural resources like land, water and fossil fuels to raise farm animals, while millions of people around the world are malnourished and still do not have access to safe drinking water.” As the leading organization at the forefront of the conscious consumerism movement, it is One Green Planet’s view that our food choices have the power to heal our broken food system, give species a fighting chance for survival, and pave the way for a truly sustainable future. The science has shown that people who eat primarily plant-based have got it right when it comes to nurturing Mother Earth with their food choices. On the  needed to produce 250 pounds of beef, we could grow 50,000 pounds of tomatoes, 53,000 pounds of potatoes or 30,000 pounds of carrots. The average person who eats plant-based can save , and cut their carbon footprint in half. But the icing on the plant-based cake is the fact we could redirect enough grain from the livestock system to feed  people if every American stopped eating meat. So, there you have your reasons to continue with a vegetable-based diet. Meat producers will certainly make a fair attempt to provide a product in a more efficient and sustainable manner. But you’ve already got the winning solution be sticking with plant protein. This site uses Akismet to reduce spam. .

The National Research Council Committee on Twenty-First Century Systems Agriculture has defined agricultural sustainability in terms of four goals that can be summarized as: 3. Sustaining the economic viability of and 4. Improving the quality of life for those involved in and their surrounding communities NRC []. Based upon this definition, modern beef production in the U.S. is a resounding success story. Approximately eighty-five percent of U.S. grazing land is unsuitable for . Utilizing this land for grazing livestock could more than double the landmass that is available to produce food for human consumption. Between the years of 1977 and 2007, technical advances in genetics, production, and processing reduced the number of animals required to produce 1 billion kg of beef by thirty-percent and the amount of feed required by nineteen-percent thus reducing the land, water and carbon footprints associated with these endeavors Capper []. Currently, domestic beef feedlot production generates $40 billion in farm gate receipts annually USDA-ERS []. Satellite industries affiliated with the beef production supply chain contribute an additional economic impact of five to ten dollars per every dollar of cattle sales. Often these industries form the critical economic foundation for under-represented communities. Additionally, the U.S. exports approximately one million metric tons of beef valued at $4 billion annually USDA-ERS []. Potential Long-Term Challenges Facing the US Beef Industry The industry faces multiple challenges that threaten the sustainability of the current production chain. Historically, beef production in the U.S. has evolved into a specialized supply chain that utilizes high-energy input to achieve the acceptable merit rewarded by current grid marketing systems. In this paradigm, calves are generally produced in pasture-based production systems. Stocker cattle are then shipped to feedlots concentrated in regions that allow cattle to be finished on grain-based diets that drive intramuscular fat (IMF) deposition. Unfortunately, IMF accretion occurs predominantly at a time when significant quantities of unwanted visceral and subcutaneous fat stores have already accumulated on the carcass Hood []. Thus, modern harvest weights represent a balance between achieving desired quality grades and tolerating diminishing feed efficiency. In this system, an estimated 55 to 75% of the total cost of beef production is related to feed and it is this aspect that makes the beef supply chain vulnerable NRC []. The world population is projected to exceed 9 billion by the year 2050 with demand for agricultural products growing 1.5% annually Bruinsma []. This competing demand for use of grain for human consumption or animal feed unfortunately comes at a time when U.S. bio-fuel policy strongly encourages the use of corn as a source for energy, as exemplified by regulations such as the Renewable Fuel Standard and the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. Additionally mounting evidence indicates climate change will occur in coming decades, which would almost certainly impact animal production. The current economic loss due to seasonal depressions in weight gain and feed efficiency has been estimated at $300M in beef herds and $900M in dairy herds in the U.S. annually St-Pierre []. Importantly, even greater future losses should be expected if warm season temperatures rise as climate models predict IPCC []. Additionally, pressure from animal activists in the U.S. has increased the importance of animal welfare issues and terms such as “factory farming” resonate with some consumers given the importance of feedlots and industrial-scale packing facilities to the current supply chain. Furthermore, while beef consumption is expected to increase worldwide in the coming years, it is important to note that heightened animal welfare concerns in foreign markets can place further pressures upon producers. For instance, European consumers have consistently demonstrated a willingness to pay more for products that they perceive as humanely produced while public policy such as the Amsterdam treaty (1997) mandates the monitoring of animal welfare Hocquette []. Despite the great success of the last half-century, such looming challenges clearly indicate the beef industry has to keep evolving strategies to improve efficiency, safeguard the welfare of cattle, and to protect the environment. Several excellent recent reviews treat many of these issues in greater detail [-]. In response to these crises, the United Nation’s Food and Agriculture Organization projects that seventy-percent of the world’s additional food needs will have to be satisfied by improving existing production methods and by developing new technologies Bruinsma []. To address these pressures, it is inevitable that changes will have to occur in the current production system. One potential long-term solution entails an increased reliance upon pasture-based production systems and modification of the ideal beef type to favor leaner carcasses that take less time to reach market. This would dictate a trend toward smallerframed, earlier maturing animals. It is likely that market weights in such a system will also tend to decrease in order to improve efficiency by limiting fat cover on the carcass while avoiding effects of remodeling on tenderness. Well-marbled cuts might become a luxury as the need for improved production efficiency is at odds with current meat quality goals forcing a shift in the way beef is consumed. Meat scientists will need to devise new strategies to improve product quality post-harvest while preserving food safety. Likewise, there will be an even greater burden placed upon large animal medicine to not only preserve the health and well-being of changing herds but to preserve the integrity of the production chain as well. Several regions of the U.S. offer grazing conditions which could lessen the impact of these anticipated shifts in beef production and thus may factor prominently in potential changes in the food delivery chain. For instance, as forage utilization increases in the southeastern United States, more cattle will be harvest-ready eliminating or reducing the need for transportation to the Midwest or the High Plains for finishing. This increased availability of finished cattle could drive expansion of harvest capacity and the associated infrastructure for the beef packing industry. Such changes will create increased job opportunities in the region and increase food system efficiencies by reducing transportation needs for the harvest and distribution of beef to growing population centers throughout the eastern United States. Research Priorities Needed to Enhance Sustainable Beef Production There needs to be a high priority placed on large animal research in order to drive necessary innovations and create new technologies. Recent USDA Farm Bills have identified pasture-based beef systems as a high-priority research and extension area. However, continuous reductions in state and federal funding have critically eroded the research capabilities within the Land Grant system needed to address this federal priority Rouquette []. In order to address the global challenges that threaten the sustainability of U.S. beef production, it is crucial that this funding trend be reversed and increased support provided for several synergistic research priorities. First there needs to be a major emphasis on reducing inputs both to ease pressure caused by competition for the cropland used to produce grain for human consumption and biofuel production but also to reduce the breakeven point for producers. Improving feed efficiency could improve long-term profitability for beef producers by as much as thirty-three percent Archer []. However, to accomplish this, the molecular basis for feed efficiency needs to be established both in soft tissues of the carcass and in regions of the brain known to regulate satiety, metabolic rate and modulation of the somatotropic axis. This should yield targets for new technologies that improve efficiency or provide new selectable markers. In this regard, residual feed intake (RFI) has been established as a heritable proxy for feed efficiency that is largely independent of growth rate and frame size. Understanding the basis for the considerable variation in RFI found within a herd could lead to rapid improvement in feed efficiency. Beef industries in Canada and Australia have already incorporated RFI in breeding programs while the U.S. has lagged behind. Likewise there needs to be better understanding of the physiological basis for heat tolerance. An increased emphasis on development is also necessary to improve both feed efficiency and meat quality. There will be a greater need to selectively alter fat deposition on the carcass in a depot-specific manner that favors IMF and limits fat accretion in undesirable depots. Pharmaceutical and biological research will be critically important to develop and strategies to overcome shifting patterns in viral mutations and antimicrobial and parasite resistance to currently available products. Finally, forage-based research needs to be prioritized to overcome difficulties in providing a consistent supply of product due to seasonality of regional forages that currently limit the adoption of year-round pasture-based beef production systems in many regions of the U.S. For instance, there is a great need for applied research aimed at developing forage options that provide energy and protein nutritive values sufficient to sustain rapid, efficient growth throughout warm and cool seasons. The U.S. beef industry has a history of combining the dedication to stewardship inherent in the psyche of cattlemen with science-based technologies and improvements in management to continually enhance the sustainability of beef production ultimately helping lift the human condition. While the challenges facing the industry in coming years loom large, there is no reason to doubt that these challenges can be overcome provided key funding and support for large animal research is prioritized by industry and granting agencies alike. Scientists, livestock producers and support personnel within the have a tremendous obligation and an exciting opportunity to address these issues. The clock is ticking. We only have thirty-seven years to double the global food supply to feed a world population estimated to exceed 9 billion people.

9cb58f1b-4f31-445a-9a6d-1b2325d118f0,"Sustainability is a term that covers a very broad concept. Everything that is related to the environment, ecology, how to live responsibly in society and concern for the future can be grouped under this concept. To describe this term, often refers to the rule of three Ps: People, Planet and Profit. The goal of is that these three elements can be balanced .On the one hand, the individual wants to make money and enjoy the well-being it brings. At the same time, we must also ensure that other individuals and the environment do not suffer. Otherwise, it would mean that the common future of humanity is in danger. If we eat more than what the planet can support, we abuse it and we deplete natural resources faster than it can produce. To calculate whether a person, company, country, product... is sufficiently durable, often uses the term ' ecological footprint ‘(link building). How precisely define sustainability with a clear definition. The World Commission on Environment and Development (Link to the website of the committee) of the United Nations makes the following definition in its report 'Our Common Future.”Sustainable development is linked to contemporary needs without compromising development and endangers the specific needs of future generations.’’ Without going back over the history of this company, we remember that this is a new company, founded in 1984. It has quickly positioned in a particular way in the market as it has opted for the direct marketing and offered its customers to configure their machines themselves. We will build on the experience of Dell to offer a complete case study that will allow us to understand concretely how the multinational has responded to market changes; including, remember, f... ... middle of paper ... ... all of its environmental policy, which I have tried to make during my research. Some of my proposals were implemented; others are still at the stage of reflection. Thus, Codalis hired a specialist sustainable development to continue in business process. It should also be noted that investing in sustainable development is not synonymous with a loss of money since even short-term investments can be recouped. For example, the solution to the 100% electric car analyzed in this work allowed a very significant financial gain, even if the investment seems excessive at first. This work has enabled me to perceive the extent of ecological solutions that exist this day and continues to grow. Attitudes are changing and the world is moving gently towards a more humane and environmentally friendly world. There However much to do and I sincerely hope that we are on the right path Sustainability requires the interplay of other disciplines from the fields of science, economy, and social studies. The disciplines must function all together at a go, not in isolation. Once that is archived, sustainable development is also due to be archived. Philosophy is needed to be in practice in order to have an efficient way to approach sustainability. Mostly environmental sustainability is the one that is seen to be important, which includes the following aspects; water, energy, oil and other resources which are finite. There is an urging need for buildings to become more eco friendly and aware about the worlds environment. The case studies show that with a little extra effort, it can be achieve and can have huge impacts on the environment. For instance, I think of “sustainable business” as the way a specific business maximizes its profits and revenues through an efficient operation without causing any negative externalities. This essay will focus on the major ideas of sustainability and sustainable business, the relationship between profitability goals and sustainable business, and how marketing can be involved in this topic. Among all the cases and materials we have studied in class, I find cases from author Griggs, Hardin, Laverty are really helpful in assisting me to understand sustainability and sustainable business better. I have learned and understand sustainability through Hardin’s case and the IPAT equation. In “The Tragedy of the Commons”, author Hardin points out how human take advantage of the “common resources” irresponsibly to maximizing their own personal interests affects negatively to the environment (Hardin, 1968). Environmental Responsibilities Of Business: The Importance Of Environmental Sustainability The duties of a company rely on the mission statement at hand. Environmental Sustainability has many benefits and is essential to growth. To understand the importance of environmental sustainability, it is vital to comprehend to the term at hand. Often times, emphasis is not placed on the significance of environmental sustainability and its impact in the world. From the article “Environmental Sustainability: Definition and Application”, information was highlighted on the true meaning of the term. This product innovation costs the business a considerable amount of money to acquire. It will only make the investment if the business believes that customers will value the product and make a buying decision based on its changed features. Sustainable marketing at the production level is intended to bring these new eco-friendly characteristics to the consumer's attention. At the public relations stage, the company can communicate to its shareholders and consumers that it is an accountable corporate citizen that it cares about sustainable product innovation for the betterment of future generations. Sustainable Development: Why Sustainable Development Is Important? (http://greenliving.lovetoknow.com/Why_Is_Sustainable_Development_Important) But what do we mean by sustainable development. To understand fully what sustainable development means, let us first defined sustainability. Sustainability means the state of being able to maintain or sustain itself. Now that we have defined what sustainability means, let us now fix the meaning of sustainable development. Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Some sustainability experts and practitioners have illustrated four pillars of sustainability, or a quadruple bottom line. There is also an opinion that considers resource use and financial sustainability as two additional pillars of sustainability. The simple definition that sustainability is something that improves ""The quality of human life while living within the carrying capacity of supporting eco-systems"", though vague, conveys the idea of sustainability having quantifiable limits. Specific types of sustainability include, sustainable agriculture, sustainable architecture or ecological economics. While the United Nations Millennium Declaration identified principles and treaties on sustainable development, including economic development, social development and environmental protection it continued using three domains: economics, environment and social Sustainable Development Doesn't Burden Future Generations This includes meeting needs and aspirations, protecting the planet, providing a better quality of life and the list goes on. Another concern is for handing on an acceptable inheritance to future generations. This is expressed in terms as not compromising the future, bequeathing in good order, abstaining from burdening future generations. In fact, we can further understand the concept of sustainable development by looking at three dimensions which are environmental, social and economy. Nowadays, environmental protection is one of the core values in sustainable development. The three R rule reduce, reuse and recycle can go a long way in trying to stop global warming. The Earth has been ransacked by people for its natural resources. If mankind doesn’t act now and become environmentally conscious there will be devastating effects in the future. People need to realize that in order to succeeded as a species we need to care for our environmental sustainability. The concept of sustainability is that its based on the premise that people and their communities are made up of environmental, economic and social systems that are constantly working together to achieve balance in ecosystem. Sustainable Transportation: Environment, Society, And Environment Sustainable transportation is an aspect of global sustainability, which involves meeting present needs without reducing the ability of future generations to meet their needs. ii. Sustainability has three components: environment, society, and economy iii. Environment refers to the surroundings of humans and other life forms that support them and limit their activity according to basic physical laws. Environmental factors affect present well-being and determine most of the legacy we leave our descendants.

6811e864-8304-4db7-9d51-1f5bbc1281a9,"This is an example of a student written essay. written by our professional writers. Any opinions, findings, conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of UKEssays.com.   The rapidly diminishing fossil fuel reserves in the recent past have raised concerns over the high energy consumption by modern day buildings. Buildings alone consume approximately 20-40% of the total energy consumption in the residential and commercial sector in developed countries, which is expected to go even higher in the future if the present practices continue. This has presented the designers with a challenge to find a balance between modernity and energy conservation. In order to achieve an energy efficient design, architects and designers are gradually shifting back to passive techniques and adapting them in their designs in a way that suits the present climate. These passive design elements have existed for several years and feature extensively in the traditional Islamic architecture. The Islamic scriptures written centuries ago hint at a lifestyle that is moderate and consumes only what is required. These teachings translated into the architecture and planning of the structures in the Islamic world. However, with the recent trends of modernization and marching towards a ‘universal modernity’, the essence of Islamic architecture has diluted. This paper looks at the features that make up the Islamic architecture and study them in the light of the dire need of energy efficiency. The intent is to determine how wasteful or efficient the Islamic world is in comparison to the rest of the world when it comes to utilizing the limited resources available. The research draw parallels between the Islamic world and the modern world of the 21st century. A brief comparative assessment of the Western countries with the traditionally Islamic countries is done to find out the standings in terms of energy efficiency. This paper aims to build a foundation for future improvement by analysing what exists on ground. Islam · Islamic Architecture · Sustainability · Energy Consumption 1               Introduction The discussion on energy consumption, GHG and CO2 emissions, coal and petroleum is commonplace worldwide, what with the increasing energy demands and diminishing fossil reserves. Buildings alone contribute to about 20-40% of the total energy consumption in the residential and commercial sector in developed countries [1]. In fact, with only 5% contribution in world’s population, the US consumes as much as 25% of the total energy [2]. These statistics are expected to go only higher in the coming years. The scenario in other developing countries is similar, with their increasing population and energy demands. This could possibly be the reason for recommendations to frame energy efficiency policies by various countries. It is reported that buildings hold a great potential for energy efficiency. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimated that the energy savings potential in this sector in 2009 could be in the range of 20 exaJoules (EJ) per year by 2030 [3]. Moreover, buildings and their design can be completely controlled by the designers and building occupants, therefore, it makes sense to invest more time and resources in practices to bring down the energy consumption by buildings. If you need assistance with writing your essay, our professional essay writing service is here to help! The concepts of energy efficient design have been in practice for several years. However, with the concerns over high energy consumption and the adverse effects of climate change, it is only recent that the energy efficient building design has become primary. A study done by IEA in 2009 suggested that if all the recommended energy efficiency policies are implemented successfully, the baseline emissions (40Gt) can be tackled by 2030, leading to savings of as much as 7.6 Gt CO/yr. by 2030 [3]. Figure 1 shows the total COsavings potential from energy efficiency recommendations in the IEA report. Energy efficient building design contributes up to 25% of the total emissions savings (). CO savings potential from energy efficiency measures (Source: IEA) Various studies have shown that the adoption of passive design measures can result in high energy efficiency in buildings ( [4], [5], [6]). These passive design features or a form of their derivative is an integral part of what is commonly referred to as Islamic architecture. The distinctive typology and guiding principles of architecture are evident in the Muslim-Arab architecture; moreover, their buildings were shaped by a conceptual framework, which developed an understanding of conscious responses to environmental, urban and societal conditions of existence [7]. Given that most of the Islamic countries have a hot-dry climate, the resulting architecture and planning reflects the conscious use of such elements that cool up the spaces, or cut down on the heat entering the interiors of the building. The Islamic scriptures written centuries ago hint at a lifestyle that is moderate and consumes only what is required. These teachings translated into the architecture and planning of the structures in the Islamic world. However, with the recent trends of modernization and marching towards a ‘universal modernity’, the essence of Islamic architecture has diluted. 2               The Concept of Sustainable Development in Islam As many as 750 verses in the Holy Qur’an can be interpreted as numerous rules to protect nature and the environment. These refer to various aspects of nature, the relationship between man and nature, vegetal and animal organisms and their environment [8]. The environment is not our property and the human beings have a duty to take care of it and preserve it for all future generations [9], [10]. The responsibility of man is not confined to one single generation, with everything having to be passed on in good condition from one generation to another.                                                                                       (Qur’an 2:22) Years before the Brundtland report [11] gave the world the best known and most cited definition of sustainable development – ‟Sustainable development is aimed at the needs of the present, without compromising the ability of future generations to address theirs”; this sustainable approach has been supported in the Holy Quran, in the 22nd verse of the 2nd Surah, approximately 1300 years before the report. The concept of sustainable development is not new to Islam, however it was only in the 20 century that Islamic ideologies translated into a modern context. Islam, for example, warns in the Holy Qur’an and Hadiths against excess and over extension of natural resources. Islam calls collective as well as individuals to refer to God’s Shariah. Islam calls for a sense of responsibility and awareness of the reason of humankind creation. All these are natural outcomes of the Shariah rules [12]. The Qur’an has various verses that encourage the mankind to protect the nature and all its elements [10] and specifies that people are not superior to any other species (Qur’an 6:38). The Holy Qur’an mentions that there is a close relationship between the behaviour of people and the state of the environment [10], [13] & [14]. A righteous and moral behaviour will lead to positive results (Qur’an 7:96; 11:52). Similarly, a number of Hadith recorded by various Muslim scholars talk about the teachings of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) wherein Muslims are encouraged to save the resources and must not be extravagant in any sense [15]. It is evident from Islamic teachings as recorded in Qur’an and various sources for Hadith that Islam propagated the idea of resource management and minimum wastage; the idea which has become rather imminent in the present day. The teachings of Islam clearly advocate the concept of sustainability and sustainable development; the reflection of these ideas is mildly visible in the architecture of predominantly Muslim countries. The architecture in these countries was shaped by keeping the functionality of spaces at the centre (which is primarily religious) and evolving the idea of passive design as per the local context. However, very few of these countries exhibit this traditional architecture in the present day, since most of these regions shifted from traditional to modern to participate in the global trends of modernization resulting in an architectural style that is neither traditional nor contextual. 3               Energy Consumption by Regions – Comparative Assessment In order to assess how energy efficient is a particular country, the total energy consumption data is the primary metric against which their performance can be compared with that of other countries. However, energy consumption data alone is not sufficient to conclude if a particular country is doing well in terms of energy efficiency; it is likely to depend on a number of other variables such as population, type of economy and economic growth, reliance on renewable and non-renewable sources of energy, etc. Since the current data available on energy consumption gives the overall energy consume, it is difficult to assess accurately if one part of the country is consuming more energy in comparison to its counterparts. This paper is based on the overall energy consumption data available only, and does not consider the abovementioned metrics. Energy Consumption (Mtoe) distribution in the world in 1990. (Source: Enerdata) Countries with highest Primary Energy Consumption per Capita (Source: The Shift Project Data Portal) The region-specific data available on energy consumption indicates the high energy consumption by developed countries, which has only increased over the past 20 years [16]. shows that the United States had the highest energy consumption (1910 Mtoe) globally in 1990. Most of the Islamic countries consumed 50-100 Mtoe, with a few consuming even less than 50 Mtoe. However given the difference in population sizes of these countries, the total energy consumption data can be misleading, as evident by . Five countries in the World top 20 countries with highest primary energy consumption per capita in 1990 (Mtoe per million people) are Islamic states, or countries with Islam as the majority religion [17]. In fact, Qatar, UAE and Bahrain have a higher per capita energy consumption that United States, which has the highest overall energy consumption. However, Iraq and Iran are among the lowest energy consumers globally [17]. shows the comparison between various Middle Eastern countries in terms of per capita primary energy consumption from 1990 to 2014. It is clearly evident that whereas Qatar has the highest per capita energy consumption globally, Iraq and Iran consume the lowest. Per Capita Energy Consumption by Middle Eastern Countries (Source: The Shift Project Data Portal) shows the total primary energy consumption globally in the year 2017. There is a marked increase in the overall energy consumption by most of the Islamic countries mentioned above, as compared to the 1990 data. Energy Consumption (Mtoe) distribution in the world in 2017. (Source: Enerdata) However, the primary contributor to the energy consumption data are still the developed economies of the world. In comparison to another developing economy that is India, most of the Islamic countries have remained stable in terms of their primary energy consumption [16]. This could be attributed to the more stable population and growth levels of these countries as compared to India. shows a clear picture of the increasing energy demand of India as compared to the Islamic states under discussion. The figures for per capita energy consumption still however reflect that Islamic countries like Qatar, UAE and Bahrain remain the top 3 consumers of primary energy globally. In fact, show that United States has managed to improve its position globally [17]. Therefore, in order to assess the performance by a specific country in energy consumption or energy efficiency, it is essential to rely not only on the primary energy consumption data, but also on the per capita consumption, GDP, investments in renewable sources of energy, and measures taken to counter the effects of a global climate change. Islamic countries, based on the study of Islamic teachings and principles should display an efficient environment which is holistic and sustainable, however, the reality as obvious from the above statistics shows otherwise. Primary Energy Consumption (Mtoe) by Islamic countries in comparison with India, from 1990 to 2017. (Source: Enerdata) Countries with highest Primary Energy Consumption per Capita from 1990 to 2014 (Source: The Shift Project Data Portal) 4               Discussion Even though Islamic scriptures and teachings preach about sustainability, efficiency and conservation of resources, but as evident from the above data, these have not actually translated on ground, or have not sustained the test of time. Most of the countries to compete with the global trends of modernization have resulted in an environmental setup that does not suit the need or the context of these places. On the other hand, countries like the Islamic Republic of Iran, and Iran which have been resilient to change, are still doing comparatively well in terms of energy efficiency. Countries like Kuwait () and Qatar are in a constant race to match their skylines with those of other developed nations that are in no way similar in any context. Skyline of Kuwait City. (Source: Flickr) Amir Chakhmaq Complex in Yazd, Iran. (Source: https://hiveminer.com) A number of studies have argued the energy saving capacity of various passive measures found in Islamic architecture viz. screens, Wind towers, , etc. [7],[15]. These features are still very common in the historic cities of Iran like Yazd (), Isfahan, and Shiraz among others. Historically, the architecture and planning of Islamic cities took shape around the ideals of Islam. The instances of these are still visible in the historic towns of many Islamic states. However, the evolution of these places has not seen a very coherent shift, but a rather universal façade of ‘development’. Over the past few decades, there has been a usage of modern interpretation of the Islamic architectural elements in various buildings, but most of the time it is done to match the imagery rather than utilise the energy efficient potential of these elements (). Our academic experts are ready and waiting to assist with any writing project you may have. From simple essay plans, through to full dissertations, you can guarantee we have a service perfectly matched to your needs. This study found its basis in the notion that Islamic teachings have been very vocal about sustainability in all forms, and the role of humans to utilize the resources moderately and judiciously. However, the hypothesis that Islamic countries, based on the principles they function, must perform efficiently cannot be held true. The data available shows that if not wasteful, these countries have resulted in an architecture and planning pattern that is not appropriate to the setting of these regions. Despite the evidence that shows Islamic architecture being successful in being energy efficient and functional, there is a clear lack of coherence in Islamic regions and their architectural syntax. When a number of European and other western counterparts are modernizing the elements of Islamic architecture and using them in their context to fully exploit their potential in energy savings, it is rather unfortunate that the Islamic states have led themselves into an unfamiliar and inappropriate territory.

Or is it whether or not enough water will fall from the sky to grow your food? March 22 is World Water Day, and it’s an opportunity to reflect on the importance of water. This year’s theme is .” How does water impact agriculture, which employs nearly ? Let’s take a look. Although nearly 70 percent of the Earth is covered in water, . To complicate things, only 1 percent of that fresh water is easily accessible. To sum it up, only 0.025 percent of the planet’s water is available for human use. Agriculture uses a lot of water, almost 70 percent of all withdrawals and up to 95 percent in developing countries where there may be fewer technologies to make water use efficient. While you only need to drink about a gallon of water per day, it takes 528 to 1,320 gallons of water to grow the food you eat in a . Think about that. Water is important in maintaining food security, which is defined as “ of people to enough high-quality food to leave active, healthy lives.” Lack of water, or too much water, can contribute to famine and undernourishment, especially where people depend on local agriculture for their livelihood. Using water efficiently is critical. Irrigation is an to help maximize the efficiency of water use in agriculture. The highest yields that can be obtained from irrigation are the best yields from rain-fed agriculture. For instance, involves distributing water at very low rates from a system of plastic pipes with outlets called emitters or drippers. The water is released so that the only part of the soil that receives moisture is where the root grows. Unfortunately, irrigation can be expensive for small-scale farmers in developing countries. Some farmers make their own versions by building earth barriers or furrows that direct rainwater runoff to crops. To prepare for dry periods, farmers can collect rainwater in reservoirs, ponds or other basins. Biotechnology also has a role to play in helping to conserve water. The first biotech maize hybrids with a degree of drought tolerance were in 2013 in the U.S. The first tropical biotech drought tolerant maize is expected to be in sub-Saharan Africa by 2017. Drought tolerance is expected to play a major role in sustainable cropping systems worldwide, particularly in developing countries. The agriculture sector is focusing more than ever on how to protect the environment, conserve water resources, and keep water systems clean while feeding a growing global population. New technologies are one key component. Using and managing the world’s water efficiently is everyone’s job. This can be as simple as turning off the tap when brushing your teeth, boiling food in as little water as possible and taking shorter showers. Empowering people to understand water management techniques and to take ownership of their choices could drastically change how the world uses its water.  New Dietary Guidelines Aim To Make Every Bite Count Subscribe to get timely email updates, including our monthly Food Insight newsletter and other news. © 2021 International Food Information Council.

Pathways to Urban Sustainability: The Atlanta Metropolitan Region: Summary of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/13143. Sustainability indicators and performance metrics were specifically addressed in the day two panel discussion but were also raised by other presenters and participants. As metropolitan Atlanta attempts to put sustainability principles into practice, stakeholders are interested in measuring their progress. Participants described existing metrics, particularly to measure reductions in CO emissions, but several participants also described other types of metrics (e.g., related to community health or mobility). Many participants also noted that these metrics could become important in the context of competitiveness among metropolitan regions if citizens begin to demand more action on sustainability. Marilyn Brown, professor, School of Public Policy, Georgia Tech, examined sustainability through the lens of energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. She began with a forecast of the growth of CO emissions in the United States and noted that a national goal ought to be not only to stop cumulative growth in emissions, but to make these growth rates negative. To do so, the United States needs to have a cumulative emissions budget. As Dr. Brown pointed out, however, implementation will fall primarily to cities and local governments, and thus it is important to understand emissions at the metropolitan level. Dr. Brown cited a 2005 study by The Brookings Institution (Brown et al., 2008) of carbon footprints of the 100 largest metropolitan areas, which found that people living in dense urban areas generate significantly lower emissions. She explained that U.S. cities offer great opportunities for improvements in energy efficiency and conservation because of the high concentration of buildings and the compact ""4 INDICATORS OF SUSTAINABILITY.""

Although they contain 65 percent of the population and create 76 percent of gross domestic product, they only produce 56 percent of carbon emissions. Dr. Brown noted that obtaining energy data at a county or zip code level is difficult. Some data are proprietary and can only be estimated. Projections for energy efficiency gains in Georgia.

[online.] Available: http://www.seealliance.org/programs/se-efficiency-study.php. [accessed April 9, 2011] K.C. Boyce, Deputy Executive Director, Membership and Regional Impact, ICLEI-Local Governments for Sustainability, discussed how progress toward sustainability might be measured in the region. He presented the STAR Community Index, which uses comparative analysis to provide a common way of measuring progress in sustainability— ""4 INDICATORS OF SUSTAINABILITY."" National Research Council. 2011. Pathways to Urban Sustainability: The Atlanta Metropolitan Region: Summary of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/13143. economic, environment, and equity indices. The index has 81 metrics categorized under 10 goal areas; each has its own structure, consisting of a goal, purpose, and measure. He emphasized that the STAR Community Index has a “high bar, but a low floor” so that top-performing communities would have incentive to continue making progress, but lower-performing communities would not be precluded from measuring their progress. Mr. Boyce also remarked that communities were expressing interest in understanding the range of positive possibilities for becoming more sustainable (rather than only measuring the decrease in undesirable indicators). Mr. Boyce noted that, until recently, indicators of sustainability for different cities did not have enough in common to make useful quantitative comparison. This makes it difficult if not impossible to verify claims emanating from communities. To share a common vision and carry out concerted action, it is useful to have a common language and set of metrics. He acknowledged that this is not without challenges, and he cited the example of defining “adequate” health care. At the same time, Mr. Boyce noted that not all sustainability indicators are directly comparable between communities. Carol Couch, Senior Public Service Associate, College of Environment and Design, University of Georgia, elaborated on this when she pointed out that stakeholders needed to have a benchmark for the region’s ecosystem services. Quantifying (and, where possible, monetizing) these services would help improve decision makers’ understanding of the tradeoffs inherent in different patterns of development. Graeme Lockaby, director, Center for Forest Sustainability, Auburn University, pointed out that macroeconomic analyses are not suited to local ecological scales, and so it is easy to miss declines in ecosystem services resulting from urban expansion. He cited two specific examples from his studies in western Georgia—first, that regional water availability tends to decrease as urbanization (i.e., land conversion) increases, and second, that the threshold for urban forest canopy and species diversity is about 15 percent. In these cases, changes to the land threaten services that at least some residents in the region value. Environmental justice, a priority issue in metropolitan Atlanta and at a federal level, is another spatial indicator. Several participants noted that, in addition to concerns about environmental pollution’s adverse impacts on segments of the regional population (e.g., by race or income), ""4 INDICATORS OF SUSTAINABILITY."" National Research Council. 2011. Pathways to Urban Sustainability: The Atlanta Metropolitan Region: Summary of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/13143. it will also be important to measure the degree to which all segments of the population are benefiting from environmental improvements in the region. Examples included access to green space, healthy food options, and multiple modes of transit. Christopher Portier, Director of the National Center for Environmental Health, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), suggested that health indicators, such as gains in life expectancy from pollution reductions, offered a positive way to communicate the impact of sustainability efforts. In the same way that efficiency improvements are communicated in terms of consumer savings over time, improvements in the built environment that also improve health outcomes can be monetized (e.g., reduced medical expenditures) and provide a direct connection to citizens. Dr. Portier concluded that the way we design our communities and use our land will either promote or harm human health. Therefore, the CDC is becoming more involved in building capacity to support Health Impact Assessments for land-use and transportation projects. Jeremy Hess, assistant professor, Department of Environmental Health, Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University, posed a question to the group about which health indicators could be used as a measure of urban sustainability. As many participants noted, health problems such as asthma and obesity are significant concerns in metropolitan Atlanta, and so linking these concerns to their environmental stressors could help make sustainability a more tangible idea for residents in the region. Dr. Hess added survival from common cancers to this list. These indicators are highly correlated with poverty and restricted access to health care. Incidence of obesity and diabetes are linked to limited mobility, limited access to nutritious food, and poor education. Dr. Hess reiterated that shifting our attention and investment to creating livable and sustainable communities can have a positive impact on public health. ""4 INDICATORS OF SUSTAINABILITY.""

Recognizing that many metropolitan areas in the United States have been experimenting with various approaches to sustainability, and that despite the differences among regions, there are likely some core similarities and transferable knowledge, Roundtable members selected the metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia region as a case study. The Atlanta region provided a compelling example for exploring urban sustainability issues because of the region's rapid growth rate, well-documented challenges with water, land use, and transportation; and its level of engagement with federal government agencies on matters related to sustainability. Pathways to Urban Sustainability: Lessons from the Atlanta Metropolitan Region: Summary of a Workshop explores the Atlanta region's approach to urban sustainability, with an emphasis on building evidence based foundation upon which policies and programs might be developed. The two day workshop held on September 30 and October 1, 2010 examined how the interaction of various systems (natural and human systems; energy, water and transportations systems) affect the region's social, economic, and environmental conditions. The intent of this workshop summary is to analyze a metropolitan region so that researchers and practitioners can improve their understanding of the spatial and temporal aspects of urban sustainability.

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/12027. As the global demand for energy continues to rise, biofuels hold the promise of providing a renewable alternative to fossil fuels. High oil prices and the threat of negative climate change impacts have sparked a surge in research and business activities. National security concerns and the desire to increase farm incomes have prompted governments around the world to enact policies in favor of biofuels. Developing countries hope to increase access to inexpensive fuel in isolated areas. Biofuels are also seen as an option to reduce air pollution in urban areas. However, the current boom has sparked controversy as well. Opponents accuse biofuels of requiring more energy inputs and causing more greenhouse gas emissions than their fossil counterparts. Many concerns center on possible environmental degradation: erosion, deterioration of soil health, depletion of aquifers, and losses in biodiversity. Large-scale biofuels production is often regarded as a threat to food production and conservation efforts (Hill et al., 2006; Worldwatch Institute, 2006). Sustainability assessments aimed at quantifying the economic, environmental, and societal impacts can help move the often heated debates over biofuels to a more factual level. Science-based methods like life cycle assessment (LCA), a ""Sustainable Biorefineries--Carina Maria Alles and Robin Jenkins."" National Academy of Engineering. 2008. Frontiers of Engineering: Reports on Leading-Edge Engineering from the 2007 Symposium. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/12027. holistic approach to quantify environmental impacts throughout the value chain of a product (ISO, 2006), have gained acceptance among decision makers. Biofuels Sustainability in Well-to-Wheel Perspective To assess the sustainability of (bio)fuels all stages of the fuel value chain have to be considered (): feedstock production and supply, fuel production and distribution, and vehicle operation. An assessment of the entire value chain (i.e., well-to-wheel [WTW]) allows a fair comparison of different fuels, whereas a well-to-tank (WTT) or cradle-to-gate (CTG) (here: extraction of raw materials from the ground to fuel production) approach is adequate to compare different technologies to make the same fuel. The DuPont integrated corn-based biorefinery (ICBR) process will use innovative technology to convert corn grain and stover into fermentable sugars for the parallel production of value-added chemicals and fuel ethanol (DOE, 2006). Current R&D efforts in the ICBR program focus on optimized process design for the conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to ethanol. From the beginning, economic evaluation and LCA have been used side by side to guide researchers to the most sustainable process alternative (). In the ICBR program, stakeholder engagement was critical to setting relevant sustainability goals. Stakeholder interests are represented by an external advisory panel of subject matter experts from government agencies, academia, industry, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), who helped prioritize topics, translate them into quantifiable metrics, and formulate specific targets for the environmental performance of the ICBR technology. The panel’s independent, critical review of life cycle methodology and results has been invaluable to the ICBR program. ""Sustainable Biorefineries--Carina Maria Alles and Robin Jenkins."" National Academy of Engineering. 2008. Frontiers of Engineering: Reports on Leading-Edge Engineering from the 2007 Symposium. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/12027. FIGURE 2 Integration of LCA into process development. Source: DuPont. Life cycle assessment sheds light on relative or directional changes in sustainability resulting from ICBR technology choices. The LCA model follows all natural resources extracted from the environment and all material releases to the environment that cross the system boundaries shown as the dotted line in . Many of these flows are then aggregated into impact assessments (e.g., fossil energy consumption, which includes petroleum, natural gas, coal, and lignite use) or greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, where gases like anthropogenic CO, CH, and NO are weighted by their global warming potential. A process model of ethanol production from corn stover in an ICBR facility forms the core of the LCA model. The environmental impacts of material and energy inputs to the biorefinery are tracked back to ground, using LCA databases and publicly available information to describe upstream processes. Michigan State University provided a rigorous LCA model of corn farming, including agrochemicals manufacture and the production of fuels used in corn farming (Kim et al., unpublished manuscript). Most ICBR designs assume that nonfermentable ""Sustainable Biorefineries--Carina Maria Alles and Robin Jenkins."" National Academy of Engineering. 2008.

FIGURE 3 Cradle-to-gate LCA model of the ICBR. Source: DuPont. biomass provides fuel for an onsite cogeneration facility, with the option to sell excess electricity to the local grid. The LCA credit for electricity sales covers the environmental burden of electricity generation all the way back to primary energy sources (Kim and Dale, 2005). As the ICBR process development progressed the LCA model was continuously updated. Multiple scenario and sensitivity analyses helped identify favorable design options and optimized process parameter settings. Eventually ICBR technology will have to be competitive against other technologies to produce ethanol from corn. The LCA model has also been used to benchmark the environmental performance of the ICBR versus the incumbent technology (i.e., ethanol from corn grain) (Graboski, 2002) and potential alternative routes to produce ethanol from corn stover (Sheehan et al., 2004). Publicly available benchmark data were carefully reviewed when the environmental targets for the ICBR were defined. When necessary, critical assumptions and data sources were aligned to ensure a fair comparison. Results for cradle-to-gate fossil energy consumption, a metric commonly used to address the energy balance of biofuels, are shown in . In all three scenarios the CTG fossil energy footprint to produce a gallon of bioethanol is well below the lower heat value (LHV) of the fuel (i.e., the energy ultimately delivered to a vehicle). The ICBR compares favorably against both benchmarks. ""Sustainable Biorefineries--Carina Maria Alles and Robin Jenkins."" National Academy of Engineering. 2008. Frontiers of Engineering: Reports on Leading-Edge Engineering from the 2007 Symposium. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/12027. Greenhouse gas emissions have emerged as a priority metric in policy making. To benchmark biofuels against the incumbent fossil fuel, differences in the energy content of the fuels need to be considered. shows well-to-wheel greenhouse gas emissions normalized to an equal amount of fuel energy for U.S. gasoline and the three biofuel alternatives discussed above. All three biofuels cause fewer GHG emissions along the fuel value chain than gasoline. Cellulosic ethanol offers significant advantages in GHG reductions, since corn stover has a smaller GHG footprint than corn grain (Kim et al., unpublished manuscript) and provides renewable fuel to the ethanol production facility, whereas conventional dry mills rely on natural gas or coal (Graboski, 2002). The ICBR ethanol presents the largest GHG reduction potential of all cases shown, thanks to advanced pretreatment and fermentation technologies and optimized process integration. A breakthrough in stover-to-ethanol technology could pave the way for ethanol from other lignocellulosic feedstocks, such as perennial grasses and agricultural or forestry residues. FIGURE 4 Cradle-to-gate fossil energy use of selected biofuels. Source: DuPont. ""Sustainable Biorefineries--Carina Maria Alles and Robin Jenkins."" National Academy of Engineering. 2008.

FIGURE 5 Well-to-wheel greenhouse gas emissions of selected fuels. Source: DuPont. Fundamental learnings from the in-depth analysis of a broad spectrum of ICBR technology options can be applied to biorefineries in general. The cradle-to-refinery-gate footprint of the primary biorefinery feedstock is a significant contributor to the overall footprint of a biofuel. Generally, lignocellulosic biomass has a lower environmental burden than food crops. In LCA terms, waste materials from industrial processes or municipal collection would come free of burden if using them in biorefinery processing would result in the avoidance of disposing of these materials. Similarly the footprint of processing chemicals used at the biorefinery needs to be considered, especially in the pretreatment of cellulosic feedstocks. As a rule of thumb, cost-efficient measures to improve process efficiency will have a positive impact on both the economic and the environmental performance ""Sustainable Biorefineries--Carina Maria Alles and Robin Jenkins."" National Academy of Engineering. 2008. Frontiers of Engineering: Reports on Leading-Edge Engineering from the 2007 Symposium. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/12027. of biorefineries. The common engineering goal to maximize product yield usually translates into reductions in feedstock footprint, waste generation, and energy consumption. Increasing the effective concentration of solids, intermediates, and products in aqueous process streams not only reduces the amount of water taken from the watershed but also reduces the burden on separation steps. Measures to lower the energy consumption within biorefinery battery limits (e.g., by heat integration or equipment design) have a positive impact on the overall biofuel energy balance, whether they reduce the need to bring supplemental fuel to the biorefinery or enable additional energy exports. Typically the biofuel is not the only material output of a biorefinery. If more outputs find their ways into beneficial uses, then the economic and environmental burdens of the biorefinery operation can be allocated among a wider range of coproducts, effectively reducing both the production cost and the cradle-to-gate footprint of the biofuel. For example, lignin and other nonfermentable components of biomass feedstocks need not be disposed as wastes, but can be used as fuels to generate thermal or electrical energy onsite or offsite. Other potential coproducts include animal feed, fertilizer, and intermediates for specialty chemicals. The colocation of biorefineries with other facilities processing agricultural and forestry feedstocks, livestock feedlots, or power plants in industrial parks will facilitate the beneficial exchange of material and energy flows to a great extent. In the development of sustainable fuels, materials, and services for the future, researchers are challenged to find innovative technical solutions without losing sight of the economic, societal, and environmental impacts of their work. The ICBR program demonstrates how the early integration of sustainability analysis into the creative process of technology development enables a holistic approach to research guidance, where economic and environmental metrics are used alongside product performance standards to define and monitor success. Sustainability analysis in the ICBR program (DOE 1435-04-03-CA-70224) was a team effort, involving partners from Michigan State University, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Diversa Corporation, and DuPont. Interactions with researchers and leadership have been very rewarding. The program also benefited immensely from the perspectives of external stakeholders, in particular, members of the ICBR LCA advisory panel.

Any scientific information contained within this essay should not be treated as fact, this content is to be used for educational purposes only and may contain factual inaccuracies or be out of date.   Sustainability is increasing concern in the food industry. According to the report published in the which showed that the food industry is lagging in the environmental performance compared to other sectors. This is mainly because the food/drink industry plays a major role in environmental impact as it accounts for: About 14% of energy consumption by UK businesses and 7 million tonnes of carbon emission each year. About 10% of all industrial use of the public water supply. 10% of the industrial and commercial waste stream. Therefore, around 30% of the total greenhouse gas emission. To help tackle government have placed various environmental legislation and food industry itself adopting sustainability practices within their companies through lifecycle assessment to minimise the magnitude of pollution and to conserve non-renewable resources. The goal of sustainable development is to “enable all people throughout the world to satisfy their basic needs and enjoy a better quality of life without compromising the quality of life of future generations    This report on “sustainability in the Food Industry” will look at the most important UK & EU environmental legislation and key drivers that promote sustainable practices within the public and commercial organisations. Also, current examples on how the food industry is practices in the use of portable water, use of energy and improvement in solid/liquid waste management. This will cover the most significant UK and EU Environmental legislations that are being used to drive sustainable initiatives in the areas of waste management and energy conservation/carbon reduction. These legislations are designed to reduce or eliminate waste streams which are dispersed into the environment by treatment, transporting, storage, disposal, etc. – legal framework for the collection, transport and treatment of the waste in the EU. Also, includes basic concepts and definition of waste management. Requires all members to take necessary measures to make sure the waste is recovered/disposed of without harming human health and environment and also includes waste hierarchy. The basis for all the other EU legislation related to waste management.    legislation for safe shipment of waste within EU and non-EU countries. The aim is to control the waste shipments to improve environmental protection. Requires documentation and security measure during transportation.   aim to control the landfill waste throughout EU, and its primary focus is to achieve universal standards for the design, operation and aftercare of landfill sites and reduce the emission of greenhouse gases emitted . The directive defines the different categories of waste (hazardous waste, inert waste, non-hazardous waste and municipal waste) .        recover/recycle of packaging wastes. Under these regulation, food industry is required to submit data to EA on packaging handling. Packaging should comply with essential requirements such as minimum weight/volume of packaging, recyclable/recoverable packaging and minimum hazardous substance.       UK legislations on waste management are derived from EU laws and transferred into UK law by statutory instruments.  transposed from WFD and other obligation includes quality recycling (separate collection of waste), separate collection of bio-waste, promote the re-use of products and recycle/re-use of 50% waste from household by 2020.  the EU controls, are supplemented by UK policy on the import and export of waste for disposal.  UK to reduce landfilling of biodegradable municipal waste by 35% of its 1995 level by 2020.   an incentive to reduce/recover waste. £84.40 per tonne (standard rate). This is being used to meet the targets set out in landfill regulations.    initiative by DEFRA to reduce biodegradable municipal waste to achieve the set target.   Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 1997 – reduce packaging waste going to landfill and promote recovery and recycling. Implement same goals in the EU directive.  2.2 Energy Conservation/Carbon reduction legislation  UK implemented through The Energy Efficiency (Encouragement, Assessment and Information) Regulations 2014. The aim is to help EU reach 30% energy efficiency target by 2030 through efficient energy use at all stages of the energy chain. Energy distributors to achieve 2% energy saving each year. EU countries to achieve saving through efficient heating systems and insulations. Companies to monitor their energy consumption and find ways to reduce it.   UK implemented through National Renewable Energy Action Plan for the United Kingdom. Establish an overall policy for the production and promotion of energy from renewable sources in the EU. At least 20% of total energy with renewables sources by 2020 and at least 10% of the transport fuel from renewable sources by 2020.       UK implemented through The Environmental Permitting (England & Wales) (Amendment) Regulations 2013. In 2010 IPPC was combined with a number of other directives to form the Industrial Emissions Directive. Both the EU Directive and the UK legislation made under it seek to: Ensure that the principle of pollution prevention is adopted, Protect the environment as whole, ensure that where an operator acquires a license the ‘polluter pays’ principle is used and ensure multimedia pollution control such as Air, Land, water, Energy consumption, resource use, waste and noise. The operator is required to get environment permit for industrial activities (burning fuel and excess of 50MW) and installation from the authorities (Environment Agency). The process of acquiring a permit requires. A permit is dependent on the installation complexity. The operator needs to demonstrate that they meet all the environmental standard. The application is open to public scrutiny, and the permitting authority typically consults with the major agencies such as HSE. this was introduced to make sure that UK reduces its carbon emission by 80% by 2050 less than the 1990 baseline to avoid dangerous climate change (Kyoto Protocol), allowing the UK to meet the long-term greenhouse gases goal at the same time moving the country towards low carbon economy. To help UK achieve its Kyoto commitments and domestic energy targets, the government have put a Climate Change Programme (CCP) in place which includes: this provides an incentive to minimise carbon emission and increase energy efficiency through a levy on businesses and public sector.   agreements to meet the energy efficiency targets, this allows the participants to benefits from 80% reduction on the CCL.   is to use biofuel in UK’s transports and obligation on the suppliers to make sure a percentage of aggregates sales is made up of biofuel.    designed to improve energy efficiency and cut emission in large public/private sector organisations across the UK that are responsible for 10% of UK’s greenhouse gas emissions. Participants include supermarkets, water companies, etc. Members to buy and surrender allowances for their carbon emissions, 2017/2018 £16.60 per tonne of carbon emission.      3.0 Key Drivers that Promote Sustainability Practices The other key Drivers that promotes and encourage sustainable practices within public and commercial organisations are Corporate Social Responsibilities CSR, Non-Governmental Organisations NGOs, consumers, collaboration and economics. For public and commercial organisations NGOs, have become a valuable tool, as they help to minimise their environmental impact at the same time increases their value and it’s a key driver to encourage sustainable practices within the organisation. If you need assistance with writing your essay, our professional essay writing service is here to help! set up with government funds and their mission is to increase the move toward low-carbon economy hence sustainable. Independent experts on energy saving and carbon reduction. Provide support for low carbon technologies. The trust can help the organisations to improve their energy efficiency in line with the goals of the energy white paper. Key services offer by the trust are: Helps the companies to create carbon reduction strategies Interest-free loan for energy efficient equipment/replacement works with communities, governments and businesses to help improve resource efficiency by providing practical solutions and with the aim to increase the move toward sustainable and resource-efficient economy by Re-inventing how we design, produce and sell products Re-defining what is possible through re-use and recycling Corporate Social Responsibility is the responsibility of organisations for their impact on the environment and society; it is becoming a major driving force to encourage sustainable practices within the organisation and to create shared value for organisation and community. Sustainability is not just important for our planet and people, but it’s equally important to organisation success. CSR represents various practices and policies which the organisation commits to in order to create positive impact on the environment and society includes community engagement and going above and beyond what is required to ensure legal compliance such as environmental protection, equal opportunities, employment, community work and health & safety to improve public relation .       The diagram above illustrates the main key driving forces for the CSR are the Government pressure, Consumer/investor Demands and Public Pressure. There are a lot of pressures to go green and to be seen as environmentally responsible. There is also, an enormous amount of pressure from public opinion and pressure groups these can have a large impact on the growth and value for public/commercial organisations. Therefore, corporate responsibility is a key driver for public relation. Consumers are a lot more eco-conscious these days, so there is increasing consumer demand for green products and services. Consumers are more likely to choose goods and services with green credentials. Exerting pressure on businesses to invest in green products. For companies, there can be economic incentives for being more environmentally friendly such as tax relief or subsidised products, which can make a business more profitable and can give a competitive advantage. – Governments and NGOs are continuously facing sustainability challenges that are too costly and too difficult to be addressed by individual organisations. therefore, collaborative approaches are being used to solve sustainability challenges with different models such as a company to NGOs, company-company or multi-sector collaborations. The main aim of this is to address social and environmental problems.   – world marketed energy consumption is expected to increase by 53% between 2015-2035, this will lead to increase the energy prices in the long term and has become a key driver for companies to minimise their energy consumption through various energy saving and energy management programs such as LED lighting – 16% reduction in energy bills, 95% Electricity from renewable sources and Voltage Optimisation minimises the energy consumption at the same time reduces their impact on the environment.     According to gov.uk, UK can save around twenty-three billion pounds a year and reduce their carbon emissions by using the resources such as energy, natural material and water more efficiently. Water is one of the most valuable resources around the globe; it is regarded as being plentiful in the Europe, but it is a limited resource in various part of the world such as Africa, India and America. Due to the poor management of water and the impact of climate change. The water crisis is one of the top risk identified by the World Economic Forum . The food industry around the globe uses a large amount of Portable water & Natural Waters each day from the public water supply. Therefore, the industry contributes significantly to the demand being placed upon water resources, which can affect local habitats and water quality. Therefore, the food industry is required to minimise their water consumption through efficient water management system and to adopt best practice without compromising food hygiene. Next part of this report will cover some of the current techniques being used by Kellogg and Coca-Cola in food manufacturing to minimise their overall water consumption.     According to Coca-Cola CSR report 2015/2016, they have come up with various strategies to reduce the amount of drinking and natural water used in their food manufacturing process by becoming more water-efficient, treating and reusing their wastewater and by investing in various water-saving technology. In 2015, Coca-Cola total water consumption was 8.24 million m, approximately 16% less than 2007. As Coca-Cola can’t reduce the amount of water used in their products, they have invested around $543,000 in process optimisation and water-saving technologies to improve their water efficiency. The water saving technologies are: Manufacturing Execution Systems, this is connected to the production processes and track the amount of water being used in real time and allow the operator to control it. Improves water management. Machines for washing refillable glass bottles consumes a large amount of water in their lines. To minimise the Portable water consumption Coca-Cola have recently introduced more efficient bottle washers which will save around 25,000m of water each year. This program will have the greatest impact on reducing their water use ratio.   installation of new air rinser at various sites around the UK, able to save approx. 8000m of water per year. Coca-Cola has switched to ionised air instead of water for rinsing cans and PET foam before they are filled, able to save a significant amount of water. Water treatment –  updated water treatment plant has been installed in the UK to recover reuse water from processes such as regenerations, resin granules and cleaning filters. Coco-Cola is managing water sustainability through water-reduction technologies at their manufacturing sites, saved around 62,000m of water in the year 2015 and expected to save more in future. Kellogg uses a mixture of external sources and internal knowledge to define total water risk score for each of their manufacturing facility. The internal information is built on site-specific surveys which include local knowledge on social, community and physical risk factors. The external sources referenced include three leading external datasets that consider exposure to current conditions (quantity, quality, regulatory, social) and projected changes in water quantity over time, based on indices such as population growth and climate change. Based on the risk assessment, a site with the greatest level of water risk was Michigan where a high level of well/natural water was used for cooling process equipment and flows into the creek. To minimise the well water consumption, Kellogg introduced a new closed cooler system with an outdoor evaporative spray, which reduced the well water by 500,000m per year. Roughly 65% of water use at plant site and 3% global water use for Kellogg. Kellogg also saved a great amount of drinking water at India’s manufacturing facility by installing 20 pressure compensating aerators in water faucets in admin block which reduced the water flow rate and minimise the water consumption. Also, treated wastewater used for gardening. Overall reduced the water consumption by 8000mof water in just 8 months in the year 2015. Kellogg is managing use of Portable/natural water sustainability through risk assessment for each of their manufacturing facility and installing new water reduction technologies at the site with the greatest level of water risk. Climate change is a long-term change in earth average temperature or shift in weather patterns. Global warming is the term used to describe a gradual increase in earth average temperature. Increased carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases such as nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbon, methane, etc. are believed to be the primary source of global warming. According to the recent research, earth average temperature could rise between 1.4 and 5.8C by the year 2100 which could lead to rising sea level and adverse weather conditions. The DEFRA report 2016 shows that the food industry in the UK contributes around 30% of the total greenhouse gas emission. Therefore, urgent action is required.   To tackle the climate change, a global climate agreement (COP21 PARIS 2015) was signed by 200 countries on the need to cut greenhouse gas emission and limit global warming to well below 2C. To welcome the agreement food/drink manufacturer such as Coca-Cola, Kellogg and many more companies signed the Parris pledge, to reduce their carbon footprint by introducing low carbon technology, increasing energy efficiency and minimising CO emission throughout their value chain.  has strengthened their commitments to reduce greenhouse emission associated with food manufacturing. The company have committed to reduce their total carbon footprint by 50% and generate 40% of the energy used in manufacturing operation from renewable and low carbon sources which include:   Produces high-efficiency clean heat and electricity from natural gas. Coca-Cola has installed CHP system at 20 sites around the globe. CHP system can reduce the greenhouse emission by 6% at the site and can save around 1500 tonnes of carbon per year.      In the year 2015 solar panels on the manufacturing sites generated more than 300MWH of electricity. Coca-Cola Hellenic invested around $200million and installed rooftop solar panels in all of its bottling plant sites in Italy with CHP systems which reduced the carbon emission by 66% . Coca-Cola UK, installed their first water turbine next to Chaudfontaine Plant. This supply 3% of the sites electricity/330MWh. Saved 1200 tonnes of carbon emission in the year 2015.  Coca-Cola is installing more energy efficient lighting at their manufacturing operation around the globe. In the year 2015 saved around 800 tonnes of carbon dioxide emission by the use of LED lightening at manufacturing operations.   Coca-Cola control/manage their energy and carbon emission through monitoring processes (MES systems) which are connected to production processes. The advanced system provides live data on water and energy consumption, gives information to the line operator to meet consumption target. $50.4 million invested in effective Cold Drink Equipment, installed with energy reduction devices such as EMS, LED lighting, doors and plug and play energy timers. Estimated energy saving of around 66000 MWh per year and 468kg reduction in carbon dioxide emissions per unit of equipment since 2007.   In 2015, Coca-Cola invested around $70million in low carbon technologies. Achieved 52.6% reduction in the Carbon dioxide emission g/litre of product produced against their 2007 baseline, 32.8% of the energy used in 2015 came from renewable/low-carbon sources, saving more than 56962 tonnes of carbon dioxide emission and 41% reduction in carbon footprint of their efficient Cold Drink equipment all in their food manufacturing plant. They are well on their way to meet their 2020 target. Kellogg Energy use and commitment to carbon reduction Kellogg commitments for 2020 includes; increase the use of low-carbon energy at manufacture site by 50% and reduce greenhouse gas emissions and energy by 20% per tonne of food produced. Current and up to date example includes: Kellogg has installed fuel cells at New Jersey site, to help power a part of the production facility and to reduce the carbon emission in food manufacturing site. Fuel cells which work like batteries use chemical energy/fuel to produce clean and efficient electricity. They do not need to recharge as they produce clean electricity as long as enough fuel is present. This project at New Jersey reduced the greenhouse emission by 8% on site.   Finally, Food manufacturing sites in the UK and around the world are managing sustainability in Energy use and Carbon reduction by the use of renewable and low carbon energy sources, for example, CHP systems, Solar Panels, Fuel cells plant, LED lighting, voltage optimisation and water turbine. These efficient and low carbon sources have allowed the food/drink manufacturing sites to reduce their total energy use and greenhouse emission to meet the current demand.   6.0 Improvement in Solid and Liquid Waste Management According to waste and resources action programme (WRAP), food and drink industry produces more than 15m tonnes of food and packaging waste each year. Therefore, good waste management is required as it can have a severe impact on the environment. Moreover, disposing of waste to landfill is getting expensive due to increasing landfill tax. The waste management is often arranged in a hierarchical manner to reflect their desirability. The first priority is “reduction at source” or “clean technology”, the next priority is to maximise reuse or recycling, once the possibility of waste prevention has been exhausted then the next option is treatment and the final choice (least desirable) is to dispose of the waste either to the air, water or land.    WRAP is helping the food and drink industry in all part of it sector, by creating an efficient circular economy which helps to deliver competitive industry, that creates sustainable growth. Circular economy covers the entire product life cycle from production to use to waste management to the secondary material. An efficient circular economy helps to reduce the waste & (zero waste to landfill), minimise the environmental impact and drive greater resource productivity.    There are many innovative waste management technologies are being used in the food manufacturing to manage solid/liquid waste by converting it into valuable products such as fertilisers, animal feed and renewable energy. Leading toward “zero waste to landfill” and circular economy. Innovative technologies include:   Our academic experts are ready and waiting to assist with any writing project you may have. From simple essay plans, through to full dissertations, you can guarantee we have a service perfectly matched to your needs. Composting is an aerobic treatment where micro-organisms, in the presence of oxygen decompose the organic fraction of solid waste. The final solid product consists of minerals and humus (complex organic material). It closely resembles soil and can be spread on land or used in gardens. Anaerobic Digestion: has grown in popularity, particularly for the processing of agricultural waste. The use of microbial organisms, in the absence of oxygen, to convert organic material into methane and carbon dioxide. Below are some of the current example on how the food manufacturing companies have managed to improve their solid and liquid waste, achieved zero waste to landfill and also the circular economy. McCain Foods have placed innovative waste management techniques in all areas of the supply chain, and they have ensured it is fully integrated at all sites to minimise waste, or convert it into valuable products. These include: McCain Food has built an Anaerobic Digester at Whittlesey, which converts the solid organic waste into a useful product.  Waste Potato, starch and Potato particles in wastewater are sent to an Anaerobic Digester on site, which is anaerobically fermented to produce biogas and provide 40% of the electrical requirement at their site. And, the remaining solid waste from the Anaerobic Digestion is used as a fertiliser.      10% of the total raw material waste is used as an Animal Feed at Whittlesey site. installed to make sure that the wastewater from the process is cleaned and re-used. This reduces the water usage by 25%.   McCain sells their sunflower oil used in cooking for biofuel for transportation purposes to reduce the liquid waste on site.         The introduction of innovative waste management techniques such as anaerobic lagoon and reverse osmosis plant has allowed McCain to use their Potatoes more efficiently and enabled them to reach “Zero waste to landfill”. 100% of their organic waste food recycled into renewable energy, animal feed and fertiliser.    The company have used the strategic methodology to waste management at Stockport site. Currently, employs 1 waste contractor, who focused on the re-use of waste packaged food product on site into a component such as plastic, cardboard and food. The idea includes: This process remove food from the packaging, and the food waste is used as an animal feed at their manufacturing site. this further separates and recover carton, plastic, metals and foodstuff which are then recycled separately. used in a number of ways – landscaping and soil pH treatment. the wastewater from the process is cleaned and reused after appropriate treatment. Instead of discharging the treated water is used to irrigate fields and as a fertiliser. In 2015, 50% sites of Jordans & Ryvita in UK, achieved zero waste to landfill while the other are constantly working towards the zero-landfill target. 76% of the waste generated in the year 2015 were recovered for beneficial purposes (circular economy). Finally, according to 2016 FDF progress report, all the members have sent zero food waste to landfill by the use of innovative waste management techniques such as composting, anaerobic digestion, incineration, liquid treatment plant and jet shredder. This has allowed the food manufacturing sites to convert the waste to a useful product such as biogas providing renewable energy.  This report on “sustainability in the Food Industry” covers the most important UK & EU environmental legislation and key drivers that promote sustainable practices within the public and commercial organisations. Also, current examples on how the food industry is managing sustainability practices in the use of portable water, use of energy and improvement in solid/liquid waste management. 1. Baldwin C.

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/23533. , Fesler-Lampert Professor of Ecological/Environmental Economics at University of Minnesota, opened the panel by reiterating that world is becoming increasingly urbanized, and that it is important to assess how exactly this movement toward urbanization affects resource sustainability. He highlighted the importance of research on urban systems as new and innovative ideas, technologies, and policies, are increasingly being driven and produced by cities. , director of the Brook Byers Institute for Sustainable Systems at the Georgia Institute of Technology, provided an overview of commonly used and emerging urban sustainability indicators. From a global perspective, Dr. Crittenden said that human society has many challenges in its path forward in reaching sustainability. He provided an example to illustrate what he termed society’s global report card in regards to interfering with natural cycles. The expanding world economy and increasing population creates more waste than nitrogen, phosphorous, water, and carbon cycles can handle, and society may not use or recycle enough renewable resources and material to offset consequent damages. To date, renewable energy sources contribute 18 percent of global energy production, yet 28 percent of material use. Meanwhile, 8.6 gigatons of carbon is being released into the atmosphere and 4,000 billion cubic meters of freshwater is being utilized, which is about 43 percent of available freshwater globally. Dr. Crittenden grouped sustainability indicators and metrics into three broad categories defined as ecological sustainability indicators, social sustainability indicators, and the environmental sustainability index. Ecological sustainability indicators such as ecological, carbon, and water footprint assessments evaluate the impacts on a certain natural system and/or cycle. Social sustainability indicators measure impacts across the social and economic spectrum. Examples include the genuine progress indicator that attempts to monetize all economic, social, and environmental factors; the happy planet index that measures the degree to which long and happy lives are achieved; and the human development index that combines life expectancy, educational development, and income. The environmental sustainability index uses indicators that measure two main components of environmental health and ecosystem vitality (). Though many of these indicators may add value to sustainability decision making in urban areas, he noted that further development of these indicators was needed and thus developed a toolbox to help address gaps in knowledge (). The toolbox’s improvement strategies are grouped into three layers: data and design, modeling, and decision support. Within the data and design layer, Dr. Crittenden indicated that modelers, scientists, and analysts could benefit from monitoring systems from within the larger infrastructure in which they exist. The cyber-physical infrastructure ""3 Urban Systems."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2016.

Bio-inspired design, or biomimicry, adapts systems by applying ideas or structures from the natural world, such as designing a building to mimic the passive heat and cooling system of a termite mound. Dr. Crittenden provided examples from systems-thinking design, bio-inspired design, and data-enabled design to intervene in these systems and achieve positive outcomes within larger infrastructure. Systems-thinking design may stray from the traditional approach of building urban infrastructure by considering the interdependencies and interactions between socioeconomic and physical factors. The increase in low-impact development represents such new systems-thinking design of urban areas which, for example, incorporate ecology into grey infrastructure and reconfigures a city to handle water as a sponge instead of a transmitter of water to large pipes, storm-water collection, or other large water reservoirs. This added green infrastructure may create new recreational and public spaces that can improve social well-being, physical health, and property values. ""3 Urban Systems."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2016. Transitioning Toward Sustainability: Advancing the Scientific Foundation: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/23533. Finally, the progression in data analytics improved the ability of urban sustainability decision makers to design around thousands of data points and individual preferences. In one study conducted by the Atlanta Regional Commission, a framework for autonomous vehicles was designed based on comments from more than 1,500 individuals, which identified future challenges such as protecting autonomous vehicles from cybersecurity threats, understanding how these vehicles will influence traffic congestion, and the policy incentives the city will need to establish the vehicles. Nevertheless, the data and design layer of urban sustainability modeling may need further development, and Dr. Crittenden stressed that science would benefit from analysis of the root of urban systems and structures—the citizens—and identify society’s preferences and values in order to create agent-based models that reflect how society’s decisions affect movement and interactions in the larger urban system. Cities and researchers frequently apply crowdsourcing to determine what citizens value and evaluate if the services that are provided fulfill these wants. In one study that Dr. Crittenden termed a study, the decisions made by a cohort of Atlanta citizens were analyzed at the microlevel of where these individuals lived, consumed, and worked. The study found that the city’s development strategies of designing new buildings and highways did not align with the citizens’ desires for an improved overall quality of life. In response, an agent-based model was developed that considered optimal land-use plans for Atlanta that provided amenities favorable to the adoption of a more sustainable infrastructure and improved quality of life. Dr. Crittenden acknowledged that agent-based modeling could improve its ability to capture complex and emergent properties of urban systems. As an example of progression in agent-based modeling, he presented the SMARTRAQ project (Strategies for Metropolitan Atlanta’s Regional Transportation and Air Quality), an urban planning model of development pattern scenarios in Atlanta. Researchers are now able to assess information on more than 1.3 million parcels and project the city’s growth patterns and potential to adopt compact growth practices based on an average of 35 attributes for each parcel, such as road type or owner-occupied tax value. Dr. Crittenden projected that growth will continue to sprawl and favor low to medium residential development in a business-as-usual scenario. More compact development action and policy, however, can reduce urban sprawl, increase land devoted to forests and greenways, and further commercial and residential growth. He additionally discussed how enhancement of sustainability indicators and metrics can provide valuable decision support in urban areas, particularly advancements in network analysis. He concluded his remarks by highlighting the issue of urban sprawl, and presented a comparative fractal dimension study of the Washington, D.C., road network versus the Atlanta road network. In the study, a high fractal dimension number indicated more connections to roads, easing single passenger transit and urban sprawl, which, in turn, results in a higher carbon footprint. He reinforced this assumption by finding a higher fractal dimension figure and a higher carbon footprint for Atlanta of 3.36 and 1.52 metric tons of carbon per capita per year, respectively. The fractal dimension figure and carbon footprint for Washington, D.C., was 2.80 and 1.07 metric tons of carbon per capita per year. , professor in the Department of Geography at Hunter College–City University of New York, discussed the connections between science and public policy in the context of cities. In terms of trends, most population growth over the next several decades will occur in urban areas, specifically in low-income countries and small- to medium-sized cities. In addition, recent international agreements, protocols, and understandings have seen an emergence of urban issues on the international policy agenda. For example, urban areas featured prominently during the 2015 United Nations World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction, in Sustainable Development Goal 11, and in the upcoming Habitat III summit.

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/23533. Dr. Solecki discussed the emergence of urbanization science and its conceptualization of urban areas, urban issues, and urbanization as a set of intersecting systems (). Urbanization science research investigates interactions within this conceptualization and attempts to translate these data into information useful for policy and decision makers. Recent developments in translating urbanization science to policy include the robustness of data information about urban processes, uncertainty measures, likelihood measures, and climate work, which have highlighted the increased need for nuanced scientific information for decision making. Questions of current indicators and monitoring have also emerged, such as what indicators are still considered appropriate for cities ""3 Urban Systems.""

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/23533. or how can existing monitoring systems be integrated and directed toward new policy agendas of sustainability, resilience, or climate change adaptation? The urban domain has witnessed a tremendous amount of growth in community organization, bottom-up approaches, boundary organizations, and demands for open and transparent processes in decision making, and coproduction of knowledge. Dr. Solecki further addressed traditional computational modeling, the role it plays in urban decision-making processes, and advancement in physical engineering (e.g., the built environment) and ecological system modeling (e.g., how urban ecosystems respond to stresses, evolve, and adapt to change) over the last 15 years. Computational models, however, may still require improvement to support decision making for the social side of urban issues. Other challenges may include a lack of appropriate data, capacity to operationalize urban systems analysis, basic science and expertise to address questions of sustainability, financial resources, and trust in products. One of the most flood-prone cities in the world—Calcutta, India—faces a data availability challenge because of a lack of access to a fully developed flood extent map for city officials to use in flood management. For the most part, urban practitioners and researchers have done little work in creating an integrated modeling approach for urban spatial planning, with the exception of some European Union countries and China. Dr. Solecki indicated that city leaders work at the right level of governance to spearhead sustainability action due to their local understanding of their community’s unique systems, risks, exposures, and vulnerabilities. In addition, these leaders retain links with local academic and research communities, direct contact with constituents, day-to-day management, and engagement with regional coordination efforts. Nevertheless, a number of challenges may remain for urban leaders, such as managing at a metropolitan scale, financing mitigation and adaptation measures, bridging differences between high- and lower-income cities, and maintaining momentum across municipal administrations and election cycles. He also reiterated various types of science-policy linkages in an urban setting, such as the emergent concept of coproduction of knowledge where different groups come together in a collaborative process to define issues, solve problems, and produce and disseminate knowledge. One example of this concept of coproduction of knowledge is Future Earth, an international research platform bringing together scientists of all disciplines, society, and users of science to coordinate new and interdisciplinary approaches for global environmental change and sustainability. Another example includes the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) Regional Integrated Sciences and Assessments (RISA) Program (see ), which promotes collaboration in the scientific community and information development directly with stakeholders to understand weather and climate risk issues, manage knowledge networks, and advance science policies (). Dr. Solecki concluded by emphasizing the significant development of policy-relevant research on urban systems. Cogeneration of knowledge is an innovative frontier; however, a number of limitations remain, including the predominance of power relations, legal constraints, time intensiveness, stakeholder fatigue, and the possibility of the scientific community losing its “outside-the-box, cutting edge” thinking. , professor of geography and urbanization and associate dean of research at the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies, addressed various advances in urban systems that could inform sustainability science. Dr. Seto said that for urban systems, it is projected that cities will build more buildings and roads between now and 2050 than currently exist around the world. Further, if the built environment in the developing world reaches similar levels to developed countries, global carbon dioxide emissions will not meet the 2015 international agreement from Paris of holding the increase in global average temperatures to below 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. The dominant conceptualization of cities considers urban environments within spatial boundaries of a city with a minimal focus on what happens outside a city. She indicated that bringing cities and the process of urbanization into the sustainability dialogue would benefit this urban conceptualization, provide new frameworks that look beyond urban impacts on resources or the environment, and incorporate the interactions between people and the environment that extend beyond the spatial boundaries of a city. As an example of progress in urban domains that could further inform sustainability science, Dr. Seto pointed to the creation of new institutions and programs on urban science. The Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis at the University College London is an example of an institution looking at spatial patterns and fractal analysis, while the Senseable City Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology provides another example of an institution focusing on “sensing” cities in real time. Dr. Seto notes, however, that these institutions and programs have not produced many new insights that challenge current understanding of urban systems. ""3 Urban Systems."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2016. Transitioning Toward Sustainability: Advancing the Scientific Foundation: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/23533. In light of the recent adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals, and Goal 11 on sustainable cities and communities, progress has been made in developing metrics and indicators for urban systems. The scientific community, however, has experienced a large degree of pushback in developing indicators and targets due to difficulty in data consistency and availability across countries. Other recent developments in urban science include a new interest by international organizations, development agencies, and foundations in developing new understandings and conceptualizations of cities. Dr. Seto acknowledged that despite advancements in urban sustainability metrics and indicators, a large disconnect exists between the information produced by urban science and the information usable in management at the local scale. This disconnect is a challenge for efforts to fight climate change. There are also challenges to urban sustainability from resource demands and poverty, and the options to address these problems at the local level may be constrained by regional or national contexts. Dr. Seto highlighted results from the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that reflect on a need for new efforts and developments in science to better inform sustainability science in cities. If the top 50 carbon-emitting cities were aggregated into one country, that country would still be the third largest emitter behind China and the United States. Large variations within or between developed and developing country cities’ average per capita energy use suggest that developed country cities operate more efficiently than developing country cities (). Scientist with different background would likely interpret these data differently. For example, a political scientist would interpret these graphs as illustrative of the varying institutions and governance across cities, an economist would point to the difference in economic structures, and urban planners would consider variations in transportation modes. Categorizing cities as either developed (Annex I) or developing (Annex II) does not provide the depth of needed information. Seto K.C., et al. 2014.

Transitioning Toward Sustainability: Advancing the Scientific Foundation: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/23533. Dr. Seto indicated that a large share of current research focuses on smart cities and sensing cities; however, further research should focus on different metrics and indicators of well-being rather than on ones targeting efficiency. In data gathering and analysis, the scientific community should look beyond measuring city growth. Observations and models of urban systems still lack sophistication compared with parallel observations and models of climate systems that have progressed not only spatially but also in complexity. An example of improving models of urban systems comes from researchers at the University of New Hampshire who utilized different types of satellite data to analyze the three-dimensional structure of cities. Additional research, she said, is needed to understand the interplay between the social and environmental dimensions of urbanization. Dr. Seto stressed the importance of progressing from models that only analyze interactions within a city to a global model that incorporates global hinterlands and feedbacks across multiple levels (see ). Dr. Seto concluded her remarks by identifying two important research needs urban science can contribute to sustainability science—updating frameworks and theoretical development and improving data and metrics that analyze linkages and flows over space and time. She also added that since a sustainable city has yet to be defined, progress toward sustainability in the urban domain will remain a challenge. In the question-and-answer session, the panelists discussed shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) as a framework for considering development and progress toward sustainability. Dr. Solecki noted that the urban community is beginning to utilize such thought processes, but that the notion of the trajectory of cities remains crucial, and in many cases these trajectories are not necessarily within the realm of SSPs. Dr. Seto added that the urban community would benefit from alternative thinking about science for urbanization given the pace and magnitude of its development, noting that the urban community currently thinks in terms of optimization and best scenarios. The scientific community has yet to define the optimal solution for urban sustainability or what a sustainable city would look like. Frolking, S., et al. 2013. A global fingerprint of macro-scale changes in urban structure from 1999 to 2009. 8(2):024004. The SSPs are part of a new framework that the climate change research community has adopted to facilitate the integrated analysis of future climate impacts, vulnerabilities, adaptation, and mitigation. The framework is built around a matrix that combines climate forcing on one axis (as represented by the Representative Forcing Pathways) and socio-economic conditions on the other. Together, these two axes describe situations in which mitigation, adaptation, and residual climate damage can be evaluated. Van Vuuren et al. 2012.

National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2016. Transitioning Toward Sustainability: Advancing the Scientific Foundation: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/23533. The panelists also discussed efficiency indicators related to urban sustainability. Dr. Solecki said that for city managers, an efficiency indicator’s ability to compare options using dollars allows for an easy measurement, but such an indicator does not account for all inputs, such as wellness and happiness, that are needed to achieve a sustainable city. Dr. Crittenden argued that the management of complex and diverse entities within a city is a more important role than ensuring urban efficiency by adopting a more sustainable infrastructure. Dr. Seto agreed, questioning whether efficiency measures really give the urban community any indication of well-being. A final question posed to the panelists concerned the justification of thinking about urban systems as closed systems rather than coupled-urban systems, given that rural-urban migration affects both urban communities and rural communities. Dr. Seto said that such a framing reflects issues of data limitations, and in part the current methods of data analysis, wherein she reiterated the importance of advancements in theoretical frameworks for urban systems. Dr. Crittenden offered an alternative response, stressing that at this stage, the focus on interactions within cities—the city as an ecosystem—is still important for sustainability given the objectives of optimizing resource use and efficiency.

In 1999 the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine released a landmark report, Our Common Journey: A Transition toward Sustainability, which attempted to “reinvigorate the essential strategic connections between scientific research, technological development, and societies’ efforts to achieve environmentally sustainable improvements in human well-being.”1 The report emphasized the need for place-based and systems approaches to sustainability, proposed a research strategy for using scientific and technical knowledge to better inform the field, and highlighted a number of priorities for actions that could contribute to a sustainable future. The past 15 years have brought significant advances in observational and predictive capabilities for a range of natural and social systems, as well as development of other tools and approaches useful for sustainability planning. In addition, other frameworks for environmental decision making, such as those that focus on climate adaptation or resilience, have become increasingly prominent. A careful consideration of how these other approaches might intersect with sustainability is warranted, particularly in that they may affect similar resources or rely on similar underlying scientific data and models. To further the discussion on these outstanding issues, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine convened a workshop on January 14–15, 2016. Participants discussed progress in sustainability science during the last 15 years, potential opportunities for advancing the research and use of scientific knowledge to support a transition toward sustainability, and challenges specifically related to establishing indicators and observations to support sustainability research and practice. This report summarizes the presentations and discussions from the workshop. 2 Decision Sciences, Demography, and Integrated Assessment Modeling Appendix C: Biographies of Planning Committee, Speakers, and Staff You're looking at OpenBook, NAP.edu's online reading room since 1999.

National Research Council. 2010. Certifiably Sustainable?: The Role of Third-Party Certification Systems: Report of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/12805. Surveying the Landscape: Certification Schemes for Sustainable Products and Services The field of certification standards and ecolabels has grown substantially since the early 1990s and now encompasses numerous complex issues, from labor and production processes to lifecycle and end-use considerations. However, like the diverse products and services which exist in today’s marketplace, these new standards and labels present consumers and buyers with a surfeit of options which can lead to confusion. Additionally, existing certification schemes are not uniform, nor are they immune to competing and sometimes false claims which, at best, contribute to “green noise” and consumer fatigue, and at worst, undermine the efforts which do contribute to environmental and social improvements. Just as there is no precise technical definition of sustainability, there is no precise set of metrics or immutable standards on which certification schemes might be based. Instead, as this field matures and advances, there is increasing evidence of what works and why, and where there is room for improvement. This paper attempts to analyze the vast field of certification as an approach to sustainability, and in particular it considers the dimensions of sustainability being certified; how certification standards are developed and implemented; impacts to producer communities, businesses, consumers, and the environment, and; future areas for potential growth. Ecolabels trace their history to Germany’s “Blue Angel” label, introduced in 1978. As the term label implies, it was developed to communicate that a product or service has “environmentally friendly” characteristics. ""Surveying the Landscape: Certification Schemes for Sustainable Products and Services--Derek Vollmer."" National Research Council. 2010. Certifiably Sustainable?: The Role of Third-Party Certification Systems: Report of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/12805. While the definition of what constitutes environmentally friendly evolves as the science and our understanding evolve, the basic notion behind this effort influenced several subsequent labels which seek to convey information, make environmental performance transparent, and empower consumers. Several factors explain this growing interest in certification as a tool, including the ineffectiveness of many governmental and intergovernmental processes, the rapid pace of economic globalization, and a general interest in pursuing innovative “smart regulation” to address adverse environmental and social impacts (Auld et al., 2008). Businesses have generally accepted this approach because they tend to be risk averse, although there is limited evidence that activist pressure actually affects market shares. Corporate strategies are changing and increasingly engaging nonbusiness stakeholders, and there is a perceived lack of credibility for industry self-regulation (Vogel, 2008). Certification of sustainably produced products first emerged, and has witnessed arguably the largest growth, in primary industries such as agriculture, fishing, and forestry. Auld et al. (2008) attribute this to the fact that certification is likely to be effective in sectors dominated by large, vertically integrated firms which are vulnerable to public pressure, and more able to afford additional costs of certification. It may also be a response to highly visible production practices in these sectors—unsustainable practices can lead to resource depletion as well as spillover effects which negatively impact the surrounding ecosystem. Additionally, these natural resources are primary inputs to manufactured items, from food products to furniture, and so secondary industries and those higher up in the value chain often rely on certificates or labels from their upstream suppliers if they intend to promote their own products as ‘organic’ or ‘sustainably sourced.’ As the market for green products has grown, and as regulators continue to seek innovative approaches to pollution prevention, voluntary certification standards have appeared in numerous secondary and service industries. The International Organization for Standardization’s ISO 14000 series for environmental management is easily the best known, and for many industries it has become a de facto requirement for conducting business internationally. It has in some respects become its own brand and brings with it recognition benefits which help justify its costs (Vogel, 2008). However, it is not a brand geared towards household consumers. Industries such as apparel are currently working on developing environmental and social certification schemes which might appeal directly to consumers, but to date they have not enjoyed the brand recognition of those in primary industries. There has been parallel growth in fair trade certification, which focuses on mitigating the negative impacts which a globalized economy imposes on small-share farmers and other producers in the developing world. More recently, some of these efforts, such as RugMark, have also focused on elim- ""Surveying the Landscape: Certification Schemes for Sustainable Products and Services--Derek Vollmer.""

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/12805. inating child labor. While fair trade is generally thought of as encompassing environmental sustainability as one of its tenets, its focus is inarguably on social and trade impacts. Similarly, some of the better known environmental standards, such as the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), attempt to take a holistic approach to resource management, including the economic and social implications of practices. However, as will be explored later, fair trade and environmental standards have taken divergent approaches and each has had mixed results in building market share. While there is no doubt that public pressure from activist campaigns, coupled with the threat of regulation, both influenced private regulatory standards in environmental protection and worker rights (Haufler, 2001), this also suggests that their development has been reactive and ad hoc rather than systematic. David Vogel (2008) and others have been critical of the notion that the ‘public’ participates in the development of many of these standards, and contend that western activists and NGOs have been the primary drivers and consumers. The FSC was created after NGOs failed to persuade governments to enact an effective international forestry treaty. Nonetheless, there does seem to be a correlation between existing regulatory requirements and establishment of third-party certification standards. In general, businesses have tended to support certification in areas where government regulations are most prescriptive, and the certification rules represent an incremental improvement over required practices (Auld et al., 2008). Implementing a certification program has generally required that stakeholders from different sectors cooperate. In this respect, there seems to be much that can be learned from the broader spectrum of multistakeholder or public-private partnerships. Specifically, three issues have been raised through recent analysis of these sorts of partnerships (Vollmer, 2009): During the initiating phase, more time could be spent identifying and engaging the necessary stakeholders (including national governments)—by rushing through this step and into implementation, programs have often overlooked crucial segments within their value chain, leading to competitive efforts, slow progress, and ultimately weakening the sustainability of the program itself; Reputational benefits appear to be a key but often overlooked driver for participation in these partnerships. When placed in the context of certifying products, it is likely worth exploring how much additional value, ""Surveying the Landscape: Certification Schemes for Sustainable Products and Services--Derek Vollmer."" National Research Council. 2010. Certifiably Sustainable?: The Role of Third-Party Certification Systems: Report of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/12805. in terms of reputational benefits, businesses attribute to their participation in or support of certification schemes; It is critical that more resources be devoted to studying and reporting on the impacts of these efforts; self-reporting has focused on processes and outputs, but without demonstration of more tangible progress towards sustainability, these programs will remain vulnerable. Stakeholder engagement has indeed been a fundamental challenge for many certification programs. Often times, it appears that local communities are being excluded from substantial participation in setting standards or making certification decisions (Vandergeest, 2007). And while certification efforts have been characterized as “nonstate market-driven” approaches (e.g., Cashore, 2004), this term is not meant to imply no government involvement. The reality is that governments frequently play at least a peripheral role in the implementation and uptake of these standards. Certification institutions often comprise shifting networks of actors, and are driven not only by markets but also by complex intersecting motives (Vandergeest, 2007). In fact, the success of many multistakeholder partnerships relies on government participation, most notably in the developing world (where participation lags), and most importantly in scaling up outcomes (NRC, 2009). One criticism of certification, despite the interaction of different stakeholder representatives, is that the schemes lack independence and fairness because they are developed in isolation, and can reflect a narrow set of perspectives (Lebel and Lorek, 2008). There are also questions of transparency. Industries are able to play an active role in creating voluntary standards and the methods to certify them, but these standards may also be implicitly endorsed by regulating agencies. This has of course been a major criticism of the multistakeholder approach, where industries are accused of becoming unduly influential in setting the global environmental governance agenda (e.g., Pattberg et al., 2007) The high cost of certification compliance is often cited as a key impediment to its growth in the market. Though there are potentials for price premiums, and in certain instances consumers are willing to pay higher prices (e.g., organic food, fair trade items), there is little evidence that these premiums are sustainable over the long term (UNEP, 2005). Moreover, it appears likely that producers are not the main beneficiary of the investments they need to make in order to become compliant (Ibid). Several schemes impose the costs of certification directly onto the producing entity, and impose complex documentation and monitoring requirements which put ""Surveying the Landscape: Certification Schemes for Sustainable Products and Services--Derek Vollmer."" National Research Council. 2010. Certifiably Sustainable?: The Role of Third-Party Certification Systems: Report of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/12805. small or less-organized producers at a disadvantage (Vandergeest, 2007). The growth in the organic food market has been aided in part by governments subsidizing part of the cost to farmers who adopt organic farming methods. For industries, it is important to consider what impact these added costs may have on their research and development (R&D) efforts. If compliance costs are high, in terms of changing production practices to meet a standard, industries must determine how best to invest resources. Managing an R&D portfolio is arguably more art than science, and so it becomes even more complex when voluntary standards are introduced and R&D resources must be divided among regulatory requirements, voluntary standards (there may be several competing standards), and more general innovation. This begs the question of whether or not there is a learning curve for certifying products. In other words, can compliance costs come down on a predictable path, or might costs go up as scale increases beyond a certain level? If so, this could have important implications for both the producers of certified goods and consumers who desire these goods but are unwilling to pay the price premium. It is also worth noting that costs need not be directly offset by a price premium. Guaranteed long-term contracts and increased market access are two potential benefits of undergoing a certification process. There is anecdotal evidence that large firms are beginning to require that their suppliers undergo certification (e.g., Home Depot purchasing FSC-certified timber). In addition, many certification programs seek to improve efficiencies (reduce energy, inputs, waste streams) and mitigate risks (accidents, social unrest, regulatory action). What is needed is a comprehensive calculation of the costs and benefits of undergoing certification. There is an important and dynamic tension between the desire for rigorous science-based standards, and the reality that for many producers and suppliers, such standards are either deemed too costly or too difficult to achieve without technical assistance. Technical standards have been described as “immutable mobiles,” those which could be developed in a think tank and then applied universally with very little flexibility (Vandergeest, 2007). From a business perspective, however, sound standards and guidelines are often preferable to the current situation, which is a crowded and confusing marketplace. Early adopters of rigorous standards fear being undercut by less rigorous competitors, and collectively the industry ends up diverting resources to marketing competing claims. Moreover, businesses may be hesitant to invest time and resources into changing production or sourcing practices if they do not have a clear signal ""Surveying the Landscape: Certification Schemes for Sustainable Products and Services--Derek Vollmer."" National Research Council. 2010. Certifiably Sustainable?: The Role of Third-Party Certification Systems: Report of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/12805. that the standards they are pursuing are in fact moving towards becoming an industry standard. This partially explains the relative success that certain standards have enjoyed through negotiating long-term contracts with large retailers. In the absence of government mandates, these large-scale buyers are offering guaranteed markets over specified amounts of time. Overall, there does appear to be a need for efforts to harmonize and define key terms for certification to succeed (Medina, 2005). A major limitation of environmental standards is that they are framed in technical terms and developed with limited input from producing communities. Setting aside the argument that these communities may have different definitions of what ‘sustainability’ means, it is important to recognize that diverse ecological and social conditions exist within any given sector. This has arguably been the primary driver behind competing schemes—rather than large industries, it is producing communities and even developing country governments which have taken steps to establish standards that better reflect local circumstances. While industry codes are often perceived to be less credible than third-party certification, there are recent efforts in the aquaculture and coffee sectors which seem to have been more successful than third-party approaches in engaging producers. The Aquaculture Certification Council (ACC) was set up by an industry organization—ACC certifies process rather than product, and its provisions for community involvement are among the strongest within aquaculture (Vandergeest, 2007). The Common Code for the Coffee Community (4C) is another industry-driven effort, and one of its ‘breakthroughs’ has been to seek creative ways to get (and keep) producers at the bargaining table (Kuenkel et al., 2009). Ideally, certification systems are oriented towards continual improvement. As market share increases, but more importantly as science advances, it will be crucial that this bar continues to rise, as it has in other areas, e.g., nutrition labeling. The ISO 14001 process for environmental management is an interesting case in that it does not require particular on-the-ground changes, which is different from many certification schemes which essentially set targets which firms rise to meet. Instead, ISO 14001 is tailored to individual firms and requires that they make a continual improvement from their own specified baseline. In effect, what it does is introduce a culture of better environmental management and stewardship, though critics will point out that this system allows firms to present insignificant changes as a major accomplishment by being labeled ISO 14001 compliant. The Common Code for the Coffee Community (4C) is another example—its premise is that, in order to elevate the environmental and social performance of the coffee industry, all the actors in the supply ""Surveying the Landscape: Certification Schemes for Sustainable Products and Services--Derek Vollmer."" National Research Council. 2010. Certifiably Sustainable?: The Role of Third-Party Certification Systems: Report of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/12805. chain must be brought along. To evaluate these actors, 4C uses a “stoplight” method and additive scoring system, with the idea that over time, and with technical assistance from 4C’s capacity building efforts, these individual actors and firms will improve their performance (Kuenkel et al., 2009). The U.S. Green Building Council’s Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) rating system for buildings also provides an interesting example. It uses an additive scoring system and offers multiple levels of compliance (platinum, gold, silver), as well as rewards innovations (additional points). It has also recently announced plans to raise certain standards for 2009 as the next evolution in the LEED system. Competition among certification schemes has led to mixed results. Efforts to achieve legitimacy place pressure on both the FSC and its industry competitors to alter rules, upward and downward (Cashore et al., 2004). In the U.S. organic market, there has been a tension between ‘senior stakeholders’ who have been in the market for several years and advocate higher standards and more stringent regulation, and the recent entrants who have favored a more free market approach (Johnson, 2008). While there is anecdotal evidence that competitors to the FSC, for example, have also contributed improvements in forest management, this does not indicate that this competition will continue to drive improvement. Moreover, it does not appear to be an efficient way to improve performance, given the scarce resources that must be diverted to marketing against competitors. Despite their growth, certified products continue to make up a small portion (<10 percent) of any market. This contributes to the argument that they are satisfying a niche market for “premium” green products (Esty and Winston, 2006). And while large-scale buyers and retailers have had and will continue to have an important influence on moving these products beyond niche markets, it is less clear that producers are poised to meet that growing demand. The existing markets in many cases may represent the low-hanging fruit—producers already oriented towards meeting the standards, supplying consumers willing to pay a price premium. Expanding this demand will require more attention to consumer behavior and leverage points (e.g., institutional buyers versus households). Meeting this demand will then require more attention to enabling noncompliant producers. Governments and corporations play an important role in facilitating the market for certified products. In the case of certified wood, they help create markets through their own preferential purchasing, and the South African government has even begun ‘outsourcing’ its forest surveillance operations ""Surveying the Landscape: Certification Schemes for Sustainable Products and Services--Derek Vollmer."" National Research Council. 2010. Certifiably Sustainable?: The Role of Third-Party Certification Systems: Report of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/12805. to the FSC (Vogel, 2008). Some reviews have suggested that procurement and long-term supply contracts may prove more important than price premiums [which rely on consumers willing to pay the premium] (e.g., UNEP, 2005). Efforts to court other large-scale buyers, particularly retailers, are well documented and have arguably become the preferred approach to growing the market for certain schemes. Thus targeting procurement policies of governments and firms, not just households, will be crucial to the long-term sustainability of these kinds of programs—however, procurement policies and behaviors are not well understood (Lebel and Lorek, 2008). Consumer behavior is key to the impact that a society has on the environment (Jackson et al, 2004). However, consumer behavior is still not well-understood, particularly as the marketplace grows and products with new attributes, e.g., ‘environmentally-friendly’ are introduced. Lebel and Lorek (2008) point out that issues of convenience, flexibility, and function matter a lot, and this may help explain why campaigns to promote ‘responsible buying’ have been limited in their success. They also note that routines are of great practical importance, because much daily behavior is habitual rather than a cognitive reasoning process. Ecolabels largely appeal to consumers who already have an interest in environmental issues (Rex and Baumann, 2007). This has alternately been referred to as ‘commodified activism’ (Fisher, 2007). A study of the impacts of dolphin-safe tuna labeling indicated that consumers did in fact respond to the ecolabel and help grow the market for certified dolphin-safe tuna; however, this study also noted a lack of research into the behavioral effectiveness of these sorts of programs (Teisl et al, 2002). A review of Americans’ understanding of genetically modified (GM) food suggested that the public is generally unaware, unfamiliar with the science of GM food, and unsure in their opinions on the subject (Hallman et al, 2004). In-depth studies of consumer practices when making purchase decisions are rare, and experiences with ecolabels as communication instruments suggest that many can be better designed, especially by paying more attention to the context in which they are used (Rex and Baumann, 2007). Conventional marketing techniques may have an impact as well—certification labels could be promotional tools rather than just conveying information. Promotion of green products has relied too strongly on ecolabels in isolation, and could make better use of the full range of marketing tools (Ibid). Fair Trade products have been marketed differently, and in particular campaigns have targeted household consumers (though they have more recently also targeted large-scale buyers). These consumers, in ""Surveying the Landscape: Certification Schemes for Sustainable Products and Services--Derek Vollmer."" National Research Council. 2010. Certifiably Sustainable?: The Role of Third-Party Certification Systems: Report of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/12805. turn, are often willing to pay a price premium. Both certifying organizations and advocacy groups have supported awareness programs and public outreach campaigns to this effect. However, several reviews of certification and ecolabels have concluded that household consumers are a narrow leverage point for influencing sustainable consumption (e.g., UNEP, 2005; Lebel and Lorek, 2008). The promise of a price premium is an important motivational tool, particularly for producers who expect to bear upfront costs associated with upgrading methods, paying for certification, and handling added administrative and documentation requirements—a failure to demonstrate access to proven consumer markets for these goods, or a failure to distribute any price premium equitably, will hinder the growth of certification (OECD, 2003). There has been a fair amount of criticism of existing standards as reinforcing global inequities of who defines and enforces standards (OECD, 2003; UNEP, 2005; Vandergeest, 2007). These standards are also criticized as reflecting the capacity of developed countries to meet them and leaving developing countries at a disadvantage. Interestingly, although government-enacted standards are regulated in international trade by the WTO, voluntary social and environmental labels do not currently fall under its jurisdiction. Not only are developing countries less involved in shaping these standards, they are often to meet them as a condition of doing business. This illustrates the need for analysis of the actual impact of certification on the environmental practices of firms in developing countries. The lack of data to understand these impacts is well known (e.g., UNEP, 2005), but recent research has suggested that the scope of coverage for certification programs is low in developed countries (Keane, 2008). For fair trade initiatives, there has also been a danger of producers being crowded out by other interests, or other producers, who form a club of privileged producers enjoying the price premium—this points to the need for meaningful representation of smaller-scale producers (Lebel and Lorek, 2008). Environmental benefits of certification are even less certain and have not yet been demonstrated in any meaningful way in terms of outcomes. While there has been some consideration of a ‘rebound effect’ undermining efforts to make consumption more sustainable, this argument does not hold up outside of the energy sector. Energy efficiency improvements have enabled households and industry alike to consume increasing amounts of energy and electricity services, e.g., refrigerators have become substantially The rebound effect refers to situations where improved environmental performance leads to increased consumption, thereby offsetting some of the gains. ""Surveying the Landscape: Certification Schemes for Sustainable Products and Services--Derek Vollmer."" National Research Council. 2010. Certifiably Sustainable?: The Role of Third-Party Certification Systems: Report of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/12805. more efficient over the decades, but have also become considerably larger. There is a possibility that the green building movement could influence consumers towards new construction and away from retrofitting existing buildings. However, in most sectors, it does not appear likely that reducing adverse environmental and social impacts will correlate to increased consumption. Given the vast potential of carbon and renewable energy markets, it seems that certification may play a considerable role in facilitating this market. In recent years, renewable energy certificates (RECs) have been developed as a way for businesses and states within the United States to meet stated goals for utilizing green or renewable power—this of course relies on a credible third-party certifier and several have emerged to track and guard against double-counting. Carbon offsets, which can be anything from energy efficiency projects to afforestation projects, are another financial instrument which relies on certification. Given that these carbon offsets are likely to be an important component of greenhouse gas mitigation efforts (and that many of the opportunities will likely be in tropical forests in developing countries), one hopes that the experiences with certification to date can feed forward and lead to improved programs to certify these offsets—the existing Clean Development Mechanism does not appear to be an appropriate model (NRC, 2009a). The Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHGP) is a program established in 2001, developed by the World Resources Institute and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development. Although it has become a sort of industry standard for calculating GHG emissions, the ISO announced in late 2008 that they intended to develop a common standard for measure carbon footprints, which would presumably be a competitor to the GHGP. While certain ecosystem services are being valued in the marketplace (e.g., forest products), there are a host of other services which are not currently valued, biodiversity being a prime example. Certification is one of many tools being considered to eventually begin placing tangible value LEED and other green building standards do have standards for existing buildings, and in the case of LEED it is catching up in terms of registered floor area, but this is still insignificant given the amount of existing stock. ""Surveying the Landscape: Certification Schemes for Sustainable Products and Services--Derek Vollmer."" National Research Council. 2010. Certifiably Sustainable?: The Role of Third-Party Certification Systems: Report of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/12805. on ecosystems, with the hope of generating revenue which could be used to protect and perhaps restore them. Experience from other sectors in certifying and instead of focusing on production practices may be useful in creating new standards to support ecosystem stewardship. Recent reviews of certification have identified issues requiring more research. Auld et al. (2008) describe certification efforts as ‘win-lose situations’ in that they require longer to realize economic benefits, but the authors also point out that such win-lose situations deserve more attention because if they emerge as purposeful features of the marketplace, they hold the greatest potential for moving consumption towards sustainability. The authors also note that organizations can change in response to external pressures—evolution may occur through competition or regulation, and this evolutionary framework is important to understand how win-lose situations might transform into win-win situations over time. David Vogel’s review (2008) of civil regulations takes an even broader perspective, and he suggests that there are too few studies that examine the global impact of civil regulations (including certification) and their effectiveness. He calls for more research into the relationship between civil regulation and state regulation, as well as research into the ‘black box’ of business thinking, to better understand how firms balance costs of acting responsibly with the business risks of not doing so. While there are undoubtedly many additional lessons to be uncovered by mining the knowledge of practitioners, collective experience and analyses to date suggest several issues which have bearing on the effectiveness of certification: Firms, not households, appear to be the important lever in building markets for certified products; consumer education is important, since they ultimately purchase the products, but retailers and other large-scale purchasers (e.g., governments) represent substantial portions of the market can play a role in marketing certified products; There is an important tension between adopting rigid evidence-based standards and flexible, custom-tailored standards; some degree of flexibility seems desirable, both to encourage innovation at the top and to make room at the bottom, though low-level compliance ought to be matched with a capacity-building component to bring about improvement; ""Surveying the Landscape: Certification Schemes for Sustainable Products and Services--Derek Vollmer."" National Research Council. 2010. Certifiably Sustainable?: The Role of Third-Party Certification Systems: Report of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/12805. The market share for certified products continues to be small, and to date, consumer demand has been limited—increasing awareness and preference for sustainable products has not yet translated to demonstrable changes in demand; On balance, the competition among standards within a sector has raised the overall level of performance, albeit slowly and arguably at considerable cost to businesses. A more efficient and effective approach might be a single scheme within a sector, but with gradients to reflect different levels of compliance; Impacts and unintended consequences of certification schemes deserve more careful attention and study. Even if a program is delivering on its stated goals, from a sustainability perspective it is important to consider the system in which it is operating. Benefits and positive impacts/outcomes also deserve more rigorous analysis—self-reporting, even from a multistakeholder partnership, is no substitute for objective evidence of a program’s impacts; Certification schemes are not meant to be independent from governments. Governments often play a critical facilitative role, as a broker, partner, endorser, or large-scale purchaser. There are also a number of critical issues deserving further inquiry, including: To what extent might there be a learning curve for certification within a sector? Can learning be applied across sectors, so that implementation costs are reduced? How has the growth of certification affected research and development (R&D) within firms? Are they devoting resources to exceeding standards, or simply meeting them? How has uncertainty about the direction of standards and labels affected decisions on where to make investments (e.g., marketing, improved processes, within the supply chain)? What are the longer-term environmental outcomes of certification programs, and how might they be measured and demonstrated? Is this an issue of scale, or is it a problem of tracing program outputs through to long-term outcomes? Auld, G., S. Bernstein, and B. Cashore. 2008. The New Corporate Social Responsibility.

Consumption of goods and services represents a growing share of global economic activity. In the United States, consumption accounts for more than two-thirds of gross domestic product. This trend of increasing consumption has brought with it negative consequences for the environment and human well-being. Global demand for energy, food, and all manner of goods is on the rise, putting strains on the natural and human capital required to produce them. Extractive industries and production processes are prominent causes of species endangerment. Modern economies are underpinned by substantial energy consumption, a primary contributor to the current climate crisis. Expanding international trade has led to many economic opportunities, but has also contributed to unfair labor practices and wealth disparities. While certain processes have improved or become more efficient, and certain practices have been outlawed or amended, the sheer scale of global consumption and its attendant impacts continue to be major challenges we face in the transition to sustainability. Third-party certification systems have emerged over the last 15 years as a tool with some promise. There has been anecdotal evidence of success, but to date the overall impact of certified goods and services has been small. Moreover, definitions of sustainable vary across sectors and markets, and rigorous assessments of these programs have been few and far between. In order to take a step in learning from this field of practice, the National Academies' Science and Technology for Sustainability Program held a workshop to illuminate the decision making process of those who purchase and produce certified goods and services. It was also intended to help clarify the scope and limitations of the scientific knowledge that might contribute to the economic success of certified products. The workshop, summarized in this volume, involved presentations and discussions with approximately 40 invited experts from academia, business, government, and nongovernmental organizations.

Congress has an ongoing interest in ensuring that the 500,000 buildings and other structures owned and operated by the Department of Defense (DOD) are operated effectively in terms of cost and resource use. Section 2830 of the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year requires the Secretary of Defense to submit a report to the congressional defense committees on the energy-efficiency and sustainability standards used by DOD for military construction and major renovations of buildings. DOD's report must include a cost-benefit analysis, return on investment, and long-term payback for the building standards and green building certification systems, including: (A) American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Standard 189.1-2011 for the Design of High-Performance, Green Buildings Except Low-Rise Residential. (B) ASHRAE Energy Standard 90.1-2010 for Buildings Except Low-Rise Residential. (C) Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Silver, Gold, and Platinum certification for green buildings, as well as the LEED Volume certification. (D) Other American National Standards Institute (ANSI) accredited standards. DOD's report to the congressional defense committees must also include a copy of DOD policy prescribing a comprehensive strategy for the pursuit of design and building standards across the department that include specific energy-efficiency standards and sustainable design attributes for military construction based on the cost-benefit analysis, return on investment, and demonstrated payback required for the aforementioned building standards and green building certification systems.

Because it is UNCORRECTED material, please consider the following text as a useful but insufficient proxy for the authoritative book pages. 42 This chapter synthesizes the information that emerged from the interviews, supplemented by information from the literature search. It highlights sustainability benefits, effective strat- egies and practices, stakeholder communication methods and messages, as well as research observations. In addition to the interview and literature search findings, the Research Team created an executive-level PowerPoint presentation, which conveys why sustainability attri- butes should be included in airport capacity-enhancing projects. This presentation is con- tained in Appendix E, which can be found on the TRB website (www.trb.org) by searching for âACRP Synthesis 93.â Sustainability Benefits The case examples presented in this report shed light on the benefits that can be realized by adopting a sustainability approach to capacity-enhancing projects. Sustainability benefits include the following: â¢ Cost savings: Airports can achieve cost savings from a range of areas, such as reduced operat- ing cost, employee retention and productivity, reduced operations and maintenance, reuse or conservation of resources, and avoided mitigation costs. â¢ Risk mitigation: By using a long-term perspective and evaluating systematic impacts of deci- sions using economic, environmental, social, and operational criteria, risks can be anticipated and mitigated early. â¢ Enhanced reputation: An airport that conveys its role in the local economy, stewardship of natural resources, and commitment to social responsibility can develop a âgood neighborâ reputation within its community. â¢ Legitimacy: Being able to demonstrate leadership in sustainability, especially when it comes to a capacity-enhancing project that affects the local community, provides an airport with reputational capital to draw on next time it wants to propose a new initiative. â¢ Facilitating innovation: Using a sustainability framework can spark innovations in areas such as how to better streamline operations or how to encourage employee well-being. â¢ Differentiating factor: Determining unique and engaging ways to communicate sustainability innovations can serve as a differentiating factor for airports. â¢ Regulatory cooperation: Taking a proactive approach to environmental stewardship can make environmental regulatory processes less arduous and require less mitigation on the airportâs part. â¢ Community champions: Airports that effectively collaborate with community stakeholders may find champions within the community that are willing to amplify the airportâs efforts on sustainability. C H A P T E R 4 Findings Findings 43 â¢ Accountability: Having an established sustainability plan, with subsequent updates or annual reports keeps an airport accountable to its goals and commitments. â¢ Lower emissions: Through efforts such as decreasing energy consumption, streamlining operations, and reducing dependence on fossil fuels, airports can lower their greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants. â¢ Waste reduction: Establishing or enhancing waste management programs can reduce the quantity of waste sent to landfills, incinerators, or waste water facilities. Consolidating redun- dant systems or digitizing processes that were historically reliant on hard-copy materials can reduce the quantity of waste generated in the first place. â¢ Increased revenue flows: Airports can increase their revenue flows through initiatives such as generating renewable energy on unused land or available roof space. â¢ Increased operational efficiency: Incorporating sustainability concepts within a capacity- enhancing project can generate innovative ideas for increasing efficiency, which can ripple across other aspects of airport operations. â¢ Enhanced connectivity between stakeholders: Frequently engaging with stakeholders can facilitate enhanced connectivity and cooperation among them, providing airport staff with opportunities to collaborate with multiple stakeholders at once and focus on issues that are deemed high-priority across stakeholder groups. Effective Strategies and Practices The strategies and practices described are synthesized from the interviews and further under- score the âwhyâ of sustainability. These items can be used to mitigate business risk and reduce costs, to assuage the concerns of community groups, and ultimately to demonstrate success emanating from sustainability to help encourage its further use. â¢ Framing sustainability as a mechanism to make smarter business decisions and to mitigate business risk can help garner the attention of airport executives and decision-makers. â¢ Using a framework of sustainability to identify and evaluate social, fiscal, and environmental impacts can help ensure smooth implementation of a decision or plan. With these impacts identified, direct, pre-emptive outreach can assuage the concerns of stakeholders who might otherwise push back against airport enhancement or development efforts. â¢ Utilizing tools such as checklists or matrices facilitates consistent application of sustain- ability practices, and ensures that the benefits of a sustainability approach can be realized in a projectâs implementation. â¢ Incorporating sustainability language into legal documents (i.e., RFPs and tenant leases) can help institutionalize sustainability by integrating triple bottom line considerations into the airportâs supply chain for procuring goods and services. â¢ Establishing systems so that compliance of sustainability language in legal documents can be tracked and enforced further institutionalizes sustainability. â¢ Involving representation from a broad range of airport departments in project planning can mitigate future delays with project development and implementation. Inclusion of operations and maintenance staff is especially important to ensure the necessary operations and mainte- nance activities are considered in project planning and design, and that operational execution matches the intended practice. â¢ Embracing sustainable initiatives and communicating these undertakings early in the project planning process can save time and money compared with needing to assuage the concerns of stakeholders later in the project planning process. Consistent application of this can also help the airport staff develop a more effective rapport with key stakeholders (environmental groups, neighboring communities, etc.). 44 Sustainabilityâs Role in Enhancing Airport Capacity Stakeholder Communication Methods and Messaging Stakeholder engagement and communication are important to the successful implementation of the effective strategies and practices. With advances in technology and the emergence of new media platforms, facilitating participatory communication with stakeholders is an area that con- tinues to evolve. The following list contains effective methods that emerged from this research, and additional resources related to communications are provided in Appendix B: â¢ Conducting tours of the airport, highlighting sustainable operations and facilities. â¢ Placing plaques and informational placards that highlight sustainable efforts in areas where passengers will see themâsuch as at seats by the gates, on windows looking out to the air- field, and in restrooms. â¢ Conducting direct outreach to key stakeholdersâsuch as elected officials or local businessesâthrough meetings or events before, during, and after the project. â¢ Hosting, participating in, or sponsoring community events. â¢ Hosting open houses, community meetings, or workshops on specific airport initiatives. â¢ Having airport representatives attend community meetings to answer questions and gain insights on community perspective. â¢ Engaging tenants through regular meetings and more active tactics such as providing GHG or sustainability benchmarking services. â¢ Including a wide variety of airport staff in developing sustainability goals, targets, and initiatives. â¢ Developing and circulating internal and external newsletters. â¢ Creating a sustainability report, dedicated microsite, and supporting outreach materials such as factsheets, videos, and social media posts. â¢ Including airport sustainability staff members on internal airport committees and in other departmental meetings. â¢ Providing an introductory-level âSustainability 101â presentation to internal airport staff members in different departments. The following list contains effective messaging approaches that emerged from this research: â¢ Focusing on job creation and economic benefits of both capacity enhancements and sustain- ability efforts. â¢ Highlighting disadvantaged business enterprise and minority inclusion in the project or effort. â¢ Showcasing quantified benefits from the sustainability efforts. â¢ Connecting sustainability to the roles and impacts of specific employees or department. â¢ Tying sustainability to corporate organizational mission and ethos. Research Observations The following list contains the main takeaways from the Research Teamâs interviews relating to experiences with sustainabilityâs role in capacity enhancement: â¢ As the number of air travelers continues to grow, airports are faced with capacity constraints that impede their ability to provide efficient and convenient travel experiences. When pas- senger growth outpaces capacity, airport staff can be faced with dissatisfied customers due to issues such as flight delays, congestion around the airport, and inadequate infrastructure. â¢ Strong executive direction and a culture of sustainability can lead to successful integration of sustainability within capacity-enhancing projects, as can meaningful sustainability policies. When all three exist togetherâcomplementing and reinforcing each otherâsustainability is most effectively incorporated into an airportâs way of doing business. â¢ Integrating sustainability measures within airport operations is an iterative process wherein lessons learned are drawn from initial efforts to inform and enhance future efforts, thus resulting in a progressive learning process for airport staff. Findings 45 â¢ Community-based governance supports sustainability by incorporating multiple perspectives and establishing the communityâs stake in the airportâs development. â¢ A culture of sustainability is best developed, ingrained, and solidified with drive and support from top-level decision-makers, in conjunction with efforts to ensure employee ownership and involvement in the direction of sustainability. â¢ While sometimes accompanied with a higher upfront cost, projects or approaches incorpo- rating sustainability initiatives in the early planning stages can save the airport money from a life-cycle cost perspective, sometimes with a very short payback. â¢ Benchmarking sustainability performance is vital, allowing the airport to quantify its perfor- mance and track (and communicate to its community and stakeholders) improvements in the future. Using a third party to establish a benchmark is best, because the airport can compare its performance with its peers and other industries. â¢ Sustainability encourages innovation, and can be used to improve airport operations and passenger experience by applying a cohesive lens through which to frame and solve complex problems. â¢ Early sustainability efforts often focus on environmental stewardship, but through an under- standing of the value streams that can be unlocked through EONS, airports broaden their initiatives to capture additional benefits. Observations from the literature search, highlighted in the following list, complement and reinforce the interview takeaways: â¢ Airport development to accommodate forecasted growth gives rise to new challenges such as environmental impacts or lack of community support. In the worst-case scenarios, airport projects have been met with environmental protests, land occupation, legal confrontation, and costly public inquiry (Upham et al. 2003). However, enhancing capacity can provide positive contributions such as job opportunities, efficient and secure transportation, higher incomes, and increased tourism (Koc and Durmaz 2015). â¢ Local community opposition can be managed by adopting a âgood neighborâ strategy that addresses the major issues of concern, while still meeting commercial or economic objec- tives. It is important to provide information to local residents about the actions being taken to resolve the perceived problems, to establish a system of public consultation, to set targets publicly for improvement, and then to implement transparent monitoring systems to show that progress is being made. In addition to minimizing the adverse effects of airport growth, it is also important that airports develop strategies that maximize the social and economic benefits of continuing growth, and target these strategies areas of greatest need or areas most affected by their operation (Upham et al. 2003). â¢ Establishing community liaisons, drawn from each airport department and appointed by their peers to coordinate and facilitate community involvement, can serve as a strategy to anticipate and manage potential stakeholder conflicts (Amaeshi and Crane 2006). â¢ Another way to foster community dialog is to establish a consultative committee of commu- nity representatives to serve as the formal interface between the airport and its neighboring communities. This committee would meet regularly and with press in attendance to request progress updates or suggest new reports from the airport on issues of concern to the com- munity (Amaeshi and Crane 2006). â¢ Although the benefits that result from the growth and development of an airport tend to be spread over a large geographical area, the environmental costs are typically borne by the resi- dents of its neighboring communities (Upham et al. 2003). â¢ There are several viable approaches, but ultimately no all-encompassing model or tool kit for effective stakeholder participation. Effective stakeholder participation depends on a variety of place-specific social, economic, and environmental criteria (Thomas and Lever 2003).

The federal government operates a portfolio of almost one million facilities (429,000 buildings and 482,000 other structures) whose core purposes are to support the conduct of public policy, to help defend the national interest, and to provide services to the American public. How well federal facilities perform in terms of resource use (energy, water, materials, fossil fuels) and indoor environmental quality, and how much they cost to build, operate, and maintain, can support or hinder the ability of federal agencies to achieve their missions on a routine basis and during disasters. Federal facilities’ performance and cost also have effects on the environment, the health and safety of building occupants, and on taxpayers. For these reasons, Congress has enacted laws and several presidential administrations have issued executive orders to improve the overall performance of federal facilities and to reduce the costs of operating them. Those mandates set performance objectives for high-performance federal buildings, also referred to as green buildings. The U.S. Department of Defense (DOD), the military services—the U.S. Army, the U.S. Air Force, the U.S. Navy, the U.S. Marine Corps—and other DOD components together represent the largest single owner of facilities among all federal agencies. DOD components own and operate more than one-half million facilities (297,000 buildings and 211,000 additional structures) in the United States and abroad to support national defense-related activities. To help meet congressional and executive mandates regarding high-performance federal facilities, DOD and the military services have been using building standards and green building certification systems to design and evaluate the performance of their buildings for more than a decade. Over time, DOD has modified its internal policies regarding the use of standards as knowledge about and experience with the design and operation of high-performance buildings has increased in both the public and private sectors. Because DOD has invested and continues to invest billions of dollars in its facilities, the congressional defense committees want to ensure that DOD facilities are being operated efficiently in terms of cost and resource use. Section 2830 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 requires the Secretary of Defense to submit a report to the congressional defense committees with a cost-benefit analysis, return on investment, and long-term payback of specific energy-efficiency and ""Front Matter.""

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/18282. sustainability standards used by DOD for military construction and renovation. The standards to be evaluated are American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Standard 189.1-2011 for High-Performance Green Buildings, ASHRAE Energy Standard 90.1-2010, the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) green building certification system, and other American National Standards Institute-accredited standards, which include a version of the Green Globes green building certification system. DOD’s report to the congressional defense committees must also include a copy of DOD’s policy prescribing a comprehensive strategy for the pursuit of design and building standards across the department that include specific energy-efficiency standards and sustainable design attributes for military construction. To provide independent, objective advice in developing DOD’s response to Congress, the Deputy Undersecretary of Defense for Installations and Environment asked the National Research Council to establish an ad hoc committee of experts to complete three related tasks: Conduct a literature review that synthesizes the state-of-the-knowledge about the costs and benefits, return on investment, and long-term payback of specified design standards related to sustainable buildings; Evaluate a consultant-generated methodology and analysis of the cost-benefit, return on investment, and long-term payback for specified building design standards and evaluate the consultant’s application of the methodology using empirical data from DOD buildings; Identify potential factors and approaches that the DOD should consider in developing a comprehensive strategy for its entire portfolio of facilities that includes standards for energy-efficiency and sustainable design. The Committee on Energy-Efficiency and Sustainability Standards Used by the Department of Defense for Military Construction and Repair included seven experts from government, industry, and academia. The committee held its first meeting at the end of June 2012 and was charged to complete its three related tasks within 6 months. The committee’s report on those tasks is organized as follows: sets the context for the congressional request, provides information on federal laws and mandates, identifies the committee’s statement of task and related issues, and describes the committee’s approach to that task. describes factors related to the DOD operating environment that are relevant to the task, describes ASHRAE Standards 90.1-2010 and 189.1-2011 and the LEED and Green Globes green building certification systems, and identifies similarities and differences between the two systems. provides background information on selected economic performance methods and measures, issues related to performance measurement of buildings, provides the committee’s evaluation of the DOD consultant’s report, and identifies issues related to the potential application of the consultant’s analytical approach in the DOD operating environment. summarizes the literature review conducted by the committee and the committee’s conclusions. presents the committee’s findings from the literature search and its evaluation of the DOD consultant’s report. Based on those findings and the committee members’ expertise and experience, the committee identified five recommended approaches for DOD’s consideration as it develops its comprehensive strategy and its response to Congress.

I personally consider it an honor and privilege to have served and worked with the other members of the committee, each a recognized expert in his or her field and each of whom volunteered their time and knowledge as a public service. As a team we appreciate the unwavering support and timely assistance of the NRC staff. DOD has been a leader in adopting and adapting energy-efficiency and sustainability criteria and standards for buildings for more than 15 years. Given the relatively narrow scope of its tasks and the 6-month time frame, the committee could not highlight all of the programs and initiatives for improving the performance of facilities that are underway within DOD and the military services. The committee is aware, however, that those initiatives include comprehensive efforts to reduce the energy use of DOD installations, the development and testing of new building-related technologies, and the evaluation of the performance of its facilities, among many others. Nonetheless, in this report the committee has identified additional opportunities for DOD to lead the way in improving the performance of its buildings based on measured results of the actual outcomes of high-performance buildings. Through collaboration with other federal agencies, not-for-profit organizations, and the private sector, DOD can also take a leadership role in improving the knowledge and practices required to improve the performance of buildings throughout the United States. Through those and other efforts, DOD has a unique opportunity to lower the total cost of ownership of its facilities over the long term, to reduce environmental impacts, to improve the quality of life for the military and their families, and to benefit the entire nation.

Congress has an ongoing interest in ensuring that the 500,000 buildings and other structures owned and operated by the Department of Defense (DOD) are operated effectively in terms of cost and resource use. Section 2830 of the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year requires the Secretary of Defense to submit a report to the congressional defense committees on the energy-efficiency and sustainability standards used by DOD for military construction and major renovations of buildings. DOD's report must include a cost-benefit analysis, return on investment, and long-term payback for the building standards and green building certification systems, including: (A) American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Standard 189.1-2011 for the Design of High-Performance, Green Buildings Except Low-Rise Residential. (B) ASHRAE Energy Standard 90.1-2010 for Buildings Except Low-Rise Residential. (C) Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Silver, Gold, and Platinum certification for green buildings, as well as the LEED Volume certification. (D) Other American National Standards Institute (ANSI) accredited standards. DOD's report to the congressional defense committees must also include a copy of DOD policy prescribing a comprehensive strategy for the pursuit of design and building standards across the department that include specific energy-efficiency standards and sustainable design attributes for military construction based on the cost-benefit analysis, return on investment, and demonstrated payback required for the aforementioned building standards and green building certification systems.

This paper analyses such processes based on eight key components in order to evaluate and explain transformation and transition towards a sustainable lifestyle. Actors on all levels of society are included in this approach, creating a whole framework. Global megatrends, such as climate change, demographic change or resource scarcity will be put into relation with current policies and production trends, which play an important role for the development of transition pathways and future scenarios. This will enable us to work out guidelines and ideas on how to create a more sustainable society specifically. Transformation; Key intervention area; consumption and production Social innovations, which transform resource intensive routines and practices into low resource ones, combined with socio-technically designed transition paths, which are created around sustainability and environmental criteria, are milestones for implementation and of SCP (Sustainable Consumption and Production). Those transition-strategies, defined by their complexity in a multilevel governance system, are materialised via low resource and sustainable Product-Service-Systems (PPS), as well as infrastructures – referring to all products, services and infrastructures surrounding us. These can support and promote (but currently also inhibit) the development of more sustainable lifestyles and business models through their design []. Efficiency, consistency and sufficiency-strategies are taken as basis for sustainable design of PSS and its needed infrastructures, in order to inhibit negative rebound effects [-]. If anything, sustainable design is able to produce positive rebound effects through materialised social innovations in the broad field of PSS (e.g. integrated Car Sharing in businesses, enterprises and at home; within the group of commuters living less than 10 km away from work, who take the bicycle instead of the car; within enterprises of the - and chemical-leasing industry, compare also [,]. The variety and creativity to be found within options for solutions and innovations is used as incremental basis for a societal and economical sustainable development and change. Given that 24,6 Mio. German commuters (up to 10 km) use the bicycle instead of their car to commute to work; a reduction of 5.658.000.000 litres in fuel savings within a period of six months would be the result. The connected financial savings amount to around 8 billion Euro. This equals an estimated material footprint of 9.205.255 t and a carbon footprint of 15.661.344 t CO. Overall, this scenario is optimistic. 10 km are most likely further, than many cyclist are willing to ride.” By calculating with only 25% of the effected commuters, 3 months with 5 working days each year and less than 5 km, we still find relevant results, especially as we only focus on one of the many practices in everyday life. This contribution will try to work out key areas or key interventions of a change management aiming towards a more sustainable society and economy (). The German Resources Commission 2014 defined eight structuring and integrating key intervention areas which are going to be explored in detailed, illustrated by . Key intervention arenas for a sustainable transformation. The needed innovation system is characterized by high complexity – social, material or substance-connected, structural, technological, action-oriented, but also institutional. It reaches and covers all levels of multi-level governance systems [-] and shows a detailed and encompassing system differentiation, as well as complexity of the system requirements on each of the levels. When introducing a social transition, such as „Commuting traffic by bike then by car”, every commuting person is able to imagine, which complex transformations would be implied: Bicycle lanes, deceleration of motor traffic, guidance systems for bicycles, security equipment and traffic education, parking and repair management, incentive structures in order to change, change of status symbols, communication strategies and campaigns, and much more. At the same time responsibilities for the needed management of such a sustainable development of PSS are neither transparent nor comprehensible for the participating actors. Participating agents are a various kinds of law-government/governance and economical systems, independent from each other or completely non-transparent within their global, common value chain. This leads to opaque power, decision- and management structures, which materialise themselves again in infrastructures and PSS. illustrates the steps of a value chain including its whole complexity, explaining the manifesting and materializing integration of cultural and technical perspectives in the respective productionconsumption system within it. A sustainable design needs to be concerned about and affect all levels of the value chain/networks, as well as the integration of the system’s socio-technological and , in order to detect and use mutual potentials. This is posing complex challenges to the competencies of all involved actors; challenges which they are not used to confront (yet). All the more it is important to create exploration spaces to study actively, to shape changes in a resilient and sustainable way. Until recently consumer and consumption have not been acknowledged as active part of the value chain, but positioned as pure users of given structures and product coding, not accountable as influencing structural actor. As more and more sustainable developments, e.g. in the field of climate change, struggled to efficiently reach out into the public sphere, changes in how consumers are perceived occur. This is not surprizing given the fact, that the excluded system-actors are the target group for economy and PSS (). Cultural determines technical perspective on production and consumption. Technical advance does not necessarily lead to an advance in competition, because technologies and individuals need to fit together, before a new product works. Sustainability can play a relevant role on new markets, but needs to be explored. Green business plans, aiming towards maintenance of well-being and wealth, while lowering resource consumption and exploitation, try to maintain the same or even better possibilities for next generations. This can only be achieved by joint strategies. Liedtke et al. [,] described that possible scenarios of such lifestyles and societies can follow different low resource, but also intensive strategies, through following either a constructive or posing orientation and connected to societal frames and interpretations (). Arguing further towards this position, a society of continuation tries to use efficiency strategies in order to resourcefully overcome borders. It has a sense or common knowledge of limits, but wishes to overcome them, by hoping for technical innovations, which would enable the actors to follow the already taken path of acceleration. Time and resource consumption, as well as interpretation of activity patterns are jointly related. Scenarios of low resource and resource-intensive perspectives of society. The latter is taken as even more important in the scenario of a “flow/passage-society”, inheriting a strong logic of enhancement and leading to a maintenance of old ways of doing, by using paths, which have brought wealth to industrial countries (). This path would, according to all research results, lead to a doubling of resource extraction until 2030 [,]. The Steady Stock Society (for a resource related depiction of different scenarios comapre Bringezu and Bleischwitz [], () instead inherits logic of limits and of squealing (). Studying is connected a priori to socio-technical innovation logics – primary de-acceleration tendencies of action patterns are tested. Instead, the “society of creation” implements these logics more fundamentally – it already inherits expectations of arriving [,] and leads dialogues around this design. As for now the current generation in charge of decisions has only used a linear sense of time – the younger generation is present-oriented and adaptive []. In first instance this seems less constructive and future oriented, though it perforates the linearity of the pure goal orientation through the immanent present oriented sense of time (ibid.). To use both competencies and abilities to design a sustainable future oriented society will be the challenge for next years and decades. A change of interpretation and then action patterns within complex societies is a multi-level governance approach; it can only be reached by simultaneous initiation on various levels and actor groups. These processes need time in order to be developed and tested, such as the intelligent resiliency management does. Incremental innovations can show long-range effects; sustainable means in this case also to be developed continuously for coming generations. Biodiversity, land/soil protection, soil, air and water quality are seen as foundation of our , which again are particularly important for our economy and well-being. Quantity of land is obviously limited, but should stay usable for the next generation. is highly relevant for eco-systemic stabilities, such as resiliency, and is therefore a key player for societal development and maintenance. Limited resources hence need to be used in a way, that allows regarding limits of nature [-]. “Sustainability (or Future-ability) has three core dimensions: One economical, one social and one ecological. The ecological dimension sets guardrails for economic and social development, because of the limited availability of natural resources and because the vital capacities of the eco-sphere, which can be reduced or destroyed by human actions, but not restored”. (Own translation of: Schmidt-Bleek []. In order to secure the eco-sphere, resource input, necessary for the functioning of PSS and co-siding infrastructures, has to be lowered. So far the need for more natural resources is constantly growing – in 2030 a redoubling is expected (Bringezu et al. []. Lettenmeier et al. [] describes necessary changes for households (resource consumption per person per year), as well as the fields of demand in finish households. Starting with a material footprint of 40 t per person per year and aiming at 8t until 2015, a reduction-factor of 5 is needed. How each person designs and create her or his own living space remains an individual decision. In order to stay within a sustainable management of the living and environmental space, a resource consumption of a maximum of 8 tons per person per year is necessary []. In order to understand the dimensions for the sociotechnical changes, () is used as an example. The creation of one’s environmental space and the co-creation of PSS is an individual matter. () depicts single activity fields for individuals. Living space decreases to an average of 20 m2 and the use of electricity, as well as heating is reduced by a factor of 6.8. In total Lettenmeier et al [] proposes a reduction of the material footprint for housing from 10.8 to 1.6 tons per person per year. The material footprint for housing can be reduced from 10.8 to 1.6 tons/(person.a): By developing zero-energy houses not exceeding present houses material intensity (i.e., strongly combining energy and resource efficiency); By drastically shifting electricity production from fossils to renewables, especially wind and solar energy; and By decreasing individual living space. The impacts of the latter on the individual wellbeing can be reduced by increasing shared living space and improving public space more liveable and attractive. Sustainable material footprint proposal for housing. Development of e.g. zero-energy houses can only be achieved by an autonomous decision of the individual to engage in the thought of resource reduction and consumption. This is necessary for the resiliency of the system. Only technical or only social innovations are not sufficient to start a change in the system, while maintaining the same or similar strandards of living and the quality of life. Innovative socio-technical strategies for solutions and testing are needed, which help to achieve incrementalism towards intelligent PSS. This means, that e.g. our mobility system must change fundamentally. Engine technology, traffic systems and consumer behaviour will lead to a radical increase in resource efficiency. The Schmidt-Bleek [] works with clear limitations considering resource consumption and requires a co-existence of economy and eco-sphere, as well as an integration of all action and management strategies in the multi-level system, especially in the field of production. Action patterns and routines in the field of consumption and production need to be explored and implemented to achieve a societal transformation towards sustainability. PSS are drivers of and also driven by societal and economical development. They build the ‘’ or basis (PSS themselves) of resource consumption and work together with the systemic and surrounding infrastructure (e.g. mobility, logistics, communication), resulting in a mutual enhancement of energy- and resource consumption. Structures create structures and become embedded in everyday practices. A change can only start in the system itself. Social innovation can help a resilient transformation, by e.g. changing products to become more userfriendly and needs oriented. Solutions, instead of products need to be sold. displays the actor as central for any action (for the following description compare Liedtke et al. [,] Welfens et al. []. Surrounding him, we find the PSS. These again are sided by markets, which are involved in sales, quality and infrastructure, and by political and cultural frames – all of which can be designed by actors and manifested in structures. Innovations, such as e-cars or passive-houses influence the consumption behaviour and the political framework, but also used technologies. These sides are intertwined, influencing each other mutually. Political frameworks include education, financial benefits and more, while cultural frameworks include values, identity and lifestyles, which are differentiated and have an impact on the choice of product. These levels are part of the meta-level, in which demography, and climate change are placed. Sustainable production and consumption – A complex system. Besides the individual consumer, ‘drivers’ on organisational level can steer production and consumption in different directions (). This actor-centred view introduces change agents, individuals and institutions with greater capacities to initiate sustainable transformations, into the field of production and consumption. Every individual has potential to change – businesses actively decide in which cases to support greener solutions, the consumer decides whether to buy regional and seasonal product or not. Besides that, external drivers, such as costs and policies such as costs and policies for internal und external driving forces and improt and export, are playing a further key factor for transformation. Open explorative scenarios [] support an exchange of knowledge between businesses, to reduce market failures of products. These are positive drivers, and as drivers are mostly created by humans and can usually be changed, a transfer from negative to positive driving forces is possible. The actor-implemented change of the system can be accomplished by remodelling single processes and chains of production, and further by reshaping whole value chain systems. Step-by-step optimization including the whole cycle from the grave - life cycle wide is generated. The circle includes extraction, processing, using the product and its recycling or waste management. A whole resource management system is approached, which generates low resource PSS, supporting sustainable lifestyles (). The resource management integrates three areas () []. • Material flow management, which optimizes used raw materials, infrastructures and their inputs – this concerns each process, circuitry in production, transports, , production places and locations. • Product design, the choice of material and all aspects of design, such as, longevity, recycling capacities and modular construction. • Product management, which concerns every step from the kind of usage to the development of business models – their reconstruction, new design and redesign. Sustainability strategies are incorporated in each management area of value added systems, including efficiency, sufficiency and consistency strategies, in order to develop resilient PSS. Theses strategies target production and consumption on the same level [,]. Undirected changes, which “just appear”, like globalisation and changes through new technologies, only create reactive practices, as one simply adapts to the situation. The individual feels incapable of actively participating and take themselves out of the system, back to their subsystems – family, friends, job, back into areas where they can overview and control the situation. The strategy also reduces time put in the system, which is perceived as not to change anyway. In order to achieve a substantial change, this practice is fatal, as transition needs to be pushed by actors themselves. Besides the Stockholm Resilience Centre [] and other research institutions, dialogues on political level, such as the Expert Dialogue with the German Federal Chancellor (2012), start to discuss adaptive governance strategies and how to connect them to current scientific research, needed in social and economic spheres. Further projects and labels for quality, e.g. the Social Design Award (this year connected to projects which work with irregular migrants, ), link sustainability also to other current discourses. This transdisciplinarity includes a polycentric and multilevel approach of transformation, which possesses great capacities to link various actor together, especially through participation and collaborations. Geels [] argues, that deep social structures need to be transformed to lead to socio-technical transitions. This can include the turn to sustainable energy or a turn in mobility structures. A collective value needs to be formed, such as a common sense of low resource mobility and how to implement it. Today there is a vast individual freedom and never were there more opportunities for education and individual or social well-being. Human capacities to overcome spontaneous everyday-life struggles are well known, may it be when there is another strike of public transportation, or on the airport, we can find complex changes and can manage them sufficiently and efficiently. Design competencies are multiple, resulting in the challenges to enable others and one to overcome environmental challenges over the next years and decades. Interpretations of ones incapability and surrendering to top-down implementations ignore the system-efficacy of the self on micro-level. Capability needs to be experienced, also through psychological processes (competence, relatedness, security, identity, distinction/popularity, stimulation [,]. Innovation structures for PSS like Living, especially Sustainabiltiy Labs [,,,] () and further innovative projects can be used to support the mentioned competencies, which can be found on personal (the self), social and professional level. They work with trustworthiness and a certain toleration for failures, connected to abilities and mediation, organising and coaching skills. A social will for cooperation and engagement should exist besides professional qualifications, to lead complex change processes. When participating in the above mentioned projects, which underline the relevance of the consumer as a driving force in the system, active research is combined with direct implementation and testing of innovative products, which might affect everyday consumption and living [,]. Resource Culture – Design of a Low Resource Society “Culture, understood as source and hotbed of immaterial resources is hence a necessary requirement for innovations in field of resource efficiency in enterprises” []. The social practices materialise themselves in the change of structures, which are e.g. connected to Car Sharing Systems or funded programmes for research and development in product design. The design can e.g. [,] deliver new charming ways to change decision and behaviour. () displays the “weight” of a normal meal, one vegetarian, and one with beef. Some design innovations already try to include the information of e.g. a material footprint into new forms of production. One idea could be to display this information in a cafeteria of universities, in order to catch attention – trying to trigger a thought or at least an informed decision, what to eat. New and transformed action patterns and routines develop through those mechanisms and lead to cultures in which behaviour is aiming for need satisfaction in a room of limited environment. This specific resource culture becomes fundament of a future-oriented transition management, which includes people instead of excluding them through technology. An integrative sustainability management can only be created through this transformation. It has to be positive, creative and enable competence development. Starting points are informal rooms for exploration and formal education systems [-,]. Visualization of the material footprint of different meals. Complex systems do not necessarily have to be non-transparent or incapacitating, but can be inspiring and exciting. Nevertheless we can find various time regimes, which are not easy to combine, an issue which has been neglected too often. Geological and biological time regimes are completely underlying different grades of development speed than human’s or societal. This is particularly interesting for a future-oriented research culture – the eco-systemic time regime will outlive time frames of human kind. Rhythm and speed in societies, but also rituals and mutual time, are reasons for the system’s stability and development. If it is too fast or inconsistent, a coherent and resilient development will fail, as all subsystems will loose their contact. The society gets unstable, if time and interpretation patterns are not based on common grounds – conflicts and the disconnection of necessary transition processes arise besides greater burdening the environmental area. Change can also be exhausting, because inventions have to be discussed including all steps that need to be accounted for (). Mapping and modulating of different social and environmental levels. Global megatrends, such as climate change, change or resource scarcity play an important role for the development of transition pathways and future scenarios. The “8-ton (per capita and year-)society” [] as future goal has been debated on social, economic and ecological levels, resulting in strategies, including multi-level plans, which integrate socio-technological and socio-economic systems, connecting them to each actor group. Overall reflections on the eight key intervention areas can be concluded in a more specific guidance for further management tasks throughout the entire multilevel governance perspective in order to empower, enable and frame the potential of ‘sustainability change actors’ []. • Develop local, regional, national, European and international qualitative and quantitative scenarios for futures on all levels of the governance system • Adapted deduction of priority measures, connected actions and lighthouse projects, as well as an introduction of interactive governance structures, including fitting structures of communication (strategies) • Comprehensibly integrated and overarching mapping of ecosystemic services, as well as their description and their interactions (input orientation) (see also Resource Commission 2014) • Description of cross points with socio-technical systems and material flows, like material management and timely capabilities of regeneration and issues around eco-systemic functions • Reflection of European and national discussions around solutions in areas of sustainable lifestyles and resource efficiency strategies • Orientation towards indicators of input and their interfaces for a precautious management and system and future-oriented evaluation in a multi-level-system along the development of scenarios (see item 1) and development of data collection • Starting dialogue with social and technical change agents in economic areas and value chains • Integration of system actors as experts on their system in research and development, but also in implementation and diffusion • Orientation on PSS as core of a change towards sustainability and climate change • Mapping of representative social practices, which inherit potentials of transformation (positive rebound effects), as well as surrounding PSS – Mapping of technical and social innovation potentials for sustainability • Design and development of a research and development LivingLab infrastructure on local, regional, national, European and international level as‚ Nuclei’ of transition-management-processes • Exploration of climate change efficient and low resource potentials of a society aiming towards resource conservation • Development of learning and explorations fields, competency development (see LivingLab infrastructure - ) • Development and testing of sustainable PSS in LivingLabs connected and integrated into quarters of cities – Implementation and development of competency in everyday life, transformation of life and economy • Mutual development of cultural identities towards sustainability and conservation • Development of an interactive culture of communication to support a mutual resource culture – active use of social media for development of niche activities in order to learn new cultures of identity. The above described and designed system management needs transparent and open information and management structures, which are able to adapt flexibly to actors’ needs. Structures of governance and government can support such innovative forms of sustainablility management actively. Further expolrations and real-life laboratories (see LivingLabs) on all actor levels are a necessity for further strengthening of societal tranformations.

This guidebook discusses the application of the framework through the following steps: Step 1 â Understanding sustainability, Step 2 â Developing transportation sustainability goals, Step 3 â Developing objectives, Step 4 â Developing performance measures, Step 5 â Implementing performance measures, and Step 6 â Refining the framework and applying feedback. Chapters 6 and 7 of this guide introduce the compendium of objectives and performance measures and a sustainability checklistâresources for further applying and reviewing the SPM framework. STEP 1 â UNDERSTANDING SUSTAINABILITY Understanding what sustainability means is the first step in being able to apply the framework for sustainability. This framework defines a set of general, inclusive principles of sustainability that become the foundation for all subsequent decisions (Figure 1). The four sustainability principles are 1. Preserving and enhancing environmental and ecological systems, 2. Fostering community health and vitality, Successful implementation of the sustainability performance measurement framework requires an agency to consider the overall context in terms of the type and scale of performance measurement application. Using the Sustainability Performance Measurement Framework 17 3. Promoting economic development and prosperity, and 4. Ensuring equity between and among population groups and over generations. Developing a Definition of Sustainability Sometimes a definition or statement on sustainability is taken as the starting point for an agency to apply sustainability through goals and performance measures. While defining sustainability is a valuable exercise, it does not form the basis for the application of this guidebookâs SPM framework, which is instead rooted in the sustainability principles. Consider defining sustainability as a supporting component in this framework. See Appendix A for more guidance on how to define sustainability for your agency. STEP 2 â DEVELOPING TRANSPORTATION SUSTAINABILITY GOALS To address and promote the four sustainability principles, 11 key goals have been defined for transportation agencies (Table 1). While the principles are general and are not transportation specific, these goals: â¢ Can relate the principles of sustainability to the transportation sector; â¢ Can be adapted, expanded, or customized, and can help your agency align its programs with sustainability principles; â¢ Can be revised to better align with your agencyâs current or existing goals or your agencyâs particular mission; and â¢ Can frame your collaborative work with other agencies (transportation and non- transportation related). By focusing on common goals, you and your agency partners decide how to leverage each otherâs work through joint projects and shared expertise. Explore how to share resources and potentially save money by matching funds or collaborating on common activities. Defining Sustainability Goals First, define your sustainability goals. The four fundamental sustainability principles provide guidance. A set of goals that cover these principles ensures that you have considered all aspects of sustainability. This framework and the compendium can be easily used in focused areas (e.g., the environmental aspect) if your agency chooses. Incorporating all the principles helps agencies fully understand the impacts and benefits of sustainability. The process that you take for defining and/or confirming your agencyâs sustainability goals will depend on whether your agency has established and adopted goals or is in the process of defining, redefining, or adopting a set of goals. Working with Established Goals Next, line your agency goals up with the four sustainability principles. You may find that all goals are relevant to one or more principles, or it may be that some are not relevant to any of the 18 A Guidebook for Sustainability Performance Measurement for Transportation Agencies principles. To assess if you need to add or revise your goals, determine if your agency addresses all of the principles within its current goals. Once you have organized your goals by principle, use this organization to relate them to the example goals in Table 1. There is no requirement that the example goals match yours, but linking them will help identify where additional goals could help round out your sustainability program. These goals will be directly supported by your measures, so it is critical that you select goals that reflect your agencyâs overall mission and relationship to sustainability in order to build a solid framework. Defining New Goals The 11 goals in the framework can serve as guidance as your agency selects and refines a set of sustainability goals. They can be edited and revised to any extent that creates a version that best fits your agency. You can also review the goals that other agencies have developed to get ideas; some agencies have chosen to use an even broader set of goal categories (e.g., public health, location efficiency) than are covered by the 11 goals in this framework. If you are in the process of identifying goals through a long-range transportation plan or other agency-wide document, these goals may become part of a larger set. They can also stand on their own as a set of sustainability goals. Case Study Summary: New York State Department of Transportation The New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT), as part of the development of their GreenLITES sustainability effort, uses a set of six principles (similar to the goals as defined in this framework) to organize the context of sustainability: 1. Protect and enhance the environment; 2. Conserve energy and natural resources; 3. Preserve or enhance the historic, scenic, and aesthetic project setting characteristics; 4. Encourage public involvement in the transportation planning process; 5. Integrate smart growth and other sound land-use practices; and 6. Encourage new and innovative approaches to sustainable design and how facilities are operated and maintained. Using the Sustainability Performance Measurement Framework 19 Table 1. Recommended transportation sustainability goals. Sustainability Goal Definition 1. Safety Provide a safe transportation system for users and the general public. 2. Basic accessibility Provide a transportation system that offers accessibility that allows people to fulfill at least their basic needs. 3. Equity/equal mobility Provide options that allow affordable and equitable transportation opportunities for all sections of society. 4. System efficiency Ensure that the transportation systemâs functionality and efficiency are maintained and enhanced. 5. Security Ensure that the transportation system is secure from, ready for, and resilient to threats from all hazards. 6. Prosperity Ensure that the transportation systemâs development and operation support economic development and prosperity. 7. Economic viability Ensure the economic feasibility of transportation investments over time. 8. Ecosystems Protect and enhance environmental and ecological systems while developing and operating transportation systems. 9. Waste generation Reduce waste generated by transportation-related activities. 10. Resource consumption Reduce the use of nonrenewable resources and promote the use of renewable replacements. 11. Emissions and air quality Reduce transportation-related emissions of air pollutants and greenhouse gases. 20 A Guidebook for Sustainability Performance Measurement for Transportation Agencies Mapping Goals to Sustainability Principles The sample goals in Table 1 reflect general sustainability principles as they apply to the transportation sector. All of your goals that form part of the final agency goal set should relate to at least one principle of sustainability. Often, a goal will support more than one principle. Yet no one goal in itself is sufficient to achieve sustainabilityâit takes multiple goals, pursued in concert, to promote sustainability. When a final set of goals is defined, itâs important to cross- check the package of goals to ensure that all of the principles are well addressed. In doing so, take care not to force-fit the goals to make them map to the principles. A balanced goal set, however, achieves comprehensive coverage of the basic principles of sustainability. Addressing Equity Equity takes special consideration; as discussed in Chapter 2 and illustrated in Figure 1, it is an overarching consideration for the principles of sustainability. Even if a goal successfully supports one or more of the first three sustainability principles (environmental, community health and vitality, economic prosperity), it could still have a negative impact on equity. For example, the economic and environmental benefits of a program could be distributed inequitably across wealthier and lower-income communities or have a negative effect on certain areas. In approaches that are not sustainable, these equity impacts are sometimes neglected for economic and environmental gain. To avoid this pitfall, each goal should be examined in terms of potential equity and distributional impacts. Your agency may already address these issues in terms of environmental justice requirements. This assessment should examine these factors of Case Study Summary: Oregon Department of Transportation The Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) has created a sustainability plan that is organized around seven focus areas. These focus areas are similar to the goals developed for this project: 1. Health and safety, 2. Social responsibility/workforce well-being and development, 3. Environmental stewardship, 4. Land use and infrastructure, 5. Energy/fuel use and climate change, 6. Material resource flows, and 7. Economic health. Within each of these seven focus areas, ODOT has developed goals, indicators, strategies, and actions. For more information, go to http://www.oregon.gov/ODOT/SUS/sustainability_plans.shtml#Sustainability_Plan__Volumes _I__II__III_. Using the Sustainability Performance Measurement Framework 21 equity, and they should be looked at in intragenerational (i.e., present-day) and intergenerational (i.e., future) contexts of â¢ Income, â¢ Age, â¢ Race and ethnicity, â¢ Disabled/handicapped populations, â¢ Gender, and â¢ Geography (spatial). STEP 3 â DEVELOPING OBJECTIVES These objectives provide specific actions to meet each of your agencyâs established goals. Chapter 6 includes a compendium of objectives and performance measures. Table 2 shows how the objectives are organized into focus areas. The focus areas represent generic transportation agency functions that cover the range of activities associated with their core business. While these focus areas may not completely align with the structure of your organization, they will help point you toward activities that are similar to those in your organization. If your agency has used the 11 goals in the framework as guidelines, many of the objectives listed in the compendium may be relevant or a good place to start. If your goals are quite different from those in the framework, the objectives in the compendium may provide examples of tone and level of specificity. Using these focus areas, consider how your goals affect all agency activities and how objectives and measures may vary in the context of different agency activities. For example, many of the measures and objectives can be used in the context of both construction and maintenance. By thinking these things through, you may find it efficient to use one measure in multiple focus areas. The objectives you set may be different for different stages of your agencyâs work or for different units of your organization. For example, the objectives for the planning process differ from those for construction. 22 A Guidebook for Sustainability Performance Measurement for Transportation Agencies Table 2. Transportation focus areas for objectives and performance measures. Focus Area Objective/Performance Measure 1. Planning Planning activities include the development of long-range plans, strategies, and frameworks intended to improve one or more functional areas of the transportation system (or the entire system). Documentation resulting from planning activities may highlight a general or categorical set of problems, outline a general program of projects or activities calculated to effect change over time, and provide an estimate of the resources required; it rarely will delve into specific project parameters. Examples may include regional transportation plans, master plans, strategic highway safety plans, and long-range thematic studies or plans. Transportation planning has strong links to land- use planning and comprehensive planning, which could be taken into consideration where possible. 2. Programming Programming is the process of determining which set of projects will be funded and the timing of that investment. These decisions are based on the policies, strategies, and other plans identified in the planning focus area. Funding availability must be considered for this process, and it may include a project prioritization tool and often requires broad input from throughout an agency and its partners. Example outcomes may include transportation improvement programs and unified planning work programs. 3. Project development Project development involves defining the specific attributes of the projects selected during the programming area, including alternatives analysis, engineering, design, specifications, environmental and regulatory analysis, and required mitigation. Example outcomes may include alternatives analysis, environmental impact assessments, and project designs. 4. Construction Construction involves building new transportation facilities, the addition or removal of ramps or flyovers, the addition or removal of lanes, and the addition or demolition of bridges, tunnels, or other integrated infrastructure. 5. Maintenance Maintenance activities are broad ranging and include routine and preventive maintenance. Significant maintenance and improvement activities such as paving/repaving and major infrastructure improvements such as re-decking are also included. 6. System operations Operations include all active or passive nonconstruction activities or systems dedicated to sustaining or improving the functionality of the transportation network. System operations include network monitoring, signalization and signage, traffic/driver information systems, tolling and managed lanes, speed control and enforcement, parking management, turning and merging permissions and restrictions, incident management, public transportation routing and management, and the management of integrated transportation and non-transportation infrastructure. STEP 4 â DEVELOPING PERFORMANCE MEASURES Your performance measures serve to assess your agencyâs progress toward each objective and provide the ongoing data to help your agency further improve performance. The measures should directly support the objectives, and building them out from your selected objectives is essential. However, your agency will have a greater chance of successful implementation if you build on the measures that you are currently tracking and using. In general, the performance measures can be classified as outcome, output, and process measures, as defined in the following. â¢ Outcome measures provide information on the achievement of broad goals such as transportation sustainability goals. These measure the result or impact of a program, policy, infrastructure decision, and so forth. Using the Sustainability Performance Measurement Framework 23 â¢ Output me asures re late to re su lts or change s i n t er ms of th e t ra nsportatio n s yste m a nd its functioning. Th es e m easur e a p roduc t o r c oncrete it em that re su lts fr om a p ro cess action. â¢ Process measures relate to inputs or products related to a transportation agencyâs activities. These measure components of an agency practice that are deemed to support the related goal or objective. Table 3 shows examples of outcome, output, and process measures that support the same sustainability goal. Table 3. Example of outcome, output, and process measures. Goal: Reduce waste generated by transportation-related activity Measure Example Outcome Change in the amount of waste generated by type, weight, or volume Output Change in the percentage of operational activities with a recycling plan or waste diversion goal Process An asset management system exists While it might be easier for your agency to track process measures (since they relate most directly to actions taken by your agency), it is important to include output and outcome measures in order to truly address the goals of sustainability in terms of the transportation system performance and community level impacts. In ventor y E xisting Measures 1. Gather a lis t o f a ll perfo rm ance measures cu rre ntly in use acr os s t he agency (inc lude data sources , m ethod of tracking, fre quenc y o f r ep or tin g, etc. ). 2. Ma tc h t hese measures with your established objectives (a nd by pr oxy, goals). Case Study Summary: Florida Department of Transportation Florida DOT has not officially created a sustainability plan, but the concept and principles are interwoven throughout many agency and partner agency activities. Performance measures play a significant role in all of these programs and documents. The departmentâs overarching approach to sustainability is embodied within the Florida Transportation Plan, the Strategic Intermodal System, mandates on the MPOs, recent regional visioning exercises, the agencyâs Efficient Transportation Decision Making process, and a 2007 executive order calling for the creation of a Florida Governmental Carbon Scorecard to track and report the reduction of greenhouse gases. 3.

T hey can also be in adequate to suppor t t he applicatio n( s) 24 A Guidebook for Sustainability Performance Measurement for Transportation Agencies that your agency has chosen as the purpose of your sustainable performance measurement program. Depending on your agency resources, this may be as far as you get. But when/if you are ready to select additional measures, the following should build on the areas that are lacking (as described previously). Select Additional Measures The measures listed in the compendium (Chapter 6) can provide examples your agency may want to consider. The selection and implementation of measures can be an additive process. Your agency may have a higher rate of success if only a few measures are added at a time. While there is no ideal number of performance measures, the total number of performance measures your agency selects should be kept to a manageable level. The following is a list of things to consider when selecting measures: 1. How will you calculate the measure? 2. What data are needed? What other measures can benefit from the data? 3. Where will you get the data? (Note: It is best to begin with data your agency has on hand or can access without further collection activities. Once the process of using data to calculate measures is underway, your agency can begin to consider additional data sources and collection.) 4. How many departments/agencies will benefit from the use of the measure? 5. Who will be in charge of tracking and reporting the data? STEP 5 â IMPLEMENTING PERFORMANCE MEASURES Application of Performance Measures The real value of performance measures comes when they are integrated and implemented to support the daily activities of your agency. Applications of performance measures include â¢ Description â Understand aspects of agency business or actions in terms of current status and trends. Determine at what level its programs, facilities, and services are performing through measures of relevance. â¢ Evaluation â Introduce a value judgment with respect to current performance and trends. Involve the use of targets, benchmarks, or trends. Help agencies identify what is wrong, the causes of a particular problem, and how it can be remedied. â¢ Accountability â Identify performance for which an agency or unit is responsible, specifically poor performance in a key area that needs to be improved. Identify agency units that need to improve to meet performance target levels. â¢ Decision support â Help evaluate, compare, prioritize, and select among alternatives and options in terms of sustainability considerations. Determine whether to proceed with a proposed action or to select among alternatives. Using the Sustainability Performance Measurement Framework 25 â¢ Communication â Communicate to internal and external stakeholders through indices, numbers, tables, graphs, scorecards, and other display tools such as dashboards. Most frequently used methods show conditions, comparisons, trends, and adherence to targets, goals, and objectives. As shown in Figure 3, these applications of performance measures are interrelated. Some applications derive logically from one another. (For example, evaluation can be viewed as an extension of description; similarly, accountability or decision support follows logically from an evaluation exercise.) Communication, on the other hand, is more an overarching application that is implied in the use of other applications, but is also an application in itself. Figure 3. Relationship between application types. Your agencyâs purpose for use of the measures should be a consideration in previous steps of the framework application. However, it is at this step that the logistics of how your agency will collect and report the data are determined and then put into practice. 26 A Guidebook for Sustainability Performance Measurement for Transportation Agencies Steps to Successful Implementation Your implementation process depends on the applications that your agency picks. The following steps provide the groundwork for successful implementation and integration. Depending on the number of measures, who is involved, and the application outcomes, these steps can be done per measure, per focus area, or per goal. 1. Determine appropriate scale (e.g., by department, agency). 2. Determine appropriate applications (if more than one) for each measure, goal, or focus area. 3. Establish a reporting system and schedule with roles and responsibility for data collection, analysis, and reporting. Will this be included in an existing annual reporting process, or will your agency establish a new sustainability dashboard of some kind? 4. Your agency can set benchmarks and targets at the level of goals, objectives, or measures. However, in the SPM framework, these benchmarks and targets need to be tracked at the level of performance measures. For example, if an agency sets a target of zero waste, this would need to be tracked for a set of measures that relate to the individual waste-generating activities. Using the Sustainability Performance Measurement Framework 27 STEP 6 â REFINING THE FRAMEWORK AND APPLYING FEEDBACK Applying the framework described in this chapter is not a linear, one-off process. Instead, it requires constant feedback and refinements to ensure that progress toward sustainability is achieved. Chapter 7 provides a sustainability checklist for reviewing the framework, which can help your agency consider whether the goals, objectives, and measures identified comprehensively address the principles of sustainability. Other parameters relating to the design and implementation of the framework can also be evaluated to provide feedback that can be applied to refine the framework. Case Study Summary: Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning The staff at the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning (CMAP) is very aware that all aspects of its work involve sustainability. In fact, the work of defining sustainability performance measures not only involved every division of the agency, but went beyond the subject areas that CMAP traditionally engages in. Because sustainability involves not sacrificing in the present the needs of future generations, the core work toward sustainability occurs in CMAPâs planning and programming division through long-range comprehensive planning efforts. CMAP has an extensive sustainability performance measurement program. For example, measures are a central element as CMAP considers major transportation projects for inclusion in its long-range transportation plan (GO TO 2040). CMAP is using a subset of 23 indicators to evaluate each projectâs sustainability. The measures are organized into the following 11 categories, with each category having between one and four measures associated with it: 1. Long-term economic development, 2. Congestion, 3. Work trip commute time, 4. Mode share, 5. Job-housing access, 6. Air quality, 7. Energy use, 8. Natural resource preservation, 9. Infill and reinvestment, 10. Peak period utilization, and 11. Facility condition (highways only). For this analysis, each measure is reported individually. The performance measures are not weighted, and the results are not converted into any type of overall score. The results of each project evaluation are presented to the sponsors and will be used to prioritize the list of projects for inclusion in the GO TO 2040 plan.

Large catastrophic events, or rare acute events, may cause situations in which a local jurisdiction’s medicines and medical supplies are not sufficient to provide care to the population it serves. In these cases of natural or engineered disasters, such as a terrorist attack, influenza pandemic, or earthquake, state or local authorities can request that the federal government provide assets from the Strategic National Stockpile to augment the state and local jurisdictions’ resources. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC’s) Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) is the nation’s repository of antibiotics, chemical antidotes, antitoxins, vaccines, antiviral drugs, and other medical materiel designed to supplement and resupply state and local public health agencies in the event of an emergency. The materiel is intended to support national health security and is managed by the Office of Public Health Preparedness and Response’s (OPHPR’s) Division of Strategic National Stockpile (DSNS). The stated mission of the SNS is to prepare and support partners and provide the right resources at the right time to secure the nation’s health. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine organized a two-day public workshop to explore opportunities to improve the efficiency, effectiveness, and sustainable methods used by the CDC’s SNS to distribute medical countermeasures and other supplies during disasters and other public health emergencies, especially those which result in disruption of physical infrastructure such as the electrical grid, central roadways, bridges, and tunnels within the impacted community. Participants explored relevant distribution lessons learned from other federal agency stockpiles and the private sector as well as opportunities to develop public-private collaborations in the purchase, warehousing, management, and distribution of medical countermeasures. This report summarizes the presentations and discussions from the workshop. 2 The Strategic National Stockpile: Origin, Policy Foundations, and Federal Context 3 Studies and Reports Related to the Strategic National Stockpile 4 Potential Opportunities for Restructuring Strategic National Stockpile Scope, Governance, and Decision Making 5 Reaching the Last Mile: Potential Opportunities to Improve Coordination and Communication Among Local, State, and Federal Agencies 6 Potential Supply-Chain Opportunities and Lessons from the Commercial Sector and Government Partners You're looking at OpenBook, NAP.edu's online reading room since 1999.

Because it is UNCORRECTED material, please consider the following text as a useful but insufficient proxy for the authoritative book pages. Case Studies and Rating System Summaries F-1 Appendix F Case Studies and Rating System Summaries CASE STUDIES Each of the case studies included in this document provides the following information, organized into sections: â¢ Details about the interview contacts and any background documents reviewed for compilation of the case studies, â¢ The agencyâs adopted definition of sustainability or a discussion of the lack of definition, â¢ Specific agency programs and practices that incorporate sustainability principles, â¢ The impetus or history behind the agencyâs incorporation of sustainability principles, â¢ Actual sustainability performance measures in use and discussion of the development of those measures, â¢ A description of how the performance measures are tracked, â¢ How the measures have been applied to decision making, â¢ Lessons learned by the agency as a result of development and/or adoption of sustainability performance measures, and â¢ The future outlook of sustainability performance measures at the agency. F-2 A Guidebook for Sustainability Performance Measurement for Transportation Agencies California Department of Transportation A set of recent state bills have required Californiaâs agencies to consider topics correlated with sustainability. Much of Caltransâ sustainability work responds to this legislation, which includes Assembly Bill 32: Global Warming Solutions Act (the primary goal of which is to reach 1990 greenhouse gas emissions levels by 2020 and 80% of 1990 levels by 2050); State Bill 375, which furthers the greenhouse gas related activities proposed in AB 32; and State Bill 391, which requires Caltrans to prepare a state plan to address how the state will meet its GHG reduction targets. In 1998 (updated 2004), Caltrans published the Transportation System Performance Measures Report, which outlined how to develop performance measures and identified mode-neutral candidates for measures. The measures used throughout Caltransâ programs are guided by this report. Caltrans has a number of programs and efforts that incorporate sustainability principles and measures, including â¢ California Transportation Plan (CTP). CTP updates have, since 2006, included the â3Esâ (equity, environment, and economy), which inform the goals and policies that direct all programs and projects. Although none of the related performance measures were specifically identified to address sustainability, many of them are related. The next CTP update will focus on GHGs and climate change and will have a context-sensitive solutions orientation. The Smart Mobility Framework, a recent effort to add action and implementation to the policies in the CTP, recommends 17 performance measures for use in project evaluations. â¢ Regional Blueprints. The Caltrans Regional Blueprints are voluntary planning processes that engage residents of a region in creating a vision of the regionâs future. Applicants are required to provide information on how they plan to measure success in the short-term and how they will measure the long-term impacts of the process toward meeting blueprint goals. There are no specific guidelines for this measurement, and it is up to the agencies to determine what they will measure and how. â¢ California Progress Report. In 2007, information gathered from the Regional Blueprints was used to compile the California Progress Report, a snapshot of regional conditions and progress across the state. A set of indicators was selected by an advisory team, which reviewed the blueprints to determine what was being measured at the regional level. The 2010 Progress Report update will feature 15 indicators, distributed among up to 10 potential issue areas: greenhouse gas emissions, air quality, energy use, water use and quality, health, transportation, economy, natural resources/productive farmland/open space, housing, and land use. The indicators will be selected to provide a good cross section of data and answer the question: âAre our regions becoming more sustainable?â The intent is that this will also serve as the overarching sustainability framework for the Strategic Growth Council and help to align state programs to better achieve progress. Caltrans has two units set up to track performance. The Office of Strategic Planning and Performance Measures is responsible for measures that Caltrans can control through programs and policies. The Transportation System Information group sources data from other divisions and then categorizes the data into a set of system indicators. Case Studies and Rating System Summaries F-3 Colorado Department of Transportation CDOT does not currently have an official definition of sustainability, although the agencyâs overall approach to sustainability is along the lines of the United Nations Brundtland Commission definition. CDOT has also adopted an âenvironmental ethic,â defined as a responsibility to âsupport and enhance efforts to protect the environment and quality of life for all of Coloradoâs citizens in the pursuit of providing the best transportation systems and services possibleâ (CDOT, 2011). CDOT addresses sustainability through four primary structures or processes: â¢ Environmental Stewardship Guide. This guide documents how social, economic, environmental, and engineering considerations are to be integrated into transportation decision making. The current (2005) version has expanded beyond NEPA processes to discuss community impacts and livability. â¢ Transportation Environmental Resource Council sustainability subcommittee. TERC is composed of representatives of transportation agencies and resource agencies from throughout the state. The sustainability subcommittee encourages sharing between agencies working on sustainability, with a focus on sharing best practices, creating a sustainability template, creating a potential coordinated certification system, creating a sustainability policy that can be adopted by all members, and developing performance measures, including a potential statewide baseline. â¢ CDOT Greening Council â greening government initiative. A 2007 executive order by Coloradoâs governor directed state agencies to reach a set of goals (including reduced energy use and petroleum consumption) by June 2012. Transportation was one of the focus areas, and CDOT is implementing this initiative through the CDOT Greening Council. The aim of the council is to share expertise at a statewide level, among CDOTâs regions. â¢ I-70 Corridor â sustainability applications. The I-70 Corridor Context Sensitive Solutions process included identifying a means for evaluating the sustainability of construction activities and a pilot application of NYSDOTâs GreenLITES effort. However, the primary acknowledgement of the I-70 sustainability effort is that the larger issues of sustainability are outside the control of the state DOT and need to be led and addressed by the local governments. Currently, performance measures are not being used for sustainability, although there are existing economic and functional performance measures, which could be expanded to encompass sustainability. Future applications envisioned for a program of sustainability performance measures include funding, resource allocation, and the development of standards and specifications. F-4 A Guidebook for Sustainability Performance Measurement for Transportation Agencies Florida Department of Transportation Florida has a long history with sustainability and environmental protection. Most recently, in 2007, then-Governor Crist issued Executive Orders establishing a climate action team, setting state emissions reduction targets, and prompting additional state actions on issues of energy climate change. The Florida Governmental Carbon Scorecard was established to track and report the reduction of GHGs, with each jurisdiction required to report its contribution to emissions. FDOT has responded to state initiatives by reiterating the role of transportation in enhancing the environment, communities, and economy, largely through the following initiatives: â¢ Florida Transportation Plan. FDOT is currently updating the FTP for the year 2060, which will result in goals, objectives, and strategies to address the long-term needs of the state transportation system. Sustainability is expected to be a focus area, with specific attention to issues of climate change and energy. The prior FTP (2025) focused on sustainable investments and also addressed sustainability with a specific objective related to conservation of the natural environment, nonrenewable resources and energy, and reduction in greenhouse gases and air pollutants. â¢ Strategic Intermodal System (SIS). The SIS Strategic Plan calls for the department to strengthen the linkage between transportation and land-use planning by working closely with statewide partners to develop and implement a complementary land use management strategy to preserve capacity and communities. â¢ Metropolitan planning. Florida MPOs are legislatively required to minimize GHG emissions as part of the planning process. MPOs also must consider strategies for integrating transportation and land use to provide for sustainable development and to reduce GHG emissions. In addition, energy considerations must be included in all state, regional, and local planning efforts. â¢ Regional visioning. FDOT has supported the development of long-term regional visioning processes throughout the state, including several visions that are well established and moving into implementation phases. Several regions are assessing impacts through the use of key measures of sustainability, including acres of land urbanized, water consumption, greenhouse gases and air pollutants, and vehicle miles travelled. â¢ Efficient Transportation Decision Making (ETDM). The ETDM process and screening tool creates linkages between land use, transportation, and environmental resource planning initiatives through early, interactive agency involvement and availability of data. FDOT has an established performance measurement framework. FDOT reports on performance within three categories: âhow we report on what we are accomplishing,â âhow we are being measured by others,â and âhow we measure ourselves on an ongoing basis.â Specific environmental performance metrics are reported regularly by the Office of Policy Planning in a publication series entitled Trends and Conditions: Environment, which includes general, statewide metrics as well as measures addressing the actual impact of DOT decisions or activities. Specific measures include acres of wetland directly affected by federal-aid roadway construction projects, number of parcels of right-of-way acquired annually, and estimated amount of recycled asphalt pavement used in construction annually. Case Studies and Rating System Summaries F-5 Minnesota Department of Transportation In 2006, Minnesota Executive Order 06-03 mandated the increased use of renewable fuels by state agencies, and in 2007 the Next Generation Energy Act required an 80% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Although MnDOT does not currently define sustainability, the agencyâs vision statement refers to a âsafe, efficient, and sustainable transportation system,â and the agency is moving in that direction. MnDOT has seen a noticeable shift in public opinion, with growing public support for transit and alternative modes. MnDOT considers sustainability as a factor in several key agency initiatives: â¢ The most recent state transportation plan is more focused on sustainability than earlier versions, though sustainability is not fully defined. The energy and environment policy areas look to improve the efficiency and sustainability of Minnesotaâs transportation system. The next iteration of the long-range plan is expected to be more explicit in discussing sustainability issues. â¢ MnDOT conducted an internal strategic planning effort that identified sustainability as a flagship focus area. â¢ MnDOTâs annual performance report has measures and indicators for the 10 policy areasâ with individual measures/indicators for pavement quality, mobility, transportation fuel consumption, and more. MnDOT defines performance measures as those that the agency has control over and that can be actively improved through agency decisions. Performance indicators, however, are considered reflective of how the transportation system is functioning, without regard to MnDOTâs role in managing the variables. Generally, performance measures/indicators are based on policies in statewide plans. Performance measures pertaining to sustainability include those under the energy and environment policy areaâincluding air pollution, clean fuels, and wetland preservation. CO2 emissions are listed as a developmental performance measure, meaning the measure has yet to be operationalized with specific data. Measures from other policy areas such as mobility, accessibility, and so forth also touch upon sustainability issues. Other MnDOT programs also use transportation and land use measures that are relevant to sustainability. Each of the measures has a specific office/division with a reporting responsibility assigned. In the future, performance measures may facilitate the comparison of transit and highway projects in terms of their sustainability impacts. F-6 A Guidebook for Sustainability Performance Measurement for Transportation Agencies New York State Department of Transportation While many of NYSDOTâs programs and practices have long incorporated some aspects of sustainability, the agency initiated the GreenLITES program to recognize and expand upon existing sustainability practices. The GreenLITES certification program was developed as a project-evaluation tool. The GreenLITES program was put in place in 2008 and has since been expanded to include an operations program and a voluntary local project certification program for federally funded projects. In recognition that issues such as GHG emissions and habitat connectivity need to be tackled at a higher level, a proposed expansion of GreenLITES to include planning metrics is currently being considered. As a part of the GreenLITES effort, NYSDOT defined transportation sustainability as a philosophy based on a set of six principles: protect and enhance the environment; conserve energy and natural resources; preserve or enhance the historic, scenic, and aesthetic project setting characteristics; encourage public involvement in the transportation planning process; integrate smart growth and other sound land-use practices; and encourage new and innovative approaches to sustainable design and how facilities are operated and maintained. Currently, however, efforts are under way to redefine sustainability to emphasize the ways in which transportation serves a sustainable society, rather than just considering sustainability in the context of transportation operations. As a rating system, GreenLITES is highly focused on metrics. Both the project design and operations programs have extensive metrics built into spreadsheet-based scorecards. The identification of measures was accomplished through a discussion-based process, in which measures were brainstormed and then refined by NYSDOT staff and stakeholders. A similar process was followed for assigning a weight to each metric. The proposed GreenLITES planning and program management scoring tool would contain metrics reflecting the eight federally required planning factors, along with other goals such as GHG reduction, smart growth, environmental stewardship, social equity, quality of life, and innovation. Tracking the GreenLITES project design metrics is mandatory for NYSDOT projects and voluntary for non-NYSDOT projects. Currently, however, the GreenLITES program only provides ratings and does not directly tie into funding allocations or decision making. Future GreenLITES applications might include project prioritization or the provision of comparative project results. Case Studies and Rating System Summaries F-7 Oregon Department of Transportation A few key state initiatives set the groundwork for sustainability at ODOT. In 2000, the Oregon Progress Board convened a comprehensive assessment of Oregonâs ecological health to help non- scientists understand the need for better environmental stewardship. This report forms the basis of Oregonâs and the Oregon Department of Transportationâs current sustainability efforts. Subsequently, the Oregon Sustainability Act of 2001 was passed, and Executive Orders 03-03 and 06-02 established a plan for sustainability leadership in each of 20 state agencies and an overall sustainability leadership team composed of high-level state leaders. To comply with Executive Order 03-03, ODOT issued its first formal sustainability plan in 2004. This plan integrated the stateâs sustainability goals with ODOT strategic goals, which are: (1) improve safety, (2) move people and goods efficiently, and (3) improve Oregonâs livability and economic prosperity. Based on the mandates and strategies set out in the sustainability plan, the Oregon Transportation Commission adopted a new Oregon Transportation Plan (OTP) in 2006 that emphasized sustainability. ODOTâs sustainability strategies are initiated and coordinated by the Sustainability Program, which also acts as a resource to staff members as they adopt new sustainability activities in their own work. The program is responsible for developing the sustainability plan and identifying strategies to implement it. In 2008, ODOT updated the sustainability plan, which remains the prevailing document. The plan addresses the vision, goals, and strategies included in the 2006 OTP. This plan establishes seven focus areas for ODOT efforts: energy/fuel use and climate change, material resource flows, environmental stewardship, land use and infrastructure, economic health, social responsibility/workforce well-being and development, and health and safety. Volume 2: Internal Operations, issued in 2010, addresses how ODOT staff and contractors will pursue sustainability within the agencyâs internal operations. It establishes specific performance measures for each of the sub-focus areas, although much of the data required are not currently collected. In the future, a supplemental installment of the ODOT sustainability plan will be prepared to address project-level sustainability plans. To develop these project-level plans, a team of ODOT managers has been tasked with investigating potential strategies for integrating sustainability into the agencyâs transportation projects. This committee is seeking a tool that can be used to provide project-level performance measures and is actively investigating the use of Greenroads for roadway design and construction. F-8 A Guidebook for Sustainability Performance Measurement for Transportation Agencies Washington State Department of Transportation Impetus for many recent sustainability initiatives at WSDOT came from a series of executive orders, including Executive Orders 02-03: Sustainable Practices by State Agencies, 04-01: Persistent Toxic Chemicals, 05-01: Establishing Sustainability and Efficiency Goals for State Operations, and 09-05: Washingtonâs Leadership on Climate Change. WSDOT is currently in the process of determining their definition of sustainability, which will bear close relation to the relevant executive orders and revised code of Washington, while at the same time maintaining the core mission of WSDOT. WSDOT has translated these executive orders and relevant legislation into 18 tasks, the most significant of which include adaptation issues, GHG strategies, VMT measurement, and VMT effectivenessâall of which have a designated technical advisory group. The agency considers itself to be well structured to carry out these tasks and to address sustainability. The executive level staffs of the Environmental Services, Public Transportation, and Strategic Planning groups jointly lead the effort, with support from the WSDOT Steering Committee. WSDOT prepared its first sustainability plan in 2007, which was updated in 2008. This plan identifies existing WSDOT objectives that support sustainability and creates four long-range goals based on Executive Order 02-03. The plan contains some quantifiable metrics pertaining to internal operations (e.g., ferry fuel use, number of low-emission/hybrid vehicles, biodiesel use, paper purchases, paper recycling, and energy use). WSDOT has long tracked agency-wide performance measures in their Grey Notebook, including some basic metrics related to sustainability. The agency is currently considering the future implementation of more significant sustainability metrics. Case Studies and Rating System Summaries F-9 Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning CMAP embarked on its long-range comprehensive planning process, GO TO 2040, in 2007. During the first phase of gathering public input and developing a vision, stakeholders expressed significant interest in sustainability principles. Therefore, the agency realized it needed to understand and define sustainability. In response, CMAP created a definition of sustainability composed of four principles: protect the environment and improve natural resources for future generations; improve economic performance and quality of life for individuals; preserve the value of human and man-made capital for future generations; and ensure a fair distribution of life- quality. A central element of the GO TO 2040 effort is the Regional Indicators Project, which involved the development of a set of 250 performance measures for the region grouped by 10 overarching themes, including environment and natural resources, with over 50 subcategories. The first indicators developed during the GO TO 2040 process were primarily for evaluating the impacts of potential regional scenarios, and therefore were more physically oriented and focused on transportation, land consumption, environmental, and economic measures. As the Regional Indicators Project evolved, CMAP made sure that all facets of the agency had a role in developing sustainability performance measures. CMAP also convened outside groups to define indicators in areas beyond those traditionally addressed by CMAP, including workforce development, arts and culture, health, public safety/crime, emergency preparedness, food systems, and hunger. CMAP anticipates continuously collecting data and tracking performance measures while publicly reporting progress every two years. Ongoing performance-measure tracking on a biannual basis will be enabled via a website under development by CMAP. The website will display a dashboard of key measures comparing the Northeast Illinois region with the five other most populous U.S. regions, Illinois, and the United States. Throughout this process, CMAP has identified a need for improved data sharing among government agencies, and CMAP hopes that other agencies using the web tool will take a more active role in data collection and sharing. As it considers major transportation projects for inclusion in the GO TO 2040 plan, CMAP is using a subset of 23 indicators to evaluate each projectâs sustainability. The agency is currently performing the analysis for 50 major capital projects that have been proposed for inclusion in the GO TO 2040 plan. Results of each project evaluation are presented to the sponsors and will be used to prioritize the list of projects for inclusion in the GO TO 2040 plan. Use of the sustainability performance measures is not possible for Transportation Improvement Program (TIP) projects because the regional travel model is the main tool for calculating the measures, and TIP projects are too small in size for such calculations to be meaningful. F-10 A Guidebook for Sustainability Performance Measurement for Transportation Agencies Mid-Ohio Regional Planning Commission Land use was a driving factor in MORPCâs history of sustainability promotion. In the 1990s, the Greenways program was developed to coordinate among several stakeholders such as parks, grassroots citizen groups, and municipal governments on waterways planning. The effort strove to develop a cohesive organization and get approval for common goals and directions for county waterways. In 2006, the Greenways program became the Center of Energy & Environment (CEE), which is focused on improving sustainability in the region through watershed planning, local foods, sustainable development, air quality, and weatherization of homes and businesses. The Green Pact program, run by CEE, is a voluntary commitment program through which local municipalities and other agencies pledge to follow several guidelines focused on sustainability, such as investing in greener public fleets, purchasing green products, and supporting mass transit. MORPC releases an annual public policy agenda that states their policy goals and informs political stakeholders of their priorities. Smart growth and patterns of sustainable development and multimodal transportation have been features of this document for many years. Among several other sustainability-oriented elements, the 2009 Public Policy Agenda calls for the region to âestablish âRegional Prosperity Indicatorsâ that enable annual measurement and analysis of regional performance versus our peer regions and ourselves on an ongoing basis.â In recent years, MORPC has promoted 40 sustainability performance indicators through its annual State of the Region reports, divided into the focus areas of people, place, and prosperity. The State of the Region reports contain indicators that are intended to be included in the long-range plan (Shaping Our Region), currently being developed for release in the spring of 2012. In the long-range plan, MORPC intends to draw from the performance indicators of the State of the Region reports and define targets for the year 2035, growing the current indicators into true long- range sustainability performance measures. The State of the Region reports and long-range plan will also serve as mechanisms for tracking and monitoring progress. MORPC anticipates continued emphasis on sustainability performance measures through their long-range planning effort, the continued work of the CEE, and additional multimodal transportation planning efforts such as the Complete Streets program. Case Studies and Rating System Summaries F-11 Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments The primary impetus for addressing sustainability was the growing interest across the Washington, D.C., region in solutions for the interconnected challenges that face the region, including population growth, aging infrastructure, threatened environmental quality, and growth in social and economic disparities. The National Capital Region Climate Change Report (2008) was also an important precursor to current efforts, focusing attention on the greenhouse gas impacts of the predicted new residents and jobs that will come to the Washington region by 2030. Preparation of the Climate Change Report was led by a Climate and Energy Steering Committee that was later reorganized into a Climate, Energy, and Environment Policy Committee. Most recently, sustainability has emerged as a priority at MWCOG via special policy study designed to provide a long-range vision for the regionâs development that outlines desirable attributes for the region in 2050. The study is called Region Forward: a Comprehensive Guide for Regional Planning and Measuring Progress in the 21st Century. It outlines four principles that participants agree should be used as a framework for guiding regional development in the future: accessibility, sustainability, prosperity, and livability. The Region Forward report sets out ambitious goals associated with these principles. To ensure progress on each goal, the report identifies multiple performance targets. Most targets include specific, measureable milestones and can be tracked with available data. Several are annual targets, while others are set for a longer horizon, such as 2025 or 2050. In addition to targets, the report also identifies numerous indicators that track progress toward achieving the goals. Although tracking protocols have not yet been established, MWCOG is in the process of beginning a plan for regularly monitoring progress toward the goals identified in Region Forward through regional progress reports. While the concepts of sustainability embodied by the MWCOG Region Forward report have yet to be integrated into MWCOGâs Transportation Planning Boardâs policies and decision making, in the future it is hoped that the goals, targets, and indicators will help inform regional leadership and policy making. F-12 A Guidebook for Sustainability Performance Measurement for Transportation Agencies Hampton Roads Transit (HRT) HRT began to get involved in sustainability practices in 2005 when it was chosen by the Federal Transit Administration to develop a pilot EMS. This initiative was made a priority in 2007, when the HRT added staff support and committed to meeting ISO 14001 certification standards. HRT was also the first American transit agency to sign the APTAâs Sustainability Commitment Pilot in January 2009. All programs that address sustainability at HRT are included under the HRT CARES (Creating Accessible Regional Sustainability) âGo Greenâ program. These include activities at headquarters to reduce waste and conserve energy, an energy reduction lighting program at the bus maintenance facility, the purchase of cleaner buses, and an agency-wide EMS designed to embed sustainable practices into the agencyâs daily activities and services. HRT has a set of measures they have identified for the EMS. When HRT committed to create an EMS that would meet ISO 14001 standards, they created an internal EMS team tasked with the responsibility of setting objectives, targets, and procedures for the EMS. The team chose three impact areas and related measures as a starting point (prevent future releases from HRTâs underground storage tanks, reduce HRTâs GHG footprint, and reduce HRTâs overall energy consumption). The EMS team felt that it made more sense to start measuring a few areas and add more as goals were met. The data for HRTâs sustainability performance measures come primarily from the facility maintenance group or the operations manager. The Director of Energy Management and Sustainability is in charge of collecting the data and tracking the measures. HRT has encountered challenges in measuring some of the required APTA measurements, due in part to resource constraints. HRT expects to begin compiling an annual report for tracking its sustainability performance measures in the near future. HRTâs goal is to see a full sustainability program in place, as a routine and integrated as a part of the culture at the agency, with the EMS functioning as a program to spur continual improvement. Case Studies and Rating System Summaries F-13 City of Alexandria, Virginia The City of Alexandria has a strong track record of environmental stewardship by government and engagement by its citizens on environmental issues. Examples include the 1998 Environmental Quality of Life Summit, which led to Alexandriaâs first strategic environmental plan, and the Alexandria 2015 Strategic Plan published in 2004. The original strategic environmental plan and the later strategic plan vision statement helped build momentum for three interrelated activities over three years that have driven Alexandriaâs sustainability agenda: â¢ In 2007, a âGreen-ventoryâ of city environmental policies, plans, and programs; â¢ In 2008, an Eco-City Charter; and â¢ In 2009, the Environmental Action Plan 2030, which is based on the Eco-City Charter and frames Alexandriaâs sustainability policy. The Environmental Action Plan (EAP) provides the foundation for incorporating sustainability principles into all the cityâs programs and plans. It does this by (1) making sector-specific recommendations for concrete short-, mid-, and long-term sustainability actions and (2) identifying nine cross-cutting strategies for supporting integration of sustainability principles into plans and programs. The majority of the Environmental Action Plan 2030 is dedicated to sector- focused chapters on transportation, green building, air quality, water resources, health, energy, land use, solid waste, and climate change. Each sector features a single statement on guiding principles and a related set of policy goals that will be achieved through a series of short-, mid-, and long-term actions. In addition, each sector has a handful of performance targets that are designed to demonstrate progress toward the goals. The city plans to continue to expand its efforts to track sustainability-related performance measures and to use this information in decision making. With the EAP in place, the City of Alexandria is working to incorporate the concepts of sustainability into its master plan and area plans as they are updated. F-14 A Guidebook for Sustainability Performance Measurement for Transportation Agencies Swedish Road Administration Sustainability became a dominant force with the passage of the Swedish governmentâs transport bill of 1997, entitled Transport Policy for a Sustainable Development (translated). Sustainability thus came to the road agency from the top, but has since also developed in a bottom-up way within the agency. Most recently (in 2009) the SRA produced its first specific sustainability report. Sustainability features in the following critical agency activities: strategic management, long-range planning and programming, project development and design, and construction. Performance measures have been defined for reporting at the sectoral level (addressing national objectives for the transport system) as well as at the agency level (addressing the strategic and performance objectives formulated at the SRA level). The measures have mostly been defined by the government agencies expected to report progress (e.g., the SRA), with reference to both national objectives and strategic plan objectives of the agency. Performance measures are used in strategic reports, long-term transport plans and associated program assessments, annual letters of appropriations, and agency annual reports and annual sectoral reports, as well as internally in SRAâs âGoals and Metricsâ database, in scorecards, in tertiary and monthly reports to SRA top management, and in several other contexts. Ideally they help craft and adjust transport plans and guide agencies and the government ministryâs control of their implementation activities. However, efforts to develop meaningful performance measures have only been partly successfulâfor several objectives only general measures exist, or performance measures exist that only partly address the objective. Although data collection and reporting is handled by SRA (using a goal and metrics database), another agency is charged with producing aggregated interpretations and assessments of progress toward the national transport policy objectives, based on all the transport agenciesâ submitted data. The idea is to have a neutral body charged with making this overall assessment. SRA believes that interagency collaboration may help pave the way toward more integrated, intermodal transport policy development and assessment, but may also increase the need for external oversight of the performance measures. Case Studies and Rating System Summaries F-15 UK Highways Agency Sustainable development has been formally incorporated into the management goals of the UK Highways Agency since 2005â06, when the agency began its corporate social responsibility reporting. In 2007â08, the agency established its first Sustainable Development Action Plan (SDAP), which is reported on and refreshed every year. In order to ensure that sustainability was properly incorporated within the agencyâs thinking and practices, changes were made to management structures and processes to ensure that sustainability had a high priority at board level that would support further changes within the operating practices of the agency. Sustainability principles cut across the actions of all parts of the organization, including strategic management, long-range planning and programming, project development and design, construction, and operations and maintenance. The 2007â08 SDAP set about defining what sustainable development meant to the Highways Agency. It was important that the agencyâs actions were consistent with the five overarching goals of the UK-wide strategy: living within environmental limits; ensuring a strong, healthy and just society; achieving a sustainable economy; promoting good governance; and using sound science responsibly. The 2007â08 SDAP was largely populated with process measures. Subsequent updates have strengthened and expanded on this document. In addition to the SDAP, a series of management tools were developed to help ensure that sustainability is part of the decision-making processes, including a monthly scorecard for each business unit (internal), a reporting tool to assess the compatibility of proposals with the SDAP goals, a corporate social responsibility report, and a national framework for project appraisal decisions. F-16 A Guidebook for Sustainability Performance Measurement for Transportation Agencies SUSTAINABILITY RATING SYSTEMS FHWA Sustainable Highways Website: www.sustainablehighways.org Purpose: The FHWA Sustainable Highways Self-Evaluation Tool identifies characteristics of sustainable highways and provides procedures and techniques to help agencies and organizations apply and integrate sustainability best practices into highway and other roadway projects and programs within system planning, project development, and operations and maintenance. While the words âhighwayâ and âroadwayâ are both used in this tool, the FHWA Sustainable Highways Self-Evaluation Tool is designed to be applied to all roadway projects, not just highways. The goal of the FHWA Sustainable Highways Self-Evaluation Tool is to encourage increased application of the principles of sustainability by presenting best practices and establishing standard and qualitative measures for sustainability. Sustainability definition: The definition of sustainability used by Sustainable Highways is simply that sustainability is the capacity to endure. Sustainable Highways describes the goal of sustainability as the âtriple bottom lineâ concept, which includes equity (also known as social or people), ecology (also known as environment or planet), and economy. The goal of sustainability is the satisfaction of basic social and economic needs, both present and future, and the responsible use of natural resources, all while maintaining or improving the well-being of the environment and ecology on which life depends. Weighting or scoring logic: There are 68 credits in the beta version of the Sustainable Highways Self-Evaluation Tool. The credits are grouped into three categories based on what the credits address. Each category serves as an independent self-evaluation tool that can be scored independently of the others. These categories are system planning (SP), project development (PD), and operations and maintenance (OM). Currently, it is not possible to mix credits from the three different categories. SP credits are concerned with agency-wide management and planning of highway networks, and apply to all roadways under the jurisdiction of the owner-agency, not a specific project. PD credits address the development of a specific project once the general need and proposal for a solution to a transportation problem has been programmed. They involve environmental review, project planning, design, and construction decisions related to a specific project. OM credits are credits concerned with agency-wide practices, policies, and procedures required for the overall functionality and efficiency of a highway network and are not specific to one project. Currently PD credits are individually weighted, and the credits within other categories are equally weighted. The overall goal of weighting within the PD credits is to make the point value for each credit commensurate with its potential to promote sustainability. Greater weights are assigned to credits that are likely to have the greatest impact on sustainability from project to project. Sustainable Transportation Access Rating System Website: http://www.portlandonline.com/transportation/index.cfm?a=319882&c=34749 Purpose: STARS is an integrated planning framework and rating system for transportation plans, projects, and employer programs that is based on sustainability principles. STARS aims to evaluate the full life cycle of transportation projects and acknowledges that the decision of what to build in the first place is just as important (and sometimes more important) than how it is constructed. This upstream approach to transportation projects distinguishes STARS from other rating systems that are centered on the design and construction phases. STARS is designed as a Case Studies and Rating System Summaries F-17 third-party certification rating system and was initiated by the North American Sustainable Transportation Council. The current draft of the STARS-Project manual was developed through a partnership between the Santa Cruz Regional Transportation Council; the City of Portland Bureau of Transportation; CH2M HILL; Parsons Brinckerhoff Quade & Douglas, Inc.; ECONorthwest; Brightworks; Confluence Planning, LLC; and numerous volunteer credit peer reviewers. Sustainability definition: STARS uses the Natural Step as a sustainability framework, which is based on systems thinking and recognizes that what happens in one part of a system affects every other part of the system. STARS focuses on sustainability with respect to access, climate, and economic health. Weighting or scoring logic: Currently, the draft STARS-Project manual serves as a planning and evaluation tool. Subsequent versions of STARS will include credit weighting, scoring, and certification levels and will also function as a rating system. The current draft version of STARS- Project is organized into 29 credits, five of which are required. To be considered for certification, a project applicant must demonstrate that they have met the minimum credit requirements for the five required credits and several of the non-required credits. The credits are broken down into six categories: integrated process, access, climate and energy, ecological function, cost effectiveness analysis, and innovation. The latter category is provided to allow for flexibility and enable applicants to receive credit for new and innovative strategies that meet sustainability goals. Greenroads Website: www.greenroads.us Purpose: Greenroads is a voluntary sustainability rating system, or performance metric, for roadway design and construction, including project planning. It is applicable to all roadway projects including new, reconstructed, and rehabilitated roadways. It awards points for sustainable choices/practices and can be used to assess roadway project sustainability. Greenroads is a metric that helps quantify the sustainable attributes of a roadway project. This quantification can be used to â¢ Define what features contribute to sustainability on the project, â¢ Provide accountability for sustainability on roadway projects, â¢ Measure and track specific sustainability goals over time, â¢ Manage and improve roadway sustainability, â¢ Encourage new and innovative practices, â¢ Promote competitive advantage and other economic or market incentives for sustainability, and â¢ Communicate sustainable features to stakeholders in an understandable way, especially to the general public. Greenroads is a publicly available system that can be used by anyone. However, the Greenroads logo and name are trademarked and remain the property of Greenroads. The University of Washington and CH2M HILL are the Greenroads developers, and the Greenroads Foundation, an independent nonprofit organization, now owns Greenroads. Agencies and organizations can use Greenroads in a variety of ways, including (1) a performance metric for roadway design and construction sustainability, (2) a means to define basic roadway sustainability attributes, (3) a means of conferring market recognition on more sustainable F-18 A Guidebook for Sustainability Performance Measurement for Transportation Agencies roadway projects, and (4) a voluntary or required baseline standard to which roadways are designed and constructed. Sustainability definition: Greenroads defines sustainability as a system characteristic that reflects the systemâs capacity to support natural laws and human values. The definition of sustainability used in Greenroads centers on seven different components that are demonstrated by a metric in a variety of ways. These seven components are the basis for the phrases ânatural lawsâ and âhuman values.â These components include the three commonly cited principles of sustainability: ecology, equity, and economy. Additionally, there are four other essential components to this systems-based definition that are emphasized within the context of the Greenroads metric: extent, expectations, experience, and exposure. Since sustainability is context sensitive and dependent on the human needs and values of the project management team and stakeholders, the extent and expectations components were identified because they act as the project system boundaries. The experience component includes technical expertise, engineering ingenuity, and knowledge of applicable historical information, which is critical in decision- making processes. The exposure component represents the idea that implementing sustainability in practice requires ongoing educational and awareness programs for the general public, professionals, agencies, and stakeholders. Weighting or scoring logic: Greenroads applies sustainability best practices to roadways. Best practices are divided into two types: required and voluntary. Required best practices, called âproject requirements,â are those that must be done as a minimum in order for a roadway to be considered a Greenroad. Voluntary best practices, called âvoluntary credits,â are those that may optionally be included in a roadway project. Each voluntary credit is assigned a point value (1â5) depending upon its impact on sustainability. Currently, there are 37 voluntary credits that total 108 points. Greenroads also allows a project or organization to create and use its own voluntary credits (called âcustom creditsâ), subject to approval of Greenroads, for a total of 10 more points, which brings the total available points to 118. Green Leadership in Transportation and Environmental Sustainability Website: www.nysdot.gov/programs/greenlites Purpose: The GreenLITES rating system is owned and was developed by NYSDOT for use on state roadway projects. The system was first published in 2008 and serves primarily as an internal management program for NYSDOT to measure performance, recognize good practices, identify needed improvements, and share advances in sustainable practices with the public. GreenLITES is a self-certification program that distinguishes transportation projects and maintenance activities based on the extent to which they incorporate sustainable practices. Sustainability definition: Sustainability is defined broadly in the GreenLITES rating system to refer to any human use of resources that does not exhaust those resources. The concept is described as balancing what is beneficial to people with what is economically sound and environmentally compatible. Specifically, NYSDOT defines transportation sustainability to mean a design philosophy that: â¢ Protects and enhances the environment; â¢ Conserves energy and natural resources; â¢ Preserves or enhances the historic, scenic, and aesthetic project setting characteristics; Case Studies and Rating System Summaries F-19 â¢ Encourages public involvement in the transportation planning process; â¢ Integrates smart growth and other sound land-use practices; and â¢ Encourages new and innovative approaches to sustainable design. GreenLITES also acknowledges that increases in project costs may result from some sustainability efforts; however, these cost increases are often warranted when all external environmental and social costs are fully considered. Weighting or scoring logic: The GreenLITES system is rated in a similar fashion to Greenroads with certified, silver, gold, and evergreen serving as the progressive certification levels for more sustainable practices. Certification is based on the total amount of points received. Points are allocated to different activities and levels of accomplishment based on their perceived sustainability impact (weighting). Projects receive points in the GreenLITES Project Design program for undertaking actions in the following categories: sustainable sites, water quality, materials and resources, energy and atmosphere, and innovation/unlisted. The latter category is provided to allow flexibility in the scoring system and allow points to be received for new and innovative sustainability practices. Projects receive points in the GreenLITES Operations program for undertaking actions such as using alternatives to herbicides during roadway vegetation maintenance, improving or retaining bridge aesthetics, optimizing signal timing, or improving ADA access. Illinois Livable and Sustainable Transportation System and Guide Website: www.acec-il.org/ and http://www.dot.il.gov/green/projects.html Purpose: I-LAST is a sustainability performance metric system developed by the Joint Sustainability Group of the Illinois Department of Transportation, the American Council of Engineering CompaniesâIllinois (ACEC-IL), and the Illinois Road and Transportation Builders Association (IRTBA). The stated purposes of I-LAST are threefold: (1) provide a comprehensive list of practices that have the potential to bring sustainable results to highway projects; (2) establish a simple and efficient method of evaluating transportation projects with respect to livability, sustainability, and their effect on the natural environment; and (3) record and recognize the use of sustainable practices in the transportation industry. Sustainability definition: I-LAST uses the United Nations Brundtland Commission definition of sustainability. The Brundtland Commission defined sustainability as âMeeting the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needsâ (World Commission on Environment and Development, 1987). Specifically, I-LAST identifies the following goals for providing sustainable features in the design and construction of highway projects: â¢ Minimize impacts to environmental resources; â¢ Minimize the consumption of material resources; â¢ Minimize energy consumption; â¢ Preserve and/or enhance the historic, scenic, and aesthetic context; â¢ Integrate highway projects into the community in a way that helps preserve and enhance community life; â¢ Encourage community involvement in the transportation planning process; F-20 A Guidebook for Sustainability Performance Measurement for Transportation Agencies â¢ Encourage integration of nonmotorized means of transportation into highway projects; â¢ Find a balance between what is important to the transportation function of the facility, to the community, to the natural environment, and to what is economically sound; and â¢ Encourage the use of new and innovative approaches in achieving these goals. Weighting or scoring logic: The I-LAST Guidebook and Construction Practices Addendum consist of a total of eight credit categories and 20 unique credits. The credit categories are planning, design, environmental, water quality, transportation, lighting, materials, and innovation. The innovation credit is included to foster creativity and reward the use of experimental and innovative features to improve the sustainability of the transportation industry. Each credit identifies criteria to meet the intent of the credit. Point values are assigned to each criterion, depending on the level of sustainability benefit. To evaluate a projectâs sustainability performance, the I-LAST guidebook recommends that the number of points earned be taken as a percentage of the total number of points possible. However, due to the varying nature of highway projects and the range of items in I-LAST, not all credit topics are relevant for every project. It is therefore recommended that the number of points possible be determined at the outset by deciding which credit topics are applicable to a specific project. Using this method, I-LAST users are encouraged to compare their final percentage-based score to the scores of other projects to estimate their level of sustainability achievement. Green Guide for Roads Website: http://www.tac-atc.ca/english/projects/greenguide.cfm Purpose: The stated purpose of Canadaâs national Green Guide for Roads is to promote sustainable growth and alternative multimodal transportation solutions within corridors, along with safe, long-lasting roadway infrastructure and green construction principles. The intent of the guide is to respect traditional design objectives for safety, efficiency, capacity, and maintenance, while integrating objectives relating to compatibility, livability, universal accessibility, modal equity, conservation of resources, affordability, and environmental protection. The Green Guide for Roads is currently designed as a self-evaluation tool and was initiated by the Transportation Association of Canada in 2010. Sustainability definition: No explicit definition of sustainability is offered throughout the documents produced to date for the Green Guide for Roads. However, the Benefits of Green Roads section of the document offers the following information on the role of transportation in creating a sustainable society: A fundamental component of sustainable development is having a transportation system that is affordable, safe, efficient, and environmentally friendly. While a transportation system brings people and goods together and contributes to the growth and prosperity of Canada, it does have environmental, economic, and social costs that affect our quality of life. As such, decisions and choices made with respect to the development, operation, and use of the transportation system shape the communities we live in and have an impact on the future sustainability of our communities. (http://www.tac- atc.ca/english/projects/pdf/greenguide-benefits.pdf) Weighting or scoring logic: Currently the working template is a compilation of sustainability requirements and best practices to meet the 13 identified sustainability principle application areas. The 13 sustainability principle application areas in the working template are community interface, Case Studies and Rating System Summaries F-21 valued environmental components and land consumption, mobility choices, intersections and driveways, hard surfaces, landscaping, amenities, drainage, safety, energy consumption, construction, operations and maintenance, and services and utilities. A suggested ordinal ranking system is provided to help the users of the template score their projects based on their level of accomplishment in meeting the requirements of each application area. The ordinal ranking system is based on a three-point low, medium, and high scale, which is weighted equally between the requirements. Currently there are no point thresholds or certification levels established since these will be included in the next phase of the rating system development. Additionally, the ability to earn points for new and innovative strategies that are not already included in the working template is limited; currently only a few of the 13 sustainability principle application areas allow points to be earned for innovation. Building Environmentally and Economically Sustainable Transportation-Infrastructure- Highways (BE2ST-in-Highways) Website: www.rmrc.unh.edu/Outreach/docs/Lee,Edil,Benson,Tinjum.pdf Purpose: BE2ST-in-Highways was developed by the University of Wisconsin to provide a quantitative methodology for rating the benefits of sustainable highway construction. The methodology is grounded in quantitative metrics so that a transparent linkage exists between the project rating and the sustainable practices employed in design and construction. This rating system can be used by the highway industry to help incorporate sustainable elements into projects more easily at the forefront but also in any phase of a project. Sustainability definition: BE2ST-in-Highways defines sustainable development as the ability to âmeet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs,â which is the definition from the United Nations Brundtland Commissionâs 1987 report entitled Our Common Future. Weighting or scoring logic: With the criteria and their target values established, weights are assigned to each criterion along with credit levels. An equally weighted system consisting of 2 points for each criterion, resulting in 18 total points, is the default in the BE2ST-in-Highways system. In application, stakeholders can select the weights and credits. Weights are based on the importance ascribed to each criterion and can be assigned using the analytical hierarchy process, which is a separate software package designed to compute the weighting value. GreenPave Website: http://www.mto.gov.on.ca/english/transtek/roadtalk/rt16-1/#a6 Purpose: GreenPave is a Canadian system developed by the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (MTO). The system primarily focuses on roadway pavements. GreenPave is a green rating system for pavements that provides a way of recognizing sustainability in pavement projects. The points-based system is designed to assess the sustainability of flexible and riding pavement designs and their construction. GreenPave is modeled after Greenroads and GreenLITES, but is customized for Ontario. F-22 A Guidebook for Sustainability Performance Measurement for Transportation Agencies Sustainability definition: The definition of sustainability that serves as an organizing concept for GreenPave is the same definition used to guide MTO. MTO is committed to enhancing the sustainability of Ontarioâs transportation infrastructure, including safe, efficient, economical, environmentally friendly technologies and materials that meet the needs of present-day users without compromising those of future generations. Weighting or scoring logic: GreenPave assesses pavements within four categories: pavement design technologies, materials and resources, energy and atmosphere, and innovation and design process. Each category has a maximum number of points that can be awarded, for a total of 36 possible points. Each category is further broken down to address specific objectives, with corresponding points assigned to each subcategory. Achievement levels of bronze, silver, gold, and trillium can be awarded.

Are you confused by all the exercise advice out there? It’s no wonder: With a dozen fitness magazines on the newsstand, a wealth of health and fitness news streaming into your home over the Internet, bogus ads guaranteeing an effortless 40-pound weight loss or bigger muscles in just 10 days, not to mention the free advice from well-intentioned friends, trainers, and the guy on the bench press next to you, there’s a lot of conflicting information to sort through. Unfortunately, many popular fitness tips not only make exercise seem harder and more complicated than it really should be, but they can also lead to injury. To set the record straight and help you exercise safely, here are the facts — nothing but the facts — behind some of the most common exercise myths. You don’t start burning fat until 20 minutes into your workout. This is one of the most popular myths of all time. You may have heard it from a friend or even from a fitness trainer at your gym, but the fact is, muscle burns a combination of fat and carbohydrate (glucose) simultaneously almost all of the time. It’s just that you may burn a higher percentage of one or the other depending on the intensity of the exercise. For example, during high-intensity activities like sprinting or strenuous weight lifting, which get you out of breath, your muscles are burning a higher percentage of carbohydrate than fat (perhaps as much as 80% to 90% carbohydrate and 10% fat). At rest and during light-intensity physical activity (such as moderate-paced walking), when breathing is easier, the percentage could change to 70% fat and 30% carbohydrate. Why does this happen? As you start to exercise, fat and carbohydrate are released from storage sites in the body as well as from the bloodstream and enter the working muscles. (Protein is not a fuel for exercise unless your body is in a starvation crisis.) Oxygen, transported from the lungs to the muscle, burns these fuels to generate energy. Fat contains more than twice the amount of energy per gram as carbohydrate (fat contains 9 calories per gram while carbohydrate has only 4). Your muscles would prefer to burn fat, because it’s so energy-dense, but the catch is, you must provide adequate oxygen to the muscle to burn it. Since fat contains more calories than carbohydrate, it also takes more oxygen to burn. When you’re really out of breath — during a sprint, for example — there’s not enough time for oxygen to travel from the lungs to the muscles, and so your muscles, low on oxygen, have no choice but to burn the less dense fuel, carbohydrate. As a general rule, unless you are performing brief, very intense exercise, there’s always enough oxygen in the muscles to burn some fat as well as carbohydrate. Which leads us to our next myth… The “fat-burning” option on the exercise machine at the gym is better for weight loss than the “cardio” option. This isn’t only a myth; it’s really bad advice. Basically, you want to burn as many calories as possible when you exercise, whether you’re trying to lose weight, increase your stamina, control your diabetes, or improve your general health. Caloric expenditure during aerobic activity is directly related to the distance you travel and how hard you work. When you select the fat-burning mode on an aerobic exercise machine, you in effect minimize the number of calories you burn, because the machine — let’s say a treadmill — keeps the speed slow and the elevation low. On the “cardio” option, the speed and elevation are set higher, so that for an equivalent amount of workout time, you end up traveling farther, working harder — and burning more calories. The reason the lower level is labeled the “fat-burning” option is that, as described above, at lower intensities you breathe more comfortably, so you deliver more oxygen to the muscles and burn a higher percentage of fat than carbohydrate. This part of the equation is accurate, but the truth is that although you may burn a higher percentage of fat at the slower speed and intensity, you end up burning less total fat. For example, if you weigh 150 pounds and walk on the treadmill for 30 minutes at 3.0 miles per hour, you will burn about 150 calories in one session. If you walk for 30 minutes at 4.0 miles per hour, you will burn 200 calories. Now let’s say that at the lower-intensity, 3-mile-per-hour pace you burn 70% of your total calories from fat. That would be .70 x 150 calories, or a total of 105 calories burned from fat. At the faster, 4-mile-per-hour pace, you burn only 60% of your calories from fat (again, because you are working harder, you can’t get as much oxygen to the muscles to burn fat). So, .60 x 200 calories equals 120 calories from fat. As you can see, at the slower speed, not only is the number of total calories burned less (150 versus 200), but the number of fat calories burned is also less than it is at the faster speed (105 versus 120). If this confuses you, don’t sweat it. Just remember that selecting a slower speed and lower intensity to maximize fat burning is counterproductive — unless it enables you to exercise longer and burn more calories. Whenever you exercise, try to work to the point where you feel warm and slightly out of breath. If you do, then you can be sure that you’re doing the best you can to burn lots of fat and glucose, increase your level of fitness, and improve your health. Don’t lift weights if you’re trying to lose weight. Some people don’t want to weight train while they’re on a weight-loss program because they know that building muscle might cause some weight gain. That’s true, because muscle tissue is heavier than fat, but muscle is exactly what you want to gain when you’re trying to lose weight. Here’s why: When you restrict calories to lose weight, you always lose some muscle. In fact, up to 25% of your body-weight loss can be from muscle. (So if you lose 10 pounds, 2.5 pounds of it could be muscle.) The problem with losing muscle during weight loss is that muscle is the engine that burns calories and helps maintain your metabolic rate. If you have less muscle, you reduce your ability to burn calories, lose more weight, and, more important, maintain your weight loss. (The plateau that many people experience during weight loss can be explained partially by loss of muscle.) In most cases, moderate weight training will not amount to more than 3–5 pounds of weight gain anyway, but even if it did, it’s what you want, because each pound of muscle consumes about 35–50 calories a day. So next time someone drops by and offers you five pounds of muscle, go ahead and take it; it’ll help you use up an additional 175–250 calories daily. Muscle is also the engine that burns glucose. The more muscle you have, the more glucose you can burn, and the better your diabetes control may be. So pour on the muscle. Lift weights all you want, whenever you want. Exercise in the morning works better than exercise at night. Some people believe that if you go to sleep right after exercise you won’t get as much benefit from the workout, because your metabolic rate slows down while you’re sleeping. If you exercise in the morning, they say, you jump-start your metabolism and burn more calories throughout the day. There’s no evidence that this is true. Another reason some people believe morning exercise is superior to nighttime exercise is that exercising right before bed supposedly keeps you awake longer. Research shows that that may be true, but generally only for deconditioned people. For fit people, exercise before bedtime does not alter sleep patterns, probably because their bodies are used to and recover quickly from the effects of exercise. Some health experts suggest that regular exercise may even help improve sleep quality and sleep onset over time. The bottom line is that the body responds to exercise whenever you do it. If exercising at night fits your schedule better, then by all means do it then. If getting a workout first thing in the morning makes you feel more energetic, all the better. The best time to exercise is the time you are most likely to do it. Walking may not be as arduous as training for a marathon, but when it comes to preventing diabetes, complications of diabetes, and heart disease, it’s powerful medicine. The Diabetes Prevention Program, a three-year, government-sponsored study designed to test the ability of healthy behavior changes to prevent diabetes, showed that when people under the age of 60 who had impaired glucose tolerance, or prediabetes (a condition that often precedes Type 2 diabetes), walked 150 minutes per week (that’s five 30-minute walks per week) and followed a low-fat diet (enabling them to lose 5% to 7% of their body weight), they reduced their risk of diabetes by 58%. For people over 60, the risk reduction was 71%. In another study, close to 3,000 retired men were enrolled in the Honolulu Heart Program to study the effects of walking on heart disease. The conclusion: The more they walked, the lower their risk of heart disease. Men who walked more than 2 miles per day were half as likely to get heart disease as men who walked less than 1 mile per day. In both of these studies, subjects walked at a moderate pace of 3.0–4.0 miles per hour. Spot-reducing exercises can trim my trouble spots. There’s no such thing as spot-reducing. It would be nice if you could walk on the treadmill and say, “OK, today I’ll burn fat from my thighs.” But that’s not the way it works. Whether it tends to collect on your thighs or your tummy, fat on your body belongs to your entire body, and the only way to reduce it is through regular exercise and reducing your caloric intake. Here’s some information about storing and burning fat that should help you understand how aerobic exercise, weight lifting or other resistance exercise, and attention to your diet can help you lose weight. Fat is stored in cells called adipocytes, which are located all over the body. When you eat more fat or calories than your body needs, the fat cells gobble up much of the excess and expand in size. The larger the cells, the higher your percentage of body fat. Where on the body your fat cells are located, where you tend to store fat first, and how efficient your adipocytes are at storing fat is genetically determined; you have no control over it. As a rule, men store fat in their abdomens, and women tend to store it in their buttocks, hips, and thighs. Similarly, people generally gain and lose weight in a consistent pattern. If you’ve lost and regained weight multiple times, you probably know where you tend to lose it from first (perhaps the face), and where it tends to stick the longest (often in the hips, thighs, and buttocks). How does exercise help you get rid of fat? During exercise, hormones like adrenaline are released that signal the adipocytes to release fat into the bloodstream. That fat is then transported to the muscles to be burned for energy. When an adipocyte releases its stored fat, it shrinks. The cells themselves never disappear, but as long as the fat is used by the muscle and does not return to fatten up the adipocyte, you will lose overall body fat. Because you have no control over which adipocytes are stimulated to release fat, however, you cannot “spot-reduce” fat from a particular body part. Aerobic exercise (such as biking, walking, or swimming) stimulates the release of more fat than does resistance exercise like weight lifting, leg lifts, or pushups. However, resistance exercise builds muscle, and muscle is the engine that burns fat and helps maintain metabolic rate. So if you’re trying to lose weight, an exercise program that includes aerobic activity as well as some type of calisthenics or weight lifting will probably help you the most. Incidentally, although they don’t change your weight-loss pattern, exercises that work your abdomen, thighs, hips, and buttocks will indeed strengthen and tone the underlying muscles, so even if there is still that pesky layer of fat on top, your physique will be tighter and your clothes may even feel looser. There is no compelling evidence that moderate exercise affects a person’s overall appetite; it neither makes you hungry nor suppresses your appetite. Some people report that they make better food choices if they exercise regularly, but this has not been studied carefully. The only time exercise is likely to make you hungry is if it’s been 3–4 hours since your last meal or snack, and you exercise on an empty stomach. If I don’t sweat during exercise I’m not getting any benefit. Sweating is important because it’s a way of cooling off muscles that heat up during exercise, but it is not necessarily an indicator of how hard you are working. Temperature, humidity, wind conditions, and even how you are dressed all affect how much you sweat on a given day. Moreover, not everyone sweats at the same rate. Do you ever turn beet-red during exercise? That happens because blood vessels below the skin in the face are dilating; as they widen, they transport heat from the muscles to the skin to cool off the body. Chances are, if you’re a person who turns bright red in the face during exercise, you may not sweat as much as a person who does not turn red; it usually has nothing to do with the amount of exercise you do or how much effort you’re putting into it. Which brings us to a related myth… There’s no relationship between how fit you are and how much you sweat. Some people sweat buckets, while others don’t sweat much at all, regardless of their fitness level or degree of exertion. Heavy sweating during exercise may not be pleasant, but it means that the body is cooling itself efficiently, which may enhance your performance. The only possible physiological downside of heavy sweating is that if you don’t replace the lost fluid by drinking water, you run the risk of dehydration. Dehydration is unhealthy for all people, but it can be even more of a concern for people with diabetes, because it is more likely to occur when blood glucose levels aren’t under control. It’s relatively easy to dehydrate if you sweat a lot; on a hot, humid day, you can lose more than 5% of your body weight from sweat during a workout. Athletic performance can be adversely affected by as little as a 1% drop in body weight, and when fluid loss exceeds 3% of body weight, endurance can diminish by as much as 20% to 30%. Weight loss from sweat should never exceed 2% of body weight. (For a 150-pound person, 2% of body weight is 3 pounds.) Thirst is not a good indicator of hydration status, because by the time you feel thirsty, you may already be dehydrated. Proper hydration, or fluid replacement, should begin before you exercise and continue during and after the activity. The amount of water you drink should approximately equal the amount of fluid lost in sweat and urine. To get a sense of how much fluid you need, weigh yourself nude before and after exercise and drink 2 cups of water for every pound lost. Some people can lose 1/2 to 2 liters of fluid per hour (1 liter of water weighs 2.25 pounds). A more general guideline for maintaining proper hydration is as follows: Drink 17 to 20 ounces of water (about 2–2 1/2 cups) 2 to 3 hours before exercise. Drink 7 to 10 ounces of water (about 1–1 1/2 cups) 10 to 20 minutes before exercise. Drink 7 to 10 ounces of water every 10 to 20 minutes during activity. If you sweat heavily, you may need to drink more. If I’m not sore after my workout, I’m not getting any benefit. This myth may hail back to that old “no pain, no gain” adage that’s simply not true. Muscle soreness is not a prerequisite for muscle growth. When just starting an exercise program or a new activity, it’s common to feel stiff or sore for a day or more afterward. Once the body adapts to a particular exercise, however, you won’t feel as sore every time you work out, though clearly you are getting stronger. You can minimize muscle pain by beginning with small amounts of activity and only gradually increasing the intensity and duration of your workout. If you’re already used to exercise, you know that you are capable of various degrees of intensity when working out. You don’t need to push to the limit at each workout to realize gains in performance (in fact, overdoing it can cause burnout or injury), but if you feel you’ve hit a plateau in your routine, and you consider a little soreness to be “good pain,” kicking your effort up a notch or two can help you reach your next fitness goal. Try lifting weights more slowly, particularly on the lowering portion of the lift, which tends to cause more soreness. You could also ask a spotter to help you with the final few repetitions once you’re fatigued and cannot complete a full repetition. You begin the lift on your own, and when you cannot lift any further, the spotter helps you finish the lift; you then lower the weight on your own. This is called assisted negative training, and it will help you build muscle. To increase the intensity of aerobic workouts, try interval training once or twice a week. Interval training involves setting up a work-to-active-recovery ratio, in which you alternate more intense periods of activity with less intense, “active recovery” periods. For example, if you usually walk on the treadmill for 30 minutes at a steady, 3.5-mile-per-hour pace, here’s what a 30-minute interval training session might look like: Walk for 10 minutes at your usual pace (so you’re good and warmed up), then increase the speed to, say, 3.8 mph (which will get your heart thumping) for one minute. Return to your 3.5-mph pace for another 3 minutes, then pick up the pace to 3.8 mph again for one minute. The work-to-active-recovery ratio in this workout is 1:3: The minute at 3.8 mph is the “work,” and the three minutes at 3.5 mph is the “active recovery.” Over time, as you get fitter, you’ll be able to extend the “work” time to 1.5 minutes and spend only 2.5 minutes at the slower pace. Eventually, your regular, steady pace will be 3.8 mph, and when you interval train, your “work” pace will be even faster. This myth was shattered by a landmark study published in 1990, in which 10 frail nursing home residents, ages 90 to 96, lifted weights for eight weeks. After the study was completed, their strength gain averaged 174%, thigh muscle area increased 9.0%, and walking speed increased by 48%. Other studies have shown similar results, so it seems clear that muscle loss is caused not by aging itself but by lack of activity. Not only is muscle gain possible, but it’s also very beneficial for older adults: Strength training helps increase bone mass, reduce the risk of falling, and preserve greater independence. It’s fair to say that it’s never too late to start lifting. Disappointing as it may seem, exercise is much more important for weight maintenance than it is for weight loss. In fact, in virtually all studies that compare people who exercise to lose weight with people who diet to lose weight, the dieters always lose lots of weight, and the exercisers lose very little, if any. That’s no reason to give up on exercise, though. For one thing, you gain important health benefits from exercise even if you don’t lose a pound. For another, when you lose weight by restricting calories, it’s very difficult to keep the weight off permanently unless you exercise to raise your metabolic rate and prevent muscle loss. Many weight-loss researchers believe that including regular exercise in a weight-loss program is the single best predictor of long-term weight-loss success. (If you cut calories but remain sedentary, there’s a high likelihood that you will regain all of the weight you lose.) This may not sound like great news, but it is. It means that you do not have to do Herculean amounts of exercise to lose weight. If you get started on weight loss by reducing your caloric intake, then gradually increase your level of physical activity while continuing to watch your calories, you will steadily lose weight. As you lose pounds, you should find it easier to move, and by the time you reach your target weight, you should be physically active enough to keep the weight off. If you find you have gained weight after starting to exercise, there are two probable explanations: You may be gaining muscle. Muscle is heavier than fat, and it’s possible to gain 3–5 pounds of muscle mass in 4–8 weeks, particularly during a weight-lifting program. (You’re likely to gain more muscle from lifting weights than from doing aerobic exercise.) This is not a bad thing. You may have started to eat more. Some people eat more when they first begin to exercise because they feel hungrier (although it’s not all that common, as mentioned before), and some people eat more because they think they are “allowed to” since they’re exercising. The problem is that exercise may not burn as many calories as you think it does. If you weigh 150 pounds and run for 30 minutes at 6.0 mph, you’ll burn about 300 calories. That may seem like a lot, but if you also eat an extra 500 calories throughout the day, you’re going to gain weight. If you exercise on an empty stomach, you may eat more than usual after exercise. For instance, if you exercise after work but before dinner, and you haven’t eaten since lunch, by the time you finish exercising, you may not have eaten for 5 or 6 hours. When you’re famished after a workout, it’s very easy to eat more than you intend to at dinner, which can cause the calories to add up. To help control hunger, try having a snack 40–60 minutes before exercise if it’s been more than 3–4 hours since you last ate. Half a bagel, 8 ounces of sugar-free yogurt, an energy bar, or a banana are some suggestions for a light pre-exercise snack. For people who take insulin or oral medicines that lower blood glucose level, exercising without a pre-exercise snack can cause hypoglycemia, or low blood glucose. Developing low blood sugar during a workout can make exercise very frustrating, and if it happens on a regular basis, the extra calories you need to treat the hypoglycemia can add up. If you’re unhappy about always having to eat before or during exercise to prevent or treat low blood sugar, speak to your doctor or diabetes educator about lowering your insulin doses on days you exercise. After all, if you’re trying to maintain weight loss, what’s the point of exercising if you have to eat every time you work out? To read more about managing blood glucose during exercise, see the article . So there you have some crucial facts about exercise. In today’s world, where information is the name of the game, it’s easy to lose track of the simplicity of movement. Exercise doesn’t have to be complicated: Pick an activity that you like and that gets your heart thumping a little (remember, the key is to feel warm and slightly out of breath), then do it daily or on most days, and ignore all the hype. If you do this, you have a great shot at good health and physical fitness.

Sustainable Materials and Sustainable Design in Construction 1640 words (7 pages) Essay 18th May 2020   Sustainable Materials and Sustainable Design in Construction Abstract The construction industry is one of the most significant contributors of landfill waste in New Zealand and around the world. Construction and Demolition waste is responsible for an estimated 27% of landfill waste in New Zealand (Ministry for the Environment, Manatu Mo Te Taiao, 2009) and this is expect to rise due to a sharp increase in building consents since 2011(see Figure A). The waste from Construction and Demolition can contaminate soil and water, and release gases harmful to the Earth’s atmosphere. The production of construction materials requires a significant amount of resources with many of these resources going to waste due to damage or a surplus. The transportation of this waste creates pollution through emissions. The waste from Construction and Demolition can be reduced through changes within the design and construction process.  This report aims to examine how selecting more sustainable materials and changes to the design and construction processes can be used to create more sustainable structures. These options aim reduce waste and the need for more raw materials. 1 Criteria for Sustainable Material Selection Materials used in buildings go through three stages: extraction, processing and transportation. The extraction stage requires energy for the harvesting or mining equipment, the processing stage require energy for the processing equipment and transportation require energy for transportation devices. This energy use produces pollution harmful to the environment. The energy used in these stages is referred to as embodied energy. 1a Local Material Sources By using locally sourced materials the amount of embodied energy in the transportation and storage of the materials can be reduced. The materials can also be better suited for the environment. 1b Recycled and Refurbishing Materials Recycling consist of dismantling and reusing materials. Refurbishing consists of repairing then using materials. Both techniques minimise the amount of waste and strain on landfills. Recycled metals can be remade into their original form, plastics can be used for carpet and paper can be used for insulation (Mehta, Mehta, & Sharma, 2014). Other products can be salvaged for reuse. Recycling materials benefits from improved energy efficiency. 1c Conserve Natural Resources Products that use less raw materials reduce the energy use for transportation and disposal. Fast growing trees such as aspen require less wood than convention lumber to make engineered wood products (Mehta, Mehta, & Sharma, 2014). If close the building site there can be a reduction in the transportation and storage cost. Natural and renewable resources require less processing and have lower embodied energy. 1d Renewable Resources The use of renewable resources can limit the amount of waste. Some renewable resources can reduce the quantity of materials used while not affecting durability. (California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery, 2018) 1e Durability The durability of the material used determines the useful life period of construction projects. Products that are durable and need to be replace or repaired less frequently contribute to less wasted resources over the long term. 1f Reusability Waste can be minimised through material reusability. When a material can be adapted to multiple purposes resource efficiency is improved through lower transport and storage costs. 1g Biodegradability Biodegradability is determined by how long materials take to discompose after being disposed of. Wood and other organic material are more biodegradable than plastics or metal because it degrades in a shorter period. 2 Material Selection during Phases of Construction 2a Design Phase A project begins with the design phase which involves designing and planning of the project. This phase involves the most opportunities for sustainable material selection to insure a sustainable project. The focuses for this phase should include examining the local area for sources of materials to reduce the energy consumption for transport and assessing which commonly used material can be substituted for renewable materials, materials with lower embodied energy or materials the can be adapted for multiple uses. 2b Construction Phase The construction phase allows for reuse or recycling of construction materials. The selections of materials in this phase can determines how durable a building is, durable buildings require less maintenance during the post-construction phase. The selection of material can reduce the energy consumption during the post-construction phase. 2c Post-Construction Phase The post-construction phase occurs after the project has been completed. In this phase waste and unused construction materials can be dismantled and recycled. This phase is heavily reliant on which construction materials were decided in the previous phases. If biodegraded materials were chosen for the project during the previous phases these materials will create less strain on landfills. Reducing waste through use recyclable or reusable material reduces the energy consumed when transporting the waste materials to landfills. Recommendations Using new design techniques such as green roofing – grass, bushes and other foliage on a roof, stormwater will be absorbed into the soil making it more manageable than a bare roof – will improve energy efficiency and require less maintenance. Commonly used construction materials such as steel, concrete, aluminium, plastics, paper and cardboard, untreated timber, topsoil and unused paint and paint cans (BRANZ, 2019) can be reuse or recycled. Replace commonly used material with more effective renewable materials. These materials when use correctly will improve energy efficiency while costing less and will produce less waste at the end of its life cycle by being more biodegradable or be useful by being recycled or reused.

From simple essay plans, through to full dissertations, you can guarantee we have a service perfectly matched to your needs. A new development is construction 3D printing. Construction 3D printing aims to reduce the amount of raw materials used during construction through more efficient designs. Construction 3D printing can also reduce the energy costs of transportation (Li & Qi, 2017). A combination of construction 3D printing and using modular construction methods can drastic reduced the energy consumed during transportation and minimise the amount of raw materials used. Conclusion This report concludes that the most effective way to achieve and to a reduction in construction waste is to rely more on sustainable materials and to incorporate more efficient building design ideas. A focus on sustainable materials and the use of efficient building designs will provide substantial environmental as well as cost benefits. The cost and availability of sustainable materials remains a challenge in the present. Banchor, A. (2015, February 23).

Because it is UNCORRECTED material, please consider the following text as a useful but insufficient proxy for the authoritative book pages. 1 Sustainability has been defined in numerous ways and applied in numerous contexts, but it has consistently represented the nexus of environmental stewardship, economic development, and social responsibility. The airport industry has built on these three components and integrated a fourth to define sustainability as the combined emphasis on economic vitality, operational efficiency, natural resources, and social responsibility (sometimes known as EONS). Within these frameworks, some airports have developed customized sustainability definitions that reflect their own values and objectives. Embrac- ing a sustainability approach impacts all aspects of airport operations, and oftentimes, a capacity-enhancing project provides an important opportunity to maximize the benefits of sustainability and engage stakeholders in visible and meaningful ways. As sustainability is a broad concept, and capacity-enhancing projects can take several different forms, the ways in which the two interact vary from one project to another. For instance, economic development can be demonstrated through job creation from an airport enhancement project such as a new terminal. Operational efficiency can be demonstrated by streamlining systems to obtain higher throughput of aircraft and passengers. Natural resource preservation can be demonstrated through efficient waste management and reuse of con- struction waste on a new runway project. Social responsibility can be demonstrated through clear, defined, and committed collaboration with community members on proposed airport development projects or facility improvements that provide local jobs, training, and business contracts. While sustainability and capacity enhancements interrelate in different ways, it is important to discern the value of incorporating sustainability into projects and to ensure that airport staff have the guidance necessary to be successful in these endeavors. The objective of this synthesis report is to compile information and examples that successfully demonstrate the value of building sustainability concepts into capacity- enhancing projects, and describe further resources and tools that provide guidance on how to select, apply, and communicate sustainability measures. The intended audience is air- port leaders and their teams working on capacity-enhancing projects. In particular, airport decision-makers seeking further understanding of the value of including sustainability are encouraged to review the report. A common thread throughout the report is an emphasis on the unique ways airport staff worked to embed sustainability concepts or measures into the project, and ensured that communication with core stakeholders led to the projectâs success. Additionally, the report provides examples of sustainability efforts building on themselves; lessons learned from one initiative are carried through to the next, and this progressive learning process can enhance sustainabilityâs role in capacity-enhancing projects over time. Personnel from seven commercial service airports were interviewed (a) to learn how they integrate sustainability with capacity-enhancing projects, (b) to identify the resulting S U M M A R Y Sustainabilityâs Role in Enhancing Airport Capacity 2 Sustainabilityâs Role in Enhancing Airport Capacity benefits, and (c) to understand how they communicate their sustainability efforts. Through the interviews, the Research Team sought to capture the story of how and why sustainabil- ity was incorporated into the projects and glean insights into the role sustainability played in garnering stakeholder support for the projects. The featured projects showcase diverse strategies used to address capacity needs. The information from the interviews was supple- mented with existing literature on the role of sustainability in capacity-enhancing projects, and methods to successfully engage airport stakeholders. This report captures findings from the research related to sustainability benefits, effec- tive strategies and practices for integrating sustainability concepts into airport projects, and research observations that were validated through the literature search. The projects fea- tured in this report illustrate some of the sustainability benefits resulting from capacity- enhancing projects. The potential benefits vary from project to project. Cost savings was identified as a key benefit of integrating sustainability efforts during capacity-enhancing projects. Savings can result from reduced operating cost, increased employee retention and productivity, reduced operations and maintenance costs, increased reuse or conservation of resources, and avoided environmental mitigation costs. Additional benefits include an enhanced reputation, regulatory cooperation, lower emissions, waste reduction, increased revenue flows, increased operational efficiency, and enhanced connectivity with stakeholders. The interviews and literature search revealed effective strategies and practices for integrating sustainability concepts into airport projects. Framing sustainability as a mechanism to make smarter business decisions and to mitigate risk can help garner the attention of executives and decision-makers. Involving a broad representa- tion of airport departments in the early stages of project planning can mitigate future delays with project development and imple- mentation. Establishing community liaisons, drawn from each air- port department and appointed by their peers to coordinate and facilitate community involvement, can help anticipate and manage stakeholder conflicts (Amaeshi and Crane 2006). Adopting a âgood neighborâ strategy can avoid community opposition to projects by addressing major issues of concern, to the extent possible, while still meeting commercial objectives. In addition to minimizing adverse effects, it is also important for airports to maximize the social and economic benefits of continuing growth and target efforts in communities with the greatest need or communities most affected by airport operations (Upham et al. 2003). Additionally, utilizing tools such as checklists or matrices facilitates the effective application of sustainability practices. The interviews revealed many research observations that were validated through the literature search. When growth outpaces capacity, airports staff can face dissatisfied customers as a result of issues such as congestion and delays. Airport development to accommodate forecasted growth can lead to new challenges such as environmental impacts or lack of com- munity buy-in. However, enhancing capacity can have positive community impacts such as providing job opportunities, fast and secure intermodal transportation, and increased tour- ism (Koc and Durmaz 2015). A culture of sustainabilityâin conjunction with robust sus- tainability policiesâleads to successful integration of sustainability within capacity-enhancing projects and airport business practices. Sustainability is supported by incorporating multiple perspectives and establishing the communityâs stake in the airportâs development. While sometimes accompanied with a higher upfront cost, incorporating sustainability can save the airport money from a life-cycle cost perspective. Sustainability encourages innovation and can be used to frame solutions to complex problems. There are several viable approaches, but ultimately no all-encompassing model or tool kit for effective stakeholder participation Framing sustainability as a mechanism to make smarter business decisions and to mitigate risk can help garner the attention of executives and decision-makers. Summary 3 existsâit depends on a variety of place-specific social, economic, and environmental criteria (Thomas and Lever 2003). The Research Team developed a draft, preliminary sustainability checklist as a precursor to a comprehensive checklist for airport staff to use in the context of capacity-enhancing projects (see Appendix A). In addition, existing resources and tools have been compiled into a convenient table to guide airport personnel seeking to integrate sustainability concepts within capacity-enhancing projects (see Appendix B). The list of interviewees and the inter- view questions appear in Appendices C and D, respectively. Appendix E is an executive-level PowerPoint presentation that conveys the âwhyâ behind incorporating sustainability into capacity-enhancing projects. Appendix E can be found on the TRB website (www.trb.org) by searching for âACRP Synthesis 93.â Finally, the interviews and literature search revealed knowledge gaps in areas that war- rant further research. Future research efforts could include revisiting a prototype airport sustainability rating system developed previously; creating a user-friendly, comprehensive sustainability checklist; or developing a sustainability benefit-cost framework. Research on identifying, quantifying, and conveying economic, social, and operational efficiency value could also be beneficial. Additional research could include surveying and interviewing com- munity stakeholders or airline representatives on how their perceptions of an airport have evolved as it embraced sustainability, or conducting an analysis of airport sustainability initiatives comparing the impacts of a âbusiness as usualâ scenario with the net impacts of the initiatives. Further research could also include interviewing current or former airport leaders about how they successfully implemented a sustainability approach.

In economics, the (; sometimes ) occurs when or government policy increases the with which a is used (reducing the amount necessary for any one use), but the rate of of that resource rises due to increasing . The Jevons paradox is perhaps the most widely known paradox in . However, governments and generally assume that efficiency gains will lower , ignoring the possibility of the paradox arising. In 1865, the English economist observed that technological improvements that increased the efficiency of coal-use led to the increased consumption of coal in a wide range of industries. He argued that, contrary to common intuition, technological progress could not be relied upon to reduce fuel consumption. The issue has been re-examined by modern economists studying consumption from improved . In addition to reducing the amount needed for a given use, improved efficiency also lowers the relative cost of using a resource, which increases the quantity demanded. This counteracts (to some extent) the reduction in use from improved efficiency. Additionally, improved efficiency increases real incomes and accelerates , further increasing the demand for resources. The Jevons paradox occurs when the effect from increased demand predominates, and improved efficiency increases the speed at which resources are used. Considerable debate exists about the size of the rebound in energy efficiency and the relevance of the Jevons paradox to . Some dismiss the paradox, while others worry that it may be self-defeating to pursue by increasing energy efficiency. Some environmental economists have proposed that efficiency gains be coupled with conservation policies that keep the cost of use the same (or higher) to avoid the Jevons paradox. Conservation policies that increase cost of use (such as or ) can be used to control the rebound effect. , after whom the paradox is named The Jevons paradox was first described by the English economist in his 1865 book . Jevons observed that 's consumption of soared after introduced the , which greatly improved the efficiency of the coal-fired from 's earlier design. Watt's innovations made coal a more cost-effective power source, leading to the increased use of the steam engine in a wide range of industries. This in turn increased total coal consumption, even as the amount of coal required for any particular application fell. Jevons argued that improvements in tend to increase (rather than decrease) fuel use, writing: ""It is a confusion of ideas to suppose that the economical use of fuel is equivalent to diminished consumption. The very contrary is the truth."" At that time, many in Britain worried that coal reserves were rapidly dwindling, but some experts opined that improving technology would reduce coal consumption. Jevons argued that this view was incorrect, as further increases in efficiency would tend to increase the use of coal. Hence, improving technology would tend to increase the rate at which England's coal deposits were being depleted, and could not be relied upon to solve the problem. Although Jevons originally focused on the issue of coal, the concept has since been extended to the use of any resource, including, for example, and interpersonal contact. The expansion of following the invention of the has also been cited as an example of the paradox. It is perhaps the most widely known paradox in . : A 20% increase in efficiency causes a 40% increase in travel. Fuel consumption increases and the Jevons paradox occurs. : A 20% increase in efficiency causes a 10% increase in travel. The Jevons paradox does not occur. Economists have observed that consumers tend to travel more when their cars are more fuel efficient, causing a 'rebound' in the for fuel. An increase in the efficiency with which a resource (e.g. fuel) is used, causes a decrease in the of using that resource when measured in terms of what it can achieve (e.g. travel). Generally speaking, a decrease in the cost (or price) of a will increase the quantity demanded (the ). With a lower cost for travel, consumers will travel more, increasing the demand for fuel. This increase in demand is known as the , and it may or may not be large enough to offset the original drop in fuel use from the increased efficiency. The Jevons paradox occurs when the rebound effect is greater than 100%, exceeding the original efficiency gains. The size of the direct rebound effect is dependent on the for the good. In a perfectly competitive market where fuel is the sole input used, if the price of fuel remains constant but efficiency is doubled, the effective price of travel would be halved (twice as much travel can be purchased). If in response, the amount of travel purchased more than doubles (i.e. demand is ), then fuel consumption would increase, and the Jevons paradox would occur. If demand is price inelastic, the amount of travel purchased would less than double, and fuel consumption would decrease. However, goods and services generally use more than one type of input (e.g. fuel, labour, machinery), and other factors besides input cost may also affect price. These factors tend to reduce the rebound effect, making the Jevons paradox less likely to occur. In the 1980s, economists Daniel Khazzoom and Leonard Brookes revisited the Jevons paradox for the case of society's . Brookes, then chief economist at the , argued that attempts to reduce energy consumption by increasing would simply raise demand for energy in the economy as a whole. Khazzoom focused on the narrower point that the potential for rebound was ignored in mandatory performance standards for domestic appliances being set by the . In 1992, the economist Harry Saunders dubbed the hypothesis that improvements in work to increase (rather than decrease) energy consumption the , and argued that the hypothesis is broadly supported by neoclassical (the mainstream economic theory of , and economic growth). Saunders showed that the Khazzoom–Brookes postulate occurs in the under a wide range of assumptions. According to Saunders, increased tends to increase energy consumption by two means. First, increased energy efficiency makes the use of energy relatively cheaper, thus encouraging increased use (the direct rebound effect). Second, increased energy efficiency increases real incomes and leads to increased economic growth, which pulls up energy use for the whole economy. At the level (looking at an individual market), even with the rebound effect, improvements in energy efficiency usually result in reduced energy consumption. That is, the rebound effect is usually less than 100%. However, at the level, more efficient (and hence comparatively cheaper) energy leads to faster economic growth, which increases energy use throughout the economy. Saunders argued that, taking into account both microeconomic and macroeconomic effects, technological progress that improves energy efficiency will tend to increase overall energy use. See also: Steady-state economy § Resource decoupling and the rebound effect Jevons warned that fuel efficiency gains tend to increase fuel use. However, this does not imply that improved fuel efficiency is worthless if the Jevons paradox occurs; higher fuel efficiency enables greater production and a higher material . For example, a more efficient steam engine allowed the cheaper transport of goods and people that contributed to the . Nonetheless, if the Khazzoom–Brookes postulate is correct, increased fuel efficiency, by itself, will not reduce the rate of depletion of . There is considerable debate about whether the Khazzoom-Brookes Postulate is correct, and of the relevance of the Jevons paradox to policy. Most governments, environmentalists and NGOs pursue policies that improve efficiency, holding that these policies will lower resource consumption and reduce environmental problems. Others, including many , doubt this 'efficiency strategy' towards , and worry that efficiency gains may in fact lead to higher production and consumption. They hold that for resource use to fall, efficiency gains should be coupled with other policies that limit resource use. However, other environmental economists point out that, while the Jevons paradox may occur in some situations, the empirical evidence for its widespread applicability is limited. The Jevons paradox is sometimes used to argue that efforts are futile, for example, that more efficient use of oil will lead to increased demand, and will not slow the arrival or the effects of . This argument is usually presented as a reason not to enact environmental policies or pursue fuel efficiency (e.g. if cars are more efficient, it will simply lead to more driving). Several points have been raised against this argument. First, in the context of a mature market such as for oil in developed countries, the direct rebound effect is usually small, and so increased fuel efficiency usually reduces resource use, other conditions remaining constant. Second, even if increased efficiency does not reduce the total amount of fuel used, there remain other benefits associated with improved efficiency. For example, increased fuel efficiency may mitigate the price increases, shortages and disruptions in the global economy associated with peak oil. Third, environmental economists have pointed out that fuel use will unambiguously decrease if increased efficiency is coupled with an intervention (e.g. a ) that keeps the cost of fuel use the same or higher. The Jevons paradox indicates that increased efficiency by itself may not reduce fuel use, and that policy must rely on other types of government interventions as well. As the imposition of conservation standards or other government interventions that increase cost of use do not display the Jevon paradox, they can be used to control the rebound effect. To ensure that efficiency-enhancing technological improvements reduce fuel use, efficiency gains can be paired with government intervention that reduces demand (e.g. , , or higher ). The and have suggested that any cost savings from efficiency gains be ""taxed away or otherwise removed from further economic circulation. Preferably they should be captured for reinvestment in rehabilitation."" By mitigating the economic effects of government interventions designed to promote ecologically sustainable activities, efficiency-improving technological progress may make the imposition of these interventions more palatable, and more likely to be implemented. : increasing road capacity can make traffic congestion worse : faster hardware can trigger the development of less-efficient software : Wirth's law as applied to .

The (IATA) considers it to be one of the key elements to reduce the within the . Aviation biofuel could help medium- and long-haul air travel generating most emissions, and could extend the life of older aircraft types by lowering their carbon footprint. Biofuels are -derived fuels, from plants or waste; depending on which type of biomass is used, they could lower CO₂ emissions by 20–98% compared to . The first test flight using blended biofuel was in 2008, and in 2011 blended fuels with 50% biofuels were allowed in commercial flights. In 2019, the IATA was aiming for a 2% penetration by 2025. Aviation biofuel can be produced from plant sources like , , , waste oils, , and (bio-SPK); from solid using processed with a (FT-SPK); with an -to-jet (ATJ) process from waste fermentation; or from through a . Small piston engines can be modified to burn . do not compete with , prime , or fresh water. Sustainable aviation fuel are certified as being by a third-party organisation. Further information: and Plants absorb as they grow, meaning plant-based biofuels emit only the same amount of as previously absorbed. Biofuel production, processing and transport however emit greenhouse gases, reducing the emissions savings. Biofuels with most emission savings are those derived from photosynthetic algae (98% savings, technology not yet mature) and from (91-95% savings). , a non-food oil used as a biofuel should lower CO₂ emissions by 50–80% compared to Jet-A1. Jatropha, used for , can thrive on where most cultures would produce low . A by the Yale School of Forestry on , one source of potential biofuels, estimated that using it could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 85% if former agro-pastoral land is used, or increase emissions by up to 60% if natural woodland is converted to use. cultivation is constrained by scarce land resources and its expansion to forestland cause and , and direct and indirect emissions due to . 's renewable products includes a refining of food-grade palm oil, and the oily waste from the palm oil mill’s . Neste’s sustainable aviation fuel is used by . NASA has determined that 50% aviation biofuel mixture can cut caused by air traffic by 50–70%. Biofuels do not contain sulfur compounds and thus do not emit . The first flight using blended took place in 2008. flew the first flight by a commercial airline to be powered partly by biofuel, while commercial biofuel flights were likely to use feedstocks such as . By then, airlines representing more than 15% of the industry formed the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Users Group, with support from NGOs such as and . They pledged to develop for aviation. That year, Boeing was co-chair of the , joined by air carriers and biofuel technology developer (Honeywell). In 2009, the IATA committed to achieve growth by 2020, and to halve carbon emissions by 2050. In 2010, Boeing targeted of 1% of global aviation fuels by 2015. US Marine Corps test flight using a 50–50 biofuel blend in 2011 By June 2011, the revised Specification for Aviation Turbine Fuel Containing Synthesized Hydrocarbons ( D7566) allowed commercial airlines to blend up to 50% biofuels with conventional jet fuel. The safety and performance of jet fuel used in passenger flights is certified by . Biofuels were approved for commercial use after a multi-year technical review from , and . Since then, some airlines have experimented with using biofuels on commercial flights. In December 2011, the awarded US$7.7 million to eight companies to develop sustainable fuels, especially from , , , and such as , within its and programs. From 2014, planned to turn annually 500,000 tonnes of waste from the that would normally go to into biofuel to be used in the fleet. By 2015, cultivation of and from the algae, , was under research as a possible jet biofuel . By 2016, Thomas Brueck of was forecasting that could provide 3-5% of jetfuel needs by 2050. In Fall 2016, to achieve its emissions reductions goals, the ICAO planned multiple measures including the development and deployment of sustainable aviation fuels. Dozens of companies received hundreds of millions in from 2005 to 2012 to extract fuel oil from algae, some promising competitively priced fuel by 2012 and a production of 1 billion US gal (3.8 million m) by 2012-2014. By 2017, nor were achieved and most companies had disappeared or changed their to focus on supplements, , additives, , and speciality oils. In 2019, the (IATA) supports the adoption of Sustainable Aviation fuel, aiming in 2019 for a 2% penetration by 2025: 7 million m (1.8 billion US gal). By then, more than 150,000 flights have used biofuels and five airports have regular biofuel distribution: , , , and , with others offering occasional supply. In 2019, purchased up to 10 million US gallons (38,000 m) of SAF from over two years. That year, had fueled more than 700 flights and flown more than one million kilometers, domestic and international, using 's alcohol-to-jet fuel. Gevo is committed to going after the entire gallon of sustainable aviation fuel, potentially leading to a negative carbon footprint. was working to regularly use fuel derived from the waste gases of , with . wanted to convert household with . committed to 900 million US gal (3,400,000 m) of sustainable aviation fuel for 10 years from (to be compared to its 4.1 billion US gal (16,000,000 m) fuel consumption in 2018), after its $30 million investment in 2015, and will develop up to five biofuel factories near its hubs. From 2020, will start using a 50/50 blend of ’s biofuel on its Los Angeles-Australia flights, also providing fuel derived from non-food plant oils to during 10 years. At its sites in , and , Finland's is expecting to improve its renewable fuel production capacity from 2.7 to 3.0 million t (6.0 to 6.6 billion lb) a year by 2020, and is increasing its Singapore capacity by 1.3 million t (2.9 billion lb) to reach 4.5 million t (9.9 billion lb) in 2022 by investing €1.4 billion ($1.6 billion). By 2020, had invested $400 million to convert waste into sustainable aviation fuel with . is a mixture of a large number of different . The range of their sizes ( or carbon numbers) is restricted by the requirements for the product, for example, or . Jet fuels are sometimes classified as or -type. Kerosene-type fuels include Jet A, Jet A-1, JP-5 and JP-8. Naphtha-type jet fuels, sometimes referred to as ""wide-cut"" jet fuel, include Jet B and JP-4. ""Drop-in"" biofuels are biofuels that are completely interchangeable with conventional fuels. Deriving ""drop-in"" jet fuel from bio-based sources is approved via two routes. ASTM has also found it safe to blend in 50% SPK into regular jet fuels. Only tests have been done so far with blending in synthetic paraffinic kerosene (SPK) in considerably higher concentrations. This section . Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosine (HEFA-SPK) is a specific type of hydrotreated used in aviation. As of 2020 this is the only . HEFA-SPK fuel is considered as leading alternative replacements for conventional jet fuel by the because of its sustainability. HEFA-SPK was approved by for use in 2011. HEFA-SPK is produced by the and hydroprocessing of the of , , and . This route involves using oil which is extracted from plant sources like , , , other waste oils, and to produce bio derived synthetic paraffinic kerosene (bio-SPK) by cracking and . The growing of algae to make jet fuel is a promising but still . Companies working on algae jet fuel are , Honeywell UOP, Solena, , , and . Universities working on algae jet fuel are and Major investors for algae based SPK research are , /, , , , and . The second route involves processing solid using to produce or to produce a which is then processed into FT SPK ( Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene). Research is also being done on the alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) pathway where alcohols such as or are de-oxygenated and processed into jet fuels. Some companies such as LanzaTech have already managed to create ATJ-SPK from CO2 in . The ethanol is hereby produced from CO in the flue gases using microbes ( autoethanogenum to be exact). LanzaTech has successfully demonstrated its technology at Pilot scale in NZ –using Industrial waste gases from the steel industry as a feedstock for its microbial fermentation. Routes that use to directly create hydro-carbons are being researched. Also, the production of Fischer-Tropsch hydro-carbon fuels (i.e. FT-SPK, referred to as ""solar kerosine"" by the project) through the use of a is being researched by the SUN-TO-LIQUID project. Small piston engines can be modified to burn as a fuel. , a biofuel alternative to under development, was approved as a test fuel by in December 2009, aiming for a comparably priced, environmentally friendlier and more fuel-efficient general aviation fuel. -based rubber materials expand in the presence of aromatic compounds found in conventional petroleum fuel. Pure biofuels that aren't mixed with petroleum and don't contain paraffin-based additives may cause rubber seals and hoses to shrink. Manufacturers are starting to use synthetic rubber substitutes which are not adversely affected by biofuels, such as , for seals and hoses. The has found harmful bacteria and fungi in their biofueled aircraft, and use to disinfect them. The forecast SAF production should grow from 18 to 75 billion litres between 2025 and 2040, representing a share of aviation fuel getting from 5% to 19%. By 2019, fossil jet fuel production cost was $0.3-0.6 per L given a $50–100 crude , while aviation biofuel production cost was $0.7-1.6, needing a $110–260 crude oil barrel to . As of 2020 aviation biofuel is more expensive than fossil jet kerosene, considering at that time. was the first international airport to offer Sustainable aviation fuel as part of the fuel mix since 2016 do not compete with , prime or fresh water. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) are certified as being by a third-party like the . The sustainable aviation fuels certification and production pace seems insufficient to meet the target of halving the CO₂ emissions by 2050. A SAF sustainability certification verifies that the fuel product, mainly focussing on the biomass feedstock, has met criteria focussed around long-term global environmental, social and economic """" sustainability considerations. Under many carbon emission regulation schemes, such as the , a certified SAF product may be granted an exemption from an associated carbon compliance liability cost.  This marginally improves the economic competitiveness of environmentally favourable SAF over traditional fossil-based jet fuel. However, in the near term there are several commercialisation and regulatory hurdles that are yet to be overcome through the collaboration of a variety of stakeholders for SAF products to meet price parity with traditional jet fuel and to enable widespread uptake. The first reputable body to launch a sustainable biofuel certification system applicable to SAF was the academic European-based Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB) NGO. This multi-stakeholder organization set a global benchmark standard on which the sustainability integrity of advanced aviation biofuel types seeking to use the claim of being a Sustainable Aviation Fuel can be judged. Leading airlines in the aviation industry and other signatories to the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Users Group (SAFUG) pledge support the RSB as the preferred provider of SAF certification. These airlines believe it important for any proposed aviation biofuels have independently certified long term environmental benefits compared to the status quo in order to ensure their successful uptake and GHG reduction - Greenhouse gas emissions from aviation sustainable fuels must be lower than those from the fossil fuels they replace: at least 50% for production facilities prior to 5 October 2015, a mandatory reduction of 60% for production facilities after that date and 65% for sustainable fuels (SAF) produced in facilities starting operations after 2021. Land use change - Carbon stocks and biodiversity: raw materials for sustainable fuel production cannot be sourced from land with high biodiversity or high carbon stocks (i.e. primary and protected forests, biodiversity-rich grasslands, wetlands and ). Other sustainability issues are set out in the Governance Regulation and may be covered by certification schemes on a voluntary basis. GHG Reduction - Criterion 1: Sustainable alternative fuel for reactors will generate net GHG reductions of at least 10% compared to fossil fuel for reactors, based on the life cycle. Carbon Stock - Criterion 1: Sustainable alternative Fuel will not be produced from biomass obtained from land whose uses changed after 1st January 2008 and which has been from primeval forests, wetlands or peatlands, as all these lands have high carbon stocks. Criterion 2: In the case of a change in land use after 1st January 2008, as defined on the basis of the IPCC land categories, emissions from direct land use change (DLUC) shall be calculated. If the greenhouse gas emissions from a DLUC exceed the default value of the land use change induced (ILUC), the value of the DLUC will replace the default value of the ILUC. Sustainable Aviation Fuel development in Europe. As and other carbon compliance regimes are emerging globally, certain biofuels are likely to be exempted (""zero rated"") by governments from having an associated carbon compliance liability due to their closed-emissions-loop renewable nature, if they can also prove their wider sustainability credentials. For example, in the it has been proposed by SAFUG that only aviation biofuels that have been certified as sustainable by the RSB or similar bodies would be zero rated. This proposal has been accepted. SAFUG was formed by a group of interested airlines in 2008 under the auspices of and in cooperation with support from NGOs such as . Member airlines represent more than 15% of the industry, and all member CEOs have signed a pledge to work on the development and use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel. In addition to SAF certification, the integrity of aviation biofuel producers and their product can be assessed by further means, such as by using 's Carbon War Room, or the Renewable Jet Fuels initiative. The latter currently cooperates with companies such as LanzaTech, SG Biofuels, AltAir, Solazyme, and Sapphire. A leading independent NGO focused on this issue is the Sustainable Sky Institute.

a918b41a-bef5-48e2-9168-876959c08ded,"Weight loss Diet and Tea: Lovely stuff... - Weight Loss & Obe... Lovely stuff to: Over the last 8 years i have spends a lot to try and get rid of the excess weight. I have been successful with diet, exercise and all sorts of pills. But within 4 months after this programs the weight is back and i have to begin from square one. Its had been a frustrating roller coaster and i considered liposuction but i kept putting it off because i knew i can loose weight, i had done it before. In April of this year i decided to begin an extreme diet plan. I went from 195lbs to 145lbs in 4 months and i have ever since maintained this weight for the longest time in 8 years. All this thanks to two unbeatable products. I am excited about 2016... This year i archived success with 2 great products. 1- iasotea from a great product that i still use to date because of its dual benefits. Please note i am just sharing to help other people out there. I wish you all a happy new year. I will give you more information on my journey to weight loss and exciting products i have used those that worked and those that did not. From Garcinia Cambogia, to Hoodia, and a lot more. Sorry, just don't buy 'miracle cures' that offer the solutions to life's problems via herbal supplements (raspberry ketones anyone?) etc. Unless you can furnish double blind, randomised trials - the gold standard of research - then your particular circumstance and results are merely N=1, anecdotal and offer nothing more than false hope. What you are presenting is the easy road to health and there is no such pathway. I can't deny what you are saying, but is very easy to generalize and i can't blame anyone for doing so. There are thousands of people and products taking advantage of others and selling them products that work. What i shared was my personal experience and it might work for others or i might not. But the truth remains you will never know till you try. Weight ultimately is a topic of calorie input vs calorie burned. But most people have been through all that and still did not loose weight. People have to understand that there is more to it than just calories, There are hormones, there is your immune system, there are parasites. For me, if something does not harm you and it can keep the weight off, do what you have to do. The consequences of obesity ( Strokes, Heart attacks, Hypertension, Diabetes are not funny). The cost of medications to treat all this are not funny. Diet and exercise is your best bet. But again these 2 things are a good kick starter that may help you boost your moral by loosing the initial pounds. Read about them. Take my words with a grain of salt, but what ever you have to do, prevention is the best form of health, keep the extra fat away. iaso tea, Nutriburst, resolution drops and the 3 week diet You sound just like me, up and down,getting heavier or lighter.I have just about tried it all,decided on one pound a week for a year,lost 3 stone,gave up smoking and put on 2 .7 pounds. What worked for me not buying anything like cake ect, if I wanted it I had to go and get it.I ate 5 times a day,I find this difficult,but about every 3/4 hours I ate something,even breakfast,i invented low cal dishes, never bought a joint,except chicken, If I wanted a sweet I bought kids sweets the smallest packet I could get,or shared something with my husband. Yes he went from a 42 waist to a 36,yes some has gone back on. My saving grace was french fries from Aldi 15 grms 65 cals,eaten at 3.30 ish,My evening treat was sugar free jelly mixed with a low fat yogurt,about 50 cals,looks like a moose,and quite sweet.About 8 ish. Breakfast was 2 weetabix,water splash of milk,lunch was home made soup or salad,around 200 cals,Dinner was loads of veg in some form or other,with meat or fish at 200 cals,total always about 400 cals. During that time I used MY PLATE,it is free,you input what you have eaten ,this then tells you you total cals, fat,colestrol,fibre,protein sugar carbs,a brilliant tool. I learnt that mashed cauliflower tastes like potatoes,blind tested the family they never knew,it was only cauliflower,The HARDEST thing was making myself eat,every 3 to 4 hours,this worked, but was very very hard for me to do.I tend to make the same mistake go far to long without eating. Yes I can do it,but I suspect most of us repeat the pattern,up and down,well i do, I look foward to you tips,will have a look at tea.In many years of trying,I have found calories being counted work,eat often small amounts,fool the body and eat out about once a fortnight,but be realistic in reducing cals b4 and after going out for a meal. INCLUDED LOTS OF VEGGIES, A WELL BALANCED PROTEIN DIET... Need a weight loss buddy for Atkins & P90x in Bangalore Like the title of the post says, need a weight loss buddy who is interested in following... Please advise efficient way of weight loss.

Because it is UNCORRECTED material, please consider the following text as a useful but insufficient proxy for the authoritative book pages. 26 chapter six Case examples To supplement the results obtained through the web-based survey, interviews with personnel from a dozen airports were conducted during the summer of 2014, with each interview lasting at least an hour. The airport personnel were extremely generous with their time and knowledge, giving deeper insights into the drivers, aids, and barriers encountered when designing and implementing sustainability initiatives and programs at smaller airports. The airports that granted interviews are listed in Table 4, and the interviews are summarized in the case examples presented. All of the case examples followed a similar format, providing information in each of the following categories: spe- cial circumstances, drivers, definition of sustainability, airport sustainability planning, aids/barriers to implementation, major focus areas and sample initiatives, and lessons learned and sage advice. In each case, additional information was provided with respect to a particular topic, called the case example focus; those topics are noted in Table 4. Case example 1: BUFFalO NIaGaRa INTeRNaTIONal aIRpORT aND NIaGaRa Falls INTeRNaTIONal aIRpORT, NeW YORK special Circumstances The Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority (NFTA), which is a public benefit corporation, owns Buffalo Niagara Inter- national Airport (BUF), Niagara Falls International Airport (IAG), and all public busing and light rail rapid transit in Buffalo. Having one entity control both air and surface trans- portation provides synergies in planning, funding, and imple- mentation. IAG is owned jointly by NFTA and the United States Air Force Reserve. Drivers NFTA is beginning a systemwide sustainability program and will draw on the experience of BUF and IAG. Definition of sustainability Sustainability projects and programs have to be practical while addressing economic, social, and environmental issues. airport sustainability planning Both airports had sustainability master plans and wanted to update them through the mechanism of overall master plans. The master plan for BUF was completed in 2013, and the IAG master plan is set for completion by the end of 2015. Master plan projects will be established under the 5-year capital improvement plan (CIP), and sustainability will be integrated at both airports on a project- by-project basis within the 5-year CIP. Every new project will weigh sustainability and National Environmental Policy Act impacts, and airport sustainability projects will be folded into the NFTA umbrella sustainability plan. The BUF plan was funded by a combination of FAA entitlement funds, 27 New York State Department of Transportation, and NFTA allocation of PFCs. The IAG plan was funded by local (NFTA/PFCs and Bridge Commission) monies, the Empire State Development, New York State Department of Transportation support, and a small portion of FAA AIP funds. Neither BUF nor IAG participated in FAA pilot sustainability programs. aids/Barriers to Implementation AidsâAccess to federal, state, and local funding. Having an airport planner who is passionate about sustainability. Being part of a larger entity (NFTA) that is implementing sustainability measures. BarriersâHaving bills for energy and water sent to a central office and paid by NFTA staff and not airport staff makes tracking of usage difficult. major Focus areas and sample InitiativesâReducing Carbon Footprint and managing surface Transportation Surface transportation is a major focus area. Initiatives: â¢ Reconfiguration of the circulator load system around BUF by installing an overpass for fly- overs, thus reducing airport traffic and lowering the carbon footprint.

Case example FocusâIdentifying Capital and Diverse Funding sources BUF and IAG provide good examples of how airports can be creative in finding funding for sus- tainability programs. At IAG, development of the master plan, including the consulting contract, cost approximately $1.5 million and was funded by a combination of the Empire State Development (which covered the bulk of the cost), FAA AIP, and the local bridge commission. However, the Empire State Development pays only upon completion of a project, so the airport self-funded nearly a million dollars and then sought reimbursement. The FAA provided additional funds for administrative pur- poses. The BUF master plan was funded through a different allocation: 75% of the funds were from AIP, 12.5% from Empire State Development, and 12.5% were sourced locally and through NFTA. Case example 2: DeeR ValleY aIRpORT aND GOODYeaR aIRpORT, aRIZONa special Circumstances Goodyear (GYR) and Deer Valley (DVT) airports are owned and operated by Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport (PHX), which allows the smaller, reliever airports to have access to sustainability experience and dedicated staff resources from PHX. DVT is one of the busiest gen- eral aviation airports in the United States, with more than 350,000 aircraft operations a year. GYR has more than 120,000 aircraft operations annually and is the home of the Lufthansa Flight Training Center and an aircraft main- tenance, repair, and overhaul facility. Drivers The city of Phoenix adopted requirements that all new build- ings use LEED standards and has goals of a 20% energy reduction for the period 2009 to 2020; a reduction of 15% by 2015 of the 2005 levels of greenhouse gas emissions; and a 50% waste stream diversion by 2020. Definition of sustainability The city of Phoenix Aviation Department is committed to incorporating sustainability principles and practices into our operational, management, and administrative processes. Our vision is to have an informed workforce and engaged business partners that deliver a well-planned, accessible, and world class airport experience for our customers. Further, we demonstrate our environmental responsibility to our community as we strive to enhance local, regional, and national economic benefits from the Phoenix airports. 29 airport sustainability planning Sustainability planning at PHX and its airports began as part of the strategic plan, which lists sus- tainability as one pillar for its vision. Recently, Phoenix airports have been developing a self-funded sustainability management plan. aids/Barriers to Implementation AidsâStaff involvement and training. City requirements for LEED certification for buildings and energy conservation. BarriersâMoney. Staff time. Entrenched practices. Tendency for resources to go to larger airport (PHX). major Focus areas and sample InitiativesâRecycling and Resource Conservation Initiatives: â¢ Extensive use of recycled asphalt for new pavement projects. â¢ Installation of LED lights. â¢ Expansion of recycling program. â¢ Energy and water conservation. â¢ Storm water management, including a quarterly newsletter for most effective management practices and tenant communication. â¢ Tracking of costs (including tipping fees) and savings from recycling programs. lessons learned and sage advice â¢ Get staff and tenants involved to increase ideas and enhance implementation. â¢ To save time, effort, and money, include sustainability planning from the beginning of a project so that facilities, operations, and maintenance are aware and can contribute ideas. â¢ For smaller airports, it is important that sustainability initiatives be easy to implement. â¢ Recycling and energy reduction are low-cost, low-hanging fruit. â¢ Smaller airports can take advantage of resources from the larger airport. â¢ Use experts from consulting firms to help design the sustainability initiatives and plan implementation. â¢ Even if tenants cannot be separately billed for energy use, have discussions with them to raise awareness and consider submetering to track usage. â¢ To gain greater acceptance and involvement for sustainability initiatives, demonstrate the finan- cial savings before, during, and after implementation. Case example Focusâleveraging Resources from a large Hub airport The city of Phoenix Aviation Department uses USGBC LEED standards for building design and construction and in 2010 developed an engineering design and construction guide for nonbuilding âhorizontalâ projects, such as pavements. This Design and Construction Green Guide includes life- cycle cost analysis tools that are used for these projects. Engineering staff at PHX are trained in LEED (six are accredited) and the Design and Construction Green Guide, and therefore they engi- neer the projects at the DVT and GYR reliever airports using these standards. Likewise, maintenance staff from PHX sent to perform work at the two airports are aware of opportunities for energy con- servation. It is important for these subject matter experts to be available and use the same approaches and procedures for the general aviation airports as they do at PHX. During the recent development of the sustainability management plan, the managers of DVT and GYR and their staff were involved during interviews of current initiatives, in the review of tenant 30 interest surveys, and in discussions of ânext stepsâ for their current sustainability programs. This collaboration clearly brought into focus that the staff and users at DVT and GYR are ready for more robust sustainability programs at their airports. Case example 3: HUNTINGTON TRI-sTaTe aIRpORT, WesT VIRGINIa special Circumstances The airport staff and police and fire departments share the same facilities at Huntington Tri-State Airport (HTS). Alto- gether, the three services employ 64 peopleâ26 full-time and 38 part-time staff. Drivers The airport director believed that a sustainability program would encourage the airport to be a proper steward of the planet, the community, and the airport. Definition of sustainability Sustainability is about people, the environment, and economic viability. The Sustainability Master Plan (SMP) will safeguard the publicâs investment in the airport and allow the airport to focus on cutting costs and not just on boosting revenue. airport sustainability planning Although discussions and ad hoc sustainability initiatives inspired by research and periodicals began in 2011, the sustainability program was started formally in 2013 with the receipt of AIP and state funding. Ad hoc initiatives included an energy assessment and policies on paper use and paper and waste recycling. By contrast, the SMP provides a more comprehensive, organized strategy. The SMP follows and is the companion document to the airport master plan, both of which have 20-year goals and objectives. SMP focus areas include social process, natural resources, carbon footprint, energy efficiency, operating costs, passenger experience, and the local and regional economies. aids/Barriers to Implementation AidsâFAA AIP funding for 90% of the sustainability program and state funding for the remain- ing 10%, which paid for both the energy assessment and design of the SMP. The advisory task force, which was composed of the local universities, city and county officials, and all airport tenants; the task force contributed ideas and generated buy-in from stakeholders. BarriersâCultural resistance to changing habits regarding energy use, recycling, and other activ- ities with environmental impacts. major Focus areas and sample InitiativesâResource Conservation and stakeholder Involvement Major focus areas: energy, waste management, air quality, green construction, and community connections. Initiatives: â¢ Energy assessment. â¢ No smoking policy. 31 â¢ Storm water pollution prevention. â¢ Wildlife management. â¢ Paper and waste recycling plan (considering aluminum recycling). â¢ Signs regarding recycling (considering signs and motion sensors for lights). â¢ Spill prevention and clean-up plan. â¢ Instant rewards to employees in the form of $25 gift cards. â¢ Paperless board meetings. â¢ Tenant outreach regarding energy conservation and programs such as the fuel-recycling program. â¢ LED lighting in taxiways. â¢ Recycling asphalt from taxiways to use in other projects. â¢ Energy efficient backup generator for lighting. â¢ Stream restoration and tree planting after runway extension project. â¢ Plan to feature sustainability initiatives on website. lessons learned and sage advice â¢ As a first step, involve the stakeholders to inform them about the goals, generate ideas, and increase their personal investment. â¢ Look at which projects make sense culturally and financially, and then seek funding. â¢ Sustainability initiatives have an added benefit of reducing operational costs, and many green initiatives can be implemented at no additional cost. â¢ Ultimately, everyone has a responsibility to sustain people, planet, and prosperity and to enhance the well-being of employees and the community. Case example FocusâBuilding Comprehesive program from ad Hoc Roots HTS is a good example of a smaller airport that first approached sustainability through ad hoc proj- ects. Information gained through various sources and periodicals, including ACRP studies, served as a guide for initial activities. However, the limitations of that approach soon became apparent, so the airport sought and received FAA AIP funding, which allowed HTS to retain a consultant to design a more thorough and comprehensive program. The sustainability program benefits greatly from having an SMP with written goals, objectives, and milestones, and the SMP would not have been possible without external funding. Having consultants involved in the preparation of the SMP was viewed as being extremely helpful, since their expertise in sustainability programs allowed for easier iden- tification of projects that needed to be accomplished. For example, the energy efficiency projects at HTS would not have been as robust without input from the consultants. According to HTS, the only detriment to having an SMP would be if the plan is completed and then sits on the shelf because tax money and employee time would then have been wasted. Case example 4: ITHaCa TOmpKINs ReGIONal aIRpORT, NeW YORK special Circumstances The Ithaca Tompkins Regional Airport (ITH) building houses airport administration, maintenance, and a fire station. ITH is in a community with a prestigious college and university. Drivers The airport director was inspired by environmental initia- tives of European airports and asked that sustainability proj- ects be included in the master plan that was being developed. 32 Definition of sustainability Actions should not affect the ability of future generations to do what they want to do. airport sustainability planning The airportâs sustainability activities began in 2008, making ITH attractive to serve as a precursor airport for FAAâs pilot program in sustainability. The airport has adopted a sustainable airport master plan that incorporated sustainability initiatives. The implementation occurs in three phases from 2010 through 2030. Sustainability is now considered in every airport project and in daily operations. aids/Barriers to Implementation AidsâEarly FAA AIP funding for the sustainability plan. County support for sustainability initiatives. Ideas contributed by students at Ithaca College and Cornell and by the community. major Focus areas and sample InitiativesâResource Conservation and Recycling Major focus areas: buildings and facilities, air quality, climate change, energy, materials, surface trans- portation, water, land use, natural resources, noise, community, design, and construction. Initiatives: â¢ Removed a dozen trees to extend a parking lot and planted 50 more around the airport. â¢ Replaced main section of terminal roof and used shingles made of recycled materials that will last 50 years. â¢ Renovated and expanded administrative building, installing windows, reusing bricks from old section and putting high polish on concrete floors to avoid plastics and carpet. lessons learned and sage advice â¢ Gaining the support of the local community and the governing legislative body is crucial, so invest time in educating the applicable stakeholders about why sustainability is important. â¢ Make presentations to the local Chamber of Commerce and Rotary Club, and display posters in the airport departures lounge to educate passengers and tenants. â¢ Involve the employees to get their buy-in and cooperation. â¢ Make sure that initiatives make financial sense, but avoid dismissing a sustainable alternative simply because the up-front costs may appear a little higher. Case example FocusâHarnessing the power of a sustainability Champion The history of sustainability at ITH illustrates how an idea can start with one person and then take on momentum as more people get involved. Bob Nicholas, the long-time airport director who recently retired, hails from the United Kingdom and wanted to adopt more environmentally friendly practices at ITH. An additional goal was to address the airportâs contribution toward global warming. Bob asked that sustainability be incorporated into the master plan that was being developed, and the consultant suggested that sustainability be treated as a separate component of the plan. Because incorporating sustainability initiatives requires higher initial expenditures, approval of the county legislature was necessary. FAA approval of the concept also had to be obtained because ITH also sought AIP fund- ing. ITH and its consultants scheduled a meeting with FAAâs head of aviation planning at ACI-NA offices in Washington, D.C. When the meeting commenced, FAA announced that it had already embraced support of sustainability and presented its plan to do a pilot project of ten airports. ITH asked to go first because it wanted to set an example for the airport industry in the United States. Because the project was new, a lot of time was required for the early stages. Local academic institu- tions Ithaca College and Cornell University were invited to participate, and both the students and the local community contributed ideas on projects to do at the airport. ITH received the Airports Going Green award in Chicago and several other local awards, and the county legislature was delighted with the local and national exposure. 33 Case example 5: KeNT sTaTe UNIVeRsITY aIRpORT, OHIO special Circumstances Kent State University Airport (1G3) is a general aviation air- port owned by Kent State University. From 85% to 90% of its operations support flight training, and the airport is finan- cially self-sufficient. 1G3 will become ENT/KENT as soon as it implements the Automated Weather Observing System (AWOS). Drivers Bolstered by increased environmental awareness among the student body, the university developed a vision for a sus- tainable future and retained a sustainability manager who is available to the airport. The primary driver for the sustain- ability program is reducing costs through energy efficiency, renewable energy, waste reduction, and increased recycling. Definition of sustainability Kent State University Airport follows the definition of sustainability provided by the Airport Coun- cil InternationalâNorth America as ensuring Economic viability, Operational efficiency, Natural resource conservation, and Social responsibility (EONS). The objective is to balance the benefits and impacts to these elements while identifying synergies among them. In order to achieve this, sustainability will be integrated into each step of the Airport Master Plan. airport sustainability planning The airport is developing a master plan with a sustainability component that is targeted for comple- tion by late 2015. The baseline assessments have been completed, and goals and associated projects have been identified. Facility upgrades and improvements that are included in the master plan will provide opportunities for integrating sustainable designs and practices and developing sustainability elements and measurements. 1G3 is part of the second group of more than 40 airports selected for FAA sustainability program, along with other Ohio-based airports such as Dayton International, Dayton Wright Brothers, and Akron Canton Regional. aids/Barriers to Implementation AidsâAIP funding. A full-time sustainability manager who serves as a resource and focal point. The culture and leadership at the university. High student awareness of environmental issues. Staff availability. BarriersâLimited financial resources to implement initiatives. Airport location in a different county from main university campus. Vocal community aversion to airport noise and traffic. major Focus areas and sample InitiativesâNoise abatement and Resource Conservation Most activities have been ad hoc while awaiting the master plan and its sustainability component. Initiatives: â¢ Active noise abatement program. â¢ Energy-efficient lighting (part of universitywide program). â¢ Storm water monitoring and control. â¢ Recycling program. 34 â¢ Preheating systems for aircraft. â¢ Waste and energy audits. â¢ Aggressive pavement maintenance to lengthen useful life. â¢ Groundwater contamination prevention. lessons learned and sage advice â¢ Having senior leadership buy-in and support is the most critical aspect. â¢ Ad hoc projects can help with initial acceptance of a sustainability program. â¢ Maintain good community relations and be aware of airport noise impacts on the community. â¢ Retain an environmental professional to get an accurate assessment of current conditions and conduct audits for waste and energy. â¢ Weave the sustainability plan and program into the full master plan and airport activities. â¢ Look at all potential revenue streams. 1G3 sells fuel as its primary revenue but also leases unneeded space, provides aircraft washing, runs a bookstore, and collects rent from the college for training. Case example Focusâensuring airport Viability with effective Noise Control The airport operates a flight training school in an urban area, resulting in aircraft noise being gener- ated over the community. Growing the flight-training program provided a financial benefit to the air- port, but it also generated noise and other social impacts, such as increased surface traffic. In response to complaints from the community, some of which demanded closure of the airport, 1G3 initiated an aggressive noise reduction and noise management program. Air traffic routing was changed, as were procedures for takeoff and landing. Enhanced reporting procedures were put into place, and the airport held monthly meetings with the tenants to review every noise complaint. Because of these proactive measures, noise complaints were reduced by 64% during the period 2010 to 2014. Case example 6: NaNTUCKeT memORIal aIRpORT, massaCHUseTTs special Circumstances Nantucket Memorial Airport (ACK) is primarily a general aviation airport serving an island (Nantucket Island). In November 2012, ACK was selected as the pilot airport for the Carbon Neutral Airport Program (CNAP), a project administered by the Massachusetts Department of Transpor- tation and Volpe National Transportation Systems Center, to reduce fossil fuel emissions and greenhouse gas emissions. Drivers Current and projected increases in cost of electricity. Definition of sustainability Efficient and long-term management of resources. airport sustainability planning Drafting of the master plan was nearing completion at the time of the interview. The master plan is funded under the AIP, and the majority of funding for the sustainability initiatives to date came from state programs, utility rebates, and ACK operating revenues. 35 aids/Barriers to Implementation AidsâMunicipality with progressive attitude toward environmental protection and energy use and conservation. Island ethos to recycle materials and compost; island mandate to reduce energy consumption and recycle. Financing for energy efficiency improvements at 0% that is repaid through energy bills. Zero emissions vehicle rebates from state program. State funding for a geothermal system retro-commissioning program, in accordance with National Grid. State rebates for zero emissions vehicles. BarriersâProcedure for obtaining bond financing. Town meetings. Burdensome state purchasing regulations. Lack of climate change awareness. Ineligibility for VALE funding as a result of primarily general aviation operations. major Focus areas and sample Initiativesâenergy Reduction and Biodiversity protection Energy reduction has been a major focus area. Initiatives: â¢ Lighting upgrades. â¢ HVAC repairs. â¢ Solar panels. â¢ Biodiversity protection for indigenous plants, moss, and wildlife. â¢ Donation of an old administration building to a construction company. â¢ Donation of an old FBO to a school. lessons learned and sage advice â¢ Planning needs to be a team effort, so engage stakeholders, especially employees, early and often. â¢ Compare utility and fuel costs against the budget quarterly, preferably on a department basis to facilitate tracking and assign responsibility. â¢ Submeter wherever possible. â¢ Establish a baseline performance level and start tracking energy use. â¢ Conduct an energy audit. â¢ Recognize that information technology equipment requires significant amounts of energy for computers, screens, servers, printers, and fax machines. Case example Focusâpioneering Carbon Neutrality Nantucket Island became connected to the mainland energy supplies only 7 or 8 years ago; until then energy had to be self-generated by the island. Airports use a lot of energy and have a baseline level of consumption that is difficult to reduce. For example, runway and control tower lights are constantly illuminated, and security operations require space, light, and HVAC. ACKâs budget allocates more than $300,000 for energy, which is 72% of the utility budget. In March 2015, a 30% increase in rates is anticipated. The incentives for ACK to address energy costs and consumption are obvious, and the airport has taken several initiatives. It applied for and was accepted as a pilot project for the CNAP. CNAP has a goal of 100% net annual energy neutrality, to be achieved 30% through energy efficiency and 70% through solar energy. CNAP funded an investment grade energy audit (IGA), which revealed specific areas for improvement. For example, the IGA found that the geothermal system in general was not functioning properly. Phase I of the CNAP project has been completed, and the airport will begin building in 2015, with target completion in 2017. Submetering will be installed to track usage in specific departments (oper- ations, maintenance, and buildings) and buildings (the airfield, terminal, and tower). Functions will 36 be also tracked, such as HVAC and lighting. For lighting upgrades, ACK accessed zero-percentage on-bill financing, which permitted the airport to finance energy efficiency measures through the util- ity and repay the loan as part of the utility bill. Solar energy implementation may be financed through a power purchase agreement. A payback analysis suggests that many efficiency initiatives are cost- effective, but the municipality will invest in renewables only if they are cost-effective. Case example 7: NORTHWesT aRKaNsas ReGIONal aIRpORT, aRKaNsas special Circumstances For the Northwest Arkansas Regional Airport (XNA), the cities of Bentonville, Fayetteville, Rogers, Siloam Springs, and Springdale, along with Benton and Washington counties, created the Airport Authority as a separate public entity, one of only two in Arkansas. The airport site is centrally located. close to all the communities of northwest Arkansas. XNA is also far enough away from populated areas to minimize adverse impact from aircraft operations. Drivers The availability of FAA funding was a key driver. In addi- tion, board members and the airport had a strong desire to be a more efficient and sustainable operation. Definition of sustainability The Northwest Arkansas Regional Airport strives to provide an operationally safe and efficient air- port that is financially sound, promotes economic growth in the region, and enhances environmental sustainability and social responsibility. airport sustainability planning The airport will soon complete a sustainable master plan study, with goals of saving money, energy, and time and improving the passenger experience. aids/Barriers to Implementation AidsâFAA AIP funding. Stakeholder involvement, including various airport departments, airlines, FBOs, and tenants. Community involvement, including an advisory group, regional planning processes, and a website for the public. BarriersâStaff time to monitor results and measure benefits and costs. Prior building projects that were completed without sustainability awareness or input. major Focus areas and sample InitiativesâResource Conservation and passenger Comfort Initiatives: â¢ Recycled all the pavement, steel, and copper from the Runway Rehab Project. â¢ Reduced electrical bills by retrofitting the building with more efficient lighting fixtures and removing every other light from Airport Boulevard. â¢ Currently installing low-flush toilets, hands-free soap dispensers and water faucets at the sinks and Dyson hand dryers in all restrooms. 37 â¢ Implemented significant changes in HVAC operation, including use of controlling zones, adjusting temperatures to reflect time of day and occupancy schedules, and optimizing use of the outside air economizer. â¢ Changed set points on boilers and chillers for optimum operating parameters. â¢ Purchased rocking chairs, made with recycled seat belts, for the new concourse addition (people love them!). â¢ Initiated a cart service and a valet service to improve the passenger experience. â¢ Began providing umbrellas with XNA logo that can be used to get to the parking lot and then deposited in drop-off boxes. â¢ Converted old space into a small, publicly available conference room that has a TV and hook- ups for presentations. â¢ Converted old space into a âQuiet Roomâ or âYoga Room,â complete with mats and pillows. â¢ Installed large (10-ft Ã 10-ft) floor chess and checkers games as well as card tables in terminal for passenger use. â¢ Refinanced and combined long-term debt, reducing annual debt service by almost a million dollars a year at a fixed rate through 2027. â¢ Performed a financial analysis to determine the priority of future projects and analyzed methods to fund them; a future parking garage, a 3-mile access road, and pavement replacement are the three major projects that were targeted. â¢ Began protecting endangered fish species by collecting, holding, and then testing rainfall runoff from pavement before releasing the water into the downstream discharge area. lessons learned and sage advice â¢ Small airports have a significant challenge to deliver on the things that larger airports commit to do and must look carefully at the financial payback of sustainability initiatives. â¢ Adopting a sustainability program before major renovations or construction allows for inclu- sion of sustainability concepts from the beginning. â¢ Be wary of optimistic predictions of financial returns and products advertising long lives. Many LED lights are not lasting as long as promised. â¢ Take the time to track results, even though an Excel spreadsheet can be tedious and time- consuming to use and staff availability can be difficult to secure for monitoring and measuring benefits and costs. â¢ Highlight sustainability drivers when applying for FAA grants. â¢ Closely review the payoff of some sustainable implementations when existing equipment is nearing end of life. â¢ When approaching the daily operations, project planning, and financial security, take time to consider projects carefully and analyze how they can be done better. â¢ Find outside resources and lessons learned. â¢ The community of airport personnel is eager to share experiences and results from tests and trials. Use the available knowledge to make your operation more sustainable. Case example FocusâGenerating Clear Objectives and Focus areas The airport formally identified the following objectives to meet the identified vision: â¢ Providing a high standard for safety and customer satisfaction; â¢ Providing a high standard for operational efficiency; â¢ Demonstrating environmental stewardship; â¢ Providing a financially and socially beneficial resource to the community/region; and â¢ Providing positive partnerships with tenants, neighbors, regulators, and other stakeholders. Primary focus areas include airport finance; energy consumption/greenhouse gases; operations and maintenance of airport facilities; waste management/recycling, and construction management. Secondary focus areas include water quality; community relations and education; and natural habitats and air quality. 38 Case example 8: OUTaGamIe COUNTY ReGIONal aIRpORT, WIsCONsIN special Circumstances The Outagamie County Regional Airport (ATW) has 29 build- ings, two runways, and numerous taxiways and paved air- craft aprons. The airport property occupies approximately 1,739 acres of land owned by Outagamie County, much of which is available for future development of new airside and landside facilities. The airport controls 29 acres of land through purchase of aviation easements. It owns an additional 9.7 acres through a runway protection zone easement. ATW has more than 250,000 annual enplanements and hosts a FedEx cargo sorting and handling facility and a wide variety of GA activities. More than 2,400 badged employees work at the airport. Drivers Prompted by rising utility costs and a volatile air service industry, the airport championed sustain- ability initiatives and in 2008 undertook a facilities assessment to reduce energy usage in the pas- senger terminal and other buildings. The assessment led to numerous changes, including the addition of a 50-kW photovoltaic array and a 12-panel solar thermal system on the airport terminal, removal of high-energyâuse equipment, and installation of energy-efficient lighting and room occupancy sensors. The success of that program brought Outagamie to the attention of FAA, which led to AIP funding through the Sustainable Airport Master Plan Pilot Program. Definition of sustainability Sustainable practices allow the current generation to meet current needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs, and they foster environmental protection, natural resource conservation, social progress, and stable economic growth and employment. airport sustainability planning The sustainable airport master plan was produced in 2012. The master planâs sustainability initia- tives focus almost exclusively on reducing the energy use of airport-owned buildings by 70% by 2030 through a combination of new construction, energy-efficient retrofits, and the use of renewable energy sources. Under the plan, 50% of energy needs would be produced by renewables, and annual greenhouse gas emissions would be reduced by 85%. aids/Barriers to Implementation AidsâExecutive management support. FAA funding. Engineering consultants. Strong support from tenants and community. BarriersâCost. Lengthy local procurement process. major Focus areas and sample Initiativesâenergy Reduction and employee programs Initiatives: â¢ Adopted mission statement of being carbon neutral by 2030. â¢ Installed energy-efficient lighting, room occupancy sensors, and ground power and a pre- conditioned air unit in a new passenger boarding bridge (PBB) to allow aircraft to shut off engines when parked on the apron. 39 â¢ Conducted energy modeling that resulted in installation of timers on the baseboard heater of each PBB. â¢ Using a grant from the U.S. Department of Energy, installed a 50-kW solar photovoltaic panel on the terminal concourse; solar monitoring stations provide education for the public. â¢ Reduced energy use through variable frequency drives on equipment; high-efficiency electri- cal, mechanical, and plumbing systems; room occupancy sensors; and natural lighting provided by skylights and large windows in the concourse and hangar. â¢ Studied a net-zero energy building for the FBO operations (the ATW Platinum Flight Center). â¢ Created a framework for measuring, tracking, and reducing the airportâs baseline energy usage and operational emissions footprints. â¢ Addressed employee programs, such as health risk analyses, absenteeism-reduction strategies, construction of new walking and biking paths on airport grounds, and provision of exercise facilities. â¢ Conducted a recycling and solid waste audit; developed strategies for diverting more waste from landfills. â¢ Evaluated wastewater management strategies; developed strategies for reusing water and better management of storm water runoff. â¢ Implemented rainwater collection, low-flow fixtures, and point-of-use hot water. â¢ Examined current and potential airport procurement practices to obtain sustainably produced supplies. â¢ Utilized enhanced wall and roof envelope insulation, in-floor radiant conditioning, high- performance Solarban 80 glazing, and a geothermal heat pump to boost efficiency and reduce the operational costs of heating and cooling systems. â¢ Utilized native plantings on airport grounds to reduce fertilizers and irrigation. â¢ Investigated ground transportation possibilities, such as mass transit, pedestrian and biking options, and plug-ins for electric cars in the parking lots. lessons learned and sage advice â¢ Although ad hoc projects may build momentum, a comprehensive plan is necessary for defining goals and setting the direction. â¢ Owing to staff time constraints, retaining an outside consultant to conduct audits and develop a sustainability plan ultimately saves both time and money. â¢ Pursue both AIP and local funding. â¢ If budget constraints prevent design and implementation of a fully developed plan, use local electric utilities and electric supply companies for advice, especially for low-hanging fruit such as LED lighting. â¢ Review life cycles and have long-term data to see if the sustainability plan and projects actually save money; engineers occasionally get the projections wrong. â¢ To understand the impact of initiatives and build a case for future projects, track everything and use an intern to input the data. â¢ Be sure to link the capital improvement plan and the sustainability plan. Case example Focusâadvancing energy efficient Buildings Following the planning goals set forth in the sustainable airport master plan, ATW established a GA campus south of the commercial air service passenger terminal that includes an FBO, a corpo- rate hangar, and a storage hangar for corporate jets. The Platinum Flight Center GA terminal was designed to achieve LEED certification, and the terminal building is designed to be the nationâs first aviation building to achieve Net Zero Energy status by producing renewable energy equivalent to the amount of energy it consumes for building operations in a calendar year. The building design includes the following energy efficiency measures: â¢ geothermal heating and cooling; â¢ in-floor radiant conditioning; 40 â¢ photovoltaic solar energy roof panels; â¢ high-performance glazing; â¢ thermal mass with enhanced envelope insulation; â¢ occupancy sensors for lighting and mechanical systems; â¢ natural ventilation; â¢ rainwater capture cistern for water reuse; and â¢ high-efficiency electrical, mechanical, and plumbing systems. Case example 9: pORTlaND INTeRNaTIONal JeTpORT, maINe special Circumstances Portland International Jetport (PWM) has 45 full-time employ- ees. The airport is owned by the city of Portland, which man- ages the procurement process, enacts mandatory policies and procedures, and acts as the final decision maker. Drivers PWM has a vocal local community with respect to environ- mental impacts stemming from the airport, and FAA, the U.S. EPA, and the Maine Department of Environmental Pro- tection (DEP) have become more focused on environmental issues. Availability of FAA AIP funding for the sustainability master plan also helped spur the airportâs program. Definition of sustainability Use only what you need and replace what you use. Sustainability must be based on economic viabil- ity, environmental impact, and importantly, the societal/organizational effect. airport sustainability planning PWM began work on a sustainability airport master plan (SAMP) in the summer of 2014, with an estimated completion in fall of 2015. The airport started with ad hoc projects, but the SAMP serves as a more robust and comprehensive vehicle for identifying issues and facilitates coalescing groups to set goals and find solutions. aids/Barriers to Implementation AidsâAIP funding for SAMP. VALE funding for geothermal. Supportive airport director. BarriersâLack of awareness and/or commitment at the municipal level. Bureaucratic processes (must get three bids for any procurement over $1,000). Staff resources. Low passenger facility charges. major Focus areas and sample Initiativesâenergy Reduction and employee Involvement Major SAMP focus areas: environmental compliance; air quality and greenhouse gases; economic impact; energy; governance and organizational readiness; ground transportation access; people and waste management; and recycling. Initiatives: â¢ Surveyed employees to obtain opinions and suggestions. â¢ Conducted environmental training. 41 â¢ Installed more efficient drives, lights, reflective roof, multistack heat pump system, and room occupancy sensors. â¢ Replacing all lights with LEDs to produce 70% energy savings plus lower maintenance costs. â¢ Achieved LEED Gold in new terminal expansion. â¢ Used VALE funds to install a geothermal system, which will pay for itself in 18 months and has a 30-year life. â¢ Reduced light pollution from airport deck by installing an airfoil to direct the light away from the town. â¢ Using software to track each flight for noise purposes. lessons learned and sage advice â¢ Make a decision to be environmentally responsible and then look for funding. â¢ Adopt initiatives that have a positive return on financial investment but understand that nothing will work well unless the social/community pillar is solid. â¢ Always seek public/employee/tenant involvement. â¢ Sound decisions require data and trends; use spreadsheets to track metrics that are not automati- cally tabulated (geothermal automatically provides data). â¢ Seek funding from governmental and other sources such as utilities. For example, Efficiency Maine has funded the LED lights. â¢ Be aware that some initiatives reduce operational or maintenance costs but could have a high greenhouse gas footprint; the heat pump for geothermal units consumes surprising amounts of energy. â¢ Smaller airports do not have the capacity to employ a full-time sustainability coordinator, and appeals to people to do the right thing can produce significant results. Case example Focusâpursuing Deicing excellence In 2007, the EPA demanded a study on deicing fluid mixing with storm water. Maine DEP found low oxygen levels in the local river and presented the airport with several options, which included gather- ing glycol and shipping it elsewhere for treatment. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 funded shovel-ready projects, leading the airport to apply for a grant to install pipes with a valve to direct glycol into a container. The FAA funded $500,000 for a tank to store the glycol. Both the EPA and the Maine DEP prohibited glycol from entering the river after November 1, 2010, and by October 2010, the storage tank was operational. All storm runoff is also diverted into the tank. Through this system of direct capture and diversion of the storm water-glycol mix, approximately 70% of the glycol is retained on site, and airport glycol leaving the site is less than half the permit- ted amount. Originally the captured glycol mix was sent off-site for separation and distillation, but now both separation and distillation are performed on site. Indeed, during the summer, other airports send their glycol to PWM for distillation. Currently, the recycled glycol is sold to firms in Canada to coat bearings on coal-mining equipment. However, PWM would like to have its on-site distilla- tion process certified to allow recycled glycol to be reused on aircraft; EPA funding is available for recapture but not for distillation, so other funding sources will have to be found. Case example 10: ReNTON mUNICIpal aIRpORT, WasHINGTON special Circumstances Renton Municipal Airport (RNT) was built in 1922 and expanded in 1943 for B-29 production during World War II. In the 1950s, the airport was prepared for jet aircraft produc- tion and served as the departure airport for all new Boeing KC135, 707, 727, 757, and 737 and P8A aircraft delivered from the Boeing Renton factory to the U.S. military and commercial airlines worldwide. 42 Drivers The airport director believed that launching a sustainability program was critical to ensuring that the airport was operated and maintained with a long-term vision while also balancing the goals of the residents living in the community around the airport. RNT was one of the 10 pilot airports for AIP sustainability funding. Definition of sustainability Sustainability is not just economic and social, nor is it just environment; it also includes operations and maintenance. It is important that all airports need look at all aspects of sustainability, especially those that ensure that the airport meets its main mission to support aviation while also being fiscally responsible, maintaining the infrastructure for the next 100 years, and operating the airport in a man- ner that ensures the airport is an asset for the community in which it is located. airport sustainability planning The sustainability master plan (SMP) was completed in 2012, and the airport master plan (AMP) process, which will align and implement the SMP goals, began in the fall of 2014. The goal of the 2012 SMP was to fully apply the EONS model for RNT to see if a holistic approach to sustainability would work and, most importantly, contribute to the longevity of the airport. The SMP serves as the umbrella program by addressing daily operations and balancing competing needs. The AMP is a facilities plan, one component of many in implementing the SMP. The airport has embarked on an aggressive construction program, and having the SMP allowed for more thoughtful decisions and resulted in cost savings. With ad hoc projects, the airport may not get credit for taking actions that have an impact on sustainability because lack of awareness and weak documentation prevent a clear link. A comprehensive plan explains the sustainability program and provides a framework for action. aids/Barriers to Implementation AidsâAIP funding that paid consultants to help develop the plan and the data âtoolâ that is used to align the goals with the implementation strategies and contain the data sets for analysis. Knowl- edgeable FAA staff in the airport regional office. The 20-person Airport Advisory Committee, with representatives from tenant and community stakeholders. BarriersâSustainability viewed as only pertaining to the environment and not the financial, operational, or long-term health of the airport infrastructure. Lack of process for gathering data. Lack of standardized data sets to use in decision making. Lack of staff time for col- lecting data. major Focus areas and sample InitiativesâWater protection and Community Outreach Focus areas that are tracked: airport financials, local and airport economic values, community out- reach and education, energy conservation/greenhouse gases, noise, facilities operation and mainte- nance, and water quality. Initiatives: â¢ Improved runway pavement rating from 30 to 100. â¢ To protect the adjacent river, replaced storm water pipes and installed drainage swales to sequester tire rubber and heavy metals from entering the adjacent river and lake. â¢ Acquired runway broom to reduce usage of E36 runway deicer and improve airport operationsâ response to winter ice/snow events. â¢ Replaced infield mower, which reduced staff hours and diesel consumption (greenhouse gases). â¢ Dredged seaplane base to maintain safe operations and designed a shoreline restoration project. 43 â¢ Conducted airport tours for preschool students, high school students, and Boy Scouts and held quarterly meetings with the Airport Advisory Committee to maintain and improve community acceptance of the airport. â¢ Maintain airport cash flow model on a weekly basis to ensure a financially healthy airport. lessons learned and sage advice â¢ To succeed, the program requires a long-term focus, and there must be a commitment and understanding from the top of the organization. â¢ Develop a process and a tool for gathering and tracking data; RNT tracks data related to the EONS balloons in an Excel spreadsheet. â¢ One of RNTâs six staff members inputs data into spreadsheets that track every metric, thus providing accurate, long-term data that inform decisions. Case example FocusâIntegrating sustainability plans with Construction In 2001, RNT was showing clear signs of neglect. Not much maintenance had been performed since the 1950s. The runways were in bad condition. Sections of the perimeter fence were miss- ing. The ramp and docks for the seaplane base had rotted. Vehicles drove down taxiways and runways. Financial planning extended only a year or two into the future. Fuel spilled into the lake and river. Poor relationships and communication between and among the community, the city, the airport, and the tenants prevented problems from getting resolved. Understanding the status quo was complicated by a lack of data. Remodeling projects failed to balance public policy goals, and opinions were not based on data. New airport management began by gathering data to get a snapshot of the current situation and determined to follow a more sustainable path. Despite best intentions, the myriad demands on the small staff (six employees) made a concentrated effort difficult. RNT was awarded an FAA AIP grant to develop an SMP. After a number of drafts and iterations to address RNTâs specific situations, the SMP was completed in 2012, just in time to implement sustainability strategies in the $18 million of major construction projects that were undertaken in 2013. With the help of a robust and detailed Excel platform that aligns with the SMP, the airport now keeps accurate and precise data to enable tracking of performance against sustainability and other goals. Case example 11: ROBeRTs FIelD, ReDmOND mUNICIpal aIRpORT, OReGON special Circumstances Redmond Municipal Airport (RDM) is the only commer- cial airport serving as a regional hub in central and eastern Oregon. Drivers The city of Redmond owns and operates the airport and financed expansion of the terminal from 16,000 square feet to 132,000 square feet in 2010. That expansion opened opportuni- ties to implement some ad hoc sustainability projects. Definition of sustainability Sustainability involves more than just environmental aspects, and although many environmental initiatives result in cost reductions, in the event of conflict, finan- cial responsibilities such as maintenance take priority over green initiatives. 44 airport sustainability planning RDM has a master plan but does not currently have a dedicated sustainability plan, so the airport has implemented sustainability measures on a self-funded, ad hoc basis. aids/Barriers to Implementation AidsâStrong community support. Staff and stakeholder buy-in. BarriersâLimited staff and budget. Potential negative cost-benefit of project. major Focus areas and sample Initiativesâsolar panels and energy Conservation Initiatives: â¢ As part of the terminal expansion, installed glass in many areas to utilize and maximize ambi- ent light. â¢ Installed a 44-kW DC solar panel array on the terminal roof in 2010; the airport web page (www.FLYRDM.com) has a monitoring link to show the total energy generated, total CO2 off- set (Total Energy Generated = X Tons of CO2 Saved), and total gallons of gas saved. â¢ Performed an energy audit of the airport terminal. â¢ Upgraded lights in terminal and parking lots to LED. â¢ Changed from paper to air dryers in restrooms. â¢ Installed sensors in all sinks and faucets. â¢ Implemented recycling program. â¢ Working with restaurants to reduce their environmental footprint. lessons learned and sage advice â¢ Having a good relationship with the community and local government is vital. â¢ Read the TRB reports and other information available online. â¢ Environmental issues are becoming more critical, as are social aspects resulting from social media, so airport priorities need to evolve with the times. â¢ With smaller airports, the financial aspect is critical, so initiatives must make good business sense. â¢ Look at nontraditional sources of funding, such federal and state environmental agencies. â¢ Attendance at airport conferences promotes networking and provides opportunities for people to exchange ideas. â¢ When completing long-term financial and capital improvement planning, consider how to incorporate sustainability aspects; build on actions taken in prior plans and allow the plans and projects to build on each other. â¢ Eliminate silos within the organization; build relationships with local governments and others to access the benefits of synergies and obtain information. â¢ With green initiatives such as solar, look carefully at the installation and maintenance costs and anticipated life cycle. Financial projections may be overly optimistic. Case example FocusâDelivering sustainability linked to Customer service One of the goals for the airport director has been to make the airport experience more pleasant and encourage people to come to the airport for reasons other than flights. Relationship building with the city and county has been a priority, and as a result, the airport is well supported by the community. For example, taking the local governing body for a tour around the terminal and the airport property helps familiarize the members with the airport design and operations. To engage the local com- munity, the airport would communicate about its activities to increase understanding of the airport. However, those communications could take into account the differences in how each generation pro- cesses information. In todayâs environment, people want to stay electronically connected, so terminal 45 designs could provide more outlets for charging personal electronic devices, especially in the seating areas. At RDM, many of the older staff are nearing retirement, which requires recruitment in ways that take into account current expectations of employees. Case example 12: TeTeRBORO aIRpORT aND sTeWaRT INTeRNaTIONal aIRpORT, NeW JeRseY/NeW YORK special Circumstances Teterboro (TEB) and Stewart International (SWF) airports are operated by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ) and are critical pieces of PANYNJâs airport net- work of five airports. TEB serves as a general aviation reliever airport for the region, and SWF serves as a vital gateway to the Mid-Hudson Valley. In 2010, FAA selected TEB for inclusion in its Sustainability Pilot Program. Drivers PANYNJ views sustainability programs as vital to the busi- ness case of an organization because a focus on sustainability can aid in evaluating long-term risk and can increase cohesion between the airport and local communities. Definition of sustainability A robust sustainability program can serve as a catalyst to help an airport meet its overall business objectives, balancing the airportâs financial needs with environmental and social goals. PANYNJ uses the EONS definition of sustainability and has established the following goals for all of its operations and facilities: an 80% reduction in all greenhouse gas emissions related to its facilities from 2006 levels by 2050; net zero greenhouse gas emissions from Port Authority operations; proactive engagement with tenants and others to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions; and development of strategies for climate change adaptation. airport sustainability planning An environmental sustainability plan has been in place at SWF since 2010, with an update under way. A sustainable management plan has been in place at TEB since 2012. Sustainability manage- ment plans help serve as enterprise-level, decision-making frameworks involving staff at all levels of the organization. A comprehensive plan allows for deployment of consistent decision-making tools and optimal use of resources among facilities. aids/Barriers to Implementation AidsâArticulating the business case for every sustainability initiative, whether it is a financial or a more qualitative business case. Industry momentum around sustainability and case examples of other airports successfully deploying strategies. High-level organizational and policy sup- port for sustainability. BarriersâEngaging field staff on a meaningful level as sustainability plans are developed. Mindset that sustainability planning is limited to the environmental field. 46 major Focus areas and sample InitiativesâClimate Change planning and energy audit Focus areas for both airports: climate risk mitigation, air quality improvement, and cost reduction. Initiatives: â¢ TEB: â Planning for the effects of climate change on critical infrastructure. â Hosts community events and career fairs. â Adopted operational efficiency improvements on the airfield. â Completed a Global Reporting Initiative sustainability report for 2013, which will serve as a template for future PANYNJ sustainability reporting. â¢ SWF: â Developed a recycling program. â Collaborated with local businesses on sustainability initiatives. â Conducted a whole facility energy audit and retrofit, including installation of smart meters. â Utilizing alternative-fuel vehicles. â Installed high-albedo roofing and pervious pavement. â Collecting and treating deicing fluid. â Engaging in community outreach and encouraging community involvement. lessons learned and sage advice â¢ Sustainability planning could be a way of (1) recognizing the efforts that staff has engaged in and that are under way, (2) grouping current efforts into broader strategic initiatives where cumulative benefits can be recognized, and (3) developing an enterprise-level, decision-making framework that weaves sustainable choices into all levels of the airport business. â¢ Sustainability can be viewed both as a tool to achieve better bottom line results and as a revenue driver. â¢ Business strategy and sustainability are beginning to merge because having a sustainability program helps airports think strategically and ultimately serve customers more effectively. â¢ Lighting retrofits can pay for themselves; look to utilities as a funding source. â¢ Have workshops with local stakeholders, who can be sources of goals and initiatives. â¢ When brainstorming projects, consider all that appear feasible, and then make selection based on practicality and cost. â¢ When implementing a recycling program, first do a ground waste audit to understand what proportion of waste items is recyclable or compostable. A basic level of human sorting is prob- ably unavoidable. Case example Focusâenhancing strategic Use of Reliever airports From the perspective of PANYNJ, the small reliever airports in the network can serve as ideal test cases for broader organizational initiatives. For example, the Aviation Department completed its first sustainability plan at SWF to test strategies for planning and implementation. Also at SWF, PANYNJ deployed a pilot smart-metering project to understand the benefits of submetering and active utility management. Deploying new initiatives on a small scale allows PANYNJ to limit its risk profile while determining how the initiatives can be deployed on a larger scale at the rest of its facilities.

Airports in the United States are responding to the demand for increased air travel with sustainable development that incorporates more energy-efficient and lower-emission technologies. Funding for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions-reducing technologies, such as electrification, alternative fuels, and renewable energy, has also become more accessible as technologies are proven to be safe, reliable, and cost-effective. Newer strategies and programs to reduce GHG emissions reach beyond airport operations to incorporate the traveling public. These are among the findings in the TRB Airport Cooperative Research Program's ACRP Synthesis 100: Airport Greenhouse Gas Reduction Efforts. The report assesses (1) the state of practice of GHG emissions reduction initiatives at airports, and (2) the lessons learned to support the successful implementation of future GHG reduction projects. The report also finds that large airports are taking the lead in moving beyond reduction strategies for their own emissions and tackling those produced by tenants and the traveling public by supporting the use of alternative fuels and directing passengers to airport carbon offset platforms. It is clear that airports regard energy-efficiency measures to be the most effective practice to reducing GHG emissions. Smaller airports, in particular, are adopting new technologies associated with more efficient heating and cooling infrastructure and lighting systems because they decrease energy consumption and make economic sense. GHG reduction projects are being implemented by different types of airports across the industry because of the cost savings and the environmental benefits of the new technology. Airports are actively benchmarking emission-reduction progress in comparison with similar efforts at airports around the world by using frameworks employed by the industry globally, such as the Airport Carbon Accreditation Program and the airport carbon emissions reporting tool (ACERT), to measure their GHG emissions. Innovative approaches are allowing airports to address rapidly changing consumer behaviors, like those presented in recent years by transportation network companies (TNCs) such as Uber and Lyft. These policy-based solutions offer the potential for wider adoption as they enable airports to act without significant capital expenditures.

""2 Government Efforts."" National Research Council. 2012. Sustainability Considerations for Procurement Tools and Capabilities: Summary of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/13476. any of the sustainable procurement activities within the federal government have been spurred by the 2009 Executive Order EO 13514, Federal Leadership in Environmental, Energy, and Economic Performance, which requires federal agencies to develop sustainability goals that focus on making improvements related to environmental, energy, and economic performance. As part of this effort, the General Services Administration (GSA) is working to integrate sustainability into its purchasing decisions. The Section 13 Interagency Working Group, created under Section 13 of EO 13514, is evaluating the feasibility of working with the federal vendor and contractor community to provide information to assist agencies in tracking and reducing greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) related to the supply of products and services to the government. According to workshop presenter Stephen Leeds from the Office of the Administrator at GSA, the agency purchases about $95 billion in goods and services annually, including 12 million products through 18,000 vendors, making the agency well positioned to influence the federal government’s purchasing decisions. GSA’s goal is to have a supply chain that is sustainable throughout. Sustainable procurement, Mr. Leeds added, is about “making smart investments in products that provide better services” for a longer period of time. Achieving a sustainable supply chain requires an understanding of the environmental “hotspots” within an industry—in other words, the components of the supply chain with Senior Counselor to the Administrator at the time of the workshop. ""2 Government Efforts."" National Research Council. 2012. Sustainability Considerations for Procurement Tools and Capabilities: Summary of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/13476. the largest environmental impact. The agency’s thinking about sustainable purchasing is evolving, with a focus on life-cycle approaches, return on investment, risk mitigation, intentionality, and partnership, he said. GSA is adopting a life-cycle approach to sustainable purchasing as it “bridges the silos of disposal and acquisition,” Mr. Leeds explained. The agency is sending a clear signal to the private sector that the focus is broader than the individual environmental impacts of purchasing decisions. Partnering with the private sector, as well as with state and local governments, is important to the agency’s work and its goal of achieving a sustainable supply chain. Nancy Gillis from GSA’s Federal Supply Chain Emissions Program Management Office (PMO) described how GSA and other agencies have worked to advance sustainable acquisition in the federal supply chain. GSA does not view the concept of “sustainability” as synonymous with the “environment,” Ms. Gillis said, but considers it a broader issue that encompasses economic and social issues as well. The agency is approaching procurement decisions by prioritizing products’ life-cycle return on investment and by considering environmental, economic, and social benefits and costs. In other words, the agency is trying to balance the need to reduce energy use, resource use, and environmental impacts while also taking into account economic considerations. Ms. Gillis discussed the office’s other activities, including collaborating with industry and supporting and managing the Sustainability in Procurement Fellowship Program. The program introduces fellows to the concept of sustainability and provides an overview of the federal government’s activities around sustainable procurement. Another effort is the GreenGov Supply Chain partnership, which was designed to increase the energy efficiency of vendors and contractors’ supply chains and to reduce their GHG emissions. The partnership resulted from a GSA report that found sustainability considerations, especially GHG emissions data, should be used in the federal procurement process, and that agencies should engage the vendor community to track and reduce GHG emissions through a collaborative, transparent, and deliberative process. The Section 13 Interagency Working Group is currently evaluating and recommending ways to advance sustainable acquisition throughout the federal government, Ms. Gillis explained. For example, after evaluating whether it is feasible for the federal contractor community to provide GHG emissions data related to the supply of products for use in government procurement decisions, the working group recommended that suppliers not be required to provide complete inventories of their GHG General Services Administration (GSA). 2010.

Instead, the group recommended that the government, as an incentive, inform suppliers that GHG emissions data could be considered by agencies when making procurement decisions. Alison Kinn Bennett from the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics described the activities of a subgroup of the Section 13 working group that focused on product standards and ecolabels. This subgroup, which involves GSA, EPA, Department of Defense (DOD), National Institutes of Health (NIH), United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), and other agencies is responsible for ensuring that the product-related acquisition goals of EO 13514 are met by providing guidelines for selecting environmental sustainability standards or ecolabeling programs. The subgroup views standards setting as a pyramid, as shown in . Environmental and health data and tools are the base, with standards and incentives for green products built on those, Ms. Kinn Bennet said. From that, a system to verify standards is established, so that ultimately buyers are able to more easily find green products with effective, reliable standards. Ms. Kinn Bennett noted that the subgroup’s work has had several phases, including grounding; developing draft guidelines; assessing the guidelines using a survey of standards and consultation among federal agencies; holding listening sessions with stakeholders; and preparing a report. The assessment phase of the subgroup’s work focused on existing U.S. and international protocols for standard setting and environmentally preferable product claims and verification methodologies. A survey conducted by the subgroup identified about 80 guidelines for selecting standards in ecolabels. Those guidelines were then categorized into five general areas: •  Standard substance: the content, relevance and effectiveness of standard criteria •  Conformity assessment: how the standard was created and whether it was third-party verified or compliance was self-declared •  Program management: how the program is managed, governed and operated •  Market penetration: the extent to which it is used and recognized in the market Ms. Kinn Bennett noted that going forward, it will be important for agencies to address trade-offs and assess environmental impacts across media and life-cycle stages when making sustainable acquisition decisions. The subgroup wants to encourage more holistic, comprehensive thinking on standards and criteria development, she said. ""2 Government Efforts."" National Research Council. 2012.

Development of effective, green standards for products that buyers can readily identify. Source : Alison Kinn Bennet presentation, December 7, 2011. Josh Silverman from the Office of Sustainability Support at the Department of Energy (DOE) and Karen Moran from the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) with the Department of Defense described sustainable procurement efforts at their respective agencies. According to Dr. Silverman, DOE relies heavily on its contractors to implement and integrate sustainability into procurement decisions; the agency establishes requirements, but contractors are responsible for implementing them. DOE also relies heavily on effective communication and information exchange; for example, the agency has an ongoing working group with hundreds of active members who regularly exchange information on best practices. The agency also tracks data on the use and procurement of green products and is trying to further integrate sustainability requirements into its contracting, with the goal of using sustainable procurement as a strategy to drive improved mission performance. The agency now requires contractors—particularly those providing construction and custodial services—to review contract actions for ways to integrate sustainability requirements. Additionally, DOE conducted a quasi-“hotspot” analysis to assess both the products in highest demand and available standards, Dr. Silverman said. The Green Buy Program within DOE offers awards to contractors and vendors that purchase these priority products. He added that DOE is trying to incentivize and reward behavior that integrates sustainable approaches. It will be necessary to better quantify the benefits of these activities so that their impact can be understood and used to make the ""2 Government Efforts."" National Research Council. 2012. Sustainability Considerations for Procurement Tools and Capabilities: Summary of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/13476. business case for sustainable procurement, he said; a purely compliance-oriented approach may not be as effective in moving this effort forward. Karen Moran described the role of the DLA as a combat logistics support agency and noted that much of the agency’s work is contracted. DLA is continually trying to incorporate sustainability into its procurement decisions and those of its contractors, Ms. Moran said. She described several ongoing sustainable procurement programs at the agency, including efforts to encourage procurement of bio-based products; a program that returns unused medications to vendors; and a variety of alternative fuel initiatives, including efforts to increase use of renewable energy and bio-diesel. Another initiative is incorporating environmental information into an electronic purchasing system known as the Federal Catalog System. This information includes environmental attribute codes that indicate a sustainable characteristic for a specified product. Ms. Moran described a recent joint GSA/DOD sustainable procurement project that kicked off with a meeting on November 17, 2011. The meeting brought together representatives from both agencies to discuss translating policy into action, the need to integrate sustainable procurement into the course of business, life-cycle assessment, and the value of synchronizing GSA and DOD to enhance standardization. Participants at the meeting discussed the need for compelling messaging that would cast sustainable procurement in terms of an agency’s mission, Ms. Moran said. Discussion at the November meeting also explored potential ways to motivate behavioral change related to sustainable procurement along with the recognition that training alone cannot create culture change. Finally, Ms. Moran noted that there was discussion of the need for a tool-box, which should be scaled in complexity and size for different types of procurement, as well as the need for a mechanism to test products and provide feedback. Edward Rau from the Division of Environmental Protection at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) spoke about efforts to incorporate sustainable procurement at NIH. His department directly purchases, funds, or influences purchases related to health care, food, drugs, and biomedical research; however, NIH has few sustainable criteria for these products and no effective tools to help make such purchases more sustainable, he noted. The information on sustainable purchasing that is available consists primarily of static reference documents distributed across many separate Web sites, which typically cannot be applied by procurement professionals to perform, facilitate, or track purchasing transactions. One area where NIH would benefit from a sustainable procurement tool would be in purchasing replacement freezer units that are 10 percent more energy efficient than the current units on NIH’s Bethesda campus, Captain Rau said. This would save NIH about $1 million a year in electricity costs. According to ""2 Government Efforts."" National Research Council. 2012. Sustainability Considerations for Procurement Tools and Capabilities: Summary of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/13476.    Provide an authoritative, one-stop sustainable shopping reference    Characterize transactions as compliant or noncompliant to FAR    Link to agency approvals and published literature Edward Rau, National Institutes of Health, December 8, 2011. a recent survey, the current freezer units account for 29 percent of total electricity use, $12 million a year in costs, and releases of about 59,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalence per year. Another gap in sustainable procurement tools is in identifying hazardous toxic or polluting substances, Captain Rau noted. From a public health perspective toxicity is one of the most important criteria in sustainable acquisition, he said. Although the interim Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) require procurement of products and services that are nontoxic, this has been difficult to implement, due in part to a lack of clear definitions and toxicity data. To address gaps in available information, Captain Rau has spearheaded the development of a “substance of concern” list that would restrict or prohibit the government from procuring products or services that contain or release listed substances of concern. The proposed list could be used as an interim screening and selection method until better data and methods of comparative toxicology are developed. The list would inventory substances by their chemical abstract service registry number to reduce synonym confusion, be derived from other well-established listings such as EPA’s Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) or the Consumer Product Safety Commission’s Safer Products lists, and characterize the listed substance as banned or restricted in certain uses. Where available, it would also list alternatives for the substance of concern. Another area with gaps that a procurement tool could address is the tracking and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in the supply chain, ""2 Government Efforts."" National Research Council. 2012. Sustainability Considerations for Procurement Tools and Capabilities: Summary of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/13476. added Captain Rau. Metrics, emissions accounting requirements, and boundary definitions would all need to be established for such a tool. Full life-cycle data would also be needed so that the focus is not just on the embodied greenhouse gas of the product but also its full life cycle. He gave the example of sulfur hexafluoride, which appears on the substance of concern list, not because it is toxic per se but because it is a potent greenhouse gas. Another major gap in sustainable procurement efforts is consideration of a product’s end of life. Currently, procurement tends to focus on a product’s recycled material content or bio-based materials rather than on its reusability, recyclability, or biodegradability. These considerations are critical for meeting net zero goals that are becoming more widely adopted, Captain Rau said. He described his view of the elements that would be included in an effective sustainability-oriented procurement tool. It would provide an authoritative, one-stop sustainable shopping reference for all products and services, be very centralized, and be automated. It would be interactive and not merely a reference companion or compilation. It would have a simple, two-step search-and-buy function; purchasers would search for a specific product or service and then be directed to where to buy a compliant product. This would save time by eliminating the need to search for applicable requirements and products that conform to them, as is currently done. The tool would eliminate the need for purchasers to understand complex, rapidly-changing, sustainable procurement requirements, thus minimizing training needs. It would also have data collection and reporting functions and would link directly to other procurement systems to avoid multiple data-entry errors. In addition, it would characterize a transaction as compliant or noncompliant with any regulations, such as the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), and track how well a product or service adheres to other desirable but not mandatory sustainable attributes. It is critical that users have confidence in the quality of the data, and be assured that purchases made with the tool meet all applicable requirements, Captain Rau stressed. Lastly, for scientific and medical applications, it would be critical that purchases of medical supplies and devices directly link to agency approvals, such as Food & Drug Administration (FDA) approvals, and to published medical literature. The DOD has a primary goal focused toward net zero, meaning net zero energy use, water use, and waste. The aim is to start with reduction, then progress through repurposing, recycling, energy recovery, and lastly disposal. Other agencies are moving toward this concept of net zero. See: .

Federal laws, regulations, and executive orders have imposed requirements for federal agencies to move toward the sustainable acquisition of goods and services, including the incorporation of sustainable purchasing into federal agency decision making. Since the federal government is such a significant player in the market, its move to incorporate sustainable procurement practices could have a profound impact on the types of products being developed for the market as a whole. The General Services Administration (GSA) has played a key role in furthering sustainable procurement practices throughout the federal government. GSA is responsible for formulating and maintaining government-wide policies covering a variety of administrative actions, including those related to procurement and management. GSA has several ongoing activities related to sustainable procurement to assess the feasibility of working with the federal supplier community - vendors and contractors that serve federal agencies to measure and reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the supply chain while encouraging sustainable operations among suppliers. GSA has also been actively developing programs to assist federal agencies in making sustainable procurement decisions. As federal agencies cannot directly fund the development of sustainable procurement tools, they are particularly interested in understanding how to foster innovation and provide incentives for collaboration between developers and users of tools for sustainable purchasing throughout the supply chain. The training of procurement professionals is also a priority for these agencies. To assist efforts to build sustainability considerations into the procurement process, the National Research Council appointed a committee to organize a two-day workshop that explored ways to better incorporate sustainability considerations into procurement tools and capabilities across the public and private sectors. The workshop was designed to help participants assess the current landscape of green purchasing tools, identify emerging needs for enhanced or new tools and opportunities to develop them, identify potential barriers to progress, and explore potential solutions. The workshop provided an opportunity for participants to discuss challenges related to sustainable purchasing and to developing new procurement tools. Sustainability Considerations for Procurement Tools and Capabilities reviews the presenters' recommendations and tools currently used in sustainable procurement, such as databases for ecolabels and standards, codes, or regulations and other nontechnological tools such as policies, frameworks, rating systems, and product indexes.

National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2017. Review of the Research Program of the U.S. DRIVE Partnership: Fifth Report. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/24717. The U.S. government, through either the administration or the Congress, has generally addressed the supply of energy and its use because of national concerns related to energy independence, national security, the environment and sustainability, and affordability (). These goals are emphasized to one extent or another depending on the current Congress or administration. The U.S. transportation sector and the use of light-duty vehicles (automobiles and light trucks) are almost completely dependent on petroleum as an energy source to power vehicles. Since the 1970s, petroleum imports satisfied part of this demand, at times reaching levels of 50 percent or more and in the view of policy makers represented an important U.S. national and energy security issue. However, in recent years, for example, 2010-2014, high global oil prices and the development of hydraulic fracturing (“fracking”) helped to produce a boom in U.S. oil production from low-permeability geologic formations such as shale; the oil produced is referred to as “shale oil” or “tight oil.” Recent projections by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) show a major change occurring in the U.S. dependence on energy imports (). The combination of increased tight oil production and higher fuel efficiency for vehicles leads to EIA projecting declines in oil imports from 24 percent of demand in 2015 to 19 percent of demand in 2040 under EIA’s reference case (; ). Under EIA’s high oil price scenario, the United States becomes a net exporter around 2025. So, the situation faced by the United States in recent decades has greatly changed. Another issue of concern is volatility. Although the price of petroleum, gasoline, and diesel dropped to low levels in late 2015 and early 2016, the economic environment since 2008 has been one of volatility. Significant eco- ""1 Introduction."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2017. Review of the Research Program of the U.S. DRIVE Partnership: Fifth Report. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/24717. nomic impacts on the transportation sector, the automotive industry, the economy, and vehicle owners can arise from the price volatility of gasoline and diesel fuel. In addition to these energy security and economic concerns, the automobile also has a significant environmental footprint as a consequence of tailpipe emissions. Furthermore, there are environmental impacts associated with the full life cycle of producing and delivering fuels to vehicles as well as the impacts of vehicle production and disposal if one looks at the sector from a full life-cycle perspective. The combustion of petroleum-derived fuels in the U.S. transportation sector, mostly gasoline and diesel, produces a significant fraction of the nation’s anthropogenic greenhouse gases (GHGs), as well as such criteria pollutants as oxides of nitrogen (NO), nonmethane hydrocarbons, and particulate matter that affect local air quality (). Although criteria pollutant emissions from light-duty vehicles have declined dramatically in the past few decades because of improvements in engines, fuels, and emission control systems, there are still some areas of the country that are not in compliance with air quality standards. And as the number of vehicles increases, there continue to be concerns about emissions, especially in urban areas with high concentrations of vehicles. These concerns can be addressed with vehicles having zero tailpipe emissions, for example, with hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (HFCVs) or battery electric vehicles (BEVs). In addition to concerns about criteria pollutants and their impact on local air quality is the desire to reduce GHG emissions that contribute to climate change. When the combustion of hydrocarbon fuels such as gasoline or diesel occurs in vehicle engines, carbon dioxide (CO) is produced, the major GHG contributing to global warming. The U.S. transportation sector accounted for about a third of total U.S. anthropogenic CO emissions in 2014, and it is projected by the EIA to still constitute a significant fraction (35 percent) in 2040 (; ). Light-duty vehicles comprised about 60 percent of the CO emissions from the transportation sector in 2014 (). If all GHGs are included (e.g., methane, nitrous oxide), the transportation sector accounted for about 26 percent of U.S. GHG emissions; therefore, the sector is an important source of GHG emissions, especially CO emissions. The energy security, environmental, and economic issues associated with the transportation sector and with light-duty vehicles can be addressed in a number of ways. One particularly important approach, which is the subject of this report, is to improve light-duty vehicle technologies. For example, if engines are made more efficient and if the fuel economy of vehicles is improved, a vehicle’s fuel consumption per mile can decline and the associated CO emitted per mile will also decline. Hence, an important part of the nation’s approach to reducing GHG emissions from light-duty vehicles is to improve automotive technology in a variety of ways that lead to higher fuel economy vehicles that are affordable. In ""1 Introduction."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2017. Review of the Research Program of the U.S. DRIVE Partnership: Fifth Report. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/24717. addition, vehicles that can use alternative sources of energy, such as electricity or hydrogen, can have low GHG emissions if, for example, they are produced using renewable energy sources. This report contains the results of a review by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine’s (the Academies) Committee on the Review of the Research Program of the U.S. DRIVE Partnership, Phase 5 (see for biographical information on the committee members). The government/industry partnership known as U.S. DRIVE (riving esearch and nnovation for ehicle Efficiency and nergy Sustainability) was formed in 2011. As noted in , it is very much in line with the partnerships that preceded it, namely, the FreedomCAR and Fuel Partnership and, prior to that, the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles (PNGV). The Academies reviewed the PNGV seven times, from 1993 to 2001; the FreedomCAR and Fuel Partnership three times, between 2004 and 2010; and the U.S. DRIVE Partnership in 2011-2012. The U.S. DRIVE Partnership is considered a continuation of the FreedomCAR and Fuel Partnership and hence the current review a fifth (Phase 5) review. (See previous reports for background on the partnerships, the various technical areas, and issues that the partnerships have addressed [, , , , ,, ,, ,].) The committee’s report represents a continuing review of the partnerships that have been formed to address advanced light-duty vehicle and associated infrastructure challenges. The main charge to the committee for this report is to review activities since the fourth review of the U.S. DRIVE Partnership (). The full statement of task for the committee is provided later in this chapter. As noted in , for decades the Department of Energy (DOE) has funded and supported research and development (R&D) programs related to advanced vehicular technologies and alternative transportation fuels. Under the Clinton administration during the 1990s much of this R&D for light-duty vehicles was conducted under the PNGV. This initial government–auto industry partnership was formed between the federal government and the auto industry’s U.S. Council for Automotive Research (USCAR). The PNGV sought to improve the nation’s competitiveness significantly in the manufacture of future generations of vehicles, to implement commercially viable innovations emanating from ongoing research on conventional vehicles, and to develop vehicles that achieve up to three times the fuel efficiency of comparable 1994 family sedans (,,; ; ; ). USCAR, which predated PNGV, was established by Chrysler Corporation, Ford Motor Company, and General Motors Corporation. Its purpose was to support intercompany, precompetitive cooperation so as to reduce the cost of redundant R&D, especially in areas mandated by government regulation, and to make the U.S. industry more competitive with foreign companies. Chrysler Corporation merged with Daimler Benz in 1998 to form DaimlerChrysler. In 2007 DaimlerChrysler divested itself of a major interest in the Chrysler Group, and Chrysler LLC was formed, which became Chrysler Group LLC. Chrysler Group LLC then became FCA US LLC (Fiat Chrysler Automobiles). ""1 Introduction."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2017. Review of the Research Program of the U.S. DRIVE Partnership: Fifth Report. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/24717. The PNGV focused on achieving a significant increase in fuel economy for a family sedan and resulted in unveiling three concept vehicles at the end of that program. Under President George W. Bush a shift in the program took place toward addressing the challenges of developing hydrogen fuel technologies as well as fuel cell vehicle technologies. The FreedomCAR and Fuel Partnership was established to address these challenges and to advance the technologies enough so that a decision on the commercial viability of hydrogen vehicles could be made by 2015. As the Obama administration took office in early 2009 a redirection began to take place, with reduced R&D on hydrogen and fuel cell vehicles and increased attention directed toward technologies for the use of electricity to power light-duty vehicles, with emphasis on plug-in electric vehicles, including plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), and all-electric vehicles (or BEVs). However, as budgets were appropriated by Congress, R&D continued across all technologies relevant to fuel cells and hydrogen, as well as those relevant to PHEVs and BEVs. In 2011, the FreedomCAR and Fuel Partnership morphed into the U.S. DRIVE Partnership, and a U.S. DRIVE Partnership Plan was formally released in February 2012 and updated in 2016 (). Outside the Partnership, the federal interest in increasing the use of alternative fuels was exemplified by the creation by Congress of the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) in 2005 prescribing annual amounts of renewable fuels to be used in transportation. Furthermore, extensive R&D on the production of biofuels is undertaken in DOE’s Bioenergy Technologies Office (BETO), which is in the Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) Office of Transportation and also outside the Partnership. Building on participation in the previous partnerships, currently U.S. DRIVE includes the following partners: U.S. Council for Automotive Research LLC (USCAR, the cooperative research organization for FCA US LLC, Ford Motor Company, and General Motors Company); DTE Energy Company, Southern California Edison Company, and the Electric Power Research Institute; U.S. Department of Energy; and In February 2003, before the announcement of the FreedomCAR and Fuel Partnership, President George W. Bush announced the FreedomCAR and Hydrogen Fuel Initiative to develop technologies for (1) fuel-efficient motor vehicles and light trucks, (2) cleaner fuels, (3) improved energy efficiency, and (4) hydrogen production, and a nationwide distribution infrastructure for vehicle and stationary power plants, to provide fuel for both hydrogen internal combustion engines and fuel cells (). The expansion of the FreedomCAR and Fuel Partnership to include the energy sector after the announcement of the initiative also supported the goal of the FreedomCAR and Hydrogen Fuel Initiative. The partners in the program included DOE, USCAR, BP America, Chevron Corporation, ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil Corporation, and Shell Hydrogen (U.S.). During 2008, with increased interest in plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and battery electric vehicles, the electric utilities DTE Energy (Detroit) and Southern California Edison were added (). Tesla Motors was a member but withdrew in July 2016. ""1 Introduction."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2017.

BP America, Chevron Corporation, Phillips 66 Company, ExxonMobil Corporation, and Shell Oil Products U.S. According to and as noted in , the Partnership is a nonbinding, nonlegal, voluntary government–industry partnership. It does not itself conduct or fund R&D, but each partner makes its own decisions regarding the funding and management of its projects. By bringing together technical experts and providing a framework for frequent and regular interaction, the Partnership provides a forum for discussing precompetitive, technology-specific R&D needs, identifies possible solutions, and evaluates progress toward jointly developed technical goals. Its frequent communication among partners also helps to identify potential duplication of efforts and increases the chances of successful commercialization of publicly funded R&D. Most of the committee’s review of technology development is focused on the DOE precompetitive R&D programs in the Vehicle Technologies Office (VTO) and in the Fuel Cell Technologies Office, both of which reside within the Office of Transportation, which is part of EERE (see ). See for further discussion of the organization of the Partnership and how it functions. American consumers have a broad range of affordable personal transportation choices that reduce petroleum consumption and significantly reduce harmful emissions from the transportation sector. Accelerate the development of precompetitive and innovative technologies to enable a full range of efficient and clean advanced light-duty vehicles, as well as related energy infrastructure. The Partnership is focused on advanced technologies for all light-duty passenger vehicles: cars, sport utility vehicles (SUVs), crossover vehicles, pickups, and minivans. It also addresses technologies for hydrogen production, distribution, dispensing, and storage, and the interface and infrastructure issues associated with the electric utility industry for the support of BEVs and PHEVs (). Furthermore, as noted in previous National Research Council (NRC) reviews, the activities and success of the Partnership “can serve as an inspiration and motivation for the next generation of scientists and engineers, and thus contribute to restoring American leadership in research and its application for the public good” (, p. 18, , p. 18). The Partnership facilitates communication among its partners and examines precompetitive technologies in four broad categories, all of which include potential issues related to the technologies or fuels as follows (): The committee views precompetitive government R&D on technology as long-term, high-risk work with regard to its potential transition into commercial viability.

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/24717. Other sustainable mobility fuels as agreed to by the Partnership. As also discussed in , the Partnership addresses the technical challenges associated with the envisioned pathways by establishing quantitative performance and cost targets for precompetitive technologies. These targets and the research related to their attainment are discussed later in this report. Technical teams, as discussed in , specify and manage technical and crosscutting needs of the Partnership. A technical team is associated with each of the bulleted areas noted earlier in the four broad categories. If special issues arise, working groups may be formed (see ). A number of changes in the regulatory environment, in automotive technology, and in the automotive marketplace have been occurring in recent years, some since the Academies issued its report in 2013 on the fourth review of the U.S. DRIVE Partnership. Industry has taken the lead in the development of fuel cell and plug-in electric vehicles (BEVs and PHEVs). As a result, a competitive commercial environment has arisen as BEVs, HFCVs, and PHEVs enter the marketplace from both domestic and foreign manufacturers, including HFCVs from foreign automotive companies. These changes are affecting the light-duty vehicle environment and indirectly may have some bearing on the strategy of the DOE defines “goals” as desired, qualitative results that collectively signify Partnership mission accomplishments. It defines “targets” as tangible, quantitative metrics to measure progress toward goals. All references to cost imply estimated variable cost (or investment, as appropriate) based on high volume (500,000 annual volume) unless otherwise stated. “Cost” refers to the cost of producing an item, whereas “price” refers to what the consumer would pay. ""1 Introduction."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2017. Review of the Research Program of the U.S. DRIVE Partnership: Fifth Report. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/24717. Partnership as it looks to future precompetitive R&D. Some of these changes are briefly reviewed in what follows. As discussed in previous reviews by the National Academies, the U.S. government during the past few decades has enacted legislation and policies to help achieve its national goals in the transportation sector (). For example, the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) regulations have increased and are projected to further increase the average miles per gallon (mpg) for light-duty vehicles and reduce GHG emissions, while federal emissions standards have led to a dramatic decrease in criteria vehicle emissions per mile traveled. The increasing levels of CAFE standards have created a need for advanced automotive technologies that will increase the relevance of the precompetitive R&D directed at technology development in the U.S. DRIVE Partnership. Other legislation, as noted previously, such as the RFS, seeks to promote the replacement of petroleum-based fuels with alternative fuels, such as those derived from biomass (). Federal R&D helps enable advanced vehicle and fuel technologies to emerge in the commercial marketplace (), which can help to address the nation’s energy security, economic, and environmental challenges. In fact, DOE developed a broad set of strategies in its Quadrennial Technology Reviews (QTRs) to address the nation’s energy challenges, including electrifying the vehicle fleet and increasing vehicle efficiency (, ). However, the challenges of doing so on a large scale are formidable. As noted in , in addition to the federal legislation noted above, California has programs to reduce emissions of GHGs from vehicles, one of which is the zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) program. The state is promoting the adoption of ZEVs—for example, electric vehicles and HFCVs—by setting benchmarks for 2020 and 2025 for infrastructure to support such vehicles as well as for the adoption of such vehicles. California’s Executive Order B-16-2012 aims for there to In 2010 CAFE standards were enacted requiring light-duty vehicles (passenger cars and light trucks) to meet 35.5 mpg by model year (MY) 2016. In October 2012 the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a joint rule to further improve fuel economy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The first phase of NHTSA’s rule is expected to require fuel economy levels of about 41 mpg in MY 2021. The second phase of the CAFE program, from 2022 to 2025, includes augural standards that are not final but are estimated to require about 49 mpg for MY 2025. EPA is projecting emission levels on an industry-wide average of 163 g/mile of CO by 2025, which also includes consideration of air conditioning leakage and alternative refrigerants. EPA’s estimates equate to 54.5 mpg if these emission levels were achieved solely through vehicle fuel efficiency. These standards represent about a doubling from pre-2010 standards that were 27.5 mpg (). On January 12, 2017, the EPA administrator signed a final determination to maintain the current GHG emission standards for MY 2022-2025 vehicles.

Nine states are following California and requiring automakers to produce zero-emission vehicles (). These programs are also stimulating the development of the advanced vehicle technologies that are under development by some of the partners in the U.S. DRIVE Partnership. Furthermore, California passed legislation in September 2016 to reduce GHG emissions by at least 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030. The availability of low-cost natural gas and initiatives by states to promote renewable electric power technologies is leading to lower GHG emissions from the electric power sector. This will affect the full fuel cycle GHG emissions from plug-in electric vehicles. The Obama administration also placed a strong emphasis on actions to address climate change and reduce U.S. GHG emissions, and the President’s Climate Action Plan was issued by the administration in 2013 (). In the Climate Action Plan then president Obama reiterated his 2009 commitment to reducing overall U.S. GHG emissions by 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020. To achieve such a goal will require that light-duty vehicles achieve significant reductions in petroleum use and corresponding GHG emissions. As noted above, more stringent fuel economy standards for light-duty vehicles have been enacted, and stricter fuel consumption standards for medium- and heavy-duty trucks have also been promulgated. Very recently, at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference, Conference of the Parties, Twenty-first session (COP-21), the United States and other countries reached a historic international agreement to holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above preindustrial levels and to aim to reach global peaking of GHG emissions as soon as possible. The intent of this agreement was for the United States to achieve an economy-wide target of reducing its GHG emissions by 26 to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025 and to make best efforts to reduce them by 28 percent () and reach 83 percent reductions by 2050. Other initiatives by the Obama administration included the development of electric supply technologies with reduced GHG emissions as well as incentives for their deployment. As pointed out in , if a large-scale penetration of BEVs or PHEVs takes place, then the goal of reducing GHGs significantly will require an electricity production system that reduces such emissions significantly compared to the current U.S. electric power system. In the past few years, the automotive marketplace has also seen a dramatic change in the diversity of new and advanced automotive technologies emerging, in large part stimulated by the increasing CAFE standards as well as the ZEV mandates, and the improvements that have occurred in batteries, motors, and power See, e.g., . ""1 Introduction."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2017. Review of the Research Program of the U.S. DRIVE Partnership: Fifth Report. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/24717. electronic components for use in vehicles. There are now many plug-in electric vehicle models (e.g., the Bolt, Leaf, plug-in Prius, Tesla, and Volt) being offered with substantial battery storage incorporating electrified power trains including pure electrics, that is, BEVs, as well as PHEVs (which also include an internal combustion engine [ICE]). The cost of these vehicles still remains high compared to their conventional ICE counterparts. In addition, a limited number of vehicles with electrified power trains using fuel cells and hydrogen stored on board are being made available. For example, Toyota has made the fuel cell vehicle Mirai available in California and plans on a production run of 3,000 in 2017, and it plans on a smaller fuel cell vehicle by 2019 in Japan, anticipating that it could be selling 30,000 vehicles per year globally by 2020 (). Hyundai is offering the Tucson fuel cell vehicle for lease in California, and Honda is offering leases for the fuel cell vehicle Clarity. Toyota has announced its intention to have all its vehicles be carbon free by 2050. One major impediment to a broad availability of fuel cell vehicles continues to be the lack of a hydrogen delivery and refueling infrastructure for providing fuel to these vehicles, as discussed later in . As pointed out in , it is likely that in the coming decades there will be a diversity of vehicles and fuels that are commercialized. Some options are lower risk and nearer term than others, and they all face different technical, cost, and market risks. These issues have been explored in depth in other reports and will not be repeated here (see, for example, ,; ,, , ,, ,, ,, ,; ). These studies have concluded that, given the high-risk and uncertain nature of many of these technologies and the immense challenge of achieving deep reductions in GHGs and petroleum use, an R&D strategy pursuing a portfolio of possible technological options is the most prudent approach (). Trends in Vehicle Automation and Smart Transportation Technologies that have been developed independent of the Partnership and that are being pursued for reasons other than support of Partnership goals will nevertheless influence achievement of those goals. These emerging technologies include the following: Deep learning technology, a variant of artificial intelligence, allows inference from the accumulation of experience. Advanced computer chips, like NVIDIA’s recently announced “Xavier,” are beginning to close in on the standard of excellence set by Google: 50 trillion operations per second at under 10 watts of power.

National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2017. Review of the Research Program of the U.S. DRIVE Partnership: Fifth Report. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/24717. Superior sensor technology on board the vehicle can relieve the computational burden by providing more precise data about immediate traffic conditions. These technologies have advanced rapidly since the Academies’ fourth review of the U.S. DRIVE Partnership and now have the capability to change the urban transportation system in ways that help realize the goals of the U.S. DRIVE Partnership. These advances have occurred largely outside the U.S. DRIVE Partnership. This section summarizes the manner in which vehicle and systems technologies might change to achieve these vehicle advancements, especially within the urban transportation system. These changes can be summarized under the rubric (CAVs), a term that encompasses a range of technological and infrastructure developments that will allow mainly self-operated vehicles to communicate with each other and with their surrounding environment. The term “connected” refers to vehicles acting in concert via computer/intelligence applications, while “autonomous” refers to a range of computerized functions that assist drivers with tasks like lane keeping and adaptive cruise control and that might eventually relieve human drivers from all operating tasks. was developed by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) to show how automation might develop in stages, ranging from a scale of 0 to 5 representing the level of automation, and illustrating how those levels might evolve. Levels 0 to 2 have the human driver monitoring the driving environment, while levels 3 to 5 involve an automated driving system that monitors the driving environment. The figure shows how the human driver and the system execute the various functions of the vehicle: steering and acceleration/deceleration; monitoring the driving environment; fallback performance of the dynamic driving task; and the system capability for various driving modes. Clearly, these levels will occur in stages, with level 1 already occurring in new vehicles. Five implications seem most important for U.S. DRIVE: With the aggregation of human populations in urban areas, especially the large mega-cities, optimized service from shared, autonomous, plug-in electric vehicles (possibly hydrogen too) could do much to achieve the environmental and energy goals of the U.S. DRIVE Partnership. Most discernible pathways through the transition will require the active participation of metropolitan transportation authorities, who can also be considered to be customers for automated mobility. Solutions are likely to reflect the local economic, demographic, and cultural characteristics of each jurisdiction. The safety of vehicle occupants and bystanders has become a primary concern of regulators, and the NHTSA has recently released guidelines that provide a general framework for future safety requirements ( ""1 Introduction."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2017. Review of the Research Program of the U.S. DRIVE Partnership: Fifth Report. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/24717. ""1 Introduction."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2017. Review of the Research Program of the U.S. DRIVE Partnership: Fifth Report. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/24717. ). These standards will influence the markets in which level 4 and 5 automated vehicles first deploy and set the pace of that deployment. A second issue for the fully automated vehicles (levels 4 and 5 in the SAE levels of automation in ) concerns the transition, when the CAVs must share the limited roadway space with human drivers. The automated vehicles (always rational, attentive, and unemotional) must compete for right of way with human-driven vehicles (sometimes rational, frequently inattentive, and often aggressive). In many traffic situations, humans and automated systems must make joint decisions under levels of uncertainty that cannot be programmed in advance. The issue is less safety than the level of services that a fully automated vehicle can provide. Emerging business models for innovation are being built around ad hoc organizations termed “innovation ecosystems.” These ecosystems can serve well in markets where technological advances occur rapidly and unpredictably and where customer demand is highly uncertain (). Many innovation ecosystems are being built through the acquisition of startup companies by industry incumbents: for example, Ford has invested $182 million in Pivotal Software, a cloud-computing venture; and Google has acquired four startup companies with the deep learning technologies since 2013, namely, DeepMind, Vision Factory, Dark Blue Labs, and DNNresearch. These new innovation models can move technology into the marketplace more rapidly than the traditional R&D model and so are relevant to the members of the Partnership. The U.S. DRIVE Partnership is not funded as a line item in the federal budget. As discussed in and noted in the current chapter, it is a means for exchanging information among the partners, eliciting various opinions on R&D directions, and helping to identify potential duplicative efforts and set targets for DOE technology development. Thus, it does not have a budget. The precompetitive R&D is under the control of DOE and, as noted in this chapter, the two main DOE offices that conduct technology R&D for light-duty vehicles are the VTO and the Fuel Cell Technologies Office (FCTO). The Vehicle Technologies Office was funded at a level of about $280 million in fiscal year (FY) 2015 and $310 million in FY 2016. The VTO pursues R&D not only for light-duty vehicle technologies but also for medium- and heavy-duty vehicles. The Fuel Cell Consider a CAV entering New York’s Holland Tunnel, for example. To enter the city through this tunnel, motorists first queue up in eight lanes for the tollbooths. After paying, the traveled way reduces quickly to two lanes. The rules by which human drivers assign themselves priority reflect individual behaviors and hence are ambiguous. Humans are adept at navigating such ambiguities; robots are not. Fully driverless cars could be at a serious disadvantage in competition with a majority of human-driven vehicles. ""1 Introduction."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2017. Review of the Research Program of the U.S. DRIVE Partnership: Fifth Report. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/24717. Technologies Office was funded at a level of about $97 million in FY 2015 and $101 million in FY 2016. In reviewing the efforts and projects in these offices associated with the Partnership, the committee reviewed projects that the Partnership defined as associated with helping to meet its goals. The DOE budgets of various R&D activities within these two offices will be presented in the various sections in that discuss the technologies. COMMITTEE APPROACH AND ORGANIZATION OF THIS REPORT The statement of task for this committee is as follows: Review the challenging high-level technical goals and timetables for government and industry R&D efforts, which address such areas as (a) integrated systems analysis; (b) fuel cell power systems; (c) hydrogen storage systems; (d) hydrogen production and distribution technologies necessary for the viability of hydrogen-fueled vehicles; (e) the technical basis for codes and standards; (f) electric propulsion systems; (g) lightweight materials; (h) electric energy storage systems; (i) vehicle-to-grid interaction; and (j) advanced combustion and emission control systems for internal combustion engines. Review and evaluate progress and program directions since the Phase 4 review toward meeting the Partnership’s technical goals, and examine ongoing research activities and their relevance to meeting the goals of the Partnership. Examine and comment on the overall balance and adequacy of the research and development effort, and the rate of progress, in light of the technical objectives and schedules for each of the major technology areas. Examine and comment, as necessary, on the appropriate role for federal involvement in the various technical areas under development, especially in light of activities ongoing in the private sector or in the states. Examine and comment on the Partnership’s strategy for accomplishing its goals, especially in the context of ongoing developments across the portfolio of advanced vehicle technologies (e.g., biofuels, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, electric vehicles), the recent enactment of legislation on corporate average fuel economy standards for light-duty vehicles, and possible legislation on carbon emissions. Other issues that the committee might address include: (a) program management and organization; (b) the process for setting milestones, research directions, and making Go/No Go decisions; (c) collaborative activities needed to meet the Partnership’s goals (e.g., among the various offices and programs in DOE, the U.S. Department of Transportation, USCAR, the fuels industry, electric power sector, universities, and other parts of the private sector [such as venture capitalists], and others); and (d) other topics that the committee finds important to comment on related to the success of the Partnership to meet its technical goals. Review and assess the actions that have been taken in response to recommendations from the Phase 4 review of the U.S. DRIVE Partnership. Write a report documenting its findings and recommendations. The committee met four times in face-to-face meetings to hear presentations from DOE and industry representatives involved in the Partnership and to discuss insights gained from the presentations and the written material gathered by the committee, and to work on drafts of its report (see for a list of committee meetings and presentations). The committee established subgroups ""1 Introduction."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2017. Review of the Research Program of the U.S. DRIVE Partnership: Fifth Report.

The committee subgroups also held several conference calls and site visits to collect information on technology development and other program issues. Some members of the committee also attended DOE’s Annual Merit Review (AMR) or served as AMR reviewers in June 2016. Although the committee organized itself into subgroups, the entire committee participated in the final report and the findings and recommendations were agreed to by the whole committee. The Partnership also provided responses to the recommendations from the NRC Phase 4 report, and these are included in the National Academies public access file. DOE budget information included in this report was collected from presentations made to the committee (see ) as well as from information provided by the Partnership to committee questions. The information gathered enabled the committee to compose and reach consensus on this report. The Summary presents the committee’s main findings and recommendations. This chapter () provides background on the Partnership and on its organization. examines the management of the Partnership and the decision-making processes. looks more closely at R&D for the various vehicle and fuel technologies that are of interest to the Partnership.

Review of the Research Program of the U.S. DRIVE Partnership: Fifth Report follows on four previous reviews of the FreedomCAR and Fuel Partnership, which was the predecessor of the U.S. DRIVE Partnership. The U.S. DRIVE (Driving Research and Innovation for Vehicle Efficiency and Energy Sustainability) vision, according to the charter of the Partnership, is this: American consumers have a broad range of affordable personal transportation choices that reduce petroleum consumption and significantly reduce harmful emissions from the transportation sector. Its mission is as follows: accelerate the development of pre-competitive and innovative technologies to enable a full range of efficient and clean advanced light-duty vehicles (LDVs), as well as related energy infrastructure. The Partnership focuses on precompetitive research and development (R&D) that can help to accelerate the emergence of advanced technologies to be commercialization-feasible. The guidance for the work of the U.S. DRIVE Partnership as well as the priority setting and targets for needed research are provided by joint industry/government technical teams. This structure has been demonstrated to be an effective means of identifying high-priority, long-term precompetitive research needs for each technology with which the Partnership is involved. Technical areas in which research and development as well as technology validation programs have been pursued include the following: internal combustion engines (ICEs) potentially operating on conventional and various alternative fuels, automotive fuel cell power systems, hydrogen storage systems (especially onboard vehicles), batteries and other forms of electrochemical energy storage, electric propulsion systems, hydrogen production and delivery, and materials leading to vehicle weight reductions.

633f1d1e-4c29-4acc-93e8-d2b0f65576c2,"Global Developments in Sustainable Architecture Design: India Global Developments in Sustainable Architecture Design: India Introduction Sustainable architecture is a major focus to the human response towards inherited environmental degradation. This paper will look into the present scenario of sustainable architecture design in India, highlighting the different approach taken by the developers in the country to meet the goals. India is known to possess some of the great vernacular and traditional buildings throughout the historical timeline which took into account the aspects without much aid from mechanical measures. “Sustainable in India is polarized into two approaches - the technology intensive ‘green’ architecture and low cost ‘alternative’ architecture” (Mathur ). Contemporary architecture faces a constant tussle between the vernacular pathway of construction and modernised implementations on the architecture design. With such a rich context and intelligent and unparalleled techniques it is unsustainable to look away from it. Although India is lending the sustainable solutions and strategies from the west and amalgamating them in the scenario, while on the other side of the coin; another fraction of minds is developing the vernacular techniques used in the past. As documented by researchers from NIT, Bhopal as the conclusion to their research regarding the learnings from the tribal settlements: The tribal settlements and habitat demonstrate an economical use of native natural building resources, and respond to climatic conditions using eco-friendly design principles that provide human comfort. These design principles are consistent with the form, orientation and materiality of the buildings.

Due to ample amount of sunlight bestowed on from the nature to majority of the country it calls for suitable measures to harness this resource. On the other hand many of the western measures to practice sustainability had been drooped when applied to the Indian architecture design calling for the new measures which can be true to the context and microclimate. Although these modernised buildings and developments are attracting the customer, but regular power cut-cuts and grid failures had proved the huge flux of energy used by air conditioners to maintain the living environment in them. Sometimes termed as the development of the ‘new vernacular’, this practice had successfully delivered some of the India’s most efficient and effective buildings to carry the country forward on the path of sustainability. Is the embrace of ESD [environmentally sustainable design] principles the panacea that many put forward? I will discuss the impact environmental concerns have had on multiple aspects of contemporary architecture and the way in which ethics have influenced the greater public perception on sustainability.

The greater push for sustainable design may have seen creativity diminish in that the functionality has now again taken precedent over from. Mother Environment: Exploiting Mother Nature, And The Environment The environment is being degraded as people build modern houses and encroach in to water catchment areas. Globalization, improve in technology and other modern activities have caused harm to the environment. Pollution is currently the key issue causing environmental degradation. History informs us that in the past pollution was absent since the environment was maintained natural unlike currently where environmental pollution is a global concern. From the same history course it is observed that the environment is the most crucial thing which makes it possible for survival of humans and other organisms. Well-recognized cities worldwide have built over the years great buildings with a variety of designs and concepts however consequently too much building has been making grievous decrease on energy efficiency. Now, “Green Architecture” has been popularized and as a result a modicum of energy efficiency has increased and also it has substantiated a new perspective, a new versatile way on architecture. Now days, the world is intended to be in a worst scenario ever imagined. Climates, global warming and furthermore problems. However, I have noticed new changes, universally speaking, yet renewable energy has also been popularized to our world and I addition, it became part of Sustainable Architecture. Passive Design Principles in Vernacular Architecture and Their Reinterpretation in Contemporary Architecture: The Case of Diyarbakir City in Turkey Vernacular houses formed over centuries by culture, nature, and human itself. Passive design elements' minimum environmental impact and their efficiency make vernacular houses sustainable. Contemporary houses consume resources carelessly unlike vernacular houses. However, resource depletion and the highly negative environmental impact of contemporary houses became one the biggest problem of the architecture world. Reinterpretation of old passive design principles in modern architecture by combining them with modern technology and techniques with the consideration of the conditions of our age, may Impact of Lean Manufacturing and Environmental Management on Business Performance  Lean manufacturing is a collection of tactical methods that helps in eliminating non-value added activities (waste) for delivering quality products with least cost at a greater efficiency.  Lean implementation is rapidly expanding throughout manufacturing and service sectors as a core business strategy to develop a competitive advantage.  The focus of lean manufacturing is on driving rapid, continual improvement in cost, quality, service, and delivery, significant environmental benefits typically ""ride the coattails"" or occur incidentally as a result of these production-focused efforts.  Lean production techniques create a culture of employee empowerment, and waste minimization, continuous improvement, which is very compatible with organizational characteristics encouraged under environmental management systems (EMS) and pollution prevention (P2). Other related business strategies such as ""Six Sigma"" can have the same effect. The industry of Civil Engineering produces a lot of unwanted waste and pollutions. There are solid waste, air and even sound pollution during construction. In addition, for most structures, it will eventually be demolished and materials become waste. This is the reason why the topic sustainability has been so popular these years. The definition of sustainable development by Brundtland, 1987, is 'Sustainable development meets the economic, social and environmental needs and interests of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs and interests.' Sustainability is a concept with a diverse array of meanings and definitions – a widely used glamorous, ambiguous, ambivalent and vague concept that is used by different stakeholder groups in various ways. Presumably to avoid noodling over a terminology or to avoid the confrontation with a definition, most widely the concept is broken down a planning process (c.f. e.g. Döring & Muraca, 2010). That is why most common sustainability is understood as sustainable development.1 Sustainable development adapted after the Brundtlandt Report 1987, is a planned, aim- and process oriented procedure that meets the needs of today’s generations without endangering the needs of future generations and world regions (Ott & Döring 2004, 2006).2 The principle of sustainability describes the efforts of the international community, all countries and people to create equal opportunities for development by explicitly taking into account the interests of future generations. However, civil engineering needs to contribute more to sustainable development along the whole chain of production and consumption, including: • Obtaining and refining natural resources • Prepar... ... middle of paper ... ... making is energy and carbon intensive but significant progress has been made to reduce this (Sansom 2013). Low carbon buildings and structures with good BREEAM (Building research establishment’s environmental assessment method) rating are effortlessly attainable using steel in construction. CONCLUSION In conclusion, a world full of sustainable structures are the ultimate goal for civil engineers and structural designers. With the rapid evolution of technology, achieving this goal should not be a difficult feat. However, I believe that there is plenty more needed to be done especially in the area of utilizing the right resources to make a cleaner, safer and more sustainable world. Features such as air purification, energy saving, uniform cooling were brought to the fore for consumer focus. The value proposition was how a slew of intelligent features led to responsible usage of ACs and thus less expenditure. Voltas had conducted extensive research and found that consumers wanted more than just cooling from their ACs. 2011: All Weather ACs Voltas was once again in the thick of things when it launched its new range of All Weather ACs. The option for climate control was a novelty in an otherwise predictable segment. Assessment 1: The Dissertation Project Description The second part is going to specifically measure the aims and objectives of this research and its correlation with human geography. The existed relationship between government applying new technology in the energy industry and inhabitants suffered from environment deterioration is at odds. Therefore, using a geography research method to test the hypotheses is the essence of a master dissertation project. Research Theme This research is produced based on the ‘energy trilemma’ theory, and the central part of this inquiry is a further investigation of a contradictory relationship between energy supply and the surroundings. As a human oriented research, it will focus on people’s awareness and response to a controversial energy production technology, hydraulic fracturing, and how could a potential risk of contaminated environment reduce the standard of living of inhabitants in North England.

Because it is UNCORRECTED material, please consider the following text as a useful but insufficient proxy for the authoritative book pages. 25 The industry survey data provide an overview of what airports are doing to plan and to imple- ment GHG reduction projects. To complement this information, airport staff were interviewed to learn more about specific GHG reduction efforts and to detail those experiences for others in the industry. The author started with the 125 GHG reduction strategies listed in ACRP Report 56 and selected specific strategies that have been implemented by airports since the reportâs publication in 2011. A minimum of 10 case examples was set on the basis of direction provided in the problem statement, and examples were identified to represent a variety of airport sizes and geographic locations. The case examples were developed from initial airport responsiveness and additional case examples were selected on the basis of those already prepared, with the goal of providing a diversity of experiences. A list of the case examples is provided in Table 3-1. The table includes the airport name, the airportâs FAA identification code, the airportâs location, the airportâs FAA hub or classification of size, the FAA region it is located in, the GHG initiative profiled, the emission Scope (e.g., 1, 2, or 3) that is applicable, and the practice category and identifier number from ACRP Report 56. The individual case examples follow in detail and include a summary table with some of the same information plus the following: â¢ Financial information indicating sources of funding â¢ Rankings for the practice relative to implementation, operations, and maintenance as con- tained in the ACRP Report 56 fact sheets â¢ Emission reduction estimates when provided by the airport or attributable to an independent source In Table 3-1, the order that the case examples are listed is based on general ease of implementationâfrom simple to complex. This is also the order that the case examples are pre- sented in this chapterâthey are organized by relative complexity, with the simplest practices applicable to a larger portion of airports presented first. The location of the airports and the types of airports that participated in the case examples are shown in Figure 3-1. The final list of 17 case examples includes 21 airports with all of the FAA regions represented. The case examples include practices implemented to reduce a range of Scope 1, 2, and 3 emis- sions. Of the 13 initiative categories presented in ACRP Report 56, seven are included in the case examplesârenewable energy (five case examples), energy management (four case examples), ground transportation (three case examples), and business planning (three case examples) are covered the most.

According to the Electrical Test- ing Laboratory, a certified 1W LED fixture is five times more energy efficient than traditional quartz-incandescent elevated fixtures, resulting in an immediate savings in electricity (Woods, 2004). This translates to fewer energy-related emissions as well as lower electricity bills for the airport. Additionally, LED lighting can reduce airfield maintenance requirements because it has a significantly longer life expectancy (Burns, Dennie, Elshetwy, Lean, and Vigilante, 2015). John Glenn Columbus International Airport (CMH) was at the forefront of the industry when it decided to incorporate LED lighting into a runway reconstruction project. As the first airport to install an all high-intensity LED runway lighting system (Kouril and May, 2014/2015), CMH encountered some initial hurdles that required adjustments. The airportâs cooperative efforts with both the FAA and lighting manufacturers were key to demonstrating the technol- ogy and to standardizing operational procedures. Many airports have since progressed with converting runway lights to LEDs; however, FAA restrictions on using AIP funds for this type of project remain. Project Details The LED lighting project for the reconstructed Runway 10R/28L, also known as the south runway at CMH, encompasses all lighting associated with the airfield including centerline, edge lights (both flush-mounted on the pavement as well as elevated adjacent to the pavement), touch- down (TDZ), taxiway, runway guard lights (RGL), and all signage (see Figure 3-2). In addition Airport Type: Medium Hub GHG Protocol Emissions Type: â¢ Scope 2: Implementing energy efficiency to reduce the amount of electricity purchased from off-site providers FAA Region: Great Lakes Financing: â¢ AIP match â¢ Rebates from the utility company ACRP Report 56 Category: Energy Management ACRP Report 56 Fact Sheet Indicative Values: â¢ Implementation timeframe: 2 of 4 â¢ Estimated annual operations and maintenance (O&M): 1 of 4 Estimated GHG Reduction: â¢ 55% reduction in electricity consumption Energy Management EM-17: Install LED Runway and Taxiway Lighting 3.1 LED Runway Lighting Installation; John Glenn Columbus International Airport (CMH), OH Case Examples 29 to LED lighting, the project integrated several other GHG-reducing elements including recycled pavement, limited construction vehicle trips, and hard-wired construction lamps that replaced traditional diesel-fueled lights. Upon successful completion of the south runway, Runway 10L/28R (the north runway) was retrofitted with LEDs as well. Implementation Between 2009 and 2013, CMH completed the replacement of its south runway by construct- ing a new runway and converting the old runway to a taxiway. Due to concerns over lack of heat radiation for melting snow and ice, lack of an infrared signal detectable by pilots when off at night, and the difference in brightness, the FAA had not yet certified the use of LED lights for airfield runway operations, and therefore, this aspect of the project was ineligible for AIP fund- ing. CMH opted to include the LED component as part of its own direct cost share. This decision catalyzed the FAA certification process and approval of commercial edge and centerline LED lights was completed prior to the installation of the system for the south runway. CMHâs work with the lighting manufacturer and the FAA enabled other airports to install LED airfield light- ing, funding these projects with AIP grants. However, the FAA has since restricted specific air- field lights from AIP funding eligibility, as noted in the AIP Handbook, specifically obstruction lights, approach lights, and high-intensity runway edge lights (FAA, 2014; K. Kodsi, personal communication, Jan. 30, 2019). The number of lights for the new runway was expanded by about one-third from the old run- way. Once installed, several operational changes were necessary. First, the brightness of the lights had to be decreased from that previously set for incandescent lights because of pilot complaints that the lights were too bright. It was determined thatâin most casesâLED lights should oper- ate one step below the level previously used for the incandescent lights. When the lights were first installed, snow impacts were expected to be inconsequential; there- fore, heating elements were thought unnecessary. However, after installation, snow impacts were greater than expected, and the LED lights were retrofitted by the manufacturer with âarctic kitsâ specifically designed to melt snow. On the basis of this experience, arctic kits were included with the expansion of LED lighting to the north runway. However, even with the arctic kits, all runway lights (both LED and incandescent) can be covered by heavy snow; these lights must be uncovered by plowing to meet FAA standards for maintaining runway visibility. Snow removal vehicles need to switch from a steel plow blade to a composite or rubber blade to minimize lamp damage. LED lights have a 7-year warranty and expected life is on average 10 years as compared to 1â2 years for incandescent light. The LED runway lights and the housing can be fully removed and replaced when needed. For edge and other lamps, the existing LED bulbs can simply be replaced with a new one. The number of repairs has decreased, reducing maintenance capital and labor costs, and minimizing disruption on the runway, which improves both labor efficiency and safety. Figure 3-2. LED runway lights at CMH. 30 Airport Greenhouse Gas Reduction Efforts Lessons Learned â¢ FAA does not allow a mix of incandescent and LED lighting on the airfield; therefore, an upgrade requires a comprehensive approach matched with a suitable investment. â¢ A heating element, such as the arctic kit, is necessary to ensure effective operation in the CMH climate. â¢ Light intensity levels for various LED operating conditions must be tested and established. â¢ Utility rebate programs are often available and should be considered to support financing. Effectiveness â¢ Electricity consumption on a per light basis decreased by about 55%. â¢ The number of lights for the new runway was expanded by about one-third from the old runway. Even with the increase in the total number of lights, LED technology resulted in a significant decrease in electricity consumption. Cobenefits â¢ Improved efficiency for operations and maintenance activities â¢ Flagship for promoting airport GHG reduction measures Other Airports Implementing this Measure â¢ Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL) in Georgia switched more than 16,000 runway and taxiway lights to LED in 2015. â¢ Nineteen-year old runway lighting at Chippewa County International Airport (CIU) in Michigan was upgraded to LED in 2018. â¢ Springdale Municipal Airport (ASG), Arkansas, opened a newly paved runway with LED runway lights in early 2019. Case Examples 31 Introduction Airports operate and maintain a variety of buildings and associated facilities used to support customer and tenant aviation activities. Each of those facilities requires heating, cooling, and electricity to safely and efficiently support all functions of airport operations. An important first step in determining where energy efficiency measures can be best and most effectively imple- mented is to conduct a study of all energy systems. Customarily referred to as an energy audit, the study accounts for all heating, cooling, and lighting systems, their age for consideration of useful life, and other characteristics to determine how they are operating and what could be done to improve their efficiency. In recognition of the economic and environmental value of energy efficiency improvements, the U.S. Congress authorized the use of AIP funds for energy audits and subsequent improve- ments in the 2012 FAA Modernization and Reform Act. St. Louis Lambert International Airport (STL) offers an example of an airport that has prepared an energy audit program, implemented improvements, and received financial and environmental benefits from those actions. Project Details STL pursued a number of different initiatives that led to the development and implementa- tion of an energy efficiency program, including the following: â¢ GHG inventories in 2005, 2010, 2013, and 2015 â¢ Environmental management system (EMS) in 2012 â¢ City of St. Louis Sustainability in 2013 Airport Type: Medium Hub GHG Protocol Emissions Type: â¢ Scope 1 and 2: Implementing energy efficiency to reduce the amount of electricity purchased from off-site providers FAA Region: Central Financing: â¢ AIP match â¢ Rebates from the utility company ACRP Report 56 Category: Performance Measurement ACRP Report 56 Fact Sheet Indicative Values: â¢ Implementation timeframe: 1 of 4 â¢ Estimated annual O&M: 1 of 4 Estimated GHG Reduction: â¢ 8.1m kWh of electricity avoided annually Performance Measurement PM-02: Perform Energy Audits 3.2 Energy Audit and Efficiency Program; St. Louis Lambert International (STL), MO 32 Airport Greenhouse Gas Reduction Efforts These efforts generated a list of energy efficiency projects, the first of which was completed in 2010. STL partnered with its local utility, Ameren Missouri, to identify projects and apply for cash rebates after completion. The airport receives cash from the utility to help offset the capital costs invested and it also saves money into the future through reduced energy costs. The number of projects completed by STL and the associated cost savings on an annual basis are included in Table 3-2. Subsequently, an energy audit was undertaken by the Electric Power Research Institute in 2015. The audit will be used to support future efficiency projects and potential funding. Implementation It is customary for planning and implementation to be conducted as parallel processes, each learning from the other. This was the case when STL was planning an energy efficiency program and accessing rebates from Ameren for the implementation of efficiency projects. The first projects, completed in 2010 and 2011, involved replacing T12 interior fluorescent light bulbs in the concourses with more efficient T8 bulbs. These projects required little research as the EPA was phasing out T12 bulbs because of their lower efficiency and their mercury content. At the same time, STL was using the initial projects to become familiar with the Ameren Missouriâs BizSaversÂ® rebate program, and its requirements. As STL began developing complementary planning efforts including the 2012 EMS, the 2013 City Sustainability Plan, and GHG inventories, it also set up a utility task force to reduce con- sumption of energy and water. From 2013 through 2015, STL implemented 31 energy efficiency projects and submitted them for rebates through the BizSavers Program, which returned to the airport $490,642. In addition to the immediate cash payment, Ameren estimated that the efficiency projects would reduce STL energy costs by an average of $480,000 annually. Many of the projects have involved replacing older light bulbs and fixtures with LED lighting as well as installing smart building devices such as occupancy sensors and programmable thermo- stats. The lighting projects were prioritized on the basis of the age of the fixture as well as the estimated return on investment for upgrading to more energy efficient products. The next phase of the program is targeting the replacement of building systems, for example, chilled water pumps. STL is also pursuing the Building Operator CertificationÂ® Program to bench- mark energy efficiency performance. As an indication of program success, STL received the Missouri Governorâs Energy Efficiency Award in 2016 for its reduction in energy use. Every kilowatt-hour of electricity avoided by STL has a comparatively greater impact on GHG reductions than in other parts of the country because 75% of the electricity in the grid in its Year Project Count Cash Incentive Annual kWh Savings Annual Bill Savings 2010 1 $9,162 142,683 $11,885 2011 2 $24,439 520,224 $43,335 2013 6 $23,804 424,138 $35,331 2014 10 $67,085 1,130,327 $94,156 2015 12 $332,486 6,637,416 $552,897 Table 3-2.

Using EPAâs eGrid emissions rate for the Southeast Region, STLâs energy efficiency efforts have resulted in approximately 8.4 million pounds of CO2e annually. Lessons Learned â¢ It is often better to take advantage of opportunities to implement even if the planning process is not yet complete. â¢ While utility companies have different programs, airports should investigate financial oppor- tunities associated with energy conservation. Effectiveness â¢ The effectiveness of the project is measured by the amount of energy electricity consumption that has been reducedâit is measured to be 8.1 million kWh annually. Cobenefits â¢ The projects have strengthened coordination between the airport and other city departments. â¢ A working partnership with a utility has led to collaboration on a renewable energy project.

One significant advantage of solar is that the panels are easily integrated into the existing built environment. They can be placed on building rooftops that are not otherwise effectively using the space. Alternatively, they can be installed on the ground in unused airfield areas or on top of canopies to double as shaded parking for customers and staff. Most airports already consume a lot of electricity, so it is easy to connect solar to the existing network to provide an ongoing supply. While some smaller systems are configured to produce electricity that is consumed directly on-site, most are larger projects constructed by third-party businesses that own and operate the facilities and sell the electricity to users of the grid. Under such arrangements, the airport is the host of the facility and it often receives lease payments for the use of airport property, but the âgreenâ power is sent directly to the electricity grid and not purchased and used by the airport. More recently, airports are leasing the land and purchasing the clean energy generated to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. SMF commenced operations of such a facility in October 2017 to advance its ambitious emission reduction objectives. Project Details The solar PV facility has a total nameplate capacity of 7.9 MW. It is a single axis tracking system, meaning that the solar panels track the daily path of the sun to maximize electricity generation (see Figure 3-3). The system comprises two arrays: a 3.38 MW ground-mounted system on a brownfield on the airport landside east of the terminal; and a 4.52 MW ground- mounted system on the airport airside north of the terminal. These sites were selected in part 3.3 Solar PV System; Sacramento International Airport (SMF), CA Airport Type: Medium Hub GHG Protocol Emissions Type: â¢ Scope 2: Purchasing solar generated electricity to reduce the amount of electricity purchased from off-site providers FAA Region: Western/Pacific Financing: â¢ Third-party partner financier â¢ Airport staff time ACRP Report 56 Category: Renewable Energy ACRP Report 56 Fact Sheet Indicative Values: â¢ Implementation timeframe: 2 of 4 â¢ Estimated annual O&M: 2 of 4 Estimated GHG Reduction: â¢ 11,535 MT of Co2e per year Renewable Energy RE-02: Install Building-Mounted or Ground-Mounted Solar Photovoltaic (PV) Panels Energy Management EM-04: Enter into a Green Power Purchasing Agreement Case Examples 35 because of their close proximity to the main airport facilities to reduce the cost of long, inter- connecting electrical lines. The east array provides power directly to Terminal A, the parking garage, and airfield lighting. The north array powers Terminal B and the automated people mover. The system is owned and operated by Clearway Energy, which leases the land from the air- port and sells it the electricity through a power purchase agreement (PPA). The PPA specifies that Clearway will guarantee a specific amount of electricity supply each year and the airport will pay Clearway for the electricity at a rate of $0.0735/kilowatt hour (kWh) over a 25-year period. The design amount of electricity supplied, 15,500,000 kWh, accounts for 38% of the airportâs current needs. Implementation The solar PV project was an employee-led initiative. All of the research to support the project concept was conducted by airport staff, including preparing a siting and feasibility study using similar models developed by other Sacramento County departments. The airport staff learned from the experience of other airports, in particular Fresno-Yosemite International Airport (FAT), and the staff used the information provided to assess siting options. Among the primary program design factors were the following: â¢ The airport wanted to consume the renewable energy to reduce its carbon footprint, which necessitated a PPA model with the third-party developer. â¢ Learning from the experience of others, the airport understood that the sites needed to be located near existing airport electrical vaults to minimize project costs and to keep the price of electricity under a PPA competitive. â¢ The airport determined that no outside party (developer or consultant) could identify the best location for a project because this decision required knowledge only the airport staff had acquired. The airport was driven by a sustainability approach requiring projects to be economical, while also serving environmental and social objectives. From an environmental perspective, the airport understood Sacramentoâs status as being one of the worst metropolitan areas in the country for air quality and the need to pursue projects that resulted in measurable improve- ments. From a social perspective, the airport saw a large-scale solar project as a great oppor- tunity to educate the public about clean energy. The economic benefits of the project became Figure 3-3. Solar PV at SMF. 36 Airport Greenhouse Gas Reduction Efforts clear when the project bid was released and the selected bidder could offer the airport a price of electricity that is 29% less than its existing rate. The airport was guided by its 2004 Master Plan, which identifies the need to implement emis- sion reduction projects. As a department of the county, it also contributed to the development of the County Climate Action Plan. The airport has recently developed a Sustainable Manage- ment Plan to advance its sustainability goals. Lessons Learned â¢ Feasibility of solar can be readily assessed independently by the airport. â¢ Learn from the experiences of other airports. â¢ Communicate with the FAA regional office early and often. Effectiveness â¢ The effectiveness of the project is measured by how much clean electricity the project has generated and consumed by the airport. The total amount of electricity used in year 1 was 15,100,00 kWh, which is just about the design capacity. Cobenefits â¢ The educational benefit has been considerable. The solar projects are visible from the termi- nal buildings and the long-term parking lot. There are two large educational displays, one in each terminal, which provide information on the amount of electricity being generated and the equivalent amount of environmental benefit including barrels of oil avoided or cars removed from the roads. Other Airports Implementing this Measure â¢ Barnstable Municipal Airport (HYA), Massachusetts, opened a ground-mounted solar PV project in 2015. â¢ Pierre Municipal Airport (PIR), South Dakota, hosts a ground-mounted solar project that opened in 2017; it generates green power for the cityâs electric utility and its customers. â¢ Tucson International Airport (TUS) in Arizona completed, in 2017, a large parking canopy covered with solar panels to keep passengersâ cars cool and to generate electricity for the airport. Case Examples 37 Introduction As highlighted in this report, there is a considerable amount of activity at airports with a high potential for generating greenhouse gas emissions. Emissions may come directly from the air- port operator; they may result from the airportâs purchase of electricity from a regional power plant; or they are produced by tenants and customers using the airport. Before an airport can determine steps for reducing its emissions, it must first prepare an inventory of the activi- ties producing emissions and an inventory of how much GHG emissions these activities are generating. ACRP Report 11: Guidebook on Preparing Airport Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventories, published in 2009, provides airport operators with information useful to the development of individual GHG emission inventories. Airports of all geographic locations and sizes are developing greenhouse gas inventories not only to establish an emissions baseline, but also to set ambitious GHG emission reduction goals to guide future development projects. One clear example of a GHG inventory that accomplishes both of these objectives is one completed recently by PWM. Project Details In 2014, the PWM received an AIP grant to prepare a Sustainability Airport Master Plan (SAMP) under the FAAâs Pilot Program. The objective of the project was to integrate sustain- ability measures throughout the master planning process to ensure that future airport devel- opment considers economic viability, operational efficiency, social responsibility, and natural resource conservation (i.e., the airport sustainability framework referred to as EONS). With sustainability representing a core airport mission, the city of Portland would ensure that each project would consider reducing energy consumption, minimizing environmental impacts, and Business Planning BP-01: Use Greenhouse Gas Impact Evaluations as Decision-Making Criteria 3.4 Greenhouse Gas Inventory; Portland International Jetport (PWM), ME Airport Type: Small GHG Protocol Emissions Type: â¢ Scope 1: Quantify emissions controlled by airport and develop reduction strategies â¢ Scope 2: Quantify emissions associated with electricity purchases from the grid and develop reduction strategies â¢ Scope 3: Quantify emissions associated with nonairport-controlled activities and develop reduction strategies FAA Region: Eastern Financing: â¢ AIP ACRP Report 56 Category: Business Planning ACRP Report 56 Fact Sheet Indicative Values: â¢ Implementation schedule: 2 of 4 â¢ Estimated annual O&M: 1 of 4 Estimated GHG Reduction: Not applicable 38 Airport Greenhouse Gas Reduction Efforts shrinking the Jetportâs carbon footprint. The final SAMP, released in November 2016, included a broad goal for greenhouse gas emissions, a baseline emissions inventory, reduction targets, and plans for project implementation. Implementation PWM created a SAMP planning advisory committee (PAC) made up of key stakeholders to provide valuable input into the development of the SAMP. The PAC was made up of 24 members, including representatives from associated municipalities, tenants, pilot organizations, the FAA, the Maine Department of Transportation, and tourism agencies. The airport administration and its consultant team initially gathered input from the PAC as to the objectives of the plan, then structured meetings around topic areas and prepared working summaries for review and discus- sion. Regular updates were also provided to PWM tenants (airlines, concessionaires, and fixed- based operators) to ensure that their comments and concerns as organizations were addressed. When the PAC members were asked for input into the six focus areas of the SAMP, the topic of greenhouse gas emissions was selected as a priority. Stakeholders were asked to define the objectives of the plan in considering greenhouse gas emissions and this resulted in the following mission statement: Become a national airport leader in climate change mitigation by supporting the reduction of green- house gas emissions generated from Jetport-controlled and influenced sources. The project team then prepared a GHG emissions inventory using ACERT, which allows air- ports to input data from a variety of sourcesâfrom aircraft type and activity to airport ground vehicle type and activity as well as information on electricity and fuel consumptionâto estimate GHG emissions for any given time period. As part of the SAMP, PWM developed a baseline GHG inventory using data from 2015. From this starting point, PWM is able to evaluate per- formance relative to the baseline and progress toward reaching specific targets, including the following: â¢ Install preconditioned air at 100% of all loading bridges by 2018 â¢ Reduce Jetport-owned and controlled GHG emissions â¢ Work with the tenants to develop a baseline of the Jetportâs Scope 3 GHG emissions by 2018 The plan also identified sustainability actions by category including the following: â¢ Provide pre-conditioned air (PCA) at all commercial service aircraft gates â¢ Encourage tenants to procure alternative fuel and/or fuel-efficient ground support equipment â¢ Install public charging stations in the garage to accommodate electric vehicles â¢ Prepare an annual Jetport-wide greenhouse gas emissions inventory and voluntarily report the Jetportâs carbon performance Greenhouse gas reduction projects completed since 2016 include the installation of a 465-kW direct current solar PV facility on the existing canopy of the parking garage. Lessons Learned â¢ It is important to remain flexible. New opportunities arose and Jetport pursued funding for a solar project that was not a high priority during planning, but market opportunities changed. Effectiveness â¢ Effectiveness is measured by the level of participation in developing the sustainability plans as well as the ability to produce resulting projects, of which the solar project is one. Case Examples 39 Cobenefits â¢ Cobenefits of this measure include a strong opportunity to collaborate with the community on projects in which the PWM can demonstrate environmental leadership.

And, since more efficient energy use correlates to a direct reduction in fuel costs, the lesson is that projects aimed at reducing GHG by improved energy efficiency make good economic sense. With so many investment needs, however, the challenge facing airports is deciding when to use public funds to upgrade old lighting, heating, and cooling equipment to new, more energy- efficient ones. Cortez Municipal Airport (CEZ) provides a straight-forward example of a small airportâs decision-making process to upgrade its furnaces and demonstrates the environmental and economic benefits of taking that action. Project Details The project replaced three 25-year-old, natural gas burning furnaces in the terminal building with three new, higher efficiency models. The old units, two 50,000 BTU furnaces and one 75,000 BTU furnace, had operated with standing pilot lights and were about 65% efficient. These were replaced by three 60,000 BTU Trane Model XR95 units with auto ignition designated as 95% efficient, defined by the EPA as âhigh-efficiency.â Implementation CEZ had experienced both reliability and efficiency issues with its three terminal building furnaces, forcing staff to patch the vintage 1989 units together with duct tape during failures. While this approach deferred the immediate cost of replacement, it was clearly labor inefficient Energy Management EM-21: Install High-Efficiency Equipment and Controls 3.5 High-Efficiency Furnace Heating Project; Cortez Municipal Airport (CEZ), CO Airport Type: Nonhub GHG Protocol Emissions Type: â¢ Scope 1: Reduced combustion of natural gas from airport heating system FAA Region: Northwest/Mountain Financing: â¢ AIP ACRP Report 56 Category: Energy Management ACRP Report 56 Fact Sheet Indicative Values: â¢ Implementation timeframe: 2 of 4 â¢ Estimated annual O&M: 2 of 4 Estimated GHG Reduction: â¢ 30% decrease in heating-related GHGs Case Examples 41 and compromised building operations. As a consequence, the airport determined it was neces- sary to upgrade the equipment. Following a review of furnace options, CEZ budgeted for the replacement of the most prob- lematic unit with a high-efficiency model. The new unit was installed in winter 2014â15 to provide heating improvements for the remainder of that winter. The test with the new unit was very successful, resulting in greatly improved energy efficiency and operational reliability. This prompted CEZ to order two more units, which were installed prior to the start of the 2015â16 winter. The total investment cost of the three new furnaces was $8,670. The cost of gas for the last full year with the old furnaces was $2,483, while the cost of gas for the first full year of the new furnaces was $1,612, providing a first-year fuel savings of $868. On the basis of these numbers, the simple payback is about 10 years; however, overall savings will vary each winter based on fuel prices and weather demands. The systems have been operating effectively for the past three years without staff labor and operational concerns. Lessons Learned â¢ Replacing outdated furnaces with modern, efficient units that drop into existing heating sys- tems has clear and quantifiable benefits that reduce both energy costs and GHG emissions. â¢ Improvements to the efficiencies of heating systems are a feasible GHG reduction practice that can be adopted by airports of all sizes when replacements are necessary. â¢ Making a small investment to test a new heating unit is a practical first step in increasing energy efficiency. Effectiveness â¢ For this small, nonhub airport, effectiveness is measured in economic terms. The new high- efficiency furnace units will pay for themselves in natural gas cost savings in approximately 10 years. â¢ The annualized fuel utilization efficiency (AFUE) rating of the new furnaces is 95%, meaning that it requires approximately 30% less fuel for heating than the old, lower-efficiency units (EnergyStar, n.d.). The EPA certifies the AFUE rating of furnaces, with the highest category being 90â97% efficiency. This rigorous evaluation establishes a strong and universal standard for reducing GHG emissions. Cobenefits â¢ Savings in maintenance and labor, and an increase in passenger comfort and staff morale. â¢ Economic benefits that open the door to additional energy-saving practices. Other Airports Implementing this Measure â¢ In 2018, Rick Husband International Airport in Amarillo, Texas, replaced its old boiler system with five new boilers, increasing efficiency from 80% to 96%. â¢ In 2015, a major expansion of the terminal at Norman Mineta San Jose International Airport (SJC), California, allowed for the replacement of two boilers with three higher efficiency ones. â¢ In 2014, Albuquerque International Sunport (ABQ), New Mexico, received a VALE grant to replace aging boilers with higher efficiency models, reducing local emissions. 42 Airport Greenhouse Gas Reduction Efforts Introduction Temperatures rise throughout the day and peak in the afternoon, which prompts a spike in energy demand to keep buildings cool. As a consequence of supply and demand, power prices rise because of the increasing scarcity of power, which incentivizes energy conservation. One creative conservation option is to manage energy use by using and storing energy during low- cost periods and reducing use and deploying stored resources to meet needs during high-cost periods. This concept is referred to as load shedding. Austin-Bergstrom International Airport (AUS) implemented a thermal energy storage pro- gram nearly two decades ago during the airportâs construction. This case example demonstrates how the thermal storage program has been effective and how its implementation over time has allowed AUS to take advantage of new technologies and incentive programs. Project Details The project comprises two components: the installation of a thermal energy storage system, and participation in the energy utilityâs load shedding program. Implementation As part of the new terminal development program in the late 1990s, AUS installed a thermal energy storage (TES) system as supplemental cooling to that provided by chillers powered by the central utility plant. The electric utility, Austin Energy, incentivized the installation of TES by offering lower electricity rates to those customers that operate a TES during summer peak power demand. The cost of the electricity consumed during on-peak is twice that of the off-peak Energy Management EM-22: Integrate Thermal Storage into Heating and Cooling Systems 3.6 Austin Energy Load Shed, Thermal Energy Storage Program; Austin- Bergstrom International Airport (AUS), TX Airport Type: Medium GHG Protocol Emissions Type: â¢ Scope 1: Reduced combustion of natural gas from airport heating system FAA Region: Southwestern Financing: â¢ AIP for capital improvements â¢ Staff for program management ACRP Report 56 Category: Energy Management ACRP Report 56 Fact Sheet Indicative Values: â¢ Implementation timeframe: 3 of 4 â¢ Estimated annual O&M: 2 of 4 Estimated GHG Reduction: â¢ Not available Case Examples 43 period. Furthermore, the demand charge applied to the customerâs monthly bill for the entire year is derived from the highest peak demand recorded. Therefore, limiting peak demand not only saves money on the electricity consumed during the peak period, but also decreases the demand charge applied throughout the year. The TES tank at AUS is designed to deliver 3,900 gallons per minute (GPM) to meet a peak cooling load of 2,438 tons. The total thermal capacity of the tank is 15,000 ton-hours. During peak power demand periods, the chillers powered by electricity are turned off and chilled water is drawn from the TES tank to cool the terminal. During off-peak power periods, the chillers cool the terminal and recharge the chilled water in the TES tank. On the basis of existing and near future demand, the TES has capacity to provide 3.8 hours of cooling during peak conditions. AUS has been considering enhancements to the TES to accommodate passenger growth and proposed terminal expansions; however, on the basis of return on investment (ROI) and opera- tional requirements, AUS decided not to construct a second tank, but rather pursue alternative programs to further shed load during peak periods. AUS has also been participating in Austin Energyâs Load Cooperative Program. During curtail- ment events, program participants agree to reduce energy consumption during the peak hours (4:00â6:00 p.m.). Austin Energy tracks participantsâ KWH reduction after each curtailment event. On the basis of these data, it can determine when a curtailment will occur and notify participating customers via e-mail. The savings for the Planning and Engineering Building in the first year was 1,616 kWh or $2,343 as shown in Figure 3-4. Lessons Learned â¢ While the existing system has performed successfully, a number of new opportunities working with the utility have proven to be more cost effective than expanding the system. â¢ The evaluation of options considered the overall sustainability of the options as opposed to just the environmental benefits. Effectiveness â¢ The effectiveness of these programs is primarily measured by energy cost savings, which have been demonstrated. Cobenefits â¢ Cobenefits of the program include increased collaboration with the city and Austin Energy. Other Airports Implementing this Measure â¢ San Antonio International Airport constructed a thermal storage project in 1982. The system continues to provide cost savings with low operations and maintenance costs. â¢ Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport built a 6 million gallon, 90,000 ton-hour thermal energy storage system in 2009, which is able to shift up to 15 MW of power to off-peak periods. 44 Airport Greenhouse Gas Reduction Efforts Source: Austin Energy, 2017. Figure 3-4. AUS load shedding program report. Case Examples 45 Introduction Geothermal heating and cooling systems make use of energy in the earth. One effective tech- nique for extracting this energy, regardless of location, is through ground source heating (GSH) technology, which takes advantage of the constant subsurface temperature of â¼50Â° F (U.S. Depart- ment of Energy, 2019). The GSH system accomplishes this by drawing the cool temperature from the ground for air conditioning in the summer and replacing it with the displaced warmer air, seasonally increasing the temperatures underground. In the winter, the system uses the stored warm temperatures underground for heating and returns the cooler temperatures, thereby bring- ing the temperatures back to â¼54Â° F (see Figure 3-5). Drawing energy from the ground through GSH greatly reduces the power required to heat and cool buildings from other sources. The Saint Joseph County Airport Authority (SJCAA) has implemented two sequential GSH projects at South Bend International Airport (SBN) that together provide all of the heating and cooling needs of the main terminal, the concourse and the international terminal. The SJCAA learned from the first project and was able to improve and perfect the second larger project; its experience with both projects has sparked a new energy efficiency initiative and partnerships. Project Details The GSH systems are composed of closed-loop wellfields through which water flows and transfers conditioned water, a heat pump internal to the building for moving the water, and electrical and plumbing components to power the system. The first project, constructed in 2010 as part of a new concourse building, includes horizontal wells located in the airfield adjacent to the apron. It has a heating and cooling capacity for the 45,000-square foot concourse and also performs snow melt for the ground loading ramp areas.

It includes 276 bore holes that extend to a depth of 350 feet below grade. Implementation In 2010, the SJCAA completed construction of a new concourse building equipped with five gates, state-of-the-art security, and passenger amenities. During the design process, both a con- ventional boiler and chiller system and a green alternative using GSH were identified as potential options for heating and cooling the building. The GSH system was selected because it was eligible for FAA AIP and passenger facility charge (PFC) funding; it was determined to be cost-effective; and it provided sustainability features that the SJCAA wished to include in the project. The GSH was designed with a horizontal wellfield that was located on the airside close to the new building, between taxiways, on land that could not be developed for other purposes. Soon after the new concourse was constructed, the boiler/chiller system for the existing terminal building was identified for replacement because it was approaching the end of its use- ful life. The SJCAA considered the success of the concourse GSH system and determined that a second system could serve as a viable replacement in the existing terminal. It developed a project concept that included heating and cooling capacity for both the existing terminal and forecasted future demand. Space for the wellfield was located on the landside and a vertical design was used to minimize the area needed and to allow for potential redevelopment options over the wellfield, such as surface parking. The airport was located in an area designated by the EPA for air quality nonattainment at the time; therefore, the project was eligible for funding under the FAAâs VALE Program. The SJCAA applied for and was awarded a VALE grant in 2013, which funded 90% of the geothermal systemâs cost. The facility was constructed by the end of 2014. The entire heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system is controlled and moni- tored using an âoff-the-shelfâ building management system that allows the operator to set the Figure 3-5. Seasonality of GSH technology. Case Examples 47 temperature of building areas to be conditioned and to monitor the operation of the entire HVAC system. It took a full year to calibrate the system to operate effectively, given the local climate and specific use patterns in the buildings. The system is most efficient in mid-winter and mid-summer, when temperatures between daytime highs and nighttime lows are less extreme and the system can respond more effectively to a smaller temperature change. The system was initially monitored and maintained by on-staff technicians. However, after several years of operational experience, the SJCAA has found that a combination of 24 hours/7 days a week (24/7) remote monitoring by a contractor and limited on-site capabilities is both more efficient and cost-effective. While the SJCAA does not have a sustainability plan, it has sought to incorporate environ- mental measures into all airport development projects. It was led by the notion that sustainable development projects would achieve environmental, social, and financial benefits. FAA funding for both projects was important for the SJCAA to afford these sustainability measures. Lessons Learned â¢ With the new energy provided from the earth, the amount of power purchased from the util- ity decreased significantly. Because the purchase volume decreased, the airport was subject to a new energy tariff rate, and that caused the cost per energy unit consumed to increase. The change in its rate resulted in an unforeseen decrease in forecasted energy savings. This mis- calculation had no impact whatsoever on whether the SJCAA would have proceeded with the project or not. However, it did result in higher expectations for its rate of return and impacted future year budget forecasts. The lesson is to consider not only how much energy consump- tion will decrease but also how the change in consumption will affect the tariff rate. â¢ The SJCAA switched from a horizontal to a vertical wellfield between the first and second projects. The vertical wellfield takes up less space, can accommodate some types of future development, and is more efficient. â¢ Operations and maintenance activities are more effective and cost-efficient with a hybrid approach combining contractor monitoring with limited on-site expertise. Effectiveness â¢ The project resulted in a decrease in natural gas consumption of about 3.8 million cubic feet of natural gas, reducing CO2 emissions by approximately 0.209 tons per year. Cobenefits â¢ The geothermal program strengthened partnerships with city and county officials, which led to collaboration on an energy performance contracting project. â¢ The projects have also increased goodwill with the community, which has improved discus- sions on other airport and regional issues. Other Airports Implementing this Measure â¢ Portland International Jetport (PWM), in Maine, used a VALE grant to incorporate ground source heating into its terminal expansion project in 2012. â¢ In 2016, Nashville International Airport (BNA), in Tennessee, opened a ground source heating project that received FAA Energy Efficiency Grant funding for an innovative design using quarry water. â¢ Duluth International Airport (DLH), in Minnesota, incorporated ground source heating into a new terminal building that opened in 2013. 48 Airport Greenhouse Gas Reduction Efforts Introduction The sun generates energy in the form of both light and heat. Solar photovoltaic energy, which uses panels to directly convert solar light into electricity, is a proven universal alterna- tive to conventional electricity generation. Solar thermal energy generates heat by capturing solar energy in thermal collectors, panels usually containing tubes of fluid that collect and hold heat (see Figure 3-6). Although solar thermal energy systems are highly efficient and effective once in place, their implementation can be more complicated because of the characteristics of a buildingâs existing heating and cooling systems. Additionally, because solar thermal energy Figure 3-6. Basic concept of solar thermal energy.

In an effort to cut heating costs, reduce energy consumption, and improve longevity of its heating system, the Boise Airport (BOI) recognized the substantial benefits associated with installing solar thermal energy. BOI offers a strong case example for GHG reduction because the practice of drawing on solar thermal energy for hot water heating was identified by ACRP Report 56 as the most impactful measure to reducing GHG emissions. Project Details The facility is composed of 12 solar thermal collector panels located on the roof of the airport terminal, a heat plate exchanger, two 300-gallon hot water storage tanks, and two high-efficiency gas water heaters or boilers located in a 3rd floor mechanical room. The system replaced three lower efficiency gas heaters. The hot water generated is applied to two uses: domestic hot water needs in the terminal building in the area prior to security; and baseline terminal heating, particularly during nonpeak usage in shoulder seasons. Implementation The concept of using a solar thermal and high-efficiency gas system as a replacement for an older generation heating system had been in the planning stage for several years. However, prior to its implementation, the replacement project needed to be programmed and funded, the design refined, and the system developed. Therefore, the airport determined that an appropri- ate way forward was to create a pilot system with capacity to provide domestic hot water for a portion of the terminal. The city applied for an FAA VALE grant that, if approved, would fund 90% of the project cost. The design and funding process followed the VALE project evalua- tion timeline: the VALE application was prepared and approved by the FAA in the spring and summer of 2016, the grant was issued in the fall of 2016, and a contractor was engaged for the work in the spring of 2017. The initial design included a due-south facing panel orientation; howeverâwhen modeled as required by the FAAâs Policy on Solar Projectsâthe results of this design showed potential for adverse glare, requiring an alternative layout with the panels positioned slightly toward the west. Once the FAA glare requirements were met, the solar component of the project was constructed, the heat exchanger and water tanks were connected, and preheated water was ready to feed into the high-efficiency gas heaters, drastically reducing the need for natural gas. The project began full operation in August 2017. Lessons Learned â¢ The airport originally sought to procure vacuum-type solar collector panels for this project. The VALE Program concluded that such a design was not âprovenâ technology and, there- fore, would not be eligible for a VALE grant. In response, the airport committed to using a conventional solar thermal panel. â¢ The state of technology, particularly that related to system monitoring, advanced in the rela- tively short time between approval of the project and its bid selection. This necessitated added commitments to some technical features, such as a unitized control system that improves overall efficiency, but these additions were not accounted for in the original budget. 50 Airport Greenhouse Gas Reduction Efforts â¢ Unanticipated regulatory reviews for the larger project arose, including load analysis for the roof and for the floor where the system components would be located. Also, all tanks required drains that were capable of tolerating the temperature of water of the design. â¢ Willingness to rework the design in conjunction with funders, administrators, and designers was important throughout the process. Effectiveness â¢ The decrease in natural gas consumption has been more than 85%. â¢ The reduction in GHGs is equivalent to removing 16 passenger cars from the road each year. â¢ The system operates better than expected; at times, the amount of heat generated has exceeded the overall capacity required. Cobenefits â¢ Because of the unique application of this solar thermal heating system, airport staff have been recognized for their technical leadership in the industry. â¢ The project furthers collaboration with the city of Boise and furthers efforts to reach goals named in the cityâs Climate Action Plan (CAP). Other Airports Implementing this Measure â¢ In 2013, Abraham Lincoln Capital Airport (SPI), in Illinois, installed solar collectors on the terminal roof to reduce energy required for hot water heating. â¢ In 2012, Brainerd Lakes Regional Airport (BRD), in Minnesota, installed a solar thermal air heat exchanger on the south side of a building to protect forced hot air heating. â¢ Appleton International Airport (ATW), in Wisconsin, installed 12 solar thermal collectors to provide supplemental hot water heating. Case Examples 51 Introduction Ground transportation operating within an airportâs perimeter has been a major contributor of GHG emissions (Monsalud, Ho, and Rakas, 2015), and there are currently a variety of initia- tives underway to reduce these impacts. Many airports have opted to convert shuttle buses, along with other vehicles in their fleet, from diesel fuel to compressed natural gas (CNG). By adding renewable natural gas (RNG) to their fuel mix, Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) has taken this initiative a significant step further. Derived from the breakdown of organic material, RNG is primarily composed of methane, which, when released into the atmosphere, has a far greater impact on global warming than that of carbon (U.S. Department of Energy, n.d.). When capturing this naturally occurring methane from landfills and converting it into a clean-burning fuel, RNG reduces emissions by up to 70% as compared to gasoline and diesel (Clean Energy Fuels, 2019). In its own move to carbon neutrality, DFW is among the first airports to power its natural gas vehicle fleet with an RNG fuel blend, a measure that is expected to further reduce DFW fleet GHG emissions by approximately 70%. This project illustrates a relatively simple solutionâswitching fuelsâfor airports that have already invested in CNG. Project Details The project involves the conversion of a diesel-fueled vehicle fleet into a vehicle fleet operat- ing on CNG that is mixed with increasing amounts of RNG. Currently, 95% of DFWâs airport vehicles are powered by CNG, including 189 shuttle buses and more than 120 trucks and ser- vice vehicles. DFW owns and operates two CNG filling stations (Figure 3-7) used for fueling Ground Transportation GT-14: Convert Airport Fleet Vehicles to Alternatively Fueled Vehicles Renewable Energy RE-14: Utilize Local Landfill Gas (secondary) 3.9 Renewable Natural Gas Fueled Ground Transportation; Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport (DFW), TX Airport Type: Large Hub GHG Protocol Emissions Type: â¢ Scope 1: Replacing airportâs diesel fleet with RNG â¢ Scope 3: Providing access to CNG filling station for tenants and the public FAA Region: Southwestern Financing: â¢ Renewable fuels standard ACRP Report 56 Category: Ground Transportation ACRP Report 56 Fact Sheet Indicative Values: â¢ Implementation schedule: 2 of 4 â¢ Estimated annual O&M: 1 of 4 Estimated GHG Reduction: â¢ 5,700 MT CO2e in the first year 52 Airport Greenhouse Gas Reduction Efforts the airportâs CNG vehicles that are also available to tenants and the public. In 2017, DFW executed a contract to add RNG that originates from a nearby landfill to create a more sustain- able natural gas mix for use at these filling stations. DFWâs contract specifies that 10% of the CNG consumed in the first year will be RNG, increasing annually to a total of 90% in 2025. Implementation DFW purchased its first CNG buses in 1999. The primary driver of those purchases was poor air quality in metro-Dallas, which was classified as nonattainment by the EPA for ozone requiring significant reductions in NOx. DFWâs bus fleet travels an estimated 12 million miles a year. The conversion to natural gas had a direct reduction in tailpipe emissions, but it also eliminated diesel truck transport by replacing it with gas delivery by pipeline. The cost of fuel also decreased. DFW has continued to convert buses and make other commitments necessary to support the long-term commitment to CNG and to reduce the number of vehicles on the road. It has committed to building and owning two CNG fueling stations, one of which is wholly owned by DFW and the second of which is close to being wholly owned. DFW also built a consolidated rental car facility that reduced in half the number of vehicles required to transport passengers across the airport. In 2017, DFW executed a contract with Clean Energy specifying its purchase of RNG as a mix of the total amount of compressed natural gas consumed at the two filling stations. The contract confirmed that Clean Energy would supply and DFW would purchase 10% of all gas consumed from the stations in 2018 with incremental annual increases up to 90% in 2025. The renewable natural gas is supplied from a landfill in south Texas. The gas is supplied to the regional natural gas network and DFW obtains credit for its purchase by drawing gas from the same infrastructure. A key component in the economics of RNG is the trading of renewable identification num- bers (RINs) under the Renewable Fuel Standards (RFS) Program created by U.S. Congress in 2005. The RFS Program is a national policy that requires a certain volume of renewable fuel to replace or reduce the quantity of petroleum-based transportation fuel, heating oil, or jet fuel. RINs are credits that are generated by renewable fuel producers and are used to confirm fuel producer compliance in meeting the standard. As the fuel producers need to either produce renewable fuels and sell them on the market or purchase RINs from other fuel producers, RINs accrue market value. The South Texas Landfill creates RINs when it delivers landfill gas to the Figure 3-7. Natural gas refilling station at DFW. Case Examples 53 transportation end user, which decreases the price to customers including Clean Energy and DFW. DFW receives a rebate at the end of the contract year on the basis of the market value of RINs, which results in an RNG cost that is lower than that of conventional CNG. When DFW purchases the RNG, it then can accurately claim ownership and use of the RNG. Lessons Learned â¢ Early adopters at times need to learn by trial and error. When DFW designed and constructed its CNG filling station, there were no other airports that had done so and could report infor- mation on fuel demand. Based on initial operating experience, it learned that it had under- estimated the amount of fuel demand from its fleet, and therefore had to add capacity and build in redundancy. â¢ Because RNG is dependent on the specifics of the RFS, for the project to proceed it was nec- essary for airport staff to get up to speed on the opportunity, and then educate partners and stakeholders to gain support. â¢ DFW has learned that its fuel buying power is more effectively leveraged because it owns the CNG filling stations. â¢ RNG is a drop-in solution requiring no change in operations or infrastructure where a pipe- line already exists. This characteristic keeps costs lower than some other options that require capital improvements. Effectiveness â¢ According to DFW, the use of locally produced RNG has reduced life cycle emissions by 79%. â¢ The use of locally produced RNG has also reduced O&M costs by 39%, or $1 million in annual savings. â¢ In the first year, use of RNG resulted in a reduction in CO2 emissions of 5,700 tons, which is equivalent to removing nearly 1,200 passenger vehicles from the road for a year. Cobenefits â¢ Buses operating on alternative fuels are a visible sign to the public of the airportâs environ- mental commitment. â¢ Progress in converting vehicles to alternative fuels and improving local air quality builds DFWâs reputation with the broader community and demonstrates leadership in the industry. Other Airports Implementing this Measure â¢ San Francisco International Airport (SFO) in California has been providing RNG, which is supplied by Clean Energy, at its two CNG stations since 2013. â¢ In January 2019, the Port of Seattle in Washington released a request for proposal seeking suppliers of RNG for shuttle buses, including for buses at SEA. â¢ The operator of 16 CNG buses at the consolidated rental car center at SAN has been using RNG since 2016. 54 Airport Greenhouse Gas Reduction Efforts Introduction Climate control is critical for all airports to function effectively. In northern climates, heat- ing is fundamental to ensuring that customers are comfortable, airport staff can do their jobs, and machinery can operate as intended. The challenge is amplified in a community like Ketchikan, Alaska, with its cold, rainy climate and remote location where transport distance adds both expense and environmental impact to the use of traditional fossil fuel. Woody bio- mass, an alternative energy resource found in abundance in Southeast Alaska, is growing in use as recent advances in biomass pellet combustion have made systems efficient and fully auto- mated (Tomberlin, 2014). When it needed a boiler replacement for Ketchikan International Airport (KTN), the borough of Ketchikan launched a biomass boiler project to provide a reliable source of heat, take advantage of regional resources, and reduce GHG emissions. Ketchikanâs proximity to softwood forests and local sawmills made the project particularly feasible and significant, as biomass pellets sourced from local forestry waste and sawmill residue show the strongest GHG reduction benefits (Buchholz, Gunn, and Saah, 2017). Project Details The customized facility is a 500 MBH (or 500,000 BTU/hour) biomass boiler capable of providing heat for 90â95% of the airportâs generation (see Figure 3-8). The remaining 5â10% represents peak demand on only the coldest days and is supplied by a supplemental oil unit. KTN made a purposeful decision to not oversize the biomass boiler, enhancing both efficiency and operational life. A 700-gallon water tank was also installed with the oil boiler to provide thermal energy storage that augments the boilerâs overall efficiency.

The boiler system is located inside an old fish storage building retrofitted for its new purpose. The building includes a large glass viewing window with an educational display allowing visitors to see the boiler and learn about its operations. Implementation KTNâs oil-fired boiler was 45 years old and in need of replacement. A bid was released for a new, more efficient oil-fired boiler system in 2010, with responses to the bid higher than expected. The airport staff learned of recent biomass boiler installations elsewhere in Alaska which, in addition to generating heat, also utilized local renewable resources. Visits were set up at existing biomass installations to learn more about recent operational experiences. The airport discovered that the cost of a biomass boiler was similar to that of an oil-fired boiler and that state grants could potentially reduce the overall cost to the borough. The borough initially received a grant from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to conduct a feasibility study of a biomass boiler, which confirmed the cost effectiveness of bio- mass and defined the system requirements for the project. With additional grant commitments from the Alaska Energy Authority, the borough proceeded with design and construction and the system became operational in the fall of 2016. Lessons Learned â¢ The airport thoroughly researched the experiences of other in-state installations, helping it better understand the advantages of a biomass boiler heating system, specifically as it would operate in Alaska. Figure 3-8. KTNâs biomass boiler. 56 Airport Greenhouse Gas Reduction Efforts â¢ Previous installations had incomplete combustion, which could be resolved by purchasing different equipment and working with an experienced engineering team. â¢ The airport also purchased the boiler and silo separately, ensuring that it controlled the selection of the most critical components and the bid engineering and installation. Effectiveness â¢ Operating costs of this biomass heating system are $30,000 per year compared with $70,000 per year for the previous oil-fueled system. â¢ Combustion of the regional woody biomass (wood waste and sawmill residue) reduces GHG emissions by 54% when compared with the burning of oil for fuel. Cobenefits â¢ Project was designed as an educational initiative with viewing opportunities and outreach materials. â¢ Project enhanced collaboration between the borough and the state of Alaska in support of local economic development and energy policy. Other Airports Implementing this Measure â¢ Grant County Regional Airport in John Day, Oregon, included a biomass boiler in its leader- ship in energy and environmental design (LEED) terminal building built in 2010. â¢ Yellowknife Airport, in the Northwest Territories, Canada, has a 540-kW biomass plant that was built in 2012. â¢ Heathrow Airport in London built a new biomass plant powered by virgin wood chips utiliz- ing combined heat and power (CHP), which provides 1.8 MW of electricity to the campus grid along with 7.8 MW of thermal energy to terminals 2 and 5. Case Examples 57 Introduction Servicing aircraft at the gate requires an array of specialized vehicles, such as baggage tugs, belt loaders, and pushback tugs. Fleets of GSE have traditionally been powered by diesel, a fuel second only to coal in its high level of CO2 emissions (U.S. Energy Information Administration, n.d.). GSE vehicles are particularly well-suited for electrification given that their patterns of use are characterized by frequent starts and stops, longer idling times, and short driving distances (National Renewable Energy Laboratory, 2017). However, an electric GSE (eGSE) program not only requires the conversion of diesel vehicles to electric vehicles, but also it requires the instal- lation of electric charging infrastructure. Recognizing the significant GHG reduction benefits of converting to eGSE, Birmingham- Shuttleworth International Airport (BHM) and selected airlines established a partnership whereby the airport would install electric charging stations and the airlines would convert to eGSE. BHM obtained funding for electric charging stations through the FAAâs VALE Program, enhancing the success of the project. Project Details â¢ This eGSE project is currently composed of 13 dual-port charging stations and one single- port station for a total of 27 electric charging ports located on the airside operational apron (see Figure 3-9). â¢ Participating airlines have provided electric baggage carts and belt loaders to replace diesel- powered vehicles. â¢ 14 charging ports have been installed on concourse A and 13 ports on concourse C. Implementation. As part of a Terminal Modernization Program implemented between 2011 and 2014, the Birmingham Airport Authority (BAA) began incorporating sustainability design Ground Support Equipment GS-01: Support Alternatively Fueled Ground Support Equipment 3.11 - Electric Ground Support Equipment; Birmingham-Shuttleworth International Airport (BHM), AL Airport Type: Small Hub GHG Protocol Emissions Type: â¢ Scope 2: Increasing airport electricity load â¢ Scope 3: Facilitating tenant conversion to electric GSE FAA Region: Southern Financing: â¢ VALE Program ACRP Report 56 Category: Ground Support Equipment ACRP Report 56 Fact Sheet Indicative Values: â¢ Implementation schedule: 2 of 4 â¢ Estimated annual O&M: 1 of 4 Estimated GHG Reduction: Not available 58 Airport Greenhouse Gas Reduction Efforts elements including the signature designation of the terminal as LEED Gold by the U.S. Green Building Council. To further the success of their sustainability efforts, the BAA initiated discus- sions with airline partners with the goal of identifying an eGSE project in which the charging infrastructure could be funded, in large part, by the FAAâs VALE Program. Under VALE, the BAA could obtain up to 90% of project costs for the electric charging infrastructure equipment and installation. As in all eGSE VALE-funded projects, the BAA would be required to document airline commitment to replace diesel-powered GSE with electric-powered vehicles without any grant funding. The BAA would also be required to provide the 10% project match. The airportâs VALE grant award was announced in September 2015, followed by a bidding and procurement process to select a contractor by January 2016, and all charging ports installed by July 2016. Airline partners Delta and Southwest, which had committed to providing 50% of the eGSE by January 2017 and the remaining 50% by January 2018, improved upon that time- frame and provided all of their required eGSE by January 2017. This significant accomplish- ment was attained through close coordination and cooperation among all parties. The total project cost for BHM was approximately $1 million, with the scope primarily limited by the amount of local funding match that was available. Since project completion, two addi- tional airlines have expressed interest in participating in an expanded program should further resources be made available. One important incentive for airlines at BHM is that the charg- ing ports are owned, operated, and maintained by the airport. And, because this electricity is not directly âmeteredâ at the port but is instead rolled into the airportâs general electricity use, participating airlines are not directly charged for the electricity. The result is the elimination of the airlineâs high diesel fuel costs and replacement with lower cost electricity. Additionally, the airport ensures that the charging ports are operational, observes their use, and submits an annual report to the FAA under the VALE grant requirements. Airport technical staff, supported by private consultants, led the data collection for consider- ing this GHG reduction measure. With a clear eye toward the airportâs environmental effects on its local community, leadership also came from the airport executive staff, which was open to implementing environmentally beneficial options. Although this eGSE project was not part of a specific development plan, the staffâs responsive approach allowed the airport to reduce GHG emissions, modernize its infrastructure, and harness significant federal funding. As a further result of this and other sustainably oriented projects, BHM and the Airport Authority are currently developing a comprehensive sustainability plan. Figure 3-9. eGSE charging stations used by Delta. Case Examples 59 Lessons Learned â¢ Although important for all airport development projects, the participation of and the close coordination with airline partners was essential to the overall success of this project. â¢ Coordination with FAA Airport District Office staff was also critical. Specifically, the FAA originally interpreted the airlineâs commitment as purchase of new eGSE for BHM. However, the airlines stated that, because of the level of use, they would instead purchase new eGSE equipment for use at large airports, then transfer refurbished and retrofitted eGSE to BHM. The FAA subsequently determined this transfer met the requirements of the grant, with par- ticular focus on the fact that the project would achieve the emission reduction goals of the VALE Program. â¢ An obstacle arose when airline partnersâwhich each have preferred equipment providersâ were required by the FAA grant to accept charging ports obtained through a single procure- ment and open selection process. As the selected charging port was technically compatible with both equipment types, the barrier was a perceived one and was overcome by additional technical support and education on its usage. â¢ Working with a consultant helped make the detailed and sometimes taxing grant approval process more effective and efficient. Effectiveness â¢ Success was measured by implementation of the technology and the inherent benefits asso- ciated with its operation. Cobenefits â¢ Stronger working partnerships with airlines and enhanced cooperation between airport technical and executive staff â¢ Good will with the broader community through a demonstrated willingness to lessen envi- ronmental impacts on local air quality â¢ Reduction in ramp noise Other Airports Implementing this Measure The FAAâs VALE Program has provided funding for eGSE and associated infrastructure, including for BHMâs project.

Airport Project Description VALE Funds Case Examples 61 Introduction Movement of passengers, airport staff, and tenant employees to, from, and around the airport is a major contributor of GHG emissions (Monsalud, Ho, and Rakas, 2015). Personal vehicles, ridesharing services, taxis, hotel shuttles, transit and private bus services, airport-owned buses, and other vehicles constitute airport ground transportation and associated emissions sources. Airports can directly control their own fleet emissions by converting their buses and service vehicles to alter- natively fueled options such as CNG and electric. However, airports can only seek to influence the emissions resulting from vehicles driven to and from the airport by passengers and staff. As a key element of its modernization plan, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ) has committed to achieving significant GHG reduction goals of 35% by 2025, and 80% by 2050, based on tracking of GHG emissions levels since 2006 (Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, 2018). A fundamental initiative for reaching these goals is the imple- mentation of a comprehensive vehicle electrification plan for its five airports: John F. Kennedy Inter national (JFK), LaGuardia International (LGA), Newark Liberty International (EWR), New York Stewart International (SWF), and Teterboro (TEB). Project Details PANYNJâs initial investment in developing an electric vehicle infrastructure network includes the current operation of six electric shuttle buses at JFK (see Figure 3-10) and a total of 15 vehicle Ground Transportation GT-14: Convert Airport Fleet Vehicles to Alternatively Fueled Vehicles GT-01: Provide Priority Vehicle Parking for Emission Friendly Vehicles (secondary) 3.12 Comprehensive Vehicle Electrification Program; Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, John F.

In an effort to increase alternative vehicle options and to accelerate its GHG reduction program in the ground transportation sector, PANYNJ announced in October 2018 a comprehensive electric vehicle and infrastructure development plan to be implemented by 2025. It includes the following: â¢ Thirty-six all-electric shuttle buses at JFK, LGA, and EWR â¢ 50% of PANYNJâs entire light duty vehicle fleet, representing 600â750 vehicles, converted to electric â¢ A new fast-charging âhubâ at JFK with 10 publicly accessible stations providing full electric vehicle recharge in 30 minutes or less Implementation The Comprehensive Vehicle Electrification Program has been developed on the basis of PANYNJâs experience accounting for emissions through annual GHG inventories and imple- menting various projects to achieve GHG reductions. One of the greatest challenges it faces is the reduction of Scope 3 emissionsâthose that can only be influenced but not controlled by the airportâwhich include emissions resulting from ground transportation activities by tenants and the traveling public. PANYNJ determined that while investing in electrification of its fleet will result in direct emissions reduction, it can also influence further changes by its partners and customers. This enhanced benefit will be achieved in two primary ways: (1) by electrifying its own fleet, particularly buses, which sends a highly visible signal to the public regarding the feasibility of electric vehicles, and (2) by installing prominently placed charging stations and electrification infrastructure accessible to the public, the Port, and its tenants, which promotes the ease of electric vehicle adoption. PANYNJâs broader plan has three main components: buses, light duty vehicles, and a charging hub. â¢ The initial implementation of the electric bus program is underway at metropolitan New Yorkâs three international airports. Six shuttle buses and multiple charging stations were delivered and have been operational at JFK since September 2018. Twelve additional buses, as well as charging infrastructure, are scheduled for delivery to LGA and EWR (six at each Figure 3-10. New electric buses at JFK Airport. Case Examples 63 airport) in 2019. The Port is also studying the most effective use for an additional 18 electric shuttle buses by planning for details such as location of charging stations and maintenance depots, as well as determining the specifications and optimal distribution of the fleet. â¢ To meet its goal of electrifying 50% of its light-duty fleet, PANYNJ has placed an initial order for 150 vehicles to be delivered in early 2019 and distributed among all Port facilities (not just airports), including vehicles operating at SWF and TEB. The initial 150-vehicle order is split between all-electric (Chevy Volt) and hybrid-electric (Chrysler Pacifica), with more than a third of the entire order for use at airports including JFK, LGA, and EWR. SWF and TEB will not receive vehicles in the first year of procurement. The number and type of vehicles acquired in each subsequent year will depend on market availability with a strong preference for all-electric options. PANYNJâs goal is to acquire between 600 and 750 electric vehicles for its light duty fleet by 2025. Contractors are installing chargers at various locations accessible to Port vehicles. â¢ The fast-charging hub project planned at JFK is a partnership with New York Power Author- ity under its EVolve Program, which will locate charging hubs 75 miles apart across New York. The hub at JFK will include 10 150-kW fast chargers easily accessible at the existing cellphone parking lot. Charging time depends on vehicle type and battery, but, on average, the fast-charging hub will complete a full charge in 30 minutes. Fully available for public use, the hub will support the expansion of electric vehicles among ridesharing TNCs, private transportation companies, and the general public. The hub is scheduled for construction in early 2019. The schedule and progress of program implementation is on the basis of funding, the electric vehicle market, and coordination with partners. Some issues at hand include constraints from the concurrent funding of major capital improvements at JFK and LGA, as well as the limited commercial availability of all-electric vans, trucks, and sport utility vehicles (SUVs). Addition- ally, a New York state initiative to develop electric vehicle infrastructure networks and charging stations is advancing the schedule for some aspects of PANYNJâs program. Lessons Learned â¢ Some of the Portâs fleet is not suitable for conversion to electric power. For example, police vehicles, which comprise 35% of the total fleet, require a substantial amount of technology that is challenging to retrofit. â¢ All-electric vehicle selection is limited, in part because of the Portâs âBuy Americanâ recom- mendation. Competitively priced, all-electric vehicles manufactured in the United States are currently only available in passenger class; however, once U.S. made all-electric SUVs and trucks become available, purchasing is expected to substantially increase. â¢ Siting is critical to ensure ease of access as well as adequate existing electrical infrastructure necessary for sufficient electricity supply, particularly for Level 3 fast-charging hubs, other- wise the costs of installation become prohibitive (Fitzgerald and Nelder, 2017). â¢ Existing charging stations at the terminals are often occupied for days by passengers who park their cars and charge them while out of town. Nonparking, fast-charging hubs will help alleviate this issue and increase overall access to charging stations. Effectiveness â¢ PANYNJ has determined that the replacement of a diesel bus with an electric one is estimated to result in a decrease of 45 MT of CO2e each year. When amplified across the larger vehicle electrification program, the 36 buses alone will result in a reduction of 1,620 MT of CO2e each year. 64 Airport Greenhouse Gas Reduction Efforts Airport Project Grant (50% of Project Cost) FY 2017 Indianapolis (IND) 3 electric buses, 3 charging stations $1,000,000 San Jose (SJC) 10 electric buses, 10 charging stations $4,857,478 Raleigh- Durham (RDU) 4 electric buses, 3 charging stations $1,633,300 Sacramento (SAC) 5 electric buses, 5 charging stations, 1 overhead charger $2,056,805 FY 2016 Indianapolis (IND) 6 electric buses, 3 charging stations $2,614,949 FY 2015 Atlanta (ATL) 1 electric bus, 1 inductive charging station $926,789 St. Louis (STL) 4 utility electric carts $28,299 Table 3-6.

Cobenefits â¢ The electric buses are purposely designed to be highly visible with the goal of positively influ- encing the publicâs perception of electric vehicle cost effectiveness and practicality. â¢ The program demonstrates PANYNJâs commitment to continually improving the air quality at the airports, positively affecting the health of their surrounding neighborhoods. Other Airports Implementing this Measure â¢ More than 79% of STLâs vehicle fleet is powered by alternative fuels. Its green fleet includes 23 electric vehicles, 80 CNG-powered vehicles, and more than 200 biodiesel powered vehicles. â¢ Los Angeles World Airports established an Electric Vehicle Purchasing Policy in June 2017, which requires it to make 50% of its light duty purchases electric vehicles by 2017, 80% by 2025, and 100% by 2035. There are currently 101 publicly available charging stations for public use free of charge at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) and Van Nuys Airport (VNY). The FAAâs ZEV Program allocates AIP grant funds for these types of projects. Recipients of ZEV grants are listed in Table 3-6. Case Examples 65 Introduction Nearly 40% of all GHG emissions are attributed to the design, construction, and operation of buildings, with the majority of those emissions resulting from fossil fuel generated electricity, heating, and cooling of building space (Theordor, 2016). One of the best strategies for reducing these emissions is the use of existing technologies to build LEED certified structures. According to the U.S. Green Building Council (2016), the average LEED building uses 32% less electricity and saves 350 metric tons of CO2 emissions annually. By stretching efficiencies to the highest levels, and by adding renewable energy systems, new and retrofitted buildings can now achieve a LEED certification of zero net energy (ZNE). ZNE buildings produce as much energy (or more) than they consume annually (see Figure 3-11). In 2014, San Francisco International Airport (SFO) constructed a ZNE-designed office build- ing intended to serve as a model for future development options at emissions-neutral air- ports. In the 2015 report Zero Net Energy Buildings: How Californiaâs Local Jurisdictions Can Lead the Way, the Center for Sustainable Energy notes that municipal buildings, like the airportâs ZNE building, are recognized not only for their immediate emission-reducing impact, but also for their capacity to lead by example. Project Details SFOâs ZNE building, which serves as the nerve center for airport security operations, is an 8,000-square foot airport office building with an attached 8,000-square foot parking garage. The project design includes daylight tubes that maximize the availability of natural light; dynamic glazed windows that automatically tint in response to light thereby reducing heat loading; 3.13 Zero Net Energy Office Building; San Francisco International Airport (SFO), CA Airport Type: Large Hub GHG Protocol Emissions Type: â¢ Scope 1: Implementing energy efficiency and renewable energy to avoid emissions from fossil fuel-fired building systems.

Solar PV panels have been erected on the building roof and on the top deck of the parking garage to supply the reduced electricity load. Implementation SFO initially identified the ZNE office building to be a test of sustainable building design with successful attributes to be incorporated into plans for the terminal 1 project and other large-scale developments planned at SFO. The building was developed for the airport security department, which had outgrown its space and capabilities, and required a state-of-the-art facility that could support the expanded technological needs of a modern agency. The build- ing was designed and built to meet LEED Gold level with many sustainability features beyond those associated with energy including water conservation, waste reduction, and low-pollutant interior carpets and paints. Once the building was constructed, it was necessary for operations staff to make modifica- tions to the heating and cooling systems and lighting controls to enhance energy efficiency on the basis of occupancy and use patterns. Some adjustments were necessary because of a lack of detail during the testing and commissioning process. For example, staff identified that not all systems had been set to operate at the most efficient mode during start-up. In other cases, changes needed to be made due to the functioning of airport security, which is occupied 24/7. While staffing is more limited at night, lighting and conditioning systems may be triggered by movement of personnel, even when just briefly passing through areas, which results in unnec- essary energy consumption. To increase efficiency, all mechanical systems were consolidated into a single building management system that is controlled and operated from a remote loca- tion. After a period of balancing the systems, operators achieved greater energy efficiency and improved occupant comfort. Another barrier to achieving zero net energy was that the particular energy demands of the security force were not effectively forecasted. For example, large television screens used for security monitoring run 24/7 and alone account for approximately 4â5% of total energy load. Figure 3-11. Zero net energy concept. Case Examples 67 Handheld radios are also constantly being charged. There is an electric bus charging station in the garage that was not accounted for in the original building forecasts. While the building incorporated the aggressive energy efficiency design components that are the first step toward ZNE, the initial installation included only about half of the required on-site renewable energy generation, which was supplemented in April 2018 by a doubling of the solar photovoltaic system. At the end of 2018, the building had achieved the milestone of one full year of net zero emissions. Lessons Learned â¢ Commissioning of the building and its systems by engineers and designers is critical to ensuring the building operates as designed, particularly given the increased use of complex technology. Airport staff needs to be well-informed about commissioning issues and firmly integrated into commissioning and verification processes. â¢ The intended occupantâs purpose and activities must be closely considered when configuring smart building systems, such as lighting and electricity demands. In this case, energy con- sumption of the airport security building was greater than expected because of the unique activities of the occupants. â¢ A willingness to alter, adjust, or rework ZNE buildings may be necessary to achieve or main- tain overall energy equilibrium as energy demands and/or use patterns shift over time. Effectiveness â¢ The effectiveness of the project has been tracked through regular monitoring of electricity consumption. Changes in operations and building system controls have been made over time, reducing consumption. With the addition of additional solar power in April 2018, the build- ing was able to achieve ZNE measured over the previous 12-month period by the end of 2018. Cobenefits â¢ The project has greatly enhanced SFO staff capabilities to identify technical and operational barriers to decreasing energy efficiency, which has been employed with each successive build- ing project. â¢ As the first U.S. airport to construct an NZE building specifically designed to meet airport needs, SFOâs industry leadership can serve as a model for airports and municipal entities looking to incorporate NZE buildings into their GHG reduction strategies. Other Airports Implementing this Measure â¢ Appleton International Airport, in Wisconsin, designed a ZNE general aviation terminal that was commissioned in 2013. 68 Airport Greenhouse Gas Reduction Efforts Introduction The Good Traveler Program provides air passengers with a simple and direct opportunity to offset their travel-associated carbon emissions by investing the added cost of associated emis- sions into local carbon reduction projects. People undertake offsetting on The Good Traveler website through a three-step process: (1) calculate the distance of the trip; (2) purchase the offset currently valued at $2 per 1,000 miles flown; and (3) Good Traveler invests the money in carbon reduction projects. Under this last step, the carbon offset credit is formally retired ensuring that the contribution has been officially used for emission reduction. Other offsetting programs exist, but none are specific to airports and their interest to provide their customers with a climate solution. Recognizing this fact, SAN founded The Good Traveler Program to offer carbon offsetting to its customers and to apply the offset value to local projects, generating benefits both locally and globally. SAN made The Good Traveler platform available to other airports in 2016 and engaged the Rocky Mountain Institute to manage the program. At the time of publication, there are 11 airports that are program partners. Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL) has been a member of The Good Traveler Program since 2018 and its participation in the program is profiled as an example. Project Details In 2018, ATL joined The Good Traveler as an advisory member, along with SAN and six other airport operators. It has identified a local source of renewable energy for which pas- sengers traveling through ATL can use to offset their emissions. The Dalton-Whitfield and Wolf Creek Landfill-to-Energy projects reduce carbon pollution and provide a reliable source of renewable energy to local industry while supplying enough power for up to 1,500 homes. The city of Atlanta promotes the opportunity for passengers to offset their carbon emissions through The Good Traveler Program through signs (see Figure 3-12), and via a custom-tailored 30-second video feed on monitors in the airport concourses. The city of Atlanta made its own contribution to Good Traveler when it purchased offsets for 71,000 fans who attended Super Bowl 53 in Atlanta in February 2019.

Implementation While any air passenger can participate in The Good Traveler Program, regardless of the airports used, the active participation of airport partners helps promote the programâs suc- cess and allows airports to connect to that success. Specifically, airport partners can promote passenger offsets inside their terminals and account for those registered from their airport to address Scope 3 CO2 emissions. Some participating airports, like ATL, have commissioned ani- mated video and created signage for terminals, promoting offsetting and allowing passengers to act when traveling. Passengers can select a home airport, which allows airport partners to better understand their ability to influence voluntary carbon reduction through their physical or virtual promotion activities. In addition, not only does participation in The Good Traveler Program allow for the measurement of the emissions from air travel originating at an airport but also it allows for stakeholders to contribute to global climate change emissions. Each credit is invested in local projects providing a direct, verifiable environmental benefit to the partner airport and its community. Airports interested in becoming a partner simply contact The Good Traveler Program and start promoting. Passengers interested in participating in The Good Traveler Program log on to the website, calculate emissions from a trip and cost to offset, and purchase the offset. Lessons Learned â¢ It can be challenging for airports to communicate to the public how offsets benefit the environment. Figure 3-12. Column wrap for Good Traveler. 70 Airport Greenhouse Gas Reduction Efforts â¢ Offsets are relatively new products and education is essential to explain how they work and to cultivate trust in their efficacy. Effectiveness â¢ The total value of the offset purchase goes directly to the associated project. Cobenefits â¢ Program increases the publicâs understanding of individual actions and impacts on climate change. â¢ Program offers a direct method that allows passengers to address the hard-to-abate emissions from aircraft.

Kennedy International Airport (JFK) â¢ LaGuardia International Airport (LGA) â¢ Newark-Liberty International Airport (EWR) â¢ San Diego International Airport (SAN) â¢ San Francisco International Airport (SFO) â¢ Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (SEA) Case Examples 71 Introduction Since 2014, TNCs such as Uber and Lyft have had a dramatic effect on how passengers travel to and from airports. As demand for ridesharing services increases, airports are faced with new challenges in influencing the amount of GHG emissions associated with these driver-owned vehicles. [It is important to note that Lyft has created a national carbon offset program which, in 2018, offset more than 1 million metric tons of carbon, ensuring that all Lyft rides are carbon neutral (Lyft, 2018).] Creative solutions are emerging to help mitigate the significant contribu- tion of TNC emissions to an airportâs overall carbon footprint. By calling on TNCs to measure impacts such as average vehicle fuel efficiency, trip distance, and the number of passengers trans- ported, airports can then track the specific contribution of TNCs to overall GHG emissions. In response, airports can create fee structures, improve access to alternative fuels, and establish other incentives to encourage TNCs to reduce their emissions. The San Diego County Regional Airport Authority launched its Clean Vehicle Program at San Diego International Airport (SAN) in 2010. While the Airportâs program successfully incen- tivized the conversion of 97% of its taxi fleet to more fuel-efficient vehicles, similarly incentivizing TNCs required another step. In a novel partnership demonstrating that TNCs can both account for GHG emissions and respond to cost-saving incentives, the airportâs TNC GHG Reduction Program establishes mutually agreed on emissions reduction targets and then provides dis- counts to the companies when they meet that target. According to the Airport Authority, this agreement has already resulted in emissions reductions of up to 30% for some participating companies, illustrating the appreciable effects of partnering with the TNC industry. Project Details The TNC GHG Reduction Program establishes annual fuel efficiency standards, records TNC activity via a customized computer platform, and provides operating fee discounts on the Ground Transportation GT-17: Support Alternatively Fueled Taxis and Ridesharing 3.15 Transportation Network Company Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction Program; San Diego International Airport (SAN), CA Airport Type: Large Hub GHG Protocol Emissions Type: â¢ Scope 3: Emissions from companies transporting air travelers to and from the airport FAA Region: Western/Pacific Financing: â¢ Operations budget ACRP Report 56 Category: Ground Transportation ACRP Report 56 Fact Sheet Indicative Values: â¢ Implementation schedule: 2 of 4 â¢ Estimated annual O&M: 1 of 4 Estimated GHG Reduction (at 2020 Goal): â¢ 30% reduction in emissions from this source after one year 72 Airport Greenhouse Gas Reduction Efforts basis of demonstrated compliance with annual emissions reduction targets. This system includes registering TNC vehicle types, collecting individual trip characteristics, calculating emissions from those activities, and applying more stringent standards each year to document emissions reductions. The program is primarily managed by a software interface used jointly by TNCs and the airport. Implementation Between 2010 and 2017, the Airport Authorityâs comprehensive Clean Vehicle Program suc- cessfully reduced taxi fleet emissions by 86% through the conversion to more fuel-efficient hybrid vehicles. This reduction was accomplished by modifying the existing commercial ground transportation permit system to increase charges on traditional fuel vehicles while simultane- ously discounting charges for cleaner alternatives. In partnership with a local nonprofit environ- mental organization and the state of California, grant funding for vehicle conversion was made available to interested taxi operators. Additional incentives were also made available to hotel/ motel shuttles, vehicles-for-hire, and off-airport parking shuttles, while all airport-owned buses and shuttles were converted to alternative fuels by the start of 2017. When TNCs began operating at the airport in 2015, these independent vehicles represented a change in the transportation landscape, as they were not subject to the commercial ground transportation permit system or its fuel efficiency incentives. In response, the Airport Authority engaged TNCs in developing a program that would fold them into the existing permitting system and allow for data collection on their environmental impact. The program records details of each airport trip, including the vehicle make and model, total miles, number of parties, and the associated GHGs. It gives the TNCs credit for measures such as pooling (i.e., higher occupancy trips) and rematch (i.e., an airport and return roundtrip with travelers as opposed to a one-way trip). The program quantifies the reduced vehicle miles traveled as well as GHGs associated with these operations. The San Diego County Regional Airport Authority uses the U.S. Department of Energyâs Fuel Economy website as its central reference for standardizing data on vehicle fuel consumption and GHG emissions. It includes information on fuel consumption by car make and model and presents a greenhouse gas rating (GGR) on a scale of 1 to 10 based on miles per gallon (mpg), with a 10 representing vehicles with 44 mpg or higher (see Figure 3-13). A range of CO2 grams per vehicle-mile is also associated with each GGR category for standardizing GHG emissions accounting. Drawing on this emissions data, TNCs calculate their average fleet GHG emissions inten- sity and pay a trip fee premium if they do not reach targeted GGR levels. In the first year of the program (2017), all of the TNCs met the required fleet mpg of GGR 6, or 26â28 mpg. For sub sequent years, the TNCs are required to improve their GGR level, with the goal of reaching GGR 9, or 38â43 mpg, by 2020 (equivalent to the hybrid taxi fleet). Lessons Learned â¢ This innovative program demonstrates how airports can adapt their GHG reduction efforts to changing market conditions. â¢ It is important to develop relationships with TNCs to understand how to structure the strongest economic incentives to reach GHG reduction targets. â¢ Data collection and standardization was fundamental to the program as there were no estab- lished baselines for GHG emissions from TNC activity, although TNCs are likely to remain somewhat protective of data for competitive reasons. Case Examples 73 â¢ Developing the formulas for crediting GHG reductions and increasing fees was an obstacle, as there were different pressures associated with striking the correct balance of regulation and incentive to achieve objectives. â¢ A performance-based approach gained support from the regulated community. Effectiveness â¢ In 2017, participating TNC companies reduced emissions by up to 30%. â¢ Continued success is measured by TNC annual compliance with this incentive program. Cobenefits â¢ Local air quality improvement is a significant cobenefit given the San Diego metropolitan areaâs EPA classification as a nonattainment zone for ozone. â¢ Increased carpooling supported by program occupancy incentives reduces congestion on roadways and curbsides. â¢ Opportunity for collaboration with the environmental community as it is interested in the impacts of TNCs. â¢ Provides industry leadership of a widely applicable and replicable program. Other Airports Implementing this Measure â¢ Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (SEA) pioneered the TNC regulatory program, which it piloted in 2016. Figure 3-13. Vehicle GHG data from the U.S. Department of Energy. 74 Airport Greenhouse Gas Reduction Efforts Introduction In recognition of the significant carbon footprint associated with aircraft operations, the Port of Seattle has directed considerable effort to support the adoption of SAF, a low-carbon alter- native to conventional jet fuel (Figure 3-14). Although GHG emissions from aircraft are the responsibility of airlines, airports and their governing authorities have the ability to influence and support GHG reduction measures, especially as they relate to airportsâ Scope 3 landing and takeoff emissions. As a focal point for aviation fuel consumption, the Port of Seattle is exploring the role they can play to aggregate demand for SAF. Over the past decade, the Port of Seattle has worked with multiple airlines, industry experts, and more than 40 regional stakeholders as part of a broad consortium to identify the environmen- tal and economic benefits of developing SAF in the Pacific Northwest (Climate Solutions, 2019). These efforts have culminated in the portâs ambitious goal to have all flights departing Seattle- Tacoma International Airport (SEA) fueled with at least 10% SAF by 2028 (GreenAir, 2014). Project Details The project includes the development of a SAF use plan, an infrastructure plan for blending and delivery of fuel at SEA, a SAF innovative financing study, and a SAF-related memorandum of understanding (MOU) with airlines. Implementation The portâs Sustainable Aviation Fuels Program has been a complex, multiyear effort to solve many previously unanswered questions about the development and delivery of SAF and the role that an airport plays in helping to develop a SAF market. The program grew out of the portâs Airfield Design and Operation AF-13: Support the Development of Alternative Fuels for Aircraft 3.16 Sustainable Aviation Fuels; Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (SEA), WA Airport Type: Large Hub GHG Protocol Emissions Type: â¢ Scope 3: Fuel burn from airline aircraft FAA Region: Northwest/Mountain Financing: â¢ Operations budget â¢ Private partners ACRP Report 56 Category: Airfield Design and Operations ACRP Report 56 Fact Sheet Indicative Values: â¢ Implementation schedule: 2 of 4 â¢ Estimated annual O&M: 1 of 4 Estimated GHG Reduction (at 2028 Goal): â¢ 682,500 MT CO2e/year (~68,250 MT CO2e/year landing and takeoff emissions) based on biogenic emissions Case Examples 75 participation in the Sustainable Aviation Fuels Northwest Initiative, a regional collaboration of airports, airlines, feedstock growers, researchers, and policy makers formed in 2008 to develop an understanding of the problem and to identify potential solutions specifically for the North- west Region. Out of this collaboration, the port shifted its role from that of research and development support, to direct market development via infrastructure, policy influence, and financing. In 2016, it released the Aviation Biofuels Infrastructure Feasibility Study with support from Boeing and Alaska Airlines. This report produced valuable data for integrating SAF into the airportâs fueling infrastructure, including specifying locations along the pipeline and at the airport for blending and receiving fuels. Since then, SFO commenced its own SAF infrastructure study in collaboration with airlines. Preliminary feedback from SAF producers suggests that fueling infrastructure studies are a best practice for airports interested in accelerating SAF adoption at their airport. In 2017, the port partnered with the Rocky Mountain Institute and SkyNRG on an innovative financial study that explored a large range of possible funding sources to reduce the incremental cost of SAF or support SAF infrastructure (Klauber et al., 2017). SAFâs price premium, com- pared with conventional jet fuel, is a barrier to faster adoption. SEA was interested in learning how it could potentially address this challenge. Importantly, the funding study included ways that an airport could be involved in financial incentives without directly paying for airlinesâ fuel, noting that some such incentives are not possible because of FAA requirements around airport revenue. The results of these efforts were drawn into other airport planning processes, including a Sustainable Airport Master Plan within the airportâs Climate Protection Program. In December 2017, the portâs Commission adopted the following sustainable aviation fuel use goals at SEA: â¢ By 2028, 10% of jet fuel available at SEA will be produced locally from sustainable sources, increasing to 25% by 2035, and to the maximum approved blend (currently 50%) by 2050. Figure 3-14. SEA partnering with Alaska Airlines. 76 Airport Greenhouse Gas Reduction Efforts In May 2018, the port announced an MOU agreement with 16 airlines to collaborate on a work plan to supply and consume sustainable aviation fuels at SEA in accordance with the use goals approved by the Commission. A Sustainable Aviation Fuel Strategic Plan (2018) summa- rizes the portâs comprehensive program and implementation schedule. Lessons Learned â¢ SAF market development research required executive level engagement on financial, eco- nomic development, policy, and legal issues. â¢ Airlines have finite staff resources to dedicate to SAF committee work across multiple airports, which has prompted more formal engagement between airport and airline industry associa- tions (ACIâNA and A4A) to develop best practices. â¢ Airports need to cooperate closely with airlines in developing practical targets, noting that prior industry goals (Boeing: 1% of industry fuel use by 2015; FAA: 1 billion gallons by 2018) have not been achieved. â¢ A fueling infrastructure study is a best first step for airports that wish to facilitate SAF adop- tion at their airport. Port staff developed both the infrastructure and financing analysis in such a way to create a template or best practices to reduce work for other airports exploring the same issues. â¢ It is important to manage expectations of both internal and external stakeholders, as SAF is a nascent market that requires time to developâwith fuel producers, airlines, airports, and policy makers all playing different but important roles to achieve success. Effectiveness â¢ Airlines at SEA are projected to use approximately 700 million gallons of jet fuel per year, therefore a 10% reduction would eliminate GHG emissions associated with 70 million gallons of fossil jet fuel (using the GHG Protocol). â¢ Without a policy mechanism like California and Oregonâs Low Carbon or Clean Fuel Standard, SAF adoption is unlikely to be adopted because of cost competitiveness. â¢ Overall, the use of SAF, when compared with conventional jet fuel, results in a 50% to 80% reduction in CO2 emissions fuel over their respective lifecycles (International Air Transport Association, 2019). Cobenefits â¢ Reduces air pollutants, such as particulate matter and sulfur, which improves relationships with surrounding airport communities â¢ Local economic development associated with SAF production in the Pacific Northwest â¢ Enhanced partnerships with airlines, producers, refineries, and pipeline owners â¢ Demonstrating industry leadership Other Airports Implementing this Measure â¢ United Airlines and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines flights from Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) contain SAF. â¢ KLM, Scandinavian Airlines, and Finnair flights from San Francisco International Airport (SFO) contain SAF. â¢ Batches of SAF have been delivered to Chicago OâHare (ORD) for future use. Case Examples 77 Introduction The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) with funding support from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Global Environment Facility (GEF) imple- mented the solar at-gate pilot project to demonstrate one solution for civil aviation authorities and airports to reduce CO2 emissions from international civil aviation consistent with ICAO State Action Plans. The solar at-gate concept was approved by the United Nations as a certified proce- dure for reducing CO2 emissions through a two-step process. In the first step, pre-conditioned air (PCA) units and ground power frequency converters are installed to allow aircraft when parked at the gate to cease operations of the APU and obtain power from the terminal. In the second step of the process, the increased electricity power demand from the gate equipment is supplied by a solar power facility connected to the terminal grid, which ensures the power used by aircraft is carbon free. While many airports have implemented either gate electrification equipment or solar PV, no other airports have demonstrated how the supply of electricity demanded by aircraft is provided by solar. The Jamaica Civil Aviation Authority identified the implementation of gate power systems and solar in its State Action Plan. Funding was directed from UNDP and GEF to ICAO to dem- onstrate the solar at-gate concept at Norman Manley International Airport (KIN) in Jamaica. Project Details The project is composed of a ground-mounted PCA unit and a ground power frequency converter attached to gate 1, where the majority of international flights operate (see Figure 3-15). A 100-kW solar facility attached to a canopy structure is located in the surface parking area 3.17 Solar At-Gate Project; Norman Manley International Airport (KIN), Kingston, Jamaica Airport Type: Medium Hub GHG Protocol Emissions Type: â¢ Scope 2: Limit grid-supplied electricity by producing renewable electricity on-site â¢ Scope 3: Eliminate emissions from aircraft APUs FAA Region: NA Financing: â¢ United Nations Development Programme and the Global Environment Facility ACRP Report 56 Category: Airfield Design and Operations ACRP Report 56 Fact Sheet Indicative Values: â¢ Implementation schedule: 2 of 4 â¢ Estimated annual O&M: 4 of 4 Estimated GHG Reduction: â¢ 583 U.S. tons of CO2 per year Airfield Design and Operations AF-01: Provide Infrastructure for Pre-Conditioned Air and Ground Power Renewable Energy RE-02: Install Building-Mounted or Ground-Mounted Solar Photovoltaic Panels (secondary) 78 Airport Greenhouse Gas Reduction Efforts directly across from the airport terminal. An educational kiosk is located inside the terminal providing real-time information on electricity output from the solar facility. A sign is also located in the parking area adjacent to the solar facility informing the public about the project, its objectives, and its components. Implementation Once ICAO developed the project proposal and was awarded funding, it prepared a tender with technical specifications about the project and the bidding and selection process. The gate equipment was required to be sized to serve Code D aircraft (e.g., Boeing 767, Airbus 310) to ensure adequate cooling capacity and power. Electric meters were required for measuring power demand from the gate equipment to compare solar facility electricity generation and confirm CO2 reductions. The solar facility and canopy structure had to be designed to meet a Category V hurricane standard with new design features developed in the aftermath of hurricanes Irma and Maria in 2017. The equipment had to meet industry standards for warranties and the bidder had to provide 2 years of preventative maintenance. The contractor also had to provide training on operations and maintenance of all systems to airport staff and stakeholders, such as ground handlers and airline personnel. A bidders meeting was conducted and, after bids were submitted and reviewed, a contractor was selected for the project. The project construction was completed in the first quarter of 2018 with the formal inaugura- tion occurring in April. The project also funded gate equipment at a second airport in Jamaica, Sangster in Montego Bay, which provided support for attracting private investment in a solar project to complete the solar at-gate concept. Lessons Learned â¢ Delivery time for gate equipment can be long because equipment is manufactured and shipped to order.

Airport Greenhouse Gas Reduction Efforts MyNAP members save 10% online. or to save! Airports in the United States are responding to the demand for increased air travel with sustainable development that incorporates more energy-efficient and lower-emission technologies. Funding for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions-reducing technologies, such as electrification, alternative fuels, and renewable energy, has also become more accessible as technologies are proven to be safe, reliable, and cost-effective. Newer strategies and programs to reduce GHG emissions reach beyond airport operations to incorporate the traveling public. These are among the findings in the TRB Airport Cooperative Research Program's ACRP Synthesis 100: Airport Greenhouse Gas Reduction Efforts. The report assesses (1) the state of practice of GHG emissions reduction initiatives at airports, and (2) the lessons learned to support the successful implementation of future GHG reduction projects. The report also finds that large airports are taking the lead in moving beyond reduction strategies for their own emissions and tackling those produced by tenants and the traveling public by supporting the use of alternative fuels and directing passengers to airport carbon offset platforms. It is clear that airports regard energy-efficiency measures to be the most effective practice to reducing GHG emissions. Smaller airports, in particular, are adopting new technologies associated with more efficient heating and cooling infrastructure and lighting systems because they decrease energy consumption and make economic sense. GHG reduction projects are being implemented by different types of airports across the industry because of the cost savings and the environmental benefits of the new technology. Airports are actively benchmarking emission-reduction progress in comparison with similar efforts at airports around the world by using frameworks employed by the industry globally, such as the Airport Carbon Accreditation Program and the airport carbon emissions reporting tool (ACERT), to measure their GHG emissions. Innovative approaches are allowing airports to address rapidly changing consumer behaviors, like those presented in recent years by transportation network companies (TNCs) such as Uber and Lyft. These policy-based solutions offer the potential for wider adoption as they enable airports to act without significant capital expenditures.

They serve a key role in trans- portation of people and goods and in regional, national, and interna- tional commerce. They are where the nationâs aviation system connects with other modes of transportation and where federal responsibility for managing and regulating air traffic operations intersects with the role of state and local governments that own and operate most airports. Research is necessary to solve common operating problems, to adapt appropriate new technologies from other industries, and to introduce innovations into the airport industry. The Airport Cooperative Research Program (ACRP) serves as one of the principal means by which the airport industry can develop innovative near-term solutions to meet demands placed on it. The need for ACRP was identified in TRB Special Report 272: Airport Research Needs: Cooperative Solutions in 2003, based on a study spon- sored by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). ACRP carries out applied research on problems that are shared by airport operating agen- cies and not being adequately addressed by existing federal research programs. ACRP is modeled after the successful National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) and Transit Cooperative Research Program (TCRP). ACRP undertakes research and other technical activi- ties in various airport subject areas, including design, construction, legal, maintenance, operations, safety, policy, planning, human resources, and administration. ACRP provides a forum where airport operators can cooperatively address common operational problems. ACRP was authorized in December 2003 as part of the Vision 100â Century of Aviation Reauthorization Act. The primary participants in the ACRP are (1) an independent governing board, the ACRP Oversight Committee (AOC), appointed by the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Transportation with representation from airport operating agencies, other stakeholders, and relevant industry organizations such as the Airports Council International-North America (ACI-NA), the American Associa- tion of Airport Executives (AAAE), the National Association of State Aviation Officials (NASAO), Airlines for America (A4A), and the Airport Consultants Council (ACC) as vital links to the airport community; (2) TRB as program manager and secretariat for the governing board; and (3) the FAA as program sponsor. In October 2005, the FAA executed a contract with the National Academy of Sciences formally initiating the program. ACRP benefits from the cooperation and participation of airport professionals, air carriers, shippers, state and local government officials, equipment and service suppliers, other airport users, and research organi- zations. Each of these participants has different interests and responsibili- ties, and each is an integral part of this cooperative research effort. Research problem statements for ACRP are solicited periodically but may be submitted to TRB by anyone at any time. It is the responsibility of the AOC to formulate the research program by identifying the highest priority projects and defining funding levels and expected products. Once selected, each ACRP project is assigned to an expert panel appointed by TRB. Panels include experienced practitioners and research specialists; heavy emphasis is placed on including airport professionals, the intended users of the research products. The panels prepare project statements (requests for proposals), select contractors, and provide technical guidance and counsel throughout the life of the project. The process for developing research problem statements and selecting research agencies has been used by TRB in managing coop- erative research programs since 1962. As in other TRB activities, ACRP project panels serve voluntarily without compensation. Primary emphasis is placed on disseminating ACRP results to the intended users of the research: airport operating agencies, service pro- viders, and academic institutions. ACRP produces a series of research reports for use by airport operators, local agencies, the FAA, and other interested parties; industry associations may arrange for workshops, training aids, field visits, webinars, and other activities to ensure that results are implemented by airport industry practitioners.

This infor- mation may be fragmented, scattered, and unevaluated. As a consequence, full knowledge of what has been learned about a problem may not be brought to bear on its solution. Costly research findings may go unused, valuable experience may be overlooked, and due consideration may not be given to recommended practices for solving or alleviating the problem. There is information on nearly every subject of concern to the airport industry. Much of it derives from research or from the work of practitioners faced with problems in their day-to-day work. To provide a systematic means for assembling and evaluating such useful information and to make it available to the entire airport community, the Airport Cooperative Research Program authorized the Transportation Research Board to undertake a continuing project. This project, ACRP Project 11-03, âSynthesis of Information Related to Airport Practices,â searches out and synthesizes useful knowl- edge from all available sources and prepares concise, documented reports on specific topics. Reports from this endeavor constitute an ACRP report series, A Synthesis of Airport Practice. This synthesis series reports on current knowledge and practice, in a compact format, without the detailed directions usually found in handbooks or design manuals. Each report in the series provides a compendium of the best knowledge available on those measures found to be the most successful in resolving specific problems. FOREWORD By Gail R. Staba Staff Officer Transportation Research Board This report focuses on airport greenhouse gas reduction efforts. It describes greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction initiatives at airports and it provides lessons learned to support the successful implementation of future GHG reduction projects. This synthesis uses ACRP Report 56: Handbook for Considering Practical Greenhouse Gas Emission Reduction Strategies for Airports as a starting point and describes airportsâ progress on practices, tools, and strategies to measure and reduce GHG emissions at airports. The information presented in this study was acquired through literature review and survey responses from 18 large airports, 16 medium airports, 15 small airports, 29 nonhub airports, and 19 general avia- tion airports. In addition, this study includes case examples of airports that implemented practices to reduce Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions. Of the 13 initiative categories presented in ACRP Report 56, seven are covered in the case examples; renewable energy (five case examples), energy management (four case examples), ground transportation (three case examples), and business planning (three case examples) are covered the most. Stephen Barrett, Barrett Energy Resources Group, Concord, Massachusetts, synthesized the infor- mation and wrote the report. The members of the topic panel are acknowledged on page iv. This synthesis is an immediately useful document that records the practices that were acceptable within the limitations of the knowledge available at the time of its preparation. As progress in research and practice continues, new knowledge will be added to that now at hand. 1 Summary 4 Chapter 1 Introduction 5 1.1 Airport Greenhouse Gas Emission Sources 8 1.2 ACRP Report 56: Handbook for Considering Practical Greenhouse Gas Emission Reduction Strategies for Airports 11 1.3 Industry Progress to Date 15 Chapter 2 Findings 15 2.1 Methodology 16 2.2 Industry Survey Results 25 Chapter 3 Case Examples 28 3.1 LED Runway Lighting Installation; John Glenn Columbus International Airport (CMH), OH 31 3.2 Energy Audit and Efficiency Program; St. Louis Lambert International (STL), MO 34 3.3 Solar PV System; Sacramento International Airport (SMF), CA 37 3.4 Greenhouse Gas Inventory; Portland International Jetport (PWM), ME 40 3.5 High-Efficiency Furnace Heating Project; Cortez Municipal Airport (CEZ), CO 42 3.6 Austin Energy Load Shed, Thermal Energy Storage Program; Austin-Bergstrom International Airport (AUS), TX 45 3.7 Ground Source Heating Facility; South Bend International Airport (SBN), IN 48 3.8 Solar Thermal Energy Facility; Boise Airport (BOI), ID 51 3.9 Renewable Natural Gas Fueled Ground Transportation; Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport (DFW), TX 54 3.10 Biomass Boiler Heating Project; Ketchikan International Airport (KTN), AK 57 3.11 Electric Ground Support Equipment; Birmingham-Shuttleworth International Airport (BHM), AL 61 3.12 Comprehensive Vehicle Electrification Program; Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, John F.

The Changing Landscape of Hydrocarbon Feedstocks for Chemical Production: Implications for Catalysis: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/23555. The workshop’s final session featured five panelists providing different perspectives of how advances in catalysis can have an impact on the environmental issues associated with greenhouse gas emissions. The five panelists were Carl Mesters, managing researcher and chief scientist at Shell; David Allen, the Gertz Regents Professor of Chemical Engineering and director of the Center for Energy and Environmental Resources at The University of Texas at Austin; Richard Helling, director of sustainable chemistry for The Dow Chemical Company; Bala Subramaniam, the Dan F. Servey Distinguished Professor of Chemical Engineering at the University of Kansas; and Klaus Harth, vice president for environmental catalysis research at Badische Anilin und Soda Fabrik (BASF). In his introductory remarks, Monty Alger, director of the Pennsylvania State University Institute for Natural Gas Research and professor of chemical engineering noted that chemicals are a subset of the energy system, which can be a city, a campus, a company, a nation, or the world. Thinking of the energy system as a whole, and considering the majority of activities related to the energy using today’s existing technologies, it is feasible to get to a zero-carbon state. The only obstacle would be the cost of investment. The real challenge is not just to become sustainable but to do so at the right level of cost-effectiveness and productivity cost; given that today there is no economic value proposition of moving to a zero-carbon world and creating the incentive to invest in a new infrastructure to support such a transition. Another challenge, said Alger, is to create policy that incentivizes ""5 Environmental Impacts."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2016.

He cited several examples of policies and associated regulations—the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, and policies banning the use of ozone-destroying chlorofluorocarbons—that triggered investment and transformation of systems using new and available technologies. Alger noted, though, that sustainability has to be built considering the entire value chain. So while one company might produce substantial carbon dioxide emissions, its products might enable other companies or industries to drastically reduce their emissions. Looking across the value chain can be challenging, because companies do not think horizontally to measure sustainability, but having said that, Alger noted that there is the capability and technology to measure what goes into the atmosphere in order to produce a total system measurement. As a final comment, Alger said that the energy business in general and the chemical industry in particular are capital intensive. The best new technologies, then, will be ones that not only offer a benefit in terms of environmental impacts and operating costs, but also make use of existing infrastructure or reduce the cost of transitioning to a new infrastructure. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS ON ENERGY-MOBILITY CHEMICALS The shale gas revolution, said Mesters, has already enabled the United States to reduce its carbon emission by replacing coal with methane, since coal burning emits nearly twice the amount of carbon dioxide per unit of energy produced compared with burning natural gas to carbon dioxide and water (see ). However, stated Mesters, the most efficient way to get energy from methane would be to convert methane to carbon and water, which would produce more energy per pound of methane but also eliminate carbon dioxide as byproduct. The challenges, then, are to develop the appropriate technology and to find a use for the carbon currently produced that would offset the cost of the carbon tax that would incentivize changing the way energy is produced from natural gas. Another way in which natural gas could reduce harmful emissions, said Mesters, is by converting them to a liquid fuel that could substitute for diesel fuel made from oil. Shell, for example, is producing what it calls GTL (gas to liquid) Gasoil, a product that when burned in a properly tuned diesel engine produces significantly lower emissions of nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, hydrocarbons, and carbon monoxide. With regard to converting methane into chemicals, Mesters said there are three basic routes to forming carbon–carbon bonds, all of which cur- ""5 Environmental Impacts.""

The direct pyrolysis of methane to olefins is energy intensive, produces a great deal of coke, and requires complex separations. Oxidative coupling suffers from competing kinetics and low methane conversion, generates a tremendous amount of heat, and can require complex separations. The indirect route via syngas or using alternative oxidants that first produce methyl-X compounds requires multiple chemical reactions in series, which drives up capital costs. CHANGING THE SYSTEM OF CHEMICAL MANUFACTURING PROCESSES Chemical manufacturing is a systems-based operation, said Allen, and as the industry and policy makers begin to assess how the industry’s environmental footprint will change with the transformations this workshop has discussed, it is important to do so from a systems perspective. For example, changing raw materials from petroleum to natural gas-based feedstocks changes the manufacturing system and creates new bottleneck processes, said Allen. In the case of butadiene, there are large effects on price and acetaldehyde becomes a bottleneck intermediate (). Similarly, an analysis of methane-to-aromatics technologies identifies key cost points and maps cascading effects through the xylene and toluene supply chains. He summarized the points he wanted the workshop to consider by saying that changing feedstocks, process chemistries, and process tech- ""5 Environmental Impacts.""

As a result, the indirect impacts of changes in energy consumption, materials consumption, water use, and other measures of environmental impact can be larger than the direct impacts. Often, the net effect can be counterintuitive, he said. Lifecycle analysis, said Helling, helps make good decisions and is a complementary tool to economic analysis when considering whether to deploy a new process technology. It can be a particularly powerful tool to use when looking at environmental impacts because it can account for the follow-on benefits that can result when a new chemical material enables changes outside of the chemical industry that have a positive environmental impact. For example, a new lightweight but strong material could have no net effect on chemical industry emissions, but it could make vehicles more energy efficient and reduce overall emissions significantly. However, calculating those benefits requires understanding how to determine the positive and negative environmental impacts of the new processes used to make that material. Lifecycle analysis starts, then, with feedstocks and the first few steps of the reaction path to a new material, explained Helling, and proceeds through the entire lifecycle of a material to when it is disposed of or recycled. He also explained that thinking about the lifecycle of a product or material and using that information to influence purchases or investments, that is called “lifecyle thinking.” Making that more quantitative, he said, is referred to as “lifecycle assessment” and it takes “a few orders of magnitude more work than lifecycle thinking,” said Helling. At Dow, lifecycle thinking is used far more often than lifecycle assessment when making decisions. One common metric used in lifecycle assessment is cumulative energy demand, which includes the energy content of a material, its fuel value, and the energy that goes into its manufacture. He said the simple rule of thumb is that the fuel value and energy for manufacturing are about equal, plus or minus 30 percent, though the uncertainty can get down to plus or minus 5 percent. “A priori, there is no way to dismiss one or the other fact as they both can be very important,” said Helling. Energetics alone, however, does not do justice to lifecycle assessment because it is fundamentally a multi-attribute assessment technique, and as Helling explained, it is rare that one option is better than an alternative in every way it can be examined. “There are almost always tradeoffs, and lifecycle assessment helps you understand quantitatively what those tradeoffs are,” he said.

As a result, while the calculations that go into a lifecycle assessment can be robust, Helling said, “it takes the values part of it to know what we do with the information and how we compare those things and come to a decision.” Acknowledging that Dow does not do a full lifecycle assessment for every project, Helling concluded his remarks by promoting what he calls a 1-day lifecycle assessment. “That involves making enough assumptions that you can come to a directionally correct analysis as rapidly as possible,” he explained. The U.S. chemical industry uses approximately 5 billion British thermal units (BTUs) per year, accounting for 5.9 percent of the nation’s energy use, and production of the top 18 commodity chemicals consume 80 percent of that energy and account for 75 percent of the industry’s greenhouse gas emissions, said Subramaniam. He noted that hydrogenations are the most energy-intensive processes, followed by cracking, oxidation, and carbon–carbon bond formation (see ). In his opinion, ""5 Environmental Impacts.""

The challenge, he said, is to develop novel catalytic technologies that are not only economically viable, but also exhibit high carbon atom economy. Lifecycle analysis can help determine which technologies will meet both of those requirements (see ). Subramaniam explained that his industry partners want this analysis to start early in process development and want to conduct a process scale simulation to perform the techno-economic analysis. As soon as he and his collaborators receive a process flow diagram, which includes stream and energy flows, they can conduct a lifecycle analysis that can even account for any environmental impacts that might accrue from producing the feedstock for the process. As examples, he discussed two processes, both for making the precursors to polyethylene terephthalate. The first analysis () compared a liquid-phase hydrogen peroxide–based process that eliminates carbon dioxide as a byproduct with a gas-phase oxygen-based silver–catalyzed process for ethylene epoxidation. The key question, he said, was whether the need to use hydrogen peroxide, which requires the use of methane, cancels the zero carbon dioxide benefit. This analysis identified performance metrics that could help yield an economically viable process and could show what parts of the process, including feedstock production, can be changed to reduce its environmental footprint. The analysis revealed that without such changes, the quantitative overall environmental impacts on air quality, water quality, and greenhouse gas emissions would be similar for both processes and lie within the uncertainties of such predictions. In the second example, he and his collaborators compared terephthalic acid produced in a spray reactor process with the conventional process. This analysis showed there were clear economic and environmental advantages to the spray reactor process. The main economic ""5 Environmental Impacts.""

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/23555. advantages were a 50 percent reduction in capital costs arising from eliminating the hydrogenation step in the current process and a 15 percent reduction in operating costs, or approximately $0.07 per pound for a multi-billion-pound compound. The main environmental advantage comes from reducing the amount of solvent burned, which would result in a substantial reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. He noted that his industry partners are now negotiating licenses for this process. ENVIRONMENTAL CATALYSIS RELATED TO FEEDSTOCK CHANGE Addressing the challenges raised during the workshop, said Harth, is of high importance to the chemical industry, particularly with regard to yield, energy utilization, capital investment, and sustainability. “We have to look at all of these criteria if we want to come up with the innovation and new processes based on shale gas,” said Harth. He reiterated, though, the message that others had made, which is that the impact of changes that the chemical industry makes will be important, but will nonetheless be small compared with changes required in the energy sector. How can catalysis impact the energy sector? Harth said that having catalysts that can oxidize natural gas, which occurs in auto exhaust, would provide a great environmental benefit. Mark Barteau from the University of Michigan, commenting on Subramaniam’s figure showing the energy intensity of the top 18 commodity chemicals (see ), noted that he draws a different conclusion from that figure. Two-thirds of the carbon footprint of the hydrogenation processes, he said, comes from generating hydrogen, and the cracking processes are endothermic, so discounting those two curves by the things that catalysis cannot change suggests, in his opinion, that the industry has figured out the optimal inefficiency for a wide variety of processes across the chemical industry that is independent of feedstock variations, price fluctuations, inversion of processes, and any other factors. Subramaniam said that where catalysis can change that equilibrium is by maximizing carbon atom efficiency. Helling agreed with Barteau and said that putting a firmer value on carbon emissions will make decisions easier because instead of them being made on the basis of complex value judgments, there will be a true, measurable economic cost. Mark Jones from The Dow Chemical Company said he agreed with both Barteau and Subramaniam and noted that in his opinion, Subramaniam is arguing that ""5 Environmental Impacts."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2016. The Changing Landscape of Hydrocarbon Feedstocks for Chemical Production: Implications for Catalysis: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/23555. running processes at maximum carbon efficiency will be good regardless of policy. Helling then noted that the U.S. chemical industry’s switch to shale gas as its major feedstock has already made it more sustainable, but that improvements are required to be among the natural gas producers who are using older technology. He suggested something akin to a “cash for clunkers” program that would encourage producers to use equipment that would greatly reduce the current methane leakage rates. Allen added that the latest data he has seen show the average leakage rate is between 1 and 1.5 percent of the methane extracted from a shale gas well is released into the atmosphere before it is used and that leakage is dominated by what he called “super-emitters.” Two percent of the sites in the Barnett shale formation, he said, accounts for 50 percent of the methane emissions (). Along the same lines, Pallavi Chitta, from the University of Utah, noted that natural gas flaring is wasting approximately $1 billion of natural gas per year and the energy equivalent of approximately 20 percent of U.S. electricity generation while emitting carbon dioxide equivalent to the emissions of approximately 1 million cars per year during the environmental panel open discussion. He added, and Helling agreed, that flaring was a better option than simply venting methane given that methane is approximately 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas, but the better option still would be to make something from that natural gas. Helling added that naphtha accounts only for approximately 8 percent of U.S. chemical feedstocks, though globally that percentage is still as high as 40 percent. Wayne Schammel from Siluria Technologies commented that process efficiency is a key aspect of sustainability, but that efficiency has to encompass an entire process developed in conjunction by chemists and chemical engineers. As an example, he cited a process for oxidizing p-xylene to terephthalic acid that achieves 100 percent conversion with 98 percent selectivity, but that generates methyl bromide, a greenhouse gas, and uses a dual water–acetic acid solvent. The most energy-intensive step in this process involves converting 80 percent acetic acid to 95 percent acetic acid for reuse. His point was that if someone developed a different process for oxidizing p-xylene terephthalic acid that eliminated methyl bromide production and operated at room temperature instead of 200°C, it would not be of much use because it would also eliminate the generation of heat that is used in the process’s dehydration tower. Mesters added that efficiency optimization modeling today does not include carbon dioxide emissions and often ignores water, too, which must change going forward. ""5 Environmental Impacts.""

A decade ago, the U.S. chemical industry was in decline. Of the more than 40 chemical manufacturing plants being built worldwide in the mid-2000s with more than $1 billion in capitalization, none were under construction in the United States. Today, as a result of abundant domestic supplies of affordable natural gas and natural gas liquids resulting from the dramatic rise in shale gas production, the U.S. chemical industry has gone from the world’s highest-cost producer in 2005 to among the lowest-cost producers today. The low cost and increased supply of natural gas and natural gas liquids provides an opportunity to discover and develop new catalysts and processes to enable the direct conversion of natural gas and natural gas liquids into value-added chemicals with a lower carbon footprint. The economic implications of developing advanced technologies to utilize and process natural gas and natural gas liquids for chemical production could be significant, as commodity, intermediate, and fine chemicals represent a higher-economic-value use of shale gas compared with its use as a fuel. To better understand the opportunities for catalysis research in an era of shifting feedstocks for chemical production and to identify the gaps in the current research portfolio, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine conducted an interactive, multidisciplinary workshop in March 2016. The goal of this workshop was to identify advances in catalysis that can enable the United States to fully realize the potential of the shale gas revolution for the U.S. chemical industry and, as a result, to help target the efforts of U.S. researchers and funding agencies on those areas of science and technology development that are most critical to achieving these advances. This publication summarizes the presentations and discussions from the workshop. 2 The Shale Gas Boom and Its Impact on the American Chemical Industry Appendix B: Biographic Sketches of Workshop Speakers and Organizing Committee Members You're looking at OpenBook, NAP.edu's online reading room since 1999.

Because it is UNCORRECTED material, please consider the following text as a useful but insufficient proxy for the authoritative book pages. 15 Because many airports have implemented GHG projects since the publication of ACRP Report 56 in 2011, it was necessary to collect information to capture lessons learned from these initiatives. Quantitative and qualitative methods were used to collect information. The quan- titative data resulted from stakeholders who selected to participate in an industry survey that requested general information on airport GHG reduction efforts. The qualitative data came from telephone interviews with select airports in which stakeholders discussed specific airport GHG efforts in detail (i.e., the case examples). This section presents the methodology and results for each of these efforts. 2.1 Methodology 2.1.1 Industry Survey The purpose of the industry survey was (1) to obtain a better understanding of the range of GHG reduction practices put into place since 2012 at a variety of airports across the United States, and (2) to determine the broader level of awareness, priority, and needs that exist in relation to implementing GHG reduction strategies. A survey of 20 questions was prepared and reviewed by the Technical Panel as part of this reportâs work plan. A range of closed-ended questions was designed to collect quantifiable data and demographic information. Additionally, the survey provided open-ended questions to encourage participants to expand details or add comments not easily captured through fixed-response options. The survey (included in this report as Appendix B) was created using the web-based, interactive survey tool SoGoSurvey; it was distributed to 255 airport staff members/potential participants via email. For larger airports, sustainability and/or environmental staff contact information was identified on the basis of contacts known by the researcher or communicated by other industry sources. For smaller airports, contacts included airport managers, assistant airport managers, and technical and operations staff, and were located through staff directories and airport information sites. Airport staff that had participated in previous ACRP research panels were also identified. There was some initial difficulty in obtaining a sufficient number of responses because the SoGoSurvey distribution was caught in email filters and did not necessarily reach the intended recipient. Subsequently, the survey link was sent directly to every contact on the notification list through a direct email from the researcher. Some of the participants who had expressed interest participated in follow-up phone calls to expand on the information they had provided. A concerted effort to avoid bias in survey data collection was made by following the recom- mended practices of keeping questions short and clear, avoiding leading questions, using a range of interval scale options, and keeping the time required to respond to the survey brief. The survey C H A P T E R 2 Findings 16 Airport Greenhouse Gas Reduction Efforts was mapped for relevance so that respondents answering ânoâ or ânot applicableâ to a specific question did not receive follow-up questions on that specific topic. Even with these measures in place, a limited bias is likely because survey respondents may be more invested in environmental concerns or GHG reduction work than those who chose not to participate. 2.1.2 Case Example Interviews The purpose of the case example interviews was to gather qualitative information to help pre- pare summaries of a variety of GHG emission reduction practices that, ultimately, would offer lessons learned to other airports considering similar initiatives. A minimum of 10 case examples was set as a target, with a goal of including GHG reduction practices from a variety of airports in size and geography that are applicable to the widest audience. The practices selected were initially identified from those listed in ACRP Report 56, with the intent of illustrating a variety of initiatives associated with alternative fuels, energy efficiency, renewable energy, and ground transportation. Of the 17 potential practices and associated airports identified through prelimi- nary study and listed in the work plan, nine were developed for this report and an additional eight were prepared on the basis of additional investigation. A questionnaire designed to guide the collection of information from each airport was pre- pared and then approved by the Technical Panel, a copy of which is included as Appendix C. The research problem statement specified that case examples should present information on the ease of implementation, lessons learned, effectiveness, and cobenefits. Airports were contacted via telephone to determine their interest in participating and to confirm the appropriate GHG reduction effort, ensuring that no single effort would be duplicated. The airport then frequently supplied background information in the form of plans, reports, PowerPoint presentations, and news articles to provide practical information on the effort. This communication was followed by a phone interview in which the questionnaire was used to validate practical information on the effort and to collect new information not otherwise documented. The results of the case example work are included in Chapter 3. 2.2 Industry Survey Results All of the airports that responded to the survey are listed in Appendix D. The following section summarizes the responses in aggregate and by airport type. 2.2.1 Summary of the Data Ninety-nine survey responses were received. Two were thrown out: one was not from an airport but from a government planning office in a municipality without an airport and the other appeared to be a duplicate from an airport that had already responded. This left 97 usable responsesâ96 from U.S. airports along with one Canadian airportâwhich are summarized here. The breakdown of responses by airport size, defined by the categories identified by the FAA in Table 2-1, is shown in Figure 2-1. There were responses from 18 large airports, 16 medium airports, 15 small airports, 29 nonhub airports, and 19 general aviation airports. Figure 2-2 shows the geographic location of the respondents and the distribution by airport type. Responses were provided by airports from 40 U.S. states. There was one response from a Canadian airport, which was also included. The respondents were asked to identify their position at the airportâa little more than half of the respondents provided this information. In general, smaller airports were represented by Findings 17 Large Commercial service airports with 1% or more of annual passenger enplanements 30 17 (plus 1 from Canada) Medium Commercial service airports with between 0.25% and 1% of annual passenger enplanements 31 16 Small Commercial service airports with between 0.05% and 0.25% of annual passenger enplanements 70 15 Nonhub Commercial service airports with less than 0.05% of annual passenger enplanements 255 29 General Aviation Noncommercial service airports including reliever airports 974 19 Hub Types Examples Total Airports (2017) Airports that Responded Table 2-1.

Airport GHG planning and implementation by airport type. Figure 2-4. Reasons airports have not pursued GHG reduction efforts. 20 Airport Greenhouse Gas Reduction Efforts The top drivers for implementing GHG reduction efforts are detailed in Figure 2-5. Cost reduction was listed by 30 airports as the single top driver followed by sustainability (13 airports) and local air quality (12 airports). Sustainability was listed as among the top three drivers by the most airports (61). The primary drivers for GHG reduction efforts are included in Figure 2-6 as reported by airport type. Cost reduction is the largest response in total with contributions from all airport types. Cli- mate protection was the highest indicated by general aviation airports. Large-hub airports were the only airports surveyed that did not select local air quality as one of their top three drivers. Airports that have implemented GHG efforts were asked to identify the most effective practice on the basis of their overall experience (see Table 2-3 for these results). Energy efficiency com- prised almost half of the responses. Airports were asked to rank the ease of implementation of the GHG reduction initiative they had identified as most effective. Respondents indicated an average level of difficulty in imple- menting those initiatives (see Figure 2-7). Figure 2-5. Top drivers for implementing GHG reduction efforts. Note: GA = general aviation.

Project Type No of Responses Percentage By Airport Type Examples Table 2-3. Most effective GHG efforts as indicated by survey respondents. 22 Airport Greenhouse Gas Reduction Efforts Airports were also asked to select from a list of conclusions to indicate which ones were appli- cable to the specific GHG reduction initiative implemented. As shown in Figure 2-8, the most selected conclusion was that the GHG reduction effort provided measurable results (47), fol- lowed by the conclusion that the GHG reduction effort required cooperation among internal aviation departments (46). When asked if GHG reduction efforts would be prioritized in the next five years, 67 airports responded in the affirmative. Respondents were then asked to rank the level of priority on a five-point scale (see Figure 2-9). When airports were asked to choose whether information related to funding, regulations, or technology would be most helpful in pursuing GHG reduction efforts, a majority of the airports responded that funding was most important (see Figure 2-10). Figure 2-7. Survey respondents rank ease of implementation for most effective GHG practices. Figure 2-8. Conclusions applicable to the effective GHG reduction practices. Findings 23 2.2.2 Respondentsâ Comments The respondents were also asked to include additional comments. The following comments provide valuable lessons learned. â¢ âEverything takes a considerable amount of time to implement, so patience is essential. Once a new system is in place (e.g., PCAir [pre-conditioned air], eGSE charging stations), that doesnât mean youâve got immediate benefit. You have to continue to work with your partners to make sure those systems are working for all external partners and itâs still a priority inter- nally for the airport to keep those systems working well for the customer.â â¢ âWe made the changes only to save on utility bills.â â¢ âRetrofitting lighting is very easy and easy to sell to skeptical parties. HVAC upgrades are effective too but can be limited. I also feel like small airports cap out very quickly as to what they can effectively accomplish.â Figure 2-10. Information most helpful to supporting airport GHG reduction efforts. Figure 2-9. Priority placed on GHG reduction efforts in the next five years. 24 Airport Greenhouse Gas Reduction Efforts â¢ âIt has to have the full support of the director/president. The leader has to fully embrace the initiative.â â¢ âEmission reduction projects need to have a strong business case. They need to both improve the environment and save moneyâor benefit the community and make operations more efficient.â â¢ âCentral plants are a big hurdle for many airports where the primary fuel is natural gas. Decarbonizing central plants, especially ones with cogeneration units, is difficult because bio- gas options are very limited and still expensive, a nonstarter for airports given the volume of gas burned. We are programming an all-electric heat-recovery chiller plant in our long-range development plan, which must undergo regulatory, permitting, and other approvals.â â¢ âMany of the more impactful emission reduction measures (such as the eGSE example described above) tend not to clear the internal hurdle rates and are difficult to fit into a capital plan. For this reason, it is extremely important to partner with the airlines and any other third parties who might help defray the cost of installation.â â¢ âAirports can only do so much; others have to take advantage of resources. That said, the technology offered has to be a cost-efficient, practical, and reliable alternative.â â¢ âWe have also reduced electrical use by installing LED lighting on all airfield roadways and parking lots. We are now starting on the terminal building. The roadway and parking lot improvements have resulted in a 52% reduction in electricity costs.â â¢ âHow to deal with aircraft emissions has been an issue of discussion regarding our plan- ning. The question of whether or not to include these in our plan was difficult. We ended up including aircraft emissions from the surface to 3,000 feet. We are not sure if these emissions are incorporated into other reduction plans or if they are being double counted by us and someone else.â â¢ âIn a climate as severe as [the Southwest], itâs all about energy. Ninety percent of our footprint is from energy for cooling. It would be good to get dedicated FAA funding and direction on GHG reduction.â â¢ âMost of the concepts sound good on the surface and can show a reduction on paper, but donât really reduce emissions and are expensive to implement.â â¢ âAlternative fuels were a relatively easy project to undertake since our shuttle buses just work the airfield. Lighting efficiency was another easy implementation.â â¢ âIt would be nice to see a ranking of initiatives, for example, low hanging fruit to BIG ideas and what these initiatives typically cost. That way airport sustainability personnel can use this ranking to convince executives to pull some fruit. Thanks!â â¢ âGenerally, GHG decisions at the airport are based on a combination of good neighbor policies, providing a superior guest experience, meeting regulatory requirements, and the financial capability to undertake. Planning for future GHG/environmental improvements is important in capital project planning. [Our airport] implemented PCA [pre-conditioned air], gate electric, hydrant fueling, and electric GSE requirements in the 1990s through the 2000s when undergoing a major expansion. In addition, facilities were built with the future in mind; for instance, parking garage roofs are solar ready, anticipating the day it would be economical and viable at a small footprint airport.â â¢ âI am a very small general aviation airport with more than 70 based aircraft. We are privately owned and public use. A yearly decrease in pilot-based aircraft affects my ability to fund large projects. This does interest me greatly. But we do not receive any federal FAA funding because we are not a 24-hour or deliver airport.

Airport Greenhouse Gas Reduction Efforts MyNAP members save 10% online. or to save! Airports in the United States are responding to the demand for increased air travel with sustainable development that incorporates more energy-efficient and lower-emission technologies. Funding for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions-reducing technologies, such as electrification, alternative fuels, and renewable energy, has also become more accessible as technologies are proven to be safe, reliable, and cost-effective. Newer strategies and programs to reduce GHG emissions reach beyond airport operations to incorporate the traveling public. These are among the findings in the TRB Airport Cooperative Research Program's ACRP Synthesis 100: Airport Greenhouse Gas Reduction Efforts. The report assesses (1) the state of practice of GHG emissions reduction initiatives at airports, and (2) the lessons learned to support the successful implementation of future GHG reduction projects. The report also finds that large airports are taking the lead in moving beyond reduction strategies for their own emissions and tackling those produced by tenants and the traveling public by supporting the use of alternative fuels and directing passengers to airport carbon offset platforms. It is clear that airports regard energy-efficiency measures to be the most effective practice to reducing GHG emissions. Smaller airports, in particular, are adopting new technologies associated with more efficient heating and cooling infrastructure and lighting systems because they decrease energy consumption and make economic sense. GHG reduction projects are being implemented by different types of airports across the industry because of the cost savings and the environmental benefits of the new technology. Airports are actively benchmarking emission-reduction progress in comparison with similar efforts at airports around the world by using frameworks employed by the industry globally, such as the Airport Carbon Accreditation Program and the airport carbon emissions reporting tool (ACERT), to measure their GHG emissions. Innovative approaches are allowing airports to address rapidly changing consumer behaviors, like those presented in recent years by transportation network companies (TNCs) such as Uber and Lyft. These policy-based solutions offer the potential for wider adoption as they enable airports to act without significant capital expenditures.

Congress has an ongoing interest in ensuring that the 500,000 buildings and other structures owned and operated by the Department of Defense (DOD) are operated effectively in terms of cost and resource use. Section 2830 of the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year requires the Secretary of Defense to submit a report to the congressional defense committees on the energy-efficiency and sustainability standards used by DOD for military construction and major renovations of buildings. DOD's report must include a cost-benefit analysis, return on investment, and long-term payback for the building standards and green building certification systems, including: (A) American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Standard 189.1-2011 for the Design of High-Performance, Green Buildings Except Low-Rise Residential. (B) ASHRAE Energy Standard 90.1-2010 for Buildings Except Low-Rise Residential. (C) Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Silver, Gold, and Platinum certification for green buildings, as well as the LEED Volume certification. (D) Other American National Standards Institute (ANSI) accredited standards. DOD's report to the congressional defense committees must also include a copy of DOD policy prescribing a comprehensive strategy for the pursuit of design and building standards across the department that include specific energy-efficiency standards and sustainable design attributes for military construction based on the cost-benefit analysis, return on investment, and demonstrated payback required for the aforementioned building standards and green building certification systems.

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/12987. 4 Environmental Impacts of Renewable Electricity Generation Fossil-fuel dominated electricity generation in the United States and China has enormous environmental consequences. In 2007, 2.4 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide (CO) were emitted from electricity generation in the United States, about 40 percent of the country’s energy-related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In the same year, electricity generation in China produced just over 2 billion metric tons of CO, accounting for about one-third of its energy-related GHG emissions. Fossil-fuel combustion is also responsible for the emission of other pollutants, such as nitrogen oxide (NO) and sulfur dioxide (SO). The production of electricity also puts a strain on water and land resources. In 2000, thermal power plants accounted for nearly half of total withdrawals of water in the United States (USGS, 2005) and nearly 40 percent of water withdrawals for industrialized use in China. Overall, reducing environmental impacts is a major impetus for shifting from fossil fuels to renewable energy for electricity generation. Developing renewable energy technologies that exploit the sun, the wind, and geothermal energy is critical to addressing concerns about climate change and some environmental issues. However, using renewable energy sources will not eliminate all environmental concerns. Although renewable energy sources produce relatively low levels of GHG emissions and conventional air pollution, manufacturing and transporting them will produce some emissions and pollutants. The production of some photovoltaic (PV) cells, for instance, generates toxic substances that may contaminate water resources. Renewable energy installations can also disrupt land use and wildlife habitat, and some technologies consume significant quantities of water. ""4 Environmental Impacts of Renewable Electricity Generation."" National Academy of Engineering and National Research Council. 2010. The Power of Renewables: Opportunities and Challenges for China and the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/12987. To develop sound policies, policy makers must understand the relative environmental impacts of alternative energy sources, including how the impacts of renewable energy technologies compare to those of fossil-fuel technologies and to opportunities for improvements in energy efficiency. Understanding the potential environmental impacts of renewable energy technologies is also essential for identifying and pursuing designs, manufacturing methods, project siting, utitlity operations, and so on to mitigate or offset these effects. Environmental impacts of energy sources are commonly assessed on two scales or levels of aggregation. The first scale is the regional or national scale, which is an attempt to characterize the average impact of a typical facility or installation for the purposes of broad comparisons and planning. Life cycle assessment (LCA), for example, is an attempt to account for the full suite of impacts associated with all stages of an energy project, from the extraction of raw materials to the decommissioning of a facility and the disposal of equipment. The second scale is on the local level, where site-specific impacts, such as effects on wildlife and local water supplies, can be assessed. The first part of this chapter provides a review of published LCAs as a basis for comparing renewable and fossil-fuel technologies in terms of emissions and energy, land, and water requirements. Detailed LCAs for selected renewable energy technologies are provided in Appendixes - of this report. The second half of the chapter provides a discussion of local-scale impacts and permitting and regulatory requirements in the United States and China, with examples illustrating some of the environmental concerns raised by renewable energy projects. Localized effects will warrant more attention as renewable energy deployment accelerates, especially in places where large-scale installations are being considered. The last part of the chapter identifies opportunities for collaboration by the United States and China to advance renewable energy technology by minimizing harmful effects on human health and the environment. An LCA estimates resource requirements, energy use, and environmental impacts of products or services at all life stages. The estimates may be derived from detailed, “bottom-up” analyses of mining, manufacturing, transport, construction, operations, and disposal processes or from “top-down” analyses based on national-scale economic input/output models. Overall, an LCA is useful for comparing impacts of different technologies and for identifying points in the life cycle where improvements can be made. In this section, we present results from published LCA studies compiled by the National Academies Committee on Electricity from Renewable Resources: Status, Prospects, and Impediments (NAS/NAE/NRC, 2010a). These studies provide high-level comparisons of fossil- and renewable-fueled technologies in ""4 Environmental Impacts of Renewable Electricity Generation."" National Academy of Engineering and National Research Council. 2010. The Power of Renewables: Opportunities and Challenges for China and the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/12987. terms of net energy production, emissions of GHGs and conventional air pollutants, water use, and land use. It is important to note that the LCA results presented here were not adjusted for differences in underlying assumptions. Indeed, for renewable energy technologies in particular, the results sometimes depend heavily on the strength and variability of the renewable resource at the assumed site of installation. In addition, newer versions of technologies may produce electricity more efficiently and use cleaner, more efficient manufacturing methods. Differences may also be attributable to differences in geographical location. The NRC committee’s (NAS/NAE/NRC, 2010a) review focused on LCA studies from Europe and the United States, so generalizing the results to conditions in China should be done cautiously. Thus, these LCA results provide a of estimates that have been published in the literature. An LCA is commonly reported with a net energy ratio (NER), which is defined as the ratio of useful energy output to the grid to the fossil or nuclear energy consumed during the lifetime of the project. For renewable energy sources, NERs are expected to be greater than one, indicating a positive return over the fossil-fuel energy investment. For fossil-fuel and nuclear technologies, NERs are smaller than one and essentially represent the overall life cycle efficiency of the project. NERs are strongly influenced by a number of underlying assumptions, such as plant capacity and life expectancy. For electricity generation from wind and solar energy, the strength of the resource (which will affect the capacity factor of the installed technology) is also a critical assumption. For silicon PV specifically, the NER is highly dependent upon the thickness of the wafer and the efficiency of the cell/module produced. The highest estimated NERs are generally for wind, followed by biopower and then solar PV (). Hydropower is also expected to have high NERs, although the results shown in the graph, from a single study, are not as high as anticipated. By definition, NERs for fossil fuels are all less than one, with average estimates of 0.3, 0.4, and 0.3 for coal, natural gas, and nuclear power, respectively. An LCA for a 300 MW solar power tower in Hami, Xinjiang Autonomic Region of China, presented in , estimated an NER of 12.4 (in that example referred to as the energy balance factor). Estimates of NERs for three different biomass combustion technologies in China (direct combustion, gasification, and co-firing) are shown in . The LCA results for these technologies, which include energy required for biomass cultivation, result in NER estimates ranging from 1.3 for direct combustion to 4.6 for co-firing. Most of the fossil energy used in these cases is associated with energy crop cultivation. NERs would be significantly higher for waste biomass.

In 2007, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded that “warming of the climate system is unequivocal …” and that “most of the observed increase in global average temperatures since the mid-20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic GHG concentrations.” In light of these and other critical concerns about climate change, the United States and China are both taking significant steps to address emissions of CO and other GHGs and are weighing further action, including new regulations. Among the sectors that use fuel directly in the United States, electric power production is the largest source of CO emissions, accounting for more than 2.3 billion metric tons in 2007, or more than 40 percent of total energy-related emissions. In China, the electric power sector is estimated to have emitted 3.1 billion metric tons of CO in 2007, accounting for nearly half of that country’s total. Compared to fossil-fuel-based electricity generation, renewable energy technologies offer a major advantage in lower emissions of CO and other GHGs. In addition, as shown in , all forms of renewable electricity production are expected to have significantly lower life cycle GHG emissions (expressed as CO equivalents, COe) than electricity production from conventional coal and natural gas plants. Supplementing the results shown in , the solar-power tower LCA in estimated GHG emissions of 32 g COe/kWh. Renewable energy would have less of an advantage if carbon capture and sequestration were included with fossil-fuel power plants, or if energy storage systems, such as battery energy storage, compressed air energy storage, or pumped hydro storage, were included as part of renewable energy systems (Denholm and Kulcinski, 2003). We should also keep in mind that there are significant opportunities to improve energy conversion efficiencies and reduce fossil fuel requirements for the manufacture and transport of some renewable energy technologies, especially PV. GHG emissions for some renewable technologies are difficult to estimate. For example, emissions from biopower vary, depending on which feedstocks are used and the assumptions about their production. Most COe values for biopower range from 15 to 52 g COe/kWh for biomass derived from cultivated feedstocks, excluding emissions associated with initial land conversion (NAS/NAE/NRC, 2010a). The negative COe values shown in reflect estimates based on the assumption that biopower could serve as a CO sink if waste residues that would otherwise decompose to produce CO and methane were used as feedstock (Spath and Mann, 2004). If carbon capture and storage were added to biopower systems, there would also be large reductions in COe values. Similarly, estimates of GHG emissions from hydropower production depend on what is included in the LCAs. Although not reflected in , some studies have suggested that initial flooding of biomass when a hydroelectric reservoir is filled can release large quantities of CO and methane (e.g., Gagnon and van de Vate, 1997). The amount of these emissions depends on the density of the biomass and the size of the reservoir. ""4 Environmental Impacts of Renewable Electricity Generation.""

Finally, electricity production from closed-loop geothermal systems has low GHG emissions as shown in (Hondo, 2005). However, depending on the composition of the reservoir gas, if these gases are vented to the atmosphere, as can occur with flash technology, COe GHG emissions can be relatively high. In the worst case, they can approach the emission levels from natural gas combined-cycle power plants (NAS/NAE/NRC, 2010a). Electricity generation accounts for significant emissions of local air pollutants in the United States and China. In the United States, the electric power sector ""4 Environmental Impacts of Renewable Electricity Generation."" National Academy of Engineering and National Research Council. 2010. The Power of Renewables: Opportunities and Challenges for China and the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/12987. accounts for 18 percent of total NO emissions and 66 percent of SO emissions (EPA, 2009). Oxides of nitrogen, which react in the atmosphere to form ground-level ozone, nitric acid, and particle-phase ammonium nitrate, contribute to human health effects, visibility degradation, acid deposition, and eutrophication. Sulfur oxides, which react in the atmosphere to form sulfuric acid and ammonium sulfate, contribute to health effects, visibility degradation, and acid deposition. In addition, coal-fired power plants account for 40 percent of direct mercury emissions in the United States and are believed to dominate direct mercury emissions in China (Wu et al., 2010). Most renewable energy technologies have much lower life cycle emissions of conventional air pollutants than conventional coal and natural gas plants. For example, the solar power tower LCA in estimates NO and SO emissions of only 15 and 43 mg/kWh, respectively. One exception is electricity generation from biomass, which can produce significant NO, particulate matter, and hazardous air pollutants, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Although biomass has lower nitrogen content than fossil fuels, a substantial quantity of NO is formed whenever high-temperature combustion occurs in air, through oxidation of atmospheric nitrogen (N) at high temperatures (see ). Although direct emissions of NO and SO are expected to be low for geothermal power plants, flash and dry-steam geothermal facilities can produce significant quantities of hydrogen sulfide (HS) from geothermal reservoirs, unless steps are taken to abate it (DiPippo, 2008). For other renewable technologies, life cycle emissions of conventional air pollutants are mainly from the manufacturing or construction stages of the life cycle. As discussed below for PV, emissions during manufacturing depend strongly on how efficiently energy is used in the manufacturing process and the efficiency and degree of pollution control at the manufacturing site. Land is in limited supply in many parts of the United States and China. Hence the physical footprint of new facilities and feedstocks for electrical generation is an important consideration. In additional, the amount of land used is a rough proxy for other impacts of new development, including impacts on ecosystems, cultural and historical resources, scenery, and agricultural land. When the impacts on land use are measured simply by the surface area they occupy during their life cycle, some renewable energy technologies appear to have heavy land-use requirements (). However, this approach does not take into account the intensity of land use or whether the technology allows for simultaneous use of land for other purposes. Whereas coal-fired power plants fully occupy the sites where they are constructed, small-scale PV installations may be placed on rooftops where they cause little or no interference with the ""4 Environmental Impacts of Renewable Electricity Generation.""

Thus, smaller scale or distributed solar technologies may have less of an impact on land use and habitat loss than large-scale, central station plants. Land-use concerns may also be addressed by deploying renewable energy systems on previously developed sites, rather than in undeveloped areas (Mosey et al., 2007). The high land-use requirements for biopower shown in assume that the feedstocks have been cultivated for energy production; if waste biomass is used as the feedstock, the land-use impacts are significantly lower. In China, the biomass materials likely to be used for electricity generation are mainly agricultural residues (e.g., straw, bagasse, and rice husks), forestry wastes (e.g., wood chips, sawdust, and bark), and municipal solid waste. Plants grown for energy are expected to comprise a very small proportion of biopower feedstocks in China. The potential of waste resources available in China is estimated at about 370 million tons of coal equivalent (Tce), equivalent to about 14 percent of total Chinese energy consumption in 2007. Incremental land-use requirements for using waste materials as biopower feedstocks are insignificant. Moreover, if not used for biopower, some waste resources, such as municipal solid waste, would otherwise occupy land and could cause environmental damage if not disposed of properly. LCA of land use for various renewable and non-renewable technologies. Adapted from Spitsley and Keoleian (2005) by NAS/NAE/NRC, 2010a. ""4 Environmental Impacts of Renewable Electricity Generation.""

The hydropower estimate shown in represents land use for the Glen Canyon Dam and Lake Powell, attributing the full area of the reservoir to electricity generation (Spitzley and Keoleian, 2005); in contrast, small-scale hydropower and run-of-the river installations would have minimal land-use requirements. Land-use requirements for electrical transmission and distribution lines and facilities, which are significant for all centralized electricity generating facilities, are not shown in . Water is a scarce resource in large portions of the United States and China. Recent global circulation model projections suggest that, if climate change proceeds as expected, under current business-as-usual scenarios, freshwater supplies will become even scarcer in some parts of the United States (Milly et al., 2005). In China, the amount of water available per capita is 2,200 m, only a quarter of the world per capita average. Water supply problems in China have been exacerbated because the spatial distribution of water is very uneven. Electricity production using thermoelectric technologies requires vast amounts of water, primarily for cooling. In the United States, about 43 percent of existing thermoelectric generating capacity uses once-through cooling, 42 percent uses recirculating wet towers, 15 percent uses recirculating cooling ponds, and 1 percent uses dry cooling (Feeley et al., 2008). Water use by power plants is characterized by withdrawals (the total amount of water taken from a source) and consumption (the amount of water not returned to the source). Although consumption is sometimes emphasized over withdrawals, the latter is important, because power plant operation may be constrained by the amount of water available for withdrawal and power plant uses may compete with other demands for water (Gleick, 1994). Furthermore, water returns can be significant sources of thermal pollution and may include discharges of chemical pollutants, such as chlorine or other biocides used in cooling towers. The U.S. Geological Survey estimates that nearly 280 billion cubic meters (BCM) of water was withdrawn in 2000 for thermoelectric power generation in the United States, accounting for nearly half of total withdrawals (USGS, 2005). Water consumption by thermoelectric facilities in the United States is much lower, an estimated 4 BCM in 1995 (estimates for 2000 are not available), but this quantity nevertheless constitutes more than 15 percent of U.S. water consumption for uses other than irrigation (Feeley et al., 2008). Water use by thermoelectric plants in China is also huge. In 2006, the quantity of withdrawals was 49 BCM, accounting for 37 percent of total industrial use. Chinese thermoelectric plants consumed an estimated 7 BCM of water. Water consumption by geothermal plants depends on the technology and geothermal resource, as well as the cooling system. The 2,000 gal/MWh water requirement shown in reflects experience in the Geysers geothermal ""4 Environmental Impacts of Renewable Electricity Generation.""

The balance of water, for recharging the reservoir, comes from secondary-treated wastewater from a nearby community (DiPippo, 2008). Water consumption in liquid-dominated binary geothermal systems can be very high if wet cooling towers are used, but can be much lower if hybrid or air-cooled systems are used. Wind and solar PV technologies use very little water. Water-use requirements for solar thermal plants also depend on the cooling system. Values shown in reflect operating experience with a 350 MW parabolic-trough system in the Mojave Desert, which uses evaporative cooling and consumes about 800 gal/MWh; a comparable estimate of water consumption for solar power tower technology; and a projection of negligible water consumption with an air-cooled parabolic dish system. Finally, if evaporative losses from hydroelectric reservoirs are ascribed fully to the generation of electricity, large-scale hydroelectric power can be considered to more water per MWh electricity output than any other electricity generation technology (Gleick, 1994). However, reservoirs associated with hydroelectric power plants may have other uses, such as storage of irrigation water. Thus, evaporative losses may not be exclusively attributable to electricity generation. Life Cycle Assessment of Solar Photovoltaic Technology Although thin-film cadmium telluride and amorphous-silicon technologies are gaining ground in the global marketplace, most PV panels produced today are made of single or multicrystalline silicon. As discussed in , in China, the production of high-purity polysilicon for solar cells is a rapidly growing industry, although it has high energy requirements and serious pollution problems at some facilities. To minimize these impacts, polysilicon manufacturers in China, as elsewhere, must use state-of-the-art methods to reduce energy consumption and address problems with hazardous materials and wastes. In response to these environmental concerns, especially the need to separate and recycle tail gas, China has initiated a key research project on the comprehensive use of by-products from polysilicon production. As indicated above, although life cycle impacts of solar PV are estimated to be much lower than those of electricity generation from fossil fuels, the estimated NER and emissions impacts of PV are somewhat less favorable than for wind technology. The main reason is that production of PV panels is very energy intensive, with significant associated emissions of CO, NO, and other air pollutants. Estimates of energy requirements for silicon PV panel manufacturing vary widely, depending in part on the vintage of the manufacturing technology and in part on the sources of process heat and electricity required. Alsema (2000) reported that estimates published up to that time ranged from 2,400 to 7,600 MJ m for ""4 Environmental Impacts of Renewable Electricity Generation."" National Academy of Engineering and National Research Council. 2010. The Power of Renewables: Opportunities and Challenges for China and the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/12987. multicrystalline silicon and from 5,300 to 16,500 MJ m for single-crystal silicon panels. To illustrate the distribution of energy requirements among the steps in the process, shows a breakdown for manufacturing of multicrystalline silicon PV modules, beginning with the production of metallurgical-grade (M-g) silicon. The fractions shown are adapted from estimates by Alsema (2000) and Alsema and de Wild-Scholten (2006). Alsema and de Wild-Scholten (2006) assumed the polycrystalline silicon is produced in part using the Siemens process and in part through a modified Siemens process, with an overall average electricity requirement of 110 kWh/kg Si and assuming 1.67 kg Si is used per square meter of PV panel. Whereas Alsema and de Wild-Scholten assumed electricity for polysilicon production was supplied from a mixture of hydroelectric and natural gas combined-cycle generation, the modified results shown here were calculated assuming electricity used at all stages in the process was produced from primary fuel with a net conversion efficiency of 31 percent. The overall estimate of the energy requirement is in the middle of the range cited by Alsema (2000). The results show the importance of electricity used at the silicon-purification stage. If the silicon is purified using inefficient processing technology, electricity is supplied from relatively inefficient power plants, or polycrystalline silicon is wasted in wafer production steps, energy requirements can easily exceed those shown. By the same token, at some production facilities, the fossil energy required for polycrystalline silicon production has been greatly reduced by process improvements, Breakdown of energy use in multicrystalline silicon PV module manufacturing. Adapted from estimates provided by Alsema (2000) and Alsema and de Wild-Scholten (2006). ""4 Environmental Impacts of Renewable Electricity Generation.""

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/12987. including fluidized bed reactors for the silane decomposition step and renewable or highly efficient electricity sources. The process of manufacturing PV panels also entails the use, or by-product production, of a number of hazardous materials that must be monitored, handled, and disposed of properly to minimize risks to workers, the public, and the environment. In addition to SiCl, these substances include silane, a highly flammable intermediate of polysilicon production, and hydrofluoric acid (HF) and other toxic gases and acids used in cleaning silicon wafers and in texturing and etching. Large amounts of acidic and alkaline wastewater are produced, so wastewater treatment and acid recycling are also critical steps. Fluoride in wastewater poses special problems, because an excessive amount of fluoride in drinking water can cause a variety of diseases. Thus, strict standards are necessary to regulate the treatment and discharge of water containing HF. These issues are discussed in more detail in , where research for reducing environmental and health and safety issues associated with polysilicon manufacturing are highlighted. Renewable energy facilities, like other means of electricity production, can have significant environmental and socio-cultural impacts. Depending on the technology, location, and scale of the facility, these impacts can include soil erosion or degradation, forest clearing, disturbance or loss of wildlife, air and/or water pollution, noise pollution, and impairment of scenic vistas. For renewable technologies, these impacts are often, but not always, similar to or milder than the effects of other industrial development on a similar scale. Nonetheless, locating renewable energy projects in sensitive areas can make the environmental licensing of the project difficult and more costly, and so these project-scale impacts can affect the rate of deployment. Assessments of Ecological, Aesthetic, and Cultural Impacts Among renewable electricity technologies, large-scale hydroelectric projects have historically had especially stark consequences, especially if they involved flooding scenic valleys or town sites. For example, when the Dalles Dam on the Columbia River was completed in 1957, the associated reservoir flooded Celilo Falls and the village of Celilo, a tribal fishing area and cultural center that archeologists estimated had been inhabited for millennia (Oregon Historical Quarterly, 2007). Like other dams on the Columbia River, the Dalles Dam serves multiple purposes, including improved navigation, irrigation, flood control, and the generation of nearly 1,800 MW of electricity. Although the Dalles Dam has provided ""4 Environmental Impacts of Renewable Electricity Generation."" National Academy of Engineering and National Research Council. 2010. The Power of Renewables: Opportunities and Challenges for China and the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/12987. widespread benefits, they came at great cost to the Native Americans whose community and traditions were rooted in the area (Wilkinson, 2005). Since the Dalles Dam was completed, a web of U.S. laws have been enacted to protect natural and cultural resources from development pressures. These include the 1964 Wilderness Act, which prohibits activities that damage the character of wilderness in specified areas, the 1968 Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, which bans construction of dams and associated hydroelectric projects on protected stretches of rivers, and the 1969 National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), which requires that environmental reviews be completed with full opportunities for public input before federal actions are taken. In part because of these protections, the pace of large-scale reservoir construction in the United States has slowed dramatically since the 1970s, and most new U.S. efforts to develop hydroelectric power plants are likely to be relatively small-scale systems. At the same time, however, as plans for utility-scale wind and solar projects move forward in the United States, advocates will have to take great care in siting and designing projects and operations that minimize environmental and social costs. A case in Hawaii is another example of controversy surrounding the siting of renewable energy projects in locations of natural, cultural, or religious value. In 2007, Hawaiians celebrated the protection of a 26,000 acre tract of lowland rainforest on the island of Hawaii, after more than 20 years of efforts to restore public access and block the development of a geothermal power plant at the site (OHA, 2007). In the late 1980s, True Geothermal Energy Co. secured a permit to develop a 100 MW geothermal plant in the then privately held Wao Kele O Puna rainforest (Boyd et al., 2002). Native Hawaiians opposed the development because they traditionally used the area for hunting and gathering and for religious purposes. Some native Hawaiians also objected to the exploitation of geothermal resources in general because of reverence for Pele, the goddess of volcanoes in the native Hawaiian religion. The Wao Kele O Puna geothermal project was abandoned in 1994. When the land was subsequently offered for sale, the Pele Defense Fund, a native Hawaiian group, approached the Trust for Public Land to arrange a purchase for conservation purposes. Only one geothermal power plant—the 30 MW Puna Geothermal Ventures Plant—is currently operating on Hawaii. As the Hawaiian Electric Company moves forward with plans to increase development of geothermal and other renewable resources in the state, it has recognized the need to deal with cultural and environmental concerns in advance “with openness and respect.” After hydropower, whose impacts have been fairly well documented (e.g., ORNL, 1993), impacts on wildlife have been a particular concern for wind energy. Collisions with wind turbines have killed birds and bats; the numbers depend in See the “Environmental and Cultural Concerns” page of HECO’s website, . ""4 Environmental Impacts of Renewable Electricity Generation."" National Academy of Engineering and National Research Council. 2010. The Power of Renewables: Opportunities and Challenges for China and the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/12987. part on turbine technology and, very strongly, on turbine siting. In the United States, wind turbines were estimated to have killed roughly 20,000 to 40,000 birds in 2003 (NRC, 2007). Although these totals are much smaller than the hundreds of millions of bird deaths nationwide attributed to collisions with buildings, high-tension lines, and motor vehicles, localized impacts on specific bird populations can be significant. For example, raptor fatalities at the Altamont Pass wind site in California in the 1980s caused significant concerns. Relatively limited data on bat deaths from wind turbines are available, but mortality rates at some facilities are as high as 40 recovered carcasses per MW per year (NRC, 2007). The significance of this rate of bat deaths is hard to gauge, in part because of a lack of baseline data on species’ abundance. However, ecologists warn that as wind energy development accelerates in the United States, the potential for biologically significant impacts on bats is a major concern (Kunz et al., 2007). In the past decade, the wind industry in the United States has been required to pay more attention to siting considerations and equipment modifications to reduce animal mortality rates. The Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS, 2003) has issued interim guidelines for minimizing the impacts of wind projects on wildlife, and an effort to revise and update them is currently under way. These concerns are embodied in substantive laws that can go beyond imposing procedural requirements (as NEPA does) to sharply curtail or block development in some areas. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) of 1973 is a prime example; this law requires that federal agencies “insure that any action authorized, funded, or carried out by such agency… is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered species or threatened species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of [critical] habitat…” (16 U.S.C. §1536(a)(2)). ESA further prohibits any person from “taking” any endangered species or listed threatened species of fish or wildlife (16 U.S.C. §1538(a)(1)) where “take” is broadly defined to mean “harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill…” (16 U.S.C. §1532). ESA requires consultation with the Fish and Wildlife Service before initiation of projects that require federal action. Even for project development on private lands, consultation is recommended to avoid incidental harm. If there is a potential for incidental harm, project developers may proceed by securing an incidental take permit, which typically entails developing and implementing a habitat conservation plan and appropriate mitigation measures. Aesthetic concerns may not be specifically regulated but can be a significant issue for communities where new renewable energy projects will be located. The NRC (2007) study of environmental impacts of wind energy notes that in many countries and cultures, people form strong attachments to the place where they live that influence their reaction to new developments. Wind farms in particular ""4 Environmental Impacts of Renewable Electricity Generation."" National Academy of Engineering and National Research Council. 2010. The Power of Renewables: Opportunities and Challenges for China and the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/12987. are often proposed for ridgelines and other locations with a high density of wind where turbines are highly visible. Moreover, as with other renewable energy facilities, they are often proposed for locations where there has been no prior industrial development. The NRC (2007) study recommends a visual impact assessment process for determining whether a particular wind project would result in undue harm to valuable aesthetic resources and cautions that meaningful public involvement is crucial for acceptance. These same concerns would apply for transmission lines as well, and thus could become an important factor in the acceptability of large-scale renewables projects requiring new transmission. Under NEPA (and similar state laws), federal (or state) agencies must assess in advance the environmental impacts of their actions. Actions that fall under NEPA requirements range from the provision of loan guarantees for renewable energy projects to the granting of rights-of-way or the issuance of leases for construction of projects or transmission lines on or across federal lands. The objective of NEPA is to ensure that agencies fully consider potential environmental impacts and allow all interested parties, including the public, to provide input into the process before decisions are made. The process typically begins with a brief Environmental Assessment (EA), the purpose of which is to determine whether the activity might impose a environmental impact. If so, the agency must prepare a full Environmental Impact Statement (EIS); if the agency anticipates little or no environmental impact, a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) is issued. The majority of projects proceed with an EA, often after agreement has been reached on mitigation measures, and do not require full-blown EIS documents. However, large projects usually require a full assessment. In recent years, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), under the U.S. Department of Interior, has collaborated with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to complete region-wide “programmatic” EISs for wind energy development (BLM, 2005) and with the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service for geothermal energy development in the western United States (BLM, 2008). BLM is currently working with DOE on a programmatic EIS for utility-scale solar energy projects (DOE, 2009). BLM assessments are important because the agency administers more than 260 million acres of public land in the United States, almost all of it in the western half of the country and much of it rich in renewable energy resources. Each programmatic assessment addresses the implications of broad policies designed to facilitate private development of renewable energy on federal lands. EIS studies examine potential environmental, social, and economic impacts on a broad scale, with the objective of assessing resource potential; identifying lands ""4 Environmental Impacts of Renewable Electricity Generation."" National Academy of Engineering and National Research Council. 2010. The Power of Renewables: Opportunities and Challenges for China and the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/12987. that should be categorically excluded from leasing; identifying best practices for mitigating impacts; and developing guidelines for public involvement and consultation with other agencies during subsequent project-level reviews of site-specific proposals. As an example, the programmatic EIS for wind identifies potential impacts on soils; water resources and water quality; air quality; noise; vegetation; wildlife; paleontological resources; and cultural resources, including sacred landscapes, historic trails, and scenic vistas (BLM, 2005). Impacts on soil, water, and air quality are expected to occur principally during project construction, whereas impacts on noise, wildlife, and scenic vistas are expected to continue throughout the life of the project. Programmatic analyses have helped to streamline later assessments of individual projects but cannot supplant case-by-case analysis because impacts on natural and cultural resources are usually site specific. The Environmental Impact Assessment Law of 1979 mandates that a developer complete an environmental assessment before project construction. If not, the developer is required to complete a post-construction assessment. The Environmental Protection Bureau can fine the developer approximately $25,000 if no assessment is completed for the project. In recent years, numerous environmental disputes have arisen over the construction of waste incineration power plants. For example, protests by nearby residents against the construction of the Liulitun waste incineration power plant in Beijing had a significant social impact at the time. Since then, a mechanism for public participation has been introduced. For controversial projects that are environmentally sensitive, local governments are responsible for explaining the project to the public and for holding public hearings, if necessary. Like other economic sectors, the electric power sector (generation, transmission, and distribution facilities) in the United States is covered by a wide range of land-use and environmental regulations that encompass the development and construction of new facilities, facility operation, and decommissioning and site restoration. Project developers must typically attend to layers of local, tribal, state, and federal regulations and deal with multiple agencies and permitting processes. Different project developers may be involved in the generation facilities and in the transmission/distribution facilities. Thus the complexities of planning and permitting may be multiplied in terms of approval steps and timelines due to the number of parties involved. Special protections or bans on development may apply to lands (including privately owned land) with special designations, including historic sites, prime farmland, and wilderness and roadless areas. Where federal ""4 Environmental Impacts of Renewable Electricity Generation."" National Academy of Engineering and National Research Council. 2010. The Power of Renewables: Opportunities and Challenges for China and the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/12987. or state action is required for project development, NEPA or parallel state laws require environmental review as part of project planning. Federal NEPA requirements apply for any electrical generating facilities or transmission lines on federally managed public lands or offshore. Approximately 30 percent of the land in the United States is federal public land, and public lands are especially prevalent in the western United States, where significant wind, solar, geothermal, and hydropower resources are located. The American Wind Energy Association has compiled a guidance document that outlines the types of local-scale environmental impacts that can arise and the corresponding regulatory framework that governs the development of wind energy projects (AWEA, 2008). Projects developed on private lands face an array of local, tribal, state, and federal land-use and environmental review and permitting requirements designed to ensure that potential impacts are identified and mitigated. Siting and land-use regulations for privately owned land are usually the purview of state, tribal, or local governments, and hence vary widely across the country. In some states, public utility or state energy siting boards have jurisdiction to review and authorize new electricity generation facilities. State environmental quality and wildlife conservation agencies may implement requirements for environmental review. In other states, or for relatively small projects, siting decisions may be left to municipal or county agencies. Whether or not state-level approval is required, almost all projects on private land require local review for compliance with zoning restrictions and ordinances limiting height, setbacks, and noise. Renewable energy projects that release contaminants into air or water or thermal pollution to surface bodies of water may also be subject to state and federal regulations. The primary laws governing air and water pollution in the United States are the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act, both of which include direct federal regulations as well as programs that are mandated and enforced by the federal government but administered by states or tribes. Compliance with air pollution regulations under the Clean Air Act is required for biomass combustion and geothermal facilities that release pollutants to the atmosphere during operation; other renewable projects that entail clearing land or construction of new roads may also have to address concerns about vehicle or construction equipment emissions and fugitive dust. Biomass, geothermal, and solar thermal power plants that discharge cooling water to lakes or rivers face regulation for thermal pollution as well as contaminant discharges. Discharge permits may also be required for renewable energy projects that use water during exploration or production phases, including for sanitation and dust suppression. Confronted with multiple pressures, such as the need for economic development, expanded employment, and mitigation of GHG emissions, the Chinese government has promulgated policies and implemented laws on energy conserva- ""4 Environmental Impacts of Renewable Electricity Generation."" National Academy of Engineering and National Research Council. 2010. The Power of Renewables: Opportunities and Challenges for China and the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/12987. tion, environmental protection, and sustainable development (see for details of specific policies). However, to avoid or mitigate environmental, cultural, ecological, and scenic impacts, the development of renewable energy projects is subject to other national laws and regulations. Specifically, projects that involve feed-in power generation from renewable energy must secure administrative permits and submit information in conformance with relevant laws or provisions of the State Council. Western China, for example, is the birthplace of Chinese civilization. Throughout history, people of many nationalities have developed and created a rich and valuable cultural heritage, and artifacts in the region are the historical testimony that people of all ethnic groups developed the region and lived there together. To protect the cultural relics in these areas, on August 31, 2000, the State Council issued the “Notice of General Office of the State Council on reinforcing cultural relic protection and management in west development by the General Office of the State Council” (No. 60 in 2000). Since the adoption of the Renewable Energy Law, additional environmental regulations have appeared in China specifically to address environmental impacts of biomass power generation. In 2006, the State Environmental Protection Administration (now MEA) and National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) promulgated an official document to strengthen the environmental evaluation and management of biomass power generation projects. In accordance with the new provisions, the construction and operation of waste incinerators must meet national or industry standards (such as GB13271-2001 Solid Waste Incineration Pollution Control Standard), and the quantity and quality of garbage must be guaranteed. At present, to qualify as a biomass power generation project, the proportion of conventional fuel fed into the furnace by mass must be limited to 20 percent when a fluidized bed incinerator is used to deal with solid waste. In addition, existing laws, such as the Thermal Power Plant Air Pollutant Emission Standards (GB13223-2003) and Boiler for Air Pollutant Emission Standard (GB13271-2001), regulate emissions. Although laws and codes issued by the Chinese national government are considered to be the dominant set of rules, because of China’s vast territory and numerous regional differences, implementation of a particular project on a local scale can differ from centrally established guidelines. Some local governments faced with economic development pressures, a lack of modern technology, and a shortage of capital have been lax in implementing or enforcing laws and codes, although this situation is improving. Lessons from the experience of developed countries and increased capital investment can further improve the implementation of standards. As public awareness of and interest in environmental issues increases in China, there are likely to be projects that attract public opposition. In comparison to fossil fuels, renewable sources of electricity such as solar, wind, and geothermal can offer substantial environmental benefits, especially with ""4 Environmental Impacts of Renewable Electricity Generation."" National Academy of Engineering and National Research Council. 2010. The Power of Renewables: Opportunities and Challenges for China and the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/12987. regard to GHG emissions. When life cycle emissions are considered, all forms of renewable electricity production are expected to have significantly lower GHG emissions per unit of electricity produced than generation from conventional coal and natural gas plants. With the exception of emissions of NO and carbonaceous materials from biomass combustion, rates of life cycle emissions of conventional air pollutants from renewable electricity generation are also sharply lower than from coal and natural gas plants. Although renewable energy sources have major advantages over fossil fuels, they also raise some environmental concerns. Many renewable energy technologies are ready for accelerated deployment, but research and development are still needed to reduce their environmental impacts. While wind, solar PV, and some geothermal plants have very low water requirements, biomass, concentrating solar thermal, and some geothermal plants generally have requirements comparable to those of other thermoelectric facilities. benefit from efforts to further improve cost effectiveness and efficiency of low water-use cooling systems to help expand their utilization. Also, as a result of evaporation, water consumption associated with large-scale hydropower plants and other uses of associated reservoirs is particularly high. LCA is a valuable method of comparing environmental impacts of alternative electricity generating technologies and identifying where improvements are most likely to pay off. LCA shows that increasing system efficiencies and operating lifetimes will reduce environmental impacts for all renewable energy technology. The life cycle GHG emissions benefits of renewable energy are generally high, but improvements are possible in some areas. In particular, research and development are needed to reduce life cycle GHG emissions for emerging storage options, such as batteries and compressed air energy storage, and to reduce GHG emissions and electricity use in PV manufacturing. To minimize waste in the modified Siemens process for polycrystalline silicon production, the toxic silicon tetrachloride (SiCl) produced as a by-product of trichlorosilane decomposition must be recycled. Several tons of SiCl are produced per ton of polysilicon, and unless it is recovered and sold as a by-product or recycled in the polysilicon production process, a large share of the silicon feedstock is wasted. However, because the components of the tail gas are very complex, separation and recycling are difficult. News reports (e.g., Cha, 2008) indicate some Chinese polysilicon producers have not been attempting this critical step. Additional research is needed on the life cycle impacts of thin-film technologies, which comprise different processes and inputs than silicon flat-plate PV (Fthenakis, 2009). Both countries will need to reduce air pollution emissions from biomass combustion. As shown in the LCA section of this chapter, the majority of energy consumption and emissions associated with biomass power generation is in the plant cultivation stage. Both the United States and China are currently focusing on using waste biomass and should continue to do so. Even with waste biomass, ""4 Environmental Impacts of Renewable Electricity Generation."" National Academy of Engineering and National Research Council. 2010. The Power of Renewables: Opportunities and Challenges for China and the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/12987. however, pollutants are emitted during plant operation. Pollutants associated with the combustion of biomass include PAHs and nitrogen and SO. The combustion of municipal solid waste can produce dioxins and release heavy metals that must be captured. Biomass has lower nitrogen content than coal, but it also has lower heating values (15 to 21 MJ/kg for biomass compared to 23 to 35 MJ/kg for coal). Therefore, some biomass fuels can produce more NO emissions than coal does for the amount of heat it produces. The production of NO from the nitrogen in biomass is not well understood, because the forms of nitrogen are different from those in coal. Therefore, research is needed to minimize pollutant emissions during biomass power generation processes. Land use is also a significant issue with some renewable energy technologies, especially as we envision scaling them up in the future. Research will be necessary to understand the impacts that renewable power installations have on plants and wildlife in various geographies, and to develop effective ways to mitigate these impacts. Land-use impacts can be reduced by the use of previously developed sites, co-occupation with other land uses, using military and government sites, and encouraging distributed generation technologies to minimize the Renewable power development will have to be restricted in areas with sensitive ecosystems or high cultural or scenic value, and public involvement will be invaluable for helping to identify these areas. Additional research is also needed to understand impacts of large-scale (e.g., 10 MW for PV, 100 MW for wind) renewable energy installations on meteorology and climate. It is evident that, in both countries, large-scale renewable energy installations will also require new transmission infrastructure that entails environmental impacts. Siting and constructing new transmission requires similar processes, in terms of impact assessments, licensing, and permitting. Project developers may need to plan for this up front, and work with regulatory agencies, environmental and civil society groups, and transmission utilities to identify ways to mitigate transmission impacts. Opportunities include: identifying areas of common transmission corridors for use by a number of projects, addressing the need for new substations for interconnection and power transmission, and enlisting local support for transmission projects that enable more renewable energy technologies to be deployed. Finally, recognizing that renewable energy facilities and the installed generation technologies will have a finite lifespan, both countries will have to pay more attention in the next decade to decommissioning, recycling, disposal, and site restoration.

Scientists and engineers in both countries should work together to solve key technical challenges in waste treatment and recycling of components. Opportunities include reducing or reusing silicon tetrachloride and other toxic byproducts of polysilicon production, and recycling PV panels and wind turbine blades. For biomass power generation, the priority should be on reducing combustion emissions and using available waste resources (rather than dedicated energy crops), including municipal solid waste and agricultural residues.

The United States and China are the world's top two energy consumers and, as of 2010, the two largest economies. Consequently, they have a decisive role to play in the world's clean energy future. Both countries are also motivated by related goals, namely diversified energy portfolios, job creation, energy security, and pollution reduction, making renewable energy development an important strategy with wide-ranging implications. Given the size of their energy markets, any substantial progress the two countries make in advancing use of renewable energy will provide global benefits, in terms of enhanced technological understanding, reduced costs through expanded deployment, and reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions relative to conventional generation from fossil fuels. Within this context, the U.S. National Academies, in collaboration with the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) and Chinese Academy of Engineering (CAE), reviewed renewable energy development and deployment in the two countries, to highlight prospects for collaboration across the research to deployment chain and to suggest strategies which would promote more rapid and economical attainment of renewable energy goals. Main findings and concerning renewable resource assessments, technology development, environmental impacts, market infrastructure, among others, are presented. Specific recommendations have been limited to those judged to be most likely to accelerate the pace of deployment, increase cost-competitiveness, or shape the future market for renewable energy. The recommendations presented here are also pragmatic and achievable. 4 Environmental Impacts of Renewable Electricity Generation 5 Renewable Energy Policies, Markets, and Deployment in China and the United States Appendix A: Timeline of U.S.-Chinese Cooperation on Clean Energy and Climate Change Appendix B: Life Cycle Assessment of Solar Thermal Power Technology in China Appendix C: Life Cycle Assessment of Biomass Power in China Appendix D: Environmental Considerations for Photovoltaics You're looking at OpenBook, NAP.edu's online reading room since 1999.

Retrieved Jan 28 2021 from https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Green+economy+and+its+implication+in+Bangladesh.-a0392176413 INTRODUCTION Bangladesh is a developing country. The growth of this country is not steady enough. The major reasons behind the unsteady growth are lack of energy resources, poor infrastructure, slow implementation of economic reforms, and overpopulation. The above reasons create social unrest, poverty and huge unemployment. Besides that, Bangladesh is a low-lying river irrigated country along with vast Bay of Bengal sea basin in south. Frequently, the country affected by floods, tornadoes and cyclones etc. This rapid climate changes impacting the country's ecology and making it imbalance. So, it is high time for Bangladesh to focus on green economy and apply it. Because, the green economy promotes steady growth in income and employment which is driven by targeted investments in a range of cleaner approaches that lead to enhanced resource efficiency, reduced carbon emission and pollution, and prevention of biodiversity loss and ecosystems degradation. The green economy also promotes the development of basic services and infrastructure as a means of alleviating poverty and improving overall quality of life (i.e. access to energy through renewable energy technology). This paper tried to reveal the possible implication of green economy in Bangladesh, its implication problems and the required steps to solve those problems. 2.0 Objectives of the study: 1. To know what is all about green economy. 2. To look at implication possibility of green economy in Bangladesh 3. To recommend required steps for the proper implication of green economy in Bangladesh 3.0 Scope and Methodology: This research is a conceptual analysis of green economy and its possible implication in Bangladesh. No research has been conducted in our country related to this issue before. Though, few studies have been accomplished in other countries especially in developed countries. And, those researches have been used in this study as conductor. A digital Library research method (Archive) has been used in this study. Only secondary data is used in this study. The secondary data collected from various books, reference Journal, seminar papers and articles, and various web links. 4.0 Concept of Green Economy: The concept of the green economy has gained currency to a large extent because it provides a response to the multiple crises that the world has been facing in recent years. There is no unique definition of the green economy, but the term itself underscores the economic dimensions of sustainability. Recent UNEP report on the Green Economy, it responds to the ""growing recognition that achieving sustainability rests almost entirely on getting the economy right"". It also emphasizes the crucial point that economic growth and environmental stewardship can be complementary strategies, challenging the still common view that there are significant tradeoffs between these two objectives--in other words, that the synergies prevail over the tradeoffs. [1] UNEP [1] has provided some of the fundamental elements defining and explaining the core principles and concepts underlying a green economy. The main tenants of this green economy initiative are: investing in natural capital; de-carbonizing the economy; and creating green jobs. The sectors analyzed in the UNEP report are: agriculture, cities, forests, renewable energy, transport, water, buildings, fisheries, industry, tourism, and waste management [1]. A green economy is historically understood as an economic system that is compatible with the natural environment and thus, is environmentally friendly. Today, the concept of green economy has evolved to consider also social issues. By using clean technology and clean energy, the green economy is expected to provide safer and healthier environments, create alternative green jobs and preserve the development of societies [2]. Green economy is a fair and resilient economy, which provides a better quality of life for all, achieved within the ecological limits of one planet (Green Economy Coalition) Green economy is founded on the principles of: 1) Sustainable development; 2) Equity and poverty alleviation; 3) Resilience; 4) Inclusiveness; 5) Environmental limits. Finally, we can say, the green economy presents an alternative vision for growth and development, in which economic growth and improvements in people's lives are generated in ways consistent with sustainable development. While there are varying visions of what the green economy encompasses, this concept has piqued the interest of policymakers and businesses alike because it presents the possibility of new opportunities for economic growth [6]. 5.0 Benefits of Green Economy: Green economy mainly focuses on the sustainable development and social equity. Adaption of green economy brings several benefits for a country. 1) New growth: Going green means new possibilities for sustainable economic growth. This growth is different from traditional economic growth which in turn brings new technology and innovative minds to design the technology, meaning new jobs, and new businesses to create. New jobs will be created in various sectors to support the new businesses. Green energy, organic agriculture, eco-friendly textiles, green building. Not only will new green businesses benefit, but all the businesses that create the products for these businesses will benefit from new customers. 2) Efficiency makes financial sense: Going green translates into efficient, streamlined practices. Much of the problem with conventional agricultural, manufacturing, and even office space practices stems from inefficiency and waste. Energy is wasted, paper is wasted, materials are wasted, and Buildings are not energy-efficiency. Again, Expensive chemicals are used, even when natural methods are more practical. Also, Conventional farming methods are unsustainable over the long-term. Green solutions save businesses so much money; it is only a matter of being aware of more practical, efficient methods and the development of eco-friendly methods. Here are two examples of eco and cost-efficient changes. * Hemp fibers are more sustainable and less expensive to grow than cotton. * Making workspaces green, with energy-efficient light bulbs, solar lighting and heating options, using recycled office supplies and recycling office supplies, cut costs and waste. 3) The green society: Green economy will bring a green society as well. A green society will indirectly improve the economy as well. Sustainability and efficiency are the products of eco living. The product of conventional living is stagnancy. Awareness of how practical and cost-effective these changes are is the first step in the great transformation to a greener society. 4) Green economy and sustainable development: Moving towards a Green Economy is an important driver in the promotion of sustainable development. Green Economy can be considered as the path for the transition towards sustainable development. 5) Green economy and poverty eradication: By increasing attention to the resources that are used by poor to earn their livelihood, the shift towards a green economy is aimed at boosting employment in low-income areas. The green economy also promotes the development of basic services and infrastructure as a means of alleviating poverty and improving overall quality of life (i.e. access to energy through renewable energy technology). 6.0 Requirements for transition to green economy: The transition to a green economy requires a workforce with the right skills. This includes not only skills in the low carbon and environmental goods and services sector, but also those needed to help all businesses use natural resources efficiently and sustainably and to be resilient to climate change. These five elements of change can be implemented in all economic sectors: the primary sector which transform natural resources into primary products and includes agriculture, forestry, fishing, and all mining and quarrying industries; the secondary sector which takes the output of the primary sector and manufactures finished goods; and the tertiary sector that provides information and services. For all sectors, the aim is to establish--to the extent possible--closed or semi-closed nutrient and energy cycles and at least, minimize waste and boost recycling. (Payment of Environmental Externalities to Remuneration, p.4) The idea of this economy is to promise environmental protection, while being profitable. Aside from using energy responsibly, it has a focus on global warming, use of resources, deforestation and reforestation, and overall prevention of environmental pollution and damage. Transition of economy basically means the transition of current product and services into environment friendly product and services. Elberts says about the following issues [7]. For products and services, transition includes: 1. Environmentally friendly and enhancing products and services 2. Renewable energy products and services 3. Clean transportation and fuels 4. Green buildings For products processes, transition includes 1. Energy efficient manufacturing, distribution, and construction 2. Reduction of energy, materials, and water consumption through high efficiency strategies 3. Switch from carbon to non-carbon components. Transition of green economy in essence does some reforms of the economic policies of a country. The reforms include the followings: National reforms: a) Abolition of perverse subsidies, taxes and incentives; b) Rationalization of land use and urban policies; c) Introduction of integrated resources and water management; d) Improvement and implementation of environmental legislation; e) Appropriate implementation of the stimulus packages. International political architecture: a) Trade regimes promoting the flow of environmental goods and services; b) International support to the countries that incorporate the 7.0 Implication possibility of Green Economy in Bangladesh: Bangladesh is a developing country. In real terms Bangladesh's economy has grown 5.8% per year. Bangladesh's economic freedom score is 52.6, making its economy the 132nd freest in the 2013 Index. The country is struggling hampered by the fragile rule of law, Corruption and marginal enforcement of property rights. It also suffered by various natural disasters which is the output of global warming. Bangladesh is trying to improve its situation by incorporating various environment friendly policies for its current economies. This study will try to focus only with those forms of policies and activities that can help Bangladesh to transitioning its current economy into green economy. 1. Renewable energy: Solar energy is the most readily available and free source of energy in our country and traditionally solar thermal energy has been utilized in different household and industrial activities in Bangladesh. Several organizations have installed low capacity wind turbines, mainly for battery charging in the coastal region of Bangladesh. However, progress in the wind energy sector of Bangladesh is not impressive. Micro Hydro Power Plants can be installed in the north-eastern hilly regions and in the existing irrigational canal system with a sufficient head. The only hydro power station of the country, the Karnafuly Hydro Power Station with a generating capacity of 230 MW by 7 units, is located in Kaptai across the river Karnafuly. There are scopes of integrated small tidal power plants in the coastal regions. Biomass is the fourth largest source of energy worldwide and provides basic energy requirements for cooking and heating of rural households in developing countries like Bangladesh. Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Re-sources, Power division (2008) has published the National Renewable Energy Policy draft. The aims of renewable energy policy are to set policies aiming for developing renewable energy resources (solar, wind, hydro) to meet 5% of the total power demand by 2015 and 10% by 2020. 2. Energy Efficiency: Power is an essential factor for developing the socio-economic conditions of our country. Demand for power is increasing day by day. Moving towards energy sustainability will require modifications not only in the way energy is supplied, but in the way it is used as well. Reducing the amount of energy required to deliver various goods or services is also essential in this regard. Energy efficiency and renewable energy are said to be the twin pillars for sustainable energy. The power division of Bangladeshi government has taken a number of initiatives for efficient energy use and reduced consumption of energy. * Steps have been taken to revise the 'Building Code' inserting energy efficiency and solar energy issues * Initiatives have been taken in order to build awareness amongst the students, by incorporating Energy Efficiency and Solar Energy issues in the academic curricula of schools, madrasas and colleges * Installation of solar panels in the government, semi government and autonomous organizations within the next 3 years * Use of CFL bulb in all ministries and power sector entities * Conventional street lights to be replaced by LED and solar lights subsequently * Public awareness for energy conservation * The gradual discontinuation of incandescent bulb and electric heater * Limiting the use of air conditioners, or keeping temperature within 25 degrees C * Encouraging the business community for using solar energy * Introduction of energy star rating system in the electric appliances through BSTI * Discouraging the use of neon sign in the markets and shopping malls at night * Closing of markets and shopping malls within 8 p.m. 3. Climate resilience: Bangladesh Climate Change Resilience Fund (BCCRF) is a coordinated financing mechanism by the Government of Bangladesh, development partners and the World Bank to address the impacts of climate change. The fund was established in May 2010 with financial support from Denmark, European Union, Sweden and United Kingdom. Switzerland, Australia and United States subsequently joined the fund. This mechanism is enabling the Government to channel in over $170m grant funds to millions of Bangladeshis to build their resilience to the effects of climate change. The Bangladesh Government leads on the management and implementation of BCCRF. 4. Waste minimization and waste management: Bangladesh is trying to minimize Waste by 3R strategy. Waste minimization can be achieved in an efficient way by focusing primarily on the first of the 3Rs, ""reduce,"" followed by ""reuse"" and then ""recycle."" 5. Low carbon society: Bangladesh is trying to reduce the carbon emission from its economic society. Several precautionary steps have been taken already. And some policy will be undertaken soon. Bangladesh is forecasting the reduction of carbon emission from its economic society in the following manner. [Source: Yuzuru Matsuoka et al, [9] 6. Sustainable Agriculture: The economy of Bangladesh largely depends on the agriculture. Bangladesh has some future targets on agriculture that are as follows: 1) Self-sufficiency in food: 2013 2) Ensuring food security: 2017(a + a + n) (a + a + n = Availability, accessibility and nutrition). According to the National Commission of Agriculture report (unpublished), 7% of GDP growth need of 3.1% increases in demand for food crops. Targets are to increase storage capacities by building additional sizes of 50,000 tons by 2015 and 1 million ton by 2021 to facilitate safe storage of rice. Significant growth in the livestock sector has been observed, in which main contributor is commercial poultry sector. The demand for livestock products will be increased through the growing population, restrained growth of per capita income and higher income elasticity. The demand for milk, eggs, and mutton are increased by 6%, 5.2%, and 5.6% respectively with the growth rate of 4.4%. Annual growth rate for sheep and goat will be about 2%. There is a huge gap of 2 and 1/2 times, higher than country's milk production level, estimated in 2002. Therefore the target is to bridging this huge gap by 2021 [9]. 8.0 Recommendations for implication of Green Economy in Bangladesh: Following are the recommendations for several sectors in establishing the green economy in Bangladesh. Residential and commercial Industrial sector; sector; --Energy efficient lighting --Energy efficient furnace, (compact fluoresce lights, steam boiler and motor. CFL) and electric fan. --Fuel switch from oil to --Efficient cooking system natural gas (improved cooking stove, using metered gas). --Efficient refrigerator. --Efficient cooling system. Transport sector; Power sector; --Energy efficiency --Fuel Switch. improvement in old and --Reduction of transmission reconditioned engines of loss. road vehicles. --Modal shift from private vehicle to public transport and railway. Agricultural sector; --Enteric fermentation. --Managed soil. --Manure management. --Rice cultivation. 9.0 Final Comments: The study shows that there exists a high potentiality for Bangladesh to transitioning its economy into green economy. Again, Green economy is a different economic concept than the traditional economic model and it is very important in terms of Bangladesh. Government agencies must be responsive in implementing a green economy policy. But, the real roles have to play by the entire private and public organizations that involved in the economic growth of Bangladesh. In present situation, every sector is suffering from environment hazardous. Now, it is the right time to protect all the environmental hazardous and should convert all the environmental hazardous works into environment friendly works which can keep environment fresh for the next generation and similarly Bangladesh can able to establish green economy.

Appendix D Glossary of Sustainability Tools and Approaches The definitions provided in this appendix are from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency report, Sustainability Analytics: Assessment Tools & Approaches (EPA 2013). Benefit-cost analysis (BCA) (also known as cost-benefit analysis) is a widely used, well-documented tool for assessing the net economic effects of policies. BCA provides a systematic process for calculating, monetizing, and comparing the economic benefits and costs of a particular action, process, regulation, or project by putting benefits and costs in a common metric. The results of a BCA can be used in two key ways: to provide insight into whether a project or policy provides a net economic benefit or cost to a company or society; and, to compare the outcomes of different project or policy alternatives. BCA is based on economic theory and techniques. Specifically, BCA draws on peer-reviewed economic literature both to identify and define categories of benefits and costs and to help estimate benefits and costs that are not directly bought and sold in markets. BCA has been an important component of regulatory analysis at the EPA for over three decades. Documentation of the EPA’s use of BCA to assess the economic impact of federal policies and programs is extensive. EPA’s 2010 provides detailed guidance on the proper use of BCA (and other forms of economic analyses) to assess regulations and policies (EPA 2010a). The premise behind chemical alternatives assessment (CAA) is that because risk is a function of hazard and exposure, focusing on hazard reduction is an effective way to mitigate risk. By assessing chemicals of potential concern and their functional alternatives with respect to their effects on the environment and human health, CAA enables the substitution of safer chemicals (Lavoie et al. 2010) ] Information gained through CAA can be used by decision-makers in combination with analyses of cost, performance, and other factors to select safer chemical and material alternatives. CAA compares alternative chemicals within the same functional-use group across a consistent and comprehensive set of hazard endpoints. CAAs may also consider intrinsic properties of chemical substitutes that affect exposure potential, including absorption potential, persistence, and bioaccumulation. This approach to alternatives assessment orients chemical evaluations within a given product type and functionality. Factors related to exposure scenarios, such as physical form and route of exposure are generally constant within a given functional use group and would fall out of the comparison. Thus, the health and environmental profiles in the alternatives assessments become the key variable and source of distinguishing characteristics. Page numbers cited immediately after the names of the tools and approaches refer to EPA (2013). ""Appendix D--Glossary of Sustainability Tools and Approaches."" National Research Council. 2014. Sustainability Concepts in Decision-Making: Tools and Approaches for the US Environmental Protection Agency. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/18949. Collaborative problem-solving (CPS) is a tool that allows various stakeholders to work together to address a particular issue or concern. Stakeholders often have to reconcile divergent interests in order to address complex and interrelated environmental, public health, economic, and social problems in local communities. Many of these problems are deeply rooted and difficult to resolve without the concerted effort and active participation of all the stakeholders. When multiple stakeholders work together, they create a collective vision that reflects mutually beneficial goals for all parties. Such collaboration fosters the conditions that enable the parties to mobilize the resources necessary to realize stronger, more enduring solutions. CPS involves proactive, strategic, and visionary community-based processes that bring together multiple parties from various stakeholder groups (e.g., community groups, all levels of government, industry, and academia) to develop solutions to address local environmental and/or public health issues. Partnerships and negotiations are required to achieve such solutions. Partnerships refer to arrangements through which different stakeholders work together to achieve a common goal. These partnerships can range from informal working relationships to very structured arrangements in which goals, membership, ground rules, and operating principles are clearly defined. Negotiations refer to processes, ranging from informal to formal, through which different stakeholders agree to come together and resolve disagreements. The National Charrette Institute defines a charrette as “a collaborative design and planning workshop held on-site and inclusive of all affected stakeholders.” (Lennertz et al. 2008). Charrettes enable community organizations, public agencies, developers, and other stakeholders to work together towards solving contentious or complex situations. They are frequently applied in the context of land use planning to support revitalization efforts, including brownfield assessment, cleanup, and reuse. Often facilitated by architects and planners, the goal of design charrettes is to come up with a mutually agreed-upon vision for future development that is both effective and sustainable (EPA 2010b). Eco-efficiency analysis (EEA) is a tool for quantifying the relationship between economic value creation and environmental impacts, throughout the entire lifecycle of a product or service (Brattebø 2005; Moller and Schaltegger 2005; MBDC 2010; NACFAM 2010; BASF 2011 The term ‘eco-efficiency’ evolved from the work of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) in response to the first United Nations Earth Summit. The WBCSD defines eco-efficiency as “the delivery of competitively-priced goods and services that satisfy human needs and bring quality of life, while progressively reducing ecological impacts and resource intensity throughout the life-cycle.” (Lehni and Pepper 2000). In other words, to be eco-efficient is to add more value to a good or service while simultaneously decreasing adverse environmental impacts. EEA evaluates products and services by examining their environmental impact in proportion to their cost-effectiveness. BASF Chemical Corp. was one of the first companies to establish an EEA methodology in the early 1990s with the goal of reducing the environmental impact and costs of its products and processes. BASF’s EEA tool quantifies the sustainability of products or processes throughout their entire life-cycle, beginning with the extraction of raw materials through the end of life disposal or recycling of the product. It compares two or more products analyzed from the end-use perspective to obtain comprehensive data on the total cost of ownership and the impact on the environment (BASF 2012). EEA differs from benefit-cost analysis (see ) in that it does not seek to monetize environmental benefits or costs and compare them to non-environmental benefits or costs (Bohne et al. 2008). Whereas BCA typically seeks to evaluate the net social benefits of a policy or program com- ""Appendix D--Glossary of Sustainability Tools and Approaches."" National Research Council. 2014. Sustainability Concepts in Decision-Making: Tools and Approaches for the US Environmental Protection Agency. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/18949. pared to a baseline without the policy or program, EEA calculates the ratio of the total value of goods and services produced (output) to the sum of the environmental pressures created by the production of those goods and services (input). More sustainable alternatives have a higher output to input ratio, or eco-efficiency ratio (UNESCAP 2010). EPA defines the term ecosystem as the “dynamic complex of plant, animal, and microorganism communities and their non-living environment.” (EPA 2009) The contributions of ecosystems to human well-being—or ecosystem services—are measured in terms of human values, and can be thought of as the direct and indirect economic, social, and environmental services provided to human populations and reflects the complex interactions between and among living organisms and their natural environment (EPA 2009). Ecosystem services may be divided into four categories: provisioning services (e.g., food, fibers, drinking water); regulating services (e.g., flood protection, pest control); cultural services (e.g., cultural, spiritual, aesthetic); and, supporting services (e.g., soil formation, primary productivity) (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2005). The objective of ecosystem service valuation is to assess the consequences of altering ecosystems or using ecosystem services for human well-being (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2005). For example, one third of our food comes from plants pollinated by birds, bats and insects. The value of these pollination services in the United States is estimated at $6 billion a year. If we destroy populations of pollinators with pesticides, loss of habitat, or other stressors we would be forced to either forgo many fruits, vegetables, and grains we enjoy or replace pollination services with potentially costly alternatives. Thus, pollination is an essential and valuable service provided free in natural functioning ecosystems, and its loss has obvious and direct implications on the economic, social, and environmental systems. Environmental footprint analysis is an accounting tool that measures human demand on ecosystem services required to support a certain level and type of consumption by an individual, product, or population. Footprint methodologies estimate life-cycle environmental impacts from a narrower viewpoint than traditional life-cycle assessment (see ). The environmental footprint methods described below can be classified into two broad categories of analyses: streamlined life-cycle assessments that use a single-unit indicator (e.g., carbon dioxide equivalents) and location-specific analyses (e.g., ecological footprint of a city). A single-unit indicator does not mean that only one source or one piece of data is used. Typically, many different data are used but are converted to a single common unit, such as carbon or nitrogen. In this manner, single-indicator environmental footprint analyses are similar to economic tools that use currency as their single-unit indicator. Ecological, materials, carbon, nitrogen, and water footprint analyses are common methods available for calculating environmental footprints. Environmental justice (EJ) is the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless of race, color, national origin, or income with respect to the development, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies (EPA 2010c). Recognizing that some populations experience higher levels of risk, Executive Order 12898, “Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations,” directs federal agencies to identify and address disproportionately high adverse human health or environmental effects on minority and low-income populations that may result from their programs, policies, and activities (Clinton 1994). The development ""Appendix D--Glossary of Sustainability Tools and Approaches."" National Research Council. 2014. Sustainability Concepts in Decision-Making: Tools and Approaches for the US Environmental Protection Agency. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/18949. of the environmental justice movement has precipitated a great deal of research on the racial and socioeconomic disparities in exposure to environmental health risks (Cole and Foster 2001; Ringquist 2005; Brulle and Pellow 2006). These studies, often referred to as EJ analyses, evaluate risks and may also attempt to address them using other sustainability tools, such as collaborative problem-solving (see ), and design charrettes (see ), among others (NRC 2011). Exposure refers to a measurable contact of an agent with a target or receptor for a specific duration of time (IPCS 2000; Zartarian et al. 2005). In the broadest terms, agents can be biological, physical, chemical, social, or psychological, and can produce both adverse and beneficial impacts to the target. EPA has historically focused on minimizing negative impacts, but in a sustainability context assessing exposures that result in positive impacts is also relevant to evaluating tradeoffs. For human exposures, receptors can be individuals, populations, subpopulations, or life-stages of interest. For ecological systems, receptors can be individuals, populations, species communities, or ecosystems that include both wildlife and vegetation. For exposure to occur, the agent and the receptor must intersect in both space and time. Exposure assessments characterize and predict this intersection by estimating the magnitude, frequency, and duration of exposure (EPA 1992). Exposure assessments also describe the number and characteristics of the population exposed (e.g., vulnerable communities, ecosystems, or endangered species). They describe the sources, routes, pathways, and uncertainty in the assessment. Exposure assessments describe the environment as well as characterize and link the processes that impact the transport and transformation of agents from their source through contact with human or ecological receptors. These assessments are a central component in understanding environmental systems and how they change when intended or unintended perturbations occur. Futures methods seek to help decision-makers anticipate conditions and events that have not yet fully developed so they can influence or better respond to the ultimate outcome. Futures methods attempt to look “beyond the horizon” to provide insight into future trends that can be used to inform strategic planning. The following four basic techniques are widely used futures methods, each drawing on a different body of knowledge and serving a distinct purpose (EPA 1995, 2007): • Scanning methods are systematic and broad-based reviews of information gleaned from journal articles, newspapers, websites, books and other sources to identify relevant “weak signals,” early indications of trends that are just beginning to emerge. Scanning methods results typically require further analysis and can provide input for other futures methods. • Delphi methods use a structured series of interviews to learn from the observations and judgments of experts. Interview questions may explore the probability, timing, and impact of emerging opportunities and challenges. • Trend analysis methods examine quantitative data for trends and patterns, and use mathematical projections to extrapolate into the future. A complete analysis also requires identifying potential counter trends, exploring possible implications, and identifying options for a response. • Future scenario analyses construct detailed qualitative or quantitative snapshots of alternative scenarios that serve as plausible images of the future rather than predictions or forecasts and are used to investigate how individual elements might interact under certain conditions (Schoemaker 1995; Swart et al. 2004). This method can provide a context for a diverse group of stakeholders to examine how changes occur in complex systems, and explore how best to achieve positive outcomes given the range of potential changes. ""Appendix D--Glossary of Sustainability Tools and Approaches."" National Research Council. 2014. Sustainability Concepts in Decision-Making: Tools and Approaches for the US Environmental Protection Agency. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/18949. Many variations on these basic techniques have been developed (Glenn, and Gordon 2009). Green accounting (also known as environmental accounting) seeks to better measure sustainability by expanding gross measures of national welfare (product, investment, etc.) to include non-market values, in particular ones associated with environmental goods and services (Vincent 2000). In addition, green accounting seeks to incorporate costs and benefits of environmental protection and depletion of natural capital – two measurements not typically included in national accounting systems such as gross domestic product (Hecht 1999). While opinions vary on how to perform green accounting, the technique is used worldwide and is well-established in the United States. Green chemistry is the science and practice of designing chemicals, products and processes in order to reduce or eliminate the generation and use of hazardous substances. Like the related field of green engineering, green chemistry seeks to protect human health and the environment by applying sustainability principles at the design phase of a process or a product, where they can have the greatest impact and be most cost-effective (EPA 2011a). Green chemistry is a transdisciplinary field encompassing elements of chemistry, engineering, biology, toxicology and environmental science. This nexus across disciplines is essential for focusing on the complex questions associated with sustainability and for providing the tools needed to answer those questions. Green chemistry is guided by a set of principles that encourage the creation of safer, more efficient, and more sustainable designs for chemical products, feedstocks, and processes (EPA 2011b). Green engineering is the design and use of economically feasible products and processes that: 1) reduce the generation of pollution at the source, and 2) minimize the risks posed to human health and the environment. Green engineering incorporates environmental science along with sound engineering design principles to minimize the overall environmental impact of products and services during manufacture, processing, use, and disposal. Like the related field of green chemistry (), green engineering operationalizes the philosophy that decisions to protect human health and the environment have the greatest impact and cost effectiveness when applied early in the design phase of a process or product (EPA 2011a). Health Impact Assessment (HIA) is defined as “a combination of procedures, methods, and tools by which a policy, program, or project may be judged as to its potential effects on the health of a population, and the distribution of those effects within the population.” (WHO 1999) This tool is used to systematically identify how new projects or policies might affect public health. HIAs consider determinants of human health stemming from all of the three pillars of sustainability – social, environmental, or economic (Quigley et al. 2006). For example, HIA takes into consideration factors such as employment, education, and climate change. The two main objectives of HIA are: (1) to predict the human health impacts of program- or project-related actions, and (2) to provide stakeholders and decision-makers with information to consider when assessing and prioritizing strategies for addressing health risk and preventing adverse health outcomes over the life of a program or project (IFC 2009). HIA is designed to address negative and positive, intended and unintended, and single and cumulative health impacts across entire populations, taking into account the fact that not all subgroups will be affected equally Quigley et al. 2006). ""Appendix D--Glossary of Sustainability Tools and Approaches."" National Research Council. 2014. Sustainability Concepts in Decision-Making: Tools and Approaches for the US Environmental Protection Agency. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/18949. Integrated assessment modeling (IAM) is a tool that integrates knowledge from two or more domains into a single framework. In general, IAM brings a systems-based approach to decision-making that takes into account the three pillars of sustainability. Integration can occur at many different levels: some integrative models are limited to water quality or hydrology while other models integrate two or more environmental components (e.g., soil and water or water and biology). For example, the Framework for Risk Analysis in Multimedia Environmental Systems (FRAMES) represents a series of fate and transport models, which are integrated such that the outputs of one model feed seamlessly as inputs into one or more models in the framework. Still other IAMs integrate multiple decision criteria, which can permit stakeholders to consider all economic, social, and environmental criteria they can identify and obtain data for decision analysis. The integration of fate and transport (environmental) models with social and economic models and then the integration of these three components in multi-criteria decision approaches is yet another example of integration. The overarching goal of IAM is to ensure that policy decisions are informed by a thorough understanding of the interdependencies and interactions within a system’s economic, environmental and social spheres. Through IAM, policymakers and stakeholders can gain better insight into the suite of impacts of policy interventions, which is expected to lead to more sustainable outcomes. In a broader context, EPA defines integrated modeling as: (EPA 2008a) “…a systems analysis-based approach to environmental assessment. It includes a set of interdependent science based components (models, data, and assessment methods) that together form the basis for constructing an appropriate modeling system. The constructed modeling system is capable of simulating the environmental stressor-response relationships relevant to a well specified problem statement.” Life-cycle assessment (LCA) is a systems-based approach to quantifying the human health and environmental impacts associated with a product’s life from “cradle to grave.” A full LCA addresses all stages of the product life-cycle and should take into account alternative uses as well as associated waste streams, raw material extraction, material transport and processing, product manufacturing, distribution and use, repair and maintenance, and wastes or emissions associated with a product, process, or service as well as end-of-life disposal, reuse, or recycling. In some cases, LCA is applied with restricted boundaries, such as “cradle to [loading] gate.” Environmental footprint analysis (see ) is a type of bounded LCA (EPA 2006). LCA typically return two specific types of information: • A comprehensive life-cycle inventory of relevant energy and material inputs and environmental releases throughout the system (EPA 2006). • Estimates of the resulting impacts for a wide range of impact categories including global climate change, natural resource depletion, ozone depletion, acidification, eutrophication, human health, and ecotoxicity (Bare et al. 2000). This information allows an analyst to consider multiple parts of a system and multiple environmental endpoints in developing effective policies. Resilience analysis investigates the ability of a system (e.g., a human community, a supply chain, or an ecosystem) to continue functioning in the face of disruptions. Generally, resilience can be defined as “the capacity for a system to survive, adapt, and flourish in the face of turbulent change” (Fiksel 2006). Examples of resilience metrics include the magnitude of disruption that is required to move a system out of equilibrium and the cost (or effort) required to restore a system to equilibrium after a disruption has ""Appendix D--Glossary of Sustainability Tools and Approaches."" National Research Council. 2014. Sustainability Concepts in Decision-Making: Tools and Approaches for the US Environmental Protection Agency. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/18949. occurred (Carpenter et al. 2001; Vugrin et al, 2009). Resilience analysis studies the adaptive cycles in a system in order to understand its vulnerabilities and its capacity for resilience (Gunderson and Holling 2002). Once these patterns are understood, a system’s resilience can be enhanced through designs and processes that promote diversity, variation, distributed functions, effective feedback loops, and freedom for innovation and adaptation (Walker and Salt 2006). The resilience of any system depends on the interconnectedness and functional diversity of multiple subsystems. For example, in decentralized systems, functions are distributed so that a malfunction or disturbance in one area does not necessarily have a critical impact on other system components. More resilient systems are able to absorb larger shocks without changing in fundamental ways (Fiksel 2003). While natural systems tend to be inherently resilient, poorly designed human systems are often brittle and vulnerable to a variety of disruptions. Risk assessment adds an important contribution to advancing sustainability. In a risk assessment, risk is understood to be the possibility of adverse consequences from an event or activity. A risk assessment, therefore, is a process for evaluating the likelihood and/or magnitude of such consequences. Risk assessment should be viewed as a tool for evaluating the relative merits of various options for managing risk (NRC 2009). This includes carefully posing the risk management questions and evaluating the options available to manage the environmental problems at hand. There are a number of context-specific types of risk assessment that can be useful in understanding aspects of sustainability in complex, real-world situations. Four of these are described below (Bahr 1997; Stewart and Melchers 1997; Landoll 2006; Hiles 2011). Human health risk assessment (HHRA) is the process used to estimate the nature and probability of adverse health effects for humans who may be exposed to environmental stressors (chemical, non-chemical, or both), now or in the future. HHRA can help inform solutions to a broad range of problems related to human health risk. Children are a subpopulation that may be more susceptible to harm caused by environmental stressors because of various physiological and behavioral factors (EPA 2008b): • they eat more, drink more, and breathe more in proportion to their body size; and, • their behavior such as crawling on the ground and hand-to-mouth activity can higher exposures to chemicals and organisms. There are multiple definitions of cumulative risk assessments. The Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA) defines cumulative risk as the risk from the total exposure to multiple stressors (usually chemical) that cause one or more common toxic effects to human health by the same, or similar, sequence of major biochemical events. The EPA’s Cumulative Risk Framework provides a considerably broader definition that includes combined risks from aggregate exposures to multiple agents or stressors, where agents or stressors may be chemical, biological, social, or physical (e.g., noise, nutritional status) (EPA 2003). EPA’s cumulative risk assessment process focuses on populations and consideration of population variability; it has been used in many of the EPA’s programs, including: Research and Development, Super- ""Appendix D--Glossary of Sustainability Tools and Approaches.""

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/18949. fund, Air, Water, and cross-program endeavors like the Community Action for a Renewed Environment program. An ecological risk assessment (EPA 1998) ] is the process for evaluating how likely it is that the environment may be impacted as a result of exposure to one or more environmental stressors such as chemicals, land change, disease, invasive species and climate change. Ecological risk assessments can be used to predict the likelihood of future effects (prospective) or evaluate the likelihood that effects are caused by past exposure to stressors (retrospective). Information from ecological risk assessment is then used by risk managers for follow-up such as communicating to interested parties and the general public, limiting activities related to the ecological stressor, limiting use of a given chemical, or developing a monitoring plan to determine if risks have been reduced or whether an ecosystem is recovering. Segmentation analysis (also known as market segmentation or audience segmentation) is a process of dividing a larger population into smaller subpopulations or segments in order to identify psychological and socio-demographic correlates of target behaviors or values. Members of subpopulations are statistically more similar to one another than they are to members of other subpopulations (Grunig 1989). Common segment factors include demographic, psychological, and behavioral variables, such as income, age, attitude, race, sexual orientation, education, consumption, and leisure pursuits. Segmentation analysis combines these data into bundles of closely correlated attributes in order to define specific segments of the population. Social impact assessment (IA) is a tool used to assess the social impacts—both positive and negative--resulting from planned interventions (such as policies, programs, projects or actions), as well as any social change invoked by those interventions. The goal of social IA is to help decision-makers produce more socially, economically, and environmentally sustainable results. Social IA draws on knowledge gained through collaborative, community-based tools, and is therefore complementary to many other sustainability tools discussed in this document (ICGPSIA 1994; Vanclay 2003). Social Network Analysis (SNA) refers to a systematic process of analyzing groups (nodes) and relationships among groups (Wellman 1988). The groups and ties comprising the social network can be visually mapped as a scatter plot: interpretation of the social network draws on scientific disciplines focused on understanding interpersonal relations and social structures (e.g., anthropology, psychology, and sociology) (Borgatti et al. 2009). One of the most important uses for SNA is in mapping communications and knowledge flows among groups (Reagans and McEvily 2003). Understanding such knowledge flows has many benefits, including identifying new opportunities for strategic collaboration, identifying communication bottlenecks, streamlining the flow of information across departmental or organizational boundaries, identifying trusted sources of knowledge within the network, and targeting specific stakeholders where key messages will have the greatest impact. Understanding such dynamic network interactions is possible through SNA because the emphasis is not on the attributes of individual groups, but on how the structure of relationships among groups affects how individual groups behave when they are plugged into the network. Thus, the overall shape and connectedness of the social network is an important determinant of what the groups within it do and how effectively the network operates to transmit information or ideas (Granovetter 1973). ""Appendix D--Glossary of Sustainability Tools and Approaches."" National Research Council. 2014. Sustainability Concepts in Decision-Making: Tools and Approaches for the US Environmental Protection Agency. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/18949. Sustainability impact assessment (IA) is a combination of procedures, methods, and tools by which a policy, program, or project may be judged as to its potential impacts on the sustainability of a system and the distribution of those impacts within and among the economic, social, and environmental dimensions. Sustainability impact assessments are most commonly applied through a multi-criteria decision analytic approach, which helps stakeholders investigate the combined economic, environmental and social impacts of proposed policies. This approach can be used to guide stakeholder and decision-maker engagement and collaboration throughout the entire planning process (OECD 2010). The purpose for conducting a sustainability impact assessment is twofold: inform policy development by explicitly considering impacts within and among the economic, social, and environmental systems; and, assess potential economic, social, and environmental impacts resulting from a proposed policy (OECD 2010). Explicit in a sustainability impact assessment is the integration of all three sustainability pillars; consideration of both spatial and temporal impacts; stakeholder involvement; transparency; accountability; and, match between the level of detail in the assessment and the impacts (OECD 2010).

In its current strategic plan, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) describes a cross-agency strategy to advance sustainable environmental outcomes and optimize economic and social outcomes through Agency decisions and actions. Sustainability has evolved from an aspiration to a growing body of practices. The evolution includes a transition from the development of broad goals toward the implementation of specific policies and programs for achieving them and the use of indicators and metrics for measuring progress. Without losing focus on implementing its existing regulatory mandates, EPA's incorporation of sustainability considerations into its decision-making about potential environmental, social, and economic outcomes involves shifting from a focus on specific pollutants in an environmental medium (air, water, or land) to a broader assessment of interactions among human, natural, and manufactured systems. EPA has indicated that it will need to consider the use of a variety of analytic tools and approaches to assess the potential sustainability-related effects of its decisions and actions in response to complex environmental challenges. Sustainability Concepts in Decision-Making: Tools and Approaches for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency examines scientific tools and approaches for incorporating sustainability concepts into assessments used to support EPA decision making. Using specific case studies, this report considers the application of analytic and scientific tools, methods, and approaches presented in the 2011 NRC report . This report examines both currently available and emerging tools, methods, and approaches to find those most appropriate for assessing and/or evaluating potential economic, social and environmental outcomes within an EPA decision context. also discusses data needs and post-decision evaluation of outcomes on dimensions of sustainability. A broad array of sustainability tools and approaches are suitable for assessing potential environmental, social, and economic outcomes in EPA's decision-making context. The recommendations of this report will assist the agency to optimize environmental, social, and economic outcomes in EPA decisions. 4 Case Studies of Applications of Sustainability Tools and Approaches 5 Private-Sector and PrivatePublic Partnership Sustainability Initiatives: Applicability to Environmental Protection Agency Decision-Making 7 Applying Sustainability Tools and Methods to Strengthen Environmental Protection Agency Decision-Making Appendix B--Biographic Information on the Committee on Scientific Tools and Approaches for Sustainability Appendix C--The Sustainability Assessment and Management Approach Appendix D--Glossary of Sustainability Tools and Approaches Appendix E--Application of General Evaluation Criteria You're looking at OpenBook, NAP.edu's online reading room since 1999.

46791155-b433-4ff3-b39a-d2985592cf35,"How many calories do you need to burn to lose one pound? There are . To burn one pound, you must burn 3,500 calories. This can be done by reducing calorie intake and increasing your activity. Do not decrease your calories by more than 500-800 calories a day. This will slow your metabolism. Try to increase your activity by engaging in moderate to intense exercise for 20-45 minutes a minimum of 3 times a week. A 1-2 pound loss in weight a week is a healthy and more maintainable amount of weight loss. Let's say you typically eat 2,500 calories per day, and want to lose weight. To lose one pound in a week, you would need to eat 3,500 calories less during that week. This would mean reducing your caloric intake to 2,000 calories per day for the week, since 2,500-2,000 = 500 and 500 x 7 days = 3,500 calories. 3,500 calories are in a pound. If you eat 3,500 calories, you gain a pound. If you burn 3,500 calories, you lose a pound. If you eat 500 calories in a day how many calories would you need to burn to lose a pound? How many calories do have to burn to lose a pound? How many calories do you have to burn to lose 20 pounds? You need to burn about 3,500 calories per pound. Then you need to burn 70,000 calories to lose 20 pounds. How many calories musy a person burn in order to lose 1lb? In order to lose 1 pound, you need to burn 3,500 calories. How many calories does it take to burn off 1 pound? How many calories do you need to burn to lose one pound a week? To lose one solid pound of weight, you need to burn 3,500 more calories than you consume in a day. How many fewer calories do you need to lose a pound? You need to burn 3,500 more calories than you consume (for example, if you consume 2,000 calories, you would then need to burn 5,500 calories) to lose a solid pound of fat. How many calories do you have to burn in order to lose one pound if you weigh 115 pounds? One pound of fat is equal to about 3,500 calories no matter what your current weight is. If you can burn that many (or consume that many fewer) calories in one week, you will lose a pound of fat in one week. Calories in one poundThere are 3500 calories in a pound of human body fat (enough to survive two or three days). If you wish to lose body fat, you need to burn or lose 3500 calories to lose one pound. 3500 calories = 1 pound. To lose 1 pound in a week, a person must burn 3500 more calories than they consume (500 calories per day). How many calories do you have to burn to lose 52lb? To lose one solid pound of weight, you need to burn 3,500 more calories to consume. Then, to lose 52 solid pounds of weight, you would need to burn 182,000 calories. 3500 calories are in one pound of fat. To lose the weight you have to burn 3500 more calories than you eat. Fact: every time you laugh you burn 3.5 calories...laugh 1,000 times every day to burn 3500 calories. How many calories does the normal person have to burn in exercise to lose on pound of fat? It take about 3500 calories to burn 1 pound of fat. So that would mean that if you lower you caloric intake by 500 calories in a week you would lose about 1 pound. How many calories does one need to burn to lose one pound of weight? To lose one pound of weight one must burn approximately anywhere from 3400 to 3600 calories. It is not recommended to try and burn this amount of calories within one day. How many calories do I need to burn to lose a pound if i consume 1200 a day for losing weight? Regardless of how much you consume per day, you need to burn 3500 calories in order to lose a pound. How many calories would it take to burn thirty pounds? You have to burn 3,500 calories more than what you consume to lose 1 pound. So to lose 35 pounds you will have to burn 122,500 extra calories. If you eat 2000 calories a day how many calories would you have to burn to lose a pound? That depends on how many calories you expend in daily metabolism. To lose a pound of fat you need to create a calorie deficit of approximately 3600 calories. How many calories do you burn per pound of body weight? To lose or gain one pound of body weight, it takes 3,500 calories. You need to burn 3,500 more calories than you consume to lose one solid pound. How many calories do you have to burn to lose 5 lb? To lose a pound you have to burn 3500 so times five would be 17500 calories and you would lose five pounds, good luck! If you want to lose a pound of fat and not water weight, it takes 3500 calories. So it takes 7 days of having a 500 calorie deficit to lose a pound of fat. You are 170 pounds you want to lose 40 pounds how many calories you have to burn? To lose one definitive pound of fat, you must burn 3,500 more calories than you consume. (For example, if you consume 2000 calories, you must burn off 5500 calories ot lose one pound of fat.) That much times 40 is roughly 140,000 calories in total. What's the most outdated thing you still use today?

Any opinions, findings, conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of UKEssays.com.   This thesis considers what sustainability means to architecture, and how architects can utilise their knowledge to not only ensure a greener future for buildings, but to promote a better understanding of sustainability on a far wider scale. The areas under study include an appraisal of the technical, social, and financial and energy-saving aspects of sustainable development. Research proposes that systematic research and study into what sustainability means can help the concept to be more fully understood and better implemented in industry. Research is secondary, and uses three case studies which I have selected for their relevance to my design interests and which I believe represent a unique and innovative approach to the concept and interpretation of sustainability in architecture. If you need assistance with writing your essay, our professional essay writing service is here to help! Contemporary definitions of sustainability suggest that it is a generic term which encompasses many areas of society and industry, including buildings, transport, and public space. ‘Sustainable architecture’ has been defined as a ‘cultural construction in that it is a label for a revised conceptualization of architecture […] A ‘sustainable design’ is a creative adaptation to ecological, sociocultural and built contexts (in that order of priority), supported by credible cohesive arguments.’ This dissertation seeks to address and discuss the varied ways in which sustainability relates to architecture, including physical constraints, impact of sustainable design, political and social trends and needs, and the availability of resources with which to build sustainable architecture. For architects sustainability and its implications have become of great value and importance – ultimately changing the direction of architecture as a discipline and practical science. I believe that the term sustainability is a term thrown around very often without much thought as to what it means often because it is a concept of such great depth – with potentially world-changing consequences – and that the concept requires far more research if it is to be fully implemented on a mass scale. Throughout this thesis, I seek to define my own professional and creative interpretation of sustainable architecture by examining and learning from the work of others. In my structuring of the thesis I have narrowed down these interests to focus on three key areas as represented by three chosen case studies. These are to include: Chapter One. Technical sustainability: Werner Sobek This chapter examines how German engineer and architect Werner Sobek has integrated sustainable technical features into the design of his ecological home. The social housing Bed Zed project in London is also examined for its contributions to developing a clearer understanding of how architects might incorporate sustainable technology into their designs. Chapter Two. Social Sustainability: Seattle Library OMA. This chapter considers the impact and function of the public building for the immediate neighbourhood, and why the development is socially important. Chapter Three. Economical and Energetic Sustainability at Beddington. This chapter examines the key features of the Bed Zed project and what energy-saving and economic incentives the project offers to the wider community. Now one of the most well-known sustainable social housing developments, designed by Bill Dunster Architects, Bed Zed provides a useful and insightful point of comparison for the other studies. This allows me to assess the changes and improvements which sustainable development has undergone over the last decade. Chapter One: Technical Sustainability: Werner Sobek As outlined by Stevenson and Williams the main objectives of sustainability include significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions, conserving resources, creating well-structured and cohesive communities, and maintaining a consistent and successful economy. For architecture these concepts have opened up a new industry involving use of alternative often re-usable materials, which offers the architect space to experiment with new designs. A considerable body of research exists into the best use of construction materials, offering guidance to architects and construction companies. For example, in 2000 The Building Research Establishment published a paper called a ‘green’ guide to construction materials which presents Life Cycle Assessment studies of various materials and their environmental impacts. Whereas Energy Efficiency Best Practice in Housing have already established through research that there is global pressure to ensure that construction materials are sustainable. Sobek’s design of his own sustainable home has been described as ‘an ecological show house of precise minimalism.’ Its principal design is of a cube wrapped in a glass shield, where all components are recyclable. The most obviously sustainable technical feature is the building’s modular design – glass panels and a steel frame, which forms a lightweight structure. Sorbek’s work illustrates a high degree of thought behind the architect’s conceptual understanding of sustainability. Sorbek has obviously thought about what sustainability means and has implemented his knowledge to create an example from which future practitioners will learn. In Sobek’s work we see the high degree to which he has embraced new technology and made sophisticated use of new materials, while also maximising user comfort by incorporating sensor and controlling technology. Furthermore, the use of arbitrarily convertible ducts makes the use of traditional composites unnecessary. Thus, Sorbek is progressing the discipline of sustainable architecture, branching out into bolder, and stranger designs, which displace the functionality and detract saleability from traditional designs. In contemporary sustainable designs there needs to be a regularity and simplicity of form – as this seems best to reflect the sustainable philosophy of the architect. As Papenek said of the designs of ecologically sensitive projects: ‘common sense must prevail when a design is planned.’ Considering the example of Sobek it is clear that sustainable building – although fairly simple – can nevertheless draw from a range of theoretical models in its designs. For example, the influence of traditional, even classical traditions will never be entirely absent from contemporary design; moreover contemporary sustainable designs require a re-assessment of architectural theory and practice. As Williamson et al phrases it: ‘’green’, ‘ecological’, and ‘environmental’ are labels that embody the notion that the design of buildings should fundamentally take account of their relationship with and impact on the natural environment [..] labels refer to a particular strategy employed to achieve the conceptual outcome, and the strategies that occur in a discourse must be understood as instances from a range of theoretical possibilities. The promotion of a restricted range of strategic options regulates the discourse and the ways of practising the discipline [..] Overall, practitioners modify their concept of their discipline to embrace these new themes, concerns and ways of practice.’ Ways in which these theoretical influences might be expressed include experiments in symmetry, and regularity of form. Very often, as shown by Sobek’s work, the sustainable features require certain areas of space which can be unified under the more common purpose of working collaboratively. At Bed Zed in London any aesthetic compromises are more than compensated for by the provision of its own renewable energy. Forms, although not ambitious or ornamental do adhere to the Vitruvian principles of symmetry, where symmetry is defined as : ‘A proper agreement between the members of the work itself, and relation between the different parts and the whole general scheme, in accordance with a certain part selected as standard.’ In the BedZed project the regular layout, consisting of the assimilation of many component parts, reflects the sense of collaboration amongst the different companies which joined forces to create BedZed, and also the community feel amongst the people who live there. There is certainly a sense of completeness, deriving from the presence of many different units, fortified by sustainable features, where vents of varying colours detract from the strict regularity of forms, creating a light-hearted and ‘sunny’ aspect. Order and symmetry are integral to the design, as without these principles the amalgamation of materials and technological apparatus has the potential to look untidy. In both Sorbek’s project and at Beddington the presence of many windows, and solar panelled roofs, will come to symbolise not a lost tradition of architecture, but the securing of conceptual ideologies which aim to combine practicality with ecological sound principles and materials. Chapter Two. Social Sustainability: Seattle Library OMA. The Seattle Central Library, that opened in 2004, offers a unique blend of technical and social sustainability; where multi-functional spaces are combined with the most recent and efficient methods of construction. An important feature of the library’s placement is that it occupied the same site as the previous library. All too often new developments – such as the newly proposed re-building of the Thomas Cooper Library at USC, Columbia – involve purchasing a bigger site, often removed from the original location. This changing of location alters the layout of the city or town and thus changes the social dynamic of the area as well as the ways in which the public use the building. Designed by OMA Architects (Rem Koolhaas) and LMN Architects, the Seattle library has become one of the most famous buildings in North America. Athens attributes this rise to fame to the building’s ‘daring form, soaring spaces, and unique interpretation of library functionality’, as well as being a primarily green building with a LEED certification. The building is an irregular shape; this is necessary in order to maximise the exposure of the high performance glazing system to the light. A triple-layered glass wall allows for people within to have a shaded view out, while having plenty of daylight in the interior. One of the most sustainable features of contemporary projects should be to maximise daylight within the building and make best use of the energy that the sun affords. This not only means a greener ethic behind the building’s construction but also encourages people to make more use of the building as a public space, eg: for conferences, functions etc. The Seattle Library seeks to mark out a new definition of what public space means to the public, and how such a space can be multi-functional and dynamic in nature and design. Furthermore, the function of the building is not entirely contained to the immediate area or immediate society. For instance, the library has a rainwater collection system that is combined with a storm water detention tank. This means that the 40,000 gallon tank makes use of the required stormwater detention tank and increases its size by about 50% – offering additional storage capacity for landscape irrigation, thus both conserving natural resources and benefiting the local farming and economic community. This library project is of particular relevance to the subject of this dissertation as it made use of LEED NC points – an assessment method for the sustainable ‘points’ of a building as it is created. The Seattle library LEED NC points check highlighted social credits as being 28%: This project is a good example of how sustainable development can benefit the community and promote social engagement within the design process. As expressed by Athens, ‘by its very nature, design process can represent the social side of sustainability because it is all about the people involved—their vision, creativity, and collaborative skills.’ Because the library project was aiming to provide a large community of people with an important service, and because the project needed to ensure a high level of longevity for the building, an extra three months was taken before the actual project design in order to research and map out the future of libraries – their evolution, functionality and use of technology. Athens explains that ‘this process served to question assumptions regarding the core purpose of the project, and assess fundamental concepts for how needs could be met.’ The Bed Zed project in London – although a social housing development – provides a useful point of contrast to the Seattle project. For example, Bed Zed is a good example of how local government can work with local society, in a community-based project. While Athens expresses, ‘social aspects are harder to define as value propositions within the triple bottom line, and are often thought of as “externalities,” it was the primary objective of the Bed Zed project to ensure that all parties were represented and consulted throughout the course of the project. In this way the social sustainability of the project is best achieved – as once completed, the residents of the 82 homes have expressed their enthusiasm for the project, highlighting its convenience, its thoughtfulness in design, and its energy-efficiency. As Buckingham said of the social cohesion that went into the Bed Zed project, and which the project itself precipitated: ‘There is a synergy from building on these links so that capacity building is achieved through partnership in delivering local environmental sustainability projects and policies. Greater capacity as the sum of the collective work done in various initiatives is greater than the individual parts or partners, and, overall, individual projects and initiatives have a positive impact locally regarding environmental sustainability[..] The design provides a carefully researched balance between the needs of residents, businesses and community activities; the need for sunlight and daylight; an economic construction system and high levels of insulation without losing contact with the outside world.’ As designers Bill Dunster Associates have noted, ‘the true value of any site is determined by the amount of accommodation the local planning area sub-committee will allow to be built on it-empowering local communities to promote zero emissions developments, without relying on large central government grants, or asking the developer to pay for the increased building costs of super efficient urban fabric.’ Thus, in the design and implementation of sustainable projects it is necessary for architects to work closely and liaise with the local planning committee, stakeholders, and potential residents. Chapter Three: Energetic and Economic Sustainability In this chapter I seek to define the nature and importance of low-energy expenditure in construction and how to lower the building’s eventual energy output through new and innovative designs. Bed ZED Project, or Beddington Zero Energy Development, is the UK’s largest carbon-neutral eco-community in the UK. It was built in 2002 in Wallington, within the London Borough of Sutton, and offers 82 residential homes. The Project was developed by the Peabody Trust, a social housing initiative in London, that aims to fight poverty within the capital. The aim of this project was to build in partnership with both an architect and an environmental consultancy firm, in order to create a housing project that incorporates new approaches to energy conservation and sustainability, and to develop a thriving community to live within it. Our academic experts are ready and waiting to assist with any writing project you may have. From simple essay plans, through to full dissertations, you can guarantee we have a service perfectly matched to your needs. The BedZed design is unique for having incorporated a zero energy policy, where the energy that the building’s inhabitants need is produced by renewable sources generated on site. Reclaimed materials were used, including floorboards, bollards, and timber. It is a large site, including a sports field, offering 50 dwelling spaces per hectare, 120 workspaces per hectare, and over 4000m2 of green open space per hectare. Utilisation of space is a key component of the design; the roofs of workspaces are used as gardens, where in comparable circumstances, most densities might only have room for a balcony. According to the designers of BedZED, the “combination of super-insulation, a wind driven ventilation system incorporating heat recovery, and passive solar gain stored within each flat by thermally massive floors and walls, reduces the need for both electricity and heat to the point where a 135 kW wood fuelled combined heat and power plant (chp) can meet the energy requirements for a community of around 240 residents and 200 workers.” The community treats all its black and grey water on site, and collects rainwater to minimise mains water consumption. A photovoltaic installation provides enough solar electricity to power 40 electric cars and the community has the capability to lead a carbon neutral lifestyle-with all energy for buildings and local transport being supplied by renewable energy sources. Other environmentally sensitive practices include community composting and plans for urban gardening on part of the adjoining Metropolitan Open Land, subject to local authority approval. Using the Bio-Regional principles of local material and labour sourcing stimulating the local economy, and minimising pollution from transportation, the team is now developing a site based prefabrication technique. Buckingham records that on-site workshops took second hand materials directly from demolition sites, cleaning up both timber and steel, and using simple jigs to build structural frames. Materials for this development – such as new hardwoods, including oak and chestnut – were sourced from local WWF Forest Stewardship Council approved woodland. Whereas local brick, concrete aggregate and precast floor planks were all sourced within 35 miles of the site, thus ‘ensuring that all bulky materials have a reduced embodied energy.’ It is important for architecture to embrace and promote new sustainable housing as a viable and prosperous alternative to renovating older style homes – and installing sustainable features – as to the potential home-owner an affordable, sustainable home is far more likely to be a more valuable asset of the future, offering them more efficient use of energy and a better quality of life. As highlighted by Glasgow Housing Association the most toxic build up of emissions occurs within the home, rather than outside the home, which is why new developments have greater viability for meeting the needs of housing associations and potential inhabitants. As stated in BedZed is ‘a piece of radical architectural design, and deserves to be seen within a wider context as a model for future volume housing.’ In terms of sustainability BedZed betters the Millennium Village as it includes photovoltaic cells and individual power units, and the heating requirements of BedZED homes are around 10% of that of a typical home. On their design of BedZed, Bill Dunster Architects is quoted as saying that it was a ‘high profile housing development: designed to be carbon neutral eco-housing with ostensible eco styling’; one where the houses were designed around a heat and power unit that operates on heat and electricity from tree waste. The project, did however, run over budget and well over its timescale – due to problems in implementing the design and generating a truly sustainable outcome. As discussed by Williamson et al, sustainable design can be problematic in decision processes being made throughout the design process: “In practice an architect must make many decisions quickly and simply, on the basis of apparent fittingness with the right thing to do rather than deep analysis. Designers are also typically concerned with many decisions at the same time, switching from one to another in an attempt to find a fit between them, and initially regard most decisions as provisional anyway. Moreover, design problems are notoriously difficult to manage, to the extent of being labelled wicked.” Whereas traditional strategies for decision-making and overcoming problems might rely upon an architect’s experience and ability to identify key features of a new situation and apply their knowledge correctly, within the relatively new field of sustainable architecture, architects have to make decisions based on the work of others. As Williams and Radford suggest: ‘skilful practitioners learn to conduct frame experiments in which they impose a kind of coherence on messy situations and thereby discover consequences and implications of their chosen frames. Long webs of ‘what if I try this?’ speculations are spun out in the process of making a design. In this way designers come to understand the possibilities and scope of a problem through a circle of making proposals and reflecting on their implications. From time to time, their efforts to give order to a situation provoke unexpected outcomes – ‘back talk’ that gives the situation a new meaning. They listen and reframe the problem.’ It is this ability to problem frame; to on-the-spot experiment, and detect the consequences and implications of sustainable designs that will allow architects to succeed in creating truly sustainable designs – designs which do not overrun budget or time-frames, but which seek to make a compromise between the interests of all parties and the resources available. As suggested by a number of researchers – including Buckingham and Healey, ‘building local knowledge and building on local knowledge within civil society is key to the development of social capital and institutional capital.’ Healey comments on the importance of local knowledge within different areas of civil society, and suggests that there is a need for local government to learn about ‘different social worlds’ from which ‘stakeholder’ groups and organisations come. The case studies under discussion have exhibited the varied considerations and implications that sustainable development involves. Contemporary projects require an interdisciplinary approach – one that consolidates information and can be used as a resource for future projects and research. As expressed by Hinchcliffe et al calculations and projections for the economic viability of sustainable projects require making ‘what formerly might be held to be no expertise as a resource for possible innovation, and to think of a project whereby expertise is less about distant judgments and more about learning to gather together in innovative ways.’ A thorough means of assessing to a specific degree the sustainability of projects can be achieved by measures such as the LEED NC, which should be a valuable and essential element of architectural practice. What the case studies have shown is that all sustainable projects need to be cohesive – stakeholders, interested parties, need to be involved and to work with the architect, if the sustainable aims are to be achieved. What all the sustainable developments under study have shown is that sustainable development is concerned with creating a build that is durable, while being economically, energetically, and practically sustainable. The overriding principle – as expressed by company ‘Sustainable Build‘ is that ‘less is more’, and it is easy for a design to run over its budget – simply by trying to include too much or be too clever. Thus, a professional architect will need to aim for simplicity and functionality, and aim to make optimum utilization of space, often by thinking dual-purposefully – as shown by the water tank at Seattle Library. Peter Fawcett sums up the contemporary relationship between architecture and sustainability – offering an explanation to the question posed at the beginning of this thesis: ‘People may ask – ‘what does sustainability mean for architecture?’ but perhaps the proper question is – ‘what does architecture mean for sustainability?’ The former question suggests a ‘weak’ approach to sustainability, i.e. an implicit assumption that sustainability has implications (possibly serious) for our present ways of procuring the built environment but those ways are basically appropriate. The latter question recognizes sustainability as the overarching concern, in terms of which all social disciplines and conduct must be reinterpreted and reformulated.’ As mentioned above, sustainable development is about keeping within the means of a realistic and attainable budget and within the aims and scope of the people involved. It is not only about ‘installing energy efficient and environmentally friendly appliances, some of which can be expensive and where the paybacks may not materialise for some time but also about recycling and making the most use out of natural materials and other materials which may have been discarded or dismissed.’ Different people have different environmental goals that they wish to achieve, and each sustainable development will thus reflect these goals. Benefits to the community and to the individual can be huge, and often simultaneous. Yet more than this, sustainable development is more of an umbrella term – that affects (or should affect) the ways in which people live and build within their environments, and how these attitudes and practices can evolve and make best use of these environments. In an article for the Guardian, architect Bill Dunster expresses his concerns that green-living should not mean ‘dull’ living: ‘I find the checklist-orientated green movement very dull. I am worried about eco-fascism and a distinct loss of “joie de vivre”‘ With respect to the designs studied in this thesis there is certainly a lively, contemporary feel to the design of the Seattle project, combined with an optimum utilisation of space. Again, in the Bed Zed project, the symmetry of design and the colours used in the materials created a fun, individual look, that could not easily be replicated. Taking all the above into consideration my own research into what sustainable development means has led me to the conclusion that sustainable architecture does not mean dull or simple living for buildings’ inhabitants. Rather, the use of sophisticated technology – as exemplified by the work of Sorbek – can mean a wholly different form of living to traditionally constructed buildings which are not sustainable. This new way of living – where space is used differently and more efficiently, and the impact of a person’s existence is immediately reduced and made to feel ‘sustainable’ offers a unique and more wholesome existence for the occupier. In conclusion, research for this project has highlighted the term ‘sustainable’ to relate both directly and indirectly to architecture. While depending upon the social, technical, and financial structure of a project and its outcomes, sustainable development necessitates a flexible and dynamic understanding of energy, it’s potential, and its conservation. Sustainable development is all too often restricted by the options available, whereby practitioners modify their concept of their sustainability to suit individual projects. Although a degree of flexibility is required in order to modify design projects to suit the needs of all parties involved, it is essential for a professional architect to keep a clear focus on his or her definition of sustainability and what sustainability brings to the discipline and to their working life. In this way architects – such as Sorbek – can ensure that they create examples of truly sustainable architecture that can be used to teach younger architects entering into the profession. As explained by Williamson et al, the practice of the discipline of sustainable architecture is necessarily subject to ‘concepts and strategies based on common themes or concerns’ where ‘the continuation, small shifts, fundamental transformations, or replacement of issues can be affected by institutional settings such as political events, changes in technologies, scientific discoveries, calamities (actual or imagined) or economic practices and processes.’ Seen in this way, says Williamson et al, ‘green’, ‘ecological’, and ‘environmental’ are ‘labels that embody the notion that the design of buildings should fundamentally take account of their relationship with and impact on the natural environment’, but the practice of implementing these concepts into physical realities requires a much deeper and more intrinsic understanding of what sustainability means – for design, operation, and budget of a project. Designs of longevity thus require an intelligent assimilation and interpretation of cultural trends and the ability to envision how a design might be embraced by future generations. Designs for the BedZed project might appear to have compromised some aesthetic elements in favour of cost and time efficient means of production. Yet these principles are essential to the future of housing design if the demands of the housing market are going to be met. Design thus involves incorporating aspects of the traditional, and the classical, in a new and dynamic housing solution, whereby the traditional principles of an architecture will never disappear from design, but will necessarily adopt a more subtle position in the ideologies of contemporary architects. The potential remains for further research into the construction of more gracious buildings than the BedZed project, but perhaps less expensive than the Seattle library. Sustainability is about finding middle ground between sustainable objectives and availability of resources and the type of budget available. Research has shown that it is possible to construct buildings which can incorporate the fundamental technologies to propitiate sustainability, but remain aesthetically impressive or even monumental in their design. Yet it is important to remember that building with sustainability in mind is still a recent trend, and one that has not yet overridden the non-ecological techniques of mass housing developments – which are all too often seen as the easier, cheaper option for local governments. Therefore, sustainable designs remain very much in their infancy and future research will require sustained interest and financial support from both architects and from Governments alike if they are to be incorporated into mainstream architectural     To export a reference to this article please select a referencing stye below: If you are the original writer of this essay and no longer wish to have your work published on UKEssays.com then please: Our academic writing and marking services with our range of university lectures!

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/18949. In the 20th century, government agencies, such as the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), tracked the emergence of important national and international trends by seeking input from reliable outside and internal experts and businesses that had good reasons to stay ahead of trends and by reading mass-media reports and studies produced by not-for-profit organizations. Federal agencies collected their own data, but often something environmentally important occurred before federal agencies found out by scanning their own data. In the 21st century, the ability to gather, maintain, analyze, and circulate data has improved markedly. Smaller and less expensive environmental monitors have been developed and deployed, so people in EPA and state environmental agencies (such as California’s Emerging Environmental Challenges Program) can quickly scan collected data for notable emerging trends and cross-reference with colleagues anywhere in the world who have similar capabilities. The ability to identify and understand trends in public preferences and perceptions has also improved markedly. The traditional survey, which uses protocols recommended by the American Association for Public Opinion Research, is one of the best ways to learn about public preferences, perceptions, and values associated with the environment because a representative sample is gathered and confidence limits can be estimated for the results. But it is now feasible to scan data for marked shifts in public perceptions. Joined with standard opinion-poll data and selected longitudinal surveys, social- media data analytics can allow EPA to stay up to date with what the public is thinking; some analytic tools may even assist in predicting public attitudes about specific issues as they emerge. As the 21st century progresses, the United States will probably undergo substantial economic, environmental, and social changes; not only are the expected changes complex, but their occurrence is expected to be rapid. New issues will include substantial uncertainty. The anticipation and prevention of adverse effects, as opposed to detection of and response to them, is growing in its appeal. Earlier recommendations to EPA seem prescient: “that EPA should include among its repertoire of analytical and technical skills, a capability to routinely and systematically study the range of possible environmental futures ahead, and advise the nation on possible actions in response” (EPASAB, 1995). The ability to anticipate, assess, and manage challenges is at the heart of sustainability practices and therefore plays a major role in addressing new issues and evaluating strategies that can minimize potentially deleterious effects. Regardless of what technologies, tools, methods, or approaches one chooses for assessing and managing emerging issues, data will fuel them (EPA 2013a). Access to high-quality data will be a pivotal determinant of success in applying sustainability approaches to management of new-issues, and it is clear that EPA and other federal agencies have deemed this a signature issue (White House 2014). This chapter discusses some key considerations regarding the need for EPA to develop science-grounded information more rapidly. It also considers a variety of specific challenges that EPA is likely to face in deciding how to apply sustainability tools and approaches when addressing a new issue. ""6 Identifying and Addressing New Issues."" National Research Council. 2014. Sustainability Concepts in Decision-Making: Tools and Approaches for the US Environmental Protection Agency. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/18949. KEY CONSIDERATIONS FOR IDENTIFYING AND ADDRESSING NEW ISSUES The regulatory implications of new issues can be informed and guided by the early warning of the existence of the issues through a robust EPA surveillance program and by equally robust sustainability assessments and analytics. However, once an emerging issue has been identified, an initial assessment will be necessary to categorize it in such a way as to determine whether regulatory oversight is necessary and, if so, which regulatory agencies should engage. Given that emerging issues, whether proceeding from societal or natural factors, will probably cut across social, economic, technologic, and environmental risk assessment and management, multiple regulatory agencies often will need to engage and collaborate. The discussion on megatrends in identified several important drivers of new issues that may confront regulatory agencies in the future. The rate at which challenges are likely to approach and their increased complexity will afford progressively shorter periods in which to assess them and, if necessary, to devise strategies to address them. An increased technical presence within the staffs of regulatory agencies may be required. And screening assessments, tools, and formal sustainability assessments may need to be further automated to meet the rapid throughput that new-issue management will require. Given the global nature of many existing environmental and sustainability issues and the likelihood that new issues will have international implications, new-issue identification may promote congruent approaches and regulatory convergence among countries that are attempting to address newly identified issues jointly. The sharing of sustainability tools and approaches could foster such congruent approaches. Rapid Changes in Information Technology and Resulting Opportunities for Input and Stakeholder Engagement The stunning pace of advances in information technology (IT), data management, and analytics () presents opportunities for EPA to engage stakeholders better. The considerable computing research already under way in EPA provides an excellent base for improving many sustainability tools and approaches while providing the capacity to create new approaches, tools, and models to support new-issue identification and assessment. , the so-called Green Book (NRC 2011a) recommended the development of a screening tool to assess an emerging issue rapidly to inform the selection of appropriate sustainability tools and approaches. Social-media platforms and analytics present new and effective forums to engage stakeholders, allowing for the use of analytic approaches to provide rapid analysis and categorization of stakeholder input and to provide transparency to stakeholders on how the agency uses their input in its decision-making. This approach presents an opportunity to derive a substantial increase in value from stakeholder processes already in place in the agency. Additional value could be created in the use of advanced IT capabilities in: • Benchmarking the potential effects of newly identified issues in the regulated community and other stakeholders. • Mapping the effects of newly identified issues in demographic or stakeholder categories. • Setting priorities of newly identified issues for action in multiple stakeholder categories. • Identifying the socially influential stakeholders to spearhead the communication of emerging issues to a broader citizenry. • Assessing stakeholder preferences for sustainable and resilient products and technologies through analysis of social-media data. EPA should leverage and enhance its advanced IT capabilities to assess emerging issues by involving the regulated community and other stakeholders through social analytic tools. ""6 Identifying and Addressing New Issues."" National Research Council. 2014. Sustainability Concepts in Decision-Making: Tools and Approaches for the US Environmental Protection Agency. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/18949. Incorporating insights from a broad array of stakeholders could markedly improve EPA’s understanding of a new issue’s importance and of the speed with which it is emerging. The insights could also improve the evidence base for the agency’s decision-making process and increase the likelihood of stakeholder acceptance of difficult decisions. The massive extent to which our world has been instrumented, interconnected, and digitized presents new opportunities to change the way in which decision making is accomplished and government agencies deliver their services. Concepts of e-government, digital government, and digital state include interactions between the government and individuals within a secure, online context. In addition, this new digital age offers opportunities for the government and the governed to conduct a rational and innovative dialog on sustainability. This is especially true when governments are able to discuss sustainability with a focus on what constituents value most, adoption of service design thinking (considering the constituents’ perspectives) and building strong levels of trust with public, academic and business sectors. Extensive digital capabilities and assets, such as the ability to assess massive amounts of public-comment through deep analytics, have the potential to deliver answers rapidly to the public via mobile devices and create effective and trustworthy data security and personal privacy through advanced security solutions. In addition, the advent of machine-to-machine learning and cognitive computing portends, not only the democratization of knowledge, but perhaps also the democratization of insights. Shared insights are a powerful cohesive force in consensus building and decision making within sustainability discussions. If staff reductions and budget cuts continue, EPA may have neither the time nor the resources to devote to expanding and refining its capability to identify and address emerging environmental challenges. The agency could benefit from strategic interaction with industry and academe in a larger collaboration focused on future method development related to sustainability concepts with joint development of assessment tools and approaches. In fact, future development of all existing or new tools and approaches could benefit from a similar strategic collaboration, perhaps occurring in projects under EPA’s Design for the Environment program. The concept of unintended consequences is not a new issue for EPA. For example, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 required that gasoline sold in areas of the nation that have poor air quality have a specified oxygen content to reduce tailpipe pollutant emission. In the 1990s, methyl -butyl ether (MTBE) was used widely as a gasoline additive to meet that requirement. The now obvious unintended consequence of the widespread use of MTBE was extensive groundwater contamination from leaking underground storage tanks (EPA 1999). Another fuel issue arises from the Renewable Fuel Standard and government support and subsidies for the use of corn-based ethanol as a renewable fuel component of gasoline. As discussed in , increased corn production to meet the demand for corn-based ethanol has raised concern about several sustainability-related consequences, such as hypoxia in the Gulf of Mexico from fertilizer runoff into the Mississippi River and increases in cropland prices (NRC 2011c). The tools developed by EPA for use in environmental, economic, and social aspects of sustainability practice represent a major investment in sustainability considerations. However, there does not appear to be an overarching capability to integrate the tools in real time in such a way that the outcomes of the combined use of tools or approaches, within or among sustainability considerations, can be assessed and visually represented. Although the futures methods address that need to some extent, it is not a tool set that is able to provide results quickly. Some available cognitive computing systems execute that type of decision analysis in real time. Existing computing capacity (NRC 2012b; EPA 2013a) supplemented with research and development investment to refine sustainability analyses could allow sustainability analysts to run repeated “what if” exercises to reveal aggregate effects in all three pillars of sustainability. The process of implementing sustainability concepts needs substantial investment in the early discovery of potential unintended consequences because of the concern about optimizing present and future outcomes and intergenerational effects. Unintended consequences are not necessarily unforeseeable; deep ""6 Identifying and Addressing New Issues."" National Research Council. 2014. Sustainability Concepts in Decision-Making: Tools and Approaches for the US Environmental Protection Agency. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/18949. analytics technology, which is available, could be applied to this topic. The addition of a formal learning loop would capture additional value from case histories and lessons learned in sustainability projects undertaken by EPA. To enhance postdecision assessment of its activities, EPA should identify, track, and address unintended consequences. The agency should create a searchable database of the lessons learned. Not only would that provide additional evidence-based support capabilities for future decision-making, but the data could feed advanced cognitive analytics that could be used to test proposed decisions against known unintended cause–effect scenarios developed from past decisions. Tools and Approaches for Identifying and Addressing New Issues National Research Council work on this topic (NRC 2011a; EPA 2013a) has emphasized the need for a tiered approach to understand what tools should be applied in sustainability assessments and has provided explicit recommendations about investment in screening capabilities. Applying futures methods will inform and guide the use of other sustainability tools as the scenarios developed become more mature and data-stable. A tiered approach to identifying and addressing emerging challenges includes: • Applying approaches to identify possible emerging challenges (EPA 2014r): o Scanning methods enhanced by deep-analytics tools to provide early detection of even weak signals or patterns. o Delphi methods involving subject-matter experts. o Trend-analysis methods for quantitative data and additional analytic tools for assessing unstructured data. o Future scenarios that use quantitative, qualitative, and unstructured data to fuel real-time and dynamic scenario imaging as data feeds are used to refine and weight potential outcomes. o The use of crowd sourcing and analytics to detect and predict emerging challenges, particularly for hazardous natural or human-caused areas of concern. • Organizing and screening emerging challenges for further review by, for example, applying selected screening-level versions of the mature tools now available in each of the three sustainability pillars (NRC 2011a). o Screening-level results drive a rank ordering of emerging challenges for further analysis. The most likely scenarios from the futures methods could be subjected to a more detailed set of assessments for each of the three pillars as more refined data become available. o Systems-based indicator analysis of likely scenarios from the futures methods could further clarify which projects would benefit most from more refined sustainability assessments. o Sustainability-assessment tools and approaches will be informed and guided by emerging related issues that are identified and may include environmental-impact assessments, social-impact assessments, benefit–cost analyses (BCAs), risk assessments, resilience and adaptation assessments, segmentation analyses, and collaborative problem-solving (See ). • Communication of findings and recommendations—EPA has and continues to develop powerful communication tools and approaches. In addition to briefings, Internet posting, podcasts, articles and brochures for agency staff, legislative staff, and the public, the use of a broad array of social media can be used to communicate with the public rapidly and effectively.

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/18949. The remainder of this chapter discusses a wide variety of emerging issues that EPA is likely to face with respect to the application of sustainability tools and approaches. An important milestone was reached in 2008 when it was recorded that more than half the global population was living in cities and towns. The growth of cities is an important emerging trend in the United States and globally, and this poses many challenges in application of sustainability tools and practices. Cities and their associated problems constitute a strong impetus for innovation; and because the urban centers are massive economic engines, they also provide an important opportunity to develop and test new sustainability tools and approaches that can inform decisions on how cities will be designed, built, and managed in the context of local forces in the future. Urban corridors will provide an important test bed for understanding the effects of increasing population density and other societal megatrends on the vulnerability of infrastructure to natural and human-made disasters and on the factors that create urban resilience. In many evaluations of increased urbanization, discussion of social-ecological system resilience and sustainability usually focuses substantial attention on the negative effects of human-caused changes to urban social-ecological systems (Tidball and Stedman 2013). Such attention can result in an “assumed negativity” regarding humans and nature. However, others point out the positive actions that humans sometimes take in systems in which they live that contribute to virtuous cycles producing, or enhancing production of, positive social and ecological outcomes, such as in ecosystem services (Bartlett, 2005; Tidball and Krasny, 2008; Krasny, et.al. 2009). As a consequence of the explosion of enabling technologies, many cities in the United States are investing heavily in infrastructure, including investment in instrumentation and sensoring of locations, utilities, and processes and integration of these data inputs into an architecture that allows continuous real-time status awareness, decision support, and management. Increases in urbanization, climate change, and demographic shifts will change cities. The need to improve quality of life, economic competitiveness, and social equity has driven cities to become more resource-efficient and sustainable. Technologies are major levers and the basis of further sustainable city development. The challenges that arise from cities and megaregions will probably have at their core an increasing population density that will affect virtually every aspect of their economic, social, and environmental quality. Response to those challenges will be constrained by the limitation of the resources that can be applied to an unlimited set of needs. Many cities in the United States have recently made important efforts in addressing some combination of interconnected problems of urban air quality, efficient energy production and use, urban transportation systems, and climate change (both mitigation and adaptation) by focusing on development and application of sustainability tools and practices (NRC 2013a, 2014). In the case of large cities, a combination of megatrends of urbanization, climate change, and a recent and rapidly emerging revolution in application of IT, including social media that promote democratization of knowledge and participation by the general public, has provided a fertile landscape for application of sustainability tools and approaches, including BCA, integrated assessment modeling, collaborative problem-solving, futures methods to evaluate alternative future scenarios, and environmental-justice (EJ) analysis (NRC 2014). Many cities of different sizes—including Portland, Oregon; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Phoenix, Arizona; New York, New York; Charleston, South Carolina; and Ft. Lauderdale, Florida—have developed their versions of sustainability plans. Federal-agency partnerships with communities have also promoted urban sustainability (for example, see the discussion in of the Sustainable Communities Regional Planning Grant Program).And the application of tools available through social networking can be ""6 Identifying and Addressing New Issues."" National Research Council. 2014. Sustainability Concepts in Decision-Making: Tools and Approaches for the US Environmental Protection Agency. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/18949. key to creating sustainable cities because it enables communities to participate in sharing ideas about solutions, such as use of renewable energy, smart transportation choices, and improving air quality through lower per capita energy use. The availability of public portals can inform choices of, for example, transportation modes and provide feedback to the system. President Clinton’s (EJ) executive order (EO 12898) was the product of considerable evidence that poor and selected minorities were overburdened by hazards and at higher risk caused by exposure to pollution in air, water, and soil. It required federal agencies to prepare and implement EJ strategies for the administration of environmental rules and guidelines. Raising the profile of the EJ issue has, for example, encouraged private organizations to take demographics into account before siting new facilities and expanding existing ones. EPA has developed Plan EJ 2014 to serve as a roadmap for integrating environmental justice into the agency’s programs, policies, and activities. The goals of the plan are to protect health in communities over-burdened by pollution, empower communities to improve their health and environment, and establish partnerships with government organizations to achieve healthy and sustainable communities (EPA 2014s). The plan includes cross-agency focus areas on rulemaking, permitting, compliance and enforcement, community-based programs, and collaborations with other federal agencies. As part of implementing this plan, EPA is developing various assessment tools, including guidelines for cumulative risk assessment, a community-focused exposure and risk screening tool, mapping and analysis tools to elucidate benefits that humans receive from their environment, and a screening tool to identify areas with potential EJ concerns that may warrant further consideration (EPA 2014t). There is growing awareness of the need to include EJ analysis in a sustainability analytic context. EPA included EJ analysis as one of the tools in its report (EPA 2013a) (see ). A special panel of EPA’s Science Advisory Board is reviewing the agency’s draft technical guidance for assessing EJ in regulatory analysis and is considering subjects that are directly and indirectly related to the intersection of EJ and sustainability. Clearly, EJ tools and approaches will be required both in the early identification of new issues and in the later stages of analysis and actionable recommendations. A rapid screening tool that could quickly be applied to a newly identified emerging challenge to allow an initial weighting of potential EJ concerns is especially important. Development of the capability for robust EJ analysis is also important, but the rapid emergence of new challenges requires quick screening capability to ensure that EJ issues are included in sustainability considerations. Strengths and Limitations of EJ Analysis in a Sustainability Context “Incorporating EJ analysis into the decision-making process promotes sustainability by highlighting the relationships between economy, society, and the environment. However, while scientific and quantitative advancements in EJ analyses have enabled researchers and stakeholders to better grasp disproportionate impacts of environmental stressors and socio-demographic conditions, the complex nature of interactions between these factors is not fully understood. For example, EJ analyses are often required to be performed without the benefit of full-scale epidemiological studies and, hence, while correlations between health impacts and populations may be apparent, analysts should be mindful that the cause and effect may not have been demonstrated.” EPA asked the Environmental Justice Technical Guidance Review Panel to provide advice and recommendations on the scientific soundness of the agency’s Draft Technical Guidance for Assessing Environmental Justice in Regulatory Analysis (EPA 2013g).

Curren ly, only 29% of the 70 gigatons (Gt) of materials that the world economy uses annually are recycled (Ashby 2012). Current rates have quadrupled consumption from 50 years ago, creating a demand trend for materials that is unsustainable with current practices. Five key materials make up a substantial fraction of carbon emission into the atmosphere: steel, cement, plastic, paper, and aluminum. Industry accounts for 38% of the total global carbon dioxide emission, and the five key materials listed above account for 56% of industrial carbon emission (IEA 2008). A breakdown of those emissions can be seen in . By 2050, the International Energy Agency expects demand for materials to at least double, but the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) recommends reducing global emission by 55–85% by that same year (Fisher et al. 2007). Even with an optimistic projection of efficiency, the increased demand makes it impossible to reach the reduced emission targets set by the IPCC (shown in ). Included in the projections are implementation of energy-efficiency measures, future efficiencies in the supply chain, reduction in yield losses, maximum recycling rates, and decarbonization of energy supplies. Substantially increased material efficiency is needed to meet future demand, although much research still needs to be done to balance resource demand with environmental effects and cost.

One of the major sustainability challenges is the scarcity of resources, such as raw materials. Historically, shortages of essential materials usually resulted in various kinds of conflicts. Today, resource scarcity continues to be a controversial emerging challenge that engages all three pillars of sustainability. It touches on many aspects of sustainability, such as intergenerational equity, resilience, adaptability, EJ, and social equity. The prospect of future scarcities of vital natural resources is, in many specific cases, underscored by present shortages in water, food, and strategic minerals. However, from the heightened concern over resource scarcity seen in 2009–2012 (World Economic Forum 2012), a new view of scarcity has turned the emerging issue into an emerging opportunity in the minds of a growing industrial sector. The fundamental premise of the new view of material scarcity is that it will drive yet another industrial revolution (Heck and Rogers 2014) as a result of the convergence of IT, nanoscale materials science, and bioengineering. This view posits that businesses will capitalize on material scarcity by focusing on resource productivity by using five distinct approaches (Heck and Rogers 2014): • replacement of expensive or scarce materials with less scarce, less expensive, higher-performing materials. • embedding software and IT in resource-intensive industries to improve how the industries produce and use scarce resources. • moving some processes completely from the physical world (such as digitalization of some processes and the use of cognitive computing capabilities). • finding value in products after their initial intended use. • greater efficiency through the redesign of products and services. Thus, one can imagine that, rather than a spiral of scarcity and rising costs of a shrinking commodity, the challenge that will affect EPA’s programs may be the evolution of a host of new materials and material uses. It will probably be a challenge for EPA to provide the inhouse subject-matter expertise needed to address emerging issues in materials development and use. EPA should consider using its convening ability to foster academic, business, and government partnerships to develop scientific and technical understanding to inform agency decision-making. Horizon materials can be defined as advanced next-generation materials that are likely to have a serious effect on our society and economy. Borne of the convergence of advances in IT, industrial technology, materials sciences, and bioengineering, the development of horizon materials often enables new applications in various industry segments. In light of the growing number of US and global patents and regulations involving materials, the topic of horizon materials should be on the emerging-challenges radar screen. Technical innovations in discrete fields are continuing to overlap, resulting in nanomedicine, nanobiotechnology, genomic-specific therapeutics, systems biology, and bioengineering. The blurred lines here will also demand vigilance in US regulatory agencies. Nanotechnologies are set to transform the global industrial landscape and involve US economic sectors as diverse as agriculture, medicine, engineering, biology, and IT.

Characterization of the risks posed by engineered nanomaterials and their applications in commercial and consumer products presents substantial challenges to life-cycle assessments, risk analyses, and governance. Given the rapidly evolving applications (especially biologic) of nanoscale materials, devices, and systems, EPA should work with other organizations to fund research in risk characterization and develop the infrastructure needed to support data-mining and data-sharing. Although much progress has been made, gaps in knowledge of the environmental, health, and safety (EHS) aspects of nanomaterials remain. Better understanding and integration of EHS data will enhance the effective regulation of these materials. The nanotechnology environmental, health, and safety research enterprise. The diagram shows the integrated and interdependent research activities that are driven by the production of engineered nanomaterials (ENMs). The production of ENMs is captured by the orange oval, labeled “materials”, which includes reference materials, ENM releases, and inventories. (An inventory is a quantitative estimate of the location and amounts of nanomaterials produced, including the properties of the nanomaterials.) The knowledge commons (red box) is the locus for collaborative development of methods, models, and materials and for archiving and sharing of data. The “laboratory world” and “real world” (green boxes) feed into the knowledge commons. The laboratory world comprises process-based and mechanism-based research that is directed at understanding the physical, chemical, and biologic properties or processes that are most critical for assessing exposures and hazards and hence risk (NRC 2012c, p. 55). The real world includes complex systems research involving observational studies that examine the effects of ENMs on people and ecosystems. The purple boxes capture the range of methods, tools, models, and instruments that support generation of research in the laboratory world, the real world, and the knowledge commons.

Nanotechnology also offers an archetypal glimpse of the future with regard to the global governance of emerging technologies (Breggin et al. 2009; Falkner and Jaspers 2012). Emerging technologies create unusual, complex, and often fundamental political problems for global governance. Recent international governance coordination mechanisms have been created through the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development and the International Organization for Standardization, but the scope of their efforts is limited. Given the lack of harmonization and alignment in global regulatory policies and practices and the great promise inherent in nanotechnology development, the convening nature of sustainability approaches may constitute a logical bridge across the governance divide. Partially obscured by the attention garnered by nanotechnology, a rapidly advancing convergence is occurring in the biospace. Driven by affordable genomics analyses, next-generation genomics marries the advances in sequencing and modifying of genetic materials with the latest big-data and analytics capabilities and enables synthetic biology (“writing” DNA). An excellent example of the convergence can be seen in a snapshot of emerging medical advances. High-throughput genomic analyses create a pipeline of raw data that are processed by high-end computing and deep analytics into usable information. That information fuels genomic-data integration and analytics platforms to find relationships between genomes and phenotypes, and this leads to the discovery and development of personalized therapies. Such relationships enable not only personalized heath care but decision support for precision medicine. However convergence of genomics and deep analytics drives a much more rich and complex constellation of capabilities that enables new potentials in three major disciplines: -omics big data and analytics, systems biology (modeling), and bioengineering (synthetic biology). An important example of an emerging new capability in the biospace convergence is metagenomics (Wooley et al. 2010). Metagenomics is the study of the genetic material recovered directly from environmental samples rather than from cultured microbial samples. This approach has revealed that the vast majority of microbial diversity has been missed by cultivation methods (Breitbart et al. 2002). Metagenomics has become an important predictor as well as a tool for use in addressing futures issues in sustainability. For instance, the research community is beginning to understand that antibiotic resistance may have strong environmental associations. Through the use of metagenomic tools and deep analytics, antibiotic-resistance genes have been shown to accumulate in wastewater-treatment plants (Yang et al. 2013), as contaminants in manures and other agriculture waste products (Zhu et al. 2013), in the water and sediments of rivers (Luo et al. 2010; Kristiansson et al. 2011), and in reclaimed water (Fahrenfeld et al. 2013). One of the most important factors in the development of antibiotic resistance is the remarkable ability of bacteria to share genetic resources via lateral gene transfer (Stokes and Gillings 2011). The use of activated sludges on farmland and the use of reclaimed water in distribution systems and irrigation may accelerate the spread of antibiotic resistance (Fahrenfeld et al. 2013). The World Health Organization has recently released a report on global surveillance of antimicrobial resistance (WHO 2014), which warns of a coming postantibiotic era without global intervention. Given the broad genetic diversity found in metagenomic studies, there is great potential in finding and using gene sequences that could be immediately useful in industrial applications. Bioengineering and industrial biotechnology often are central in sustainability predictions and require the development of novel enzymes, processes, products, and applications. Metagenomics promises to provide insights into new molecules that have diverse functions, but it is the exploitation of the gene-expression systems that are the key to the economic success of the new molecules. This brief discussion of the biospace convergence should make it apparent that the new insights enable capabilities in diverse sectors of the economy (see ).

Expected Capabilities Based on Biospace Advances Accelerated drug discovery, development, and manufacturing Carbon capture and bioremediation of air, water, and soil Green-chemistry enabling of bioplastics and enzymes Functional material enhancements, such as spider silk in tires Clearly, this will be a target-rich space for new and emerging issues that will require sustainability assessments and solutions. Sustainability tools, approaches, and assessments may be crucial if the pros and cons of the emerging innovations are to be understood and acted on. Closely aligned with the nanotechnology and biospace discussions are a related set of productivity advances and sustainability practices that arise in the manufacturing space. Collectively, these activities and practices are often referred to as advanced manufacturing, which is defined as “a family of activities that: a) depend upon the use and coordination of information, automation, computation, software, sensing, and networking; and/or b) Make use of cutting edge materials and emerging capabilities enabled by the physical and biological sciences (nanotechnology, chemistry, biology)” (PCAST 2011, p. ii). The activities involve new ways to manufacture existing products and advanced technologies to manufacture new products. They affect all five stages of manufacturing: product design, production planning, engineering, production, and service and maintenance. These capabilities have converged to create a scenario in which an idea can move through design, prototyping, engineering, and production within an hour with 3D computer design, digital prototyping, and additive manufacturing (3D printing that uses polymers or metals). In fact, the ability to model, visualize, and test in the world of virtual-to-real manufacturing is changing the nature of innovation and allowing a new level of efficiency and customization. The United States—with a track record of innovation, software design and development, and university education—is now driving a new era of efficient products by lowering costs and allowing mass customization, extreme scalability, and high speed to market. The innovative technologies and machinery lead to huge dividends for the environment and economy, such as reductions in material use and waste and in energy use; some manufacturing steps will never again be physical but will remain in the virtual world until translated in final production steps. From this perspective, this represents a major step forward into a more sustainable manufacturing scenario. It is important to recognize that innovative and disruptive technologies will probably enable the use of new and exotic materials and methods and will enable “manufacturing” to take place not only in modern, clean, tightly controlled facilities but in homes, garages, and schools.

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/18949. Advanced manufacturing provides new opportunities for material-efficient and energy-efficient processes, but EPA should address this emerging issue as a part of a futures-methods analysis. The potential for manufacturing to occur in nonmanufacturing environments might well create new challenges for occupational and environmental regulators. New futures methods will be needed to predict, assess, inform, and guide governance. The scientific consensus is that global climate change is occurring and that weather will trend toward extreme events. Therefore, it is imperative that sustainability factors be considered by planners, engineers, emergency managers, public-health workers, and associated professionals to reduce the vulnerability of people and assets. Sustainability-related activities include removing highly vulnerable land from development and turning it into open space or to less vulnerable uses, siting infrastructure in less vulnerable locations, and prohibiting activities in high-risk areas that have highly vulnerable populations. The activities include retrofitting of structures to be more resistant to hazardous events, providing loans and other inducements to property owners to reduce their vulnerability, and organizing local first responders and community groups that can increase the resilience of a community. Those and many other sustainability activities can be implemented before, during, or after events. It would be prudent to focus on particularly vulnerable populations, such as older people, disabled people, children, and people whose response to hazard events may be hindered by language barriers, lack of transportation options, and other constraints. A great deal of literature is appearing on those subjects in public health, urban planning, and emergency management. EPA should consider the development of additional futures methods that focus on assessing and predicting vulnerability and resilience of both urban and rural environments. More accurate and earlier prediction of emerging issues related to environmental settings would enhance the ability to incorporate resilience strategies into infrastructure design. Incorporation of resilience in the context of sustainability would have implications for the design and planning of projects, particularly urban infrastructure projects. However, it has been a challenge to accomplish that because no comprehensive tool for quantifying resilience is available. A conceptual tool, the Sustainable and Resilient (SuRe) zone of planning and design, aims to address that issue (see ). Simultaneous Consideration of Sustainability and Resilience Resilience analysis is a tool for evaluating the ability of a system (such as a city’s infrastructure, an ecosystem, or a supply chain) to continue functioning after a disruption. Considering options for increasing resilience can be challenging when narrowly targeted sustainability objectives are also being pursued to reduce material and energy investment, motivate the removal of redundancy from systems, and thus undermine their resilience. An approach is being developed to assess sustainability and resilience of urban infrastructure systems simultaneously. It involves use of traditional benefit–cost analysis to assess the costs associated with the building of a more resilient infrastructure and the benefits of avoiding damages through augmented resilience (Pandit et al. in press).

Examples of the Nexus of EPA Focus Areas of Sustainability with New or Emerging Issues Climate change, rapid urbanization, and air quality Benefit–cost analysis, environmental-justice analysis, futures methods, exposure assessments, risk assessments, health-impact assessments, integrated assessment modeling, resilience assessments, collaborative problem-solving Advanced manufacturing enabling new products and bioengineered materials Life-cycle analysis, benefit–cost analysis, green chemistry, green engineering, exposure assessments, health-impact assessments, environmental-footprint analysis, integrated assessment modeling Engineered systems for the reuse of water and activated sludges and rising concentration of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms in urban areas Benefit–cost analysis, environmental-footprint analysis, green engineering, collaborative problem-solving, lifecycle analysis, exposure assessments, risk assessments, health-impact assessments, environmental-justice analysis, resilience analysis, social-impact analysis Benefit–cost analysis, green chemistry, green engineering, risk assessments, chemical-alternatives assessments, life-cycle assessments, environmental-footprint assessments THE NEXUS OF NEW ISSUES WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY’S FOCUS AREAS OF SUSTAINABILITY The previous discussions in this chapter reveal a striking relationship: new or emerging issues have substantial intersections with EPA’s four focus areas for sustainability and the tools and approaches described in Table 3-1. It should be noted in this context that new issues are likely not to occur in single occurrences (such as climate change) but rather to arise from an aggregation of issues (such as climate change, energy disruptions, food disruptions, and aridity) (NRC 2013a). provides a few examples to illustrate the nexus by focus area, new issue, and tools for predicting, detecting, or assessing the issues. The examples in are not meant to be exhaustive but rather to stimulate thinking about how sustainability focus areas are affected by new issues and how sustainability tools will have the potential both to identify and to evaluate effects of new or emerging issues. The complexity of new issues and their rate of occurrence will probably place even greater demands on even the most automated and robust tools and approaches in the race to prevent new issues from surging to become old unresolved problems. The rate at which future challenges are likely to approach and their increasing complexity will afford less and less time in which to assess them and, if necessary, to devise strategies to address them. A set of screening tools that can be implemented rapidly is essential. It is important to avoid rapidly approaching challenges from becoming historical events before they can be adequately assessed. EPA should develop screening tools to assess new issues rapidly to support the selection of appropriate sustainability tools and approaches. Existing screening approaches, tools, and formal sustainability assessments should be automated further for the rapid analysis that responses to new issues will require. ""6 Identifying and Addressing New Issues."" National Research Council. 2014. Sustainability Concepts in Decision-Making: Tools and Approaches for the US Environmental Protection Agency. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/18949. The tools developed by EPA for use in environmental, economic, and social areas of sustainability practice represent a major investment in sustainability considerations. However, there does not appear to be an overarching capability to integrate the tools, in real time, in such a way that the results of their combined use can be assessed and visually represented. An integrated “big picture” capability would lead to deeper insights, better pattern recognition, and better decision-making through the avoidance of the overweighting or masking that can be caused by the serial use of tools. EPA should leverage and enhance its advanced IT capabilities for integrating sustainability tools so that the outcomes of their combined use approaches can be simulated in a sustainability context in real time. (See Recommendation 6a) To enhance post-decision assessment of its activities, EPA should identify, track, and address unintended consequences. The agency should create a searchable database of these valuable lessons learned. (Recommendation 6b) The use of a broad array of social media can be used to communicate rapidly and effectively with the public. Private and public organizations are increasingly leveraging the use of structured and unstructured public input to improve prediction of public preferences and to extract valuable insights into public behavior. Public support for regulatory decision-making could be substantially enhanced by using such approaches. EPA should consider piloting “electronic jams” that reach out to the public in monitored on-line chat sessions that allow public input to be analyzed and additional value to be derived from it. In addition to the public-comment aspect of this approach, passive “crowd sourcing” can be useful in identifying new issues. (See Recommendation 6a) EPA should consider using its convening ability to foster academic, business and government partnerships in this area to develop adequate scientific and technical understanding to inform agency decision making. (See Recommendation 6c) Given the rapidly evolving applications (especially biologic) of nanoscale materials, devices and systems, EPA should work with other organizations to fund research in the area of risk characterization and develop the infrastructure needed to support data-mining and data-sharing. ( Advanced manufacturing provides new opportunities for material-efficient and energy-efficient processes, but EPA should address this emerging issue as a part of a futures-methods analysis. EPA should consider the development of additional futures methods that focus on assessing and predicting vulnerability and resilience of both urban and rural environments.

In its current strategic plan, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) describes a cross-agency strategy to advance sustainable environmental outcomes and optimize economic and social outcomes through Agency decisions and actions. Sustainability has evolved from an aspiration to a growing body of practices. The evolution includes a transition from the development of broad goals toward the implementation of specific policies and programs for achieving them and the use of indicators and metrics for measuring progress. Without losing focus on implementing its existing regulatory mandates, EPA's incorporation of sustainability considerations into its decision-making about potential environmental, social, and economic outcomes involves shifting from a focus on specific pollutants in an environmental medium (air, water, or land) to a broader assessment of interactions among human, natural, and manufactured systems. EPA has indicated that it will need to consider the use of a variety of analytic tools and approaches to assess the potential sustainability-related effects of its decisions and actions in response to complex environmental challenges. Sustainability Concepts in Decision-Making: Tools and Approaches for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency examines scientific tools and approaches for incorporating sustainability concepts into assessments used to support EPA decision making. Using specific case studies, this report considers the application of analytic and scientific tools, methods, and approaches presented in the 2011 NRC report . This report examines both currently available and emerging tools, methods, and approaches to find those most appropriate for assessing and/or evaluating potential economic, social and environmental outcomes within an EPA decision context. also discusses data needs and post-decision evaluation of outcomes on dimensions of sustainability. A broad array of sustainability tools and approaches are suitable for assessing potential environmental, social, and economic outcomes in EPA's decision-making context. The recommendations of this report will assist the agency to optimize environmental, social, and economic outcomes in EPA decisions. 4 Case Studies of Applications of Sustainability Tools and Approaches 5 Private-Sector and PrivatePublic Partnership Sustainability Initiatives: Applicability to Environmental Protection Agency Decision-Making 7 Applying Sustainability Tools and Methods to Strengthen Environmental Protection Agency Decision-Making Appendix B--Biographic Information on the Committee on Scientific Tools and Approaches for Sustainability Appendix C--The Sustainability Assessment and Management Approach Appendix D--Glossary of Sustainability Tools and Approaches Appendix E--Application of General Evaluation Criteria You're looking at OpenBook, NAP.edu's online reading room since 1999.

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/13437. s with production and use of any fuels, aspects of biofuel production and use have benefits and adverse effects. This chapter discusses potential environmental effects from the production and use of algal biofuels, the potential influence of perceived or actual impacts on societal acceptance, and some of the health impacts potentially emanating from the specific environmental effects. Potential environmental effects discussed in this chapter include those resulting from land-use changes, water quality, net greenhousegas (GHG) emissions, air quality, biodiversity, waste generation, and effects from genetically engineered algae (with an emphasis on new or enhanced traits). ""5 Environmental Effects."" National Research Council. 2012. Sustainable Development of Algal Biofuels in the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/13437. Where possible, this chapter discusses the potential for algal biofuels to improve aspects of sustainability compared to petroleum-based fuels and other biofuels and the potential for mitigating negative effects along the life cycle of algal biofuel. Environmental indicators of sustainability and data to be collected to assess sustainability are suggested. In some environments and biofuel management systems, metrics for assessing environmental performance are easy to measure and adequate baseline data are available, but that is not the case in all systems. A number of potential environmental concerns are evident, and if the concerns are not addressed they could become significant risks under large-scale deployment. As in any other industrial or agricultural enterprise, once they are recognized, such risks can be managed by standards or regulations so that industry is required to reduce effects to acceptable levels. For the sake of comprehensiveness, a number of potential environmental risks are mentioned in this chapter, but some are less likely to occur than others. Some of the environmental risks might require exploratory assessment and subsequent monitoring to ensure that they do not become sustainability concerns if algal biofuel production is scaled up. Producing algal biofuels could improve or harm water quality depending on the resource input and management used in algae cultivation, weather events, integrity of infrastructure, and processing of spent water. Water-quality concerns associated with commercial-scale production of algal biofuels, if sufficient culture waters are released to natural environments, include eutrophication of waters, contamination of groundwater, and salinization of water sources. Potential water-quality benefits are reduced runoff of herbicides and insecticides compared to corn-grain ethanol or soybean-based biodiesel because of their reduced use, and reduced eutrophication if there are no releases of culture water or if algae are used as a means to remove nutrients from municipal waste, confined animal feeding operations, and other liquid wastes. Water-quality effects will depend on the nutrient content of the algal culture medium; whether feedstock production systems are sealed, artificially lined, or clay lined; and the likelihood of extreme precipitation events. Leakage of culture fluid to groundwater or surface water could occur if the integrity of the pond or trough system is compromised, if flooding occurs, or if spills occur during transfers of fluid during process stages or waste removal, but most of these events could be avoided with proper management. As discussed in , the water for algae cultivation is likely to be reclaimed and reused to reduce the water requirement and consumptive water use. The liquid effluent also can be recycled from anaerobic digestion of lipid-extracted algae to produce biogas (Davis et al., 2011). If harvest water is to be released instead of recycled, it or effluent from anaerobic digestion would contain nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), the concentrations of which depend on the nitrogen and phosphorus taken up by the harvested algal biomass (Sturm and Lamer, 2011). Released waters could be more saline than receiving waters, particularly if water from saline aquifers is used for algae cultivation. Such point-source discharge will be regulated by the Clean Water Act, and a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit would have to be obtained to operate the algae cultivation facilities (EPA, 2011a). However, permit violation has been observed in some biofuel refineries ""5 Environmental Effects."" National Research Council. 2012. Sustainable Development of Algal Biofuels in the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/13437. that use terrestrial crops as feedstock (Beeman, 2007; Smith, 2008; EPA, 2009b; Buntjer, 2010; Meersman, 2010; O’Sullivan, 2010). Regulation and compliance assurance would address concerns about release of harvest water. The potential for accidental release of cultivation water exists; for example, clay or plastic liners could be breached through normal weathering or from extreme weather events, some of which are predictable. High precipitation or winds could lead to overtopping of ponds or above-grade raceways. In those cases, the entire contents of algal cultures could be lost to surface runoff and leaching to surface water or groundwater. Siting in areas prone to tornadoes, hurricanes, or earthquakes would increase the likelihood of accidental releases. However, producers are likely to take preventive measures when extreme weather events are forecasted, and they would put effort into preventing accidental releases of cultivation water because such events could adversely affect their profit margin. Large-scale algae cultivation requires the provision of large quantities of nutrients, especially nitrogen and phosphorus, to ensure high yield (see section Nutrients in ). Even where nitrogen and phosphorus are not in oversupply, the total nutrient concentrations in algal biomass will be high. Although accidental release of cultivation water into surface water and soil is unlikely, such an event could lead to eutrophication of downstream freshwater and marine ecosystems, depending on the proximity of algal ponds to surface and groundwater sources. Eutrophication occurs when a body of water receives high concentrations of inorganic nutrients, particularly nitrogen and phosphorus, stimulating algal growth and resulting in excessive algal biomass. As the algae die off and decompose, high levels of organic matter and the decomposition processes deplete oxygen in the water and result in anoxic conditions (Smith, 2003; Breitburg et al., 2009; Rabalais et al., 2009; Smith and Schindler, 2009). In some cases, eutrophication-induced changes could be difficult or impossible to reverse if alternative stable states can occur in the affected ecosystem (Scheffer et al., 2001; Carpenter, 2005). Eutrophication effects have been well studied, and they depend on the nutrient loadings to the receiving waters and the volume and residence time of water of these systems (Smith et al., 1999; Smith, 2003). High nutrient loading could lead to anoxia in the deep cool portion of lakes or in hypoxia in the receiving water bodies. Potential biotic effects of eutrophication include changes in algal density and in the structure and biomass of the broader ecological community (Scheffer et al., 1997; Reynolds et al., 2002; Smayda and Reynolds, 2003). Fish yield is affected by phytoplankton biomass and by the nutrient ratios in the edibility of phytoplankton (Oglesby, 1977; Bachmann et al., 1996). Nutrient levels play a key role in determining the productivity and structure of the primary producing community in estuaries and coastal marine waters (Deegan et al., 2002; Smith, 2006) and by extension, the productivity and structure of higher trophic levels. Nutrient-enriched shallow marine systems tend to have a reduced seagrass community (Burkholder et al., 1992; Hauxwell et al., 2003) because elevated nitrogen concentrations and loadings adversely affect seagrass (Efroymson et al., 2007 and references cited therein). A collection of microscopic photosynthetic organisms that float or drift in fresh water or sea water. ""5 Environmental Effects."" National Research Council. 2012. Sustainable Development of Algal Biofuels in the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/13437. In high-nitrate environments, seagrasses can be shaded by epiphytic algae and macroalgae (Drake et al., 2003) or sometimes by phytoplankton blooms (Nixon et al., 2001). Seagrasses affect the entire estuarine food web because they stabilize sediments; serve as habitats and temporary nurseries for fish and shellfish; are sources of food for fish, waterfowl, benthic invertebrates, or manatees; and provide refuges from predation. Eutrophication and other nutrient-related effects could be a concern for cultivation of microalgae or macroalgae in large suspended offshore enclosures (for example, Honkanen and Helminen, 2000). Eutrophication also has implications for social acceptability (Codd, 2000), for example, because of eutrophication-related aesthetic concerns (Grant, 2010), and aesthetics can affect the recreational value of water bodies. It is unknown whether rare releases of culture water or the physical appearance of open ponds for algae cultivation could have negative effects on the social acceptability of algal biofuels. Quantifying water losses from raceways, ponds, or photobioreactors would indicate whether repairs of small leaks are necessary. These culture systems can be designed and tested to withstand natural disasters that are possible during the lifetime of the infrastructure. In coastal locations, for example, facility and infrastructure designs would need to consider the probabilities that hurricane winds and water surges could reach the algae cultivation site (Guikema, 2009). Mitigation plans for accidental releases would be desirable. Open-pond algae cultivation also can be sited in locations that are not prone to hurricanes or away from lakes and streams. With respect to harvest water, engineering solutions can maximize recycling. Some compounds present in algal ponds or photobioreactors could be toxic to humans or other organisms depending on exposure levels. Herbicides often are added to open systems to prevent growth of macrophytes and for selective control of algae (NALMS, 2004), but their application likely would be regulated as in the case of agriculture. If wastewater or oil well-produced water (Shpiner et al., 2009) is used as a water source for algae cultivation, heavy metals could be present. Wastewater could include industrial effluent (Chinnasamy et al., 2010) and municipal wastewater that has undergone various levels of treatment (Wang et al., 2010). The composition and amount of toxicants vary by the type of wastewater. Produced water (water contained in oil and gas reservoirs that is produced in conjunction with the fossil fuel) may contain high levels of organic compounds, oil and grease, boron, and ammonia (NH) (Drewes et al., 2009). Many algal species including cyanobacteria, diatoms, and chlorophytes can bioconcentrate heavy metals (Watras and Bloom, 1992; Vymazal, 1995; Mathews and Fisher, 2008). Mercury could be introduced into feedstock production waters if unscrubbed flue gas from coal-fired power plants is used as a carbon dioxide (CO) source (O’Dowd et al., 2006). Therefore, potential risks from using each type of produced water need to be identified so that adequate containment and mitigation measures can be implemented in cultivation and processing. Waterborne toxicants (toxic substances made or introduced into the environment anthropogenically, not including algal toxins) potentially pose risk to humans or other ""5 Environmental Effects."" National Research Council. 2012. Sustainable Development of Algal Biofuels in the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/13437. animals if exposures occur. Occupational exposures could be significant, especially during the harvesting phase. Thus, monitoring of toxic compounds in the culture media is important. Potential toxicity exposure to animals through drinking is discussed in the section on terrestrial biodiversity. The release of culture waters to natural environments could pose other risks to animal consumers. Toxic concentrations and doses for various chemicals are available in the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Integrated Risk Information System database for humans (EPA, 2012), in Suter and Tsao (1996) for aquatic biota, in Sample et al. (1996) for terrestrial wildlife, and in other government and independent compilations. Cultivation of algae in wastewater may require special handling and means of containment. Monitoring for the presence of toxicants or pathogens might be necessary to ensure the quality of the culture water. Monitoring of metals and other compounds in water sources, nutrient sources, and culture media in demonstration facilities would provide information about whether waterborne toxicants pose a significant concern. If so, technical solutions for removing waterborne toxicants would be needed to prevent occupational and ecological exposures. Mercury is removed from flue gas in some configurations of coal-fired electric-generating units (EPA, 2010). However, mercury removal is ineffective for certain types of coal and plant configurations (NETL, 2011). Contaminants in flue gas could place another constraint on the type of coal-fired electricity facilities that would be suitable for providing CO for algae cultivation (see sections Estimated Land Requirements and Estimated Nutrient Requirements in ). Open ponds may not be suitable for many soil types without using lining, and a thorough review of potential effects on surface water and groundwater quality would have to be conducted if clay-lined ponds are to be used. If outdoor ponds are poorly lined or the lining fails as a result of wear, then seepage of the pond water into the local groundwater system could occur. Clays that are compacted and graded have structural integrity that can be comparable to synthetic liners (Boyd, 1995). However, integrity can be compromised by poor construction. Nitrate leaching has been observed below structured clay soils (White et al., 1983), but the qualitative applicability of these results to clay-lined algal ponds is unknown. Local terrestrial vegetation might take up some of the culture media released through seepage. In some areas, if open ponds contain high concentrations of dissolved inorganic nitrate, seepage may contribute to concerns related to nitrate poisoning if the groundwater is used for drinking by livestock or humans. Withdrawal of freshwater adjacent to briny aquifers or injection of saline wastewater into the ground could result in salinization of groundwater if fresh water and briny aquifers are not well separated. Salinization of groundwater is a potential problem for some agricultural lands where irrigation is prevalent (Schoups et al., 2005). However, one of the key advantages of algal biofuel is that the feedstock could be produced on nonarable land (Ryan, 2009; Assmann et al., 2011), so salinization of agricultural lands as a result of freshwater withdrawal for algae cultivation is not likely. ""5 Environmental Effects."" National Research Council. 2012. Sustainable Development of Algal Biofuels in the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/13437. Using sealed algal cultivation systems would practically eliminate the potential for leakage, barring catastrophic breaches. Where open systems are used, technologies (such as the development of impermeable, long-lived liner systems) and regional solutions for minimizing nutrient leakage could be deployed, and regulations to minimize leakage could be developed. For example, Phyco BioSciences uses a trough system that has a lightweight, fabricated liner. The liner is expected to eliminate leakage or minimize percolation to less than 0.01 percent (Cloud, 2011). Potential preventive measures might include specifications for soil type, combined with defined values for the minimum depth from the pond bottom to groundwater. Moreover, local regulations likely require lined ponds, which would reduce the probability of leakage of waters but contribute to capital costs and lead to temporary system closures when the liners are replaced because of wear or failure. Measures to prevent inadvertent discharge of water (for example, overflow corridors or basins) during extreme weather events would be helpful in preventing water pollution. Wastewaters derived from municipal, agricultural, and industrial activities potentially could be used for cultivating algal feedstocks either in open ponds or in photobioreactors for algal biofuels and could provide an environmental benefit. Microalgae have been used in wastewater treatment for a long time (Oswald et al., 1957), where they provide photosynthetically produced oxygen for the bacterial breakdown of organic compounds present in the waste (Benemann, 2008). Microalgae have been shown to be effective for wastewater treatment in diverse systems including oxidation (stabilization) ponds and shallow raceway systems and using both phytoplankton and periphyton (Green et al., 1995; Hoffmann, 1998; Pittman et al., 2011; Sandefur et al., 2011). High rate algal ponds (HRAPs), which are shallow, open raceway ponds used for treating municipal, industrial, and agricultural wastewater, combine heterotrophic bacterial and photosynthetic algal processes (Park et al., 2011). The ponds allow the growth of high-standing crops of algae, which remove nitrogen and phosphorus from the wastewater (Sturm et al., 2012). The concept of adapting HRAPs for the purpose of biofuel production was proposed more than five decades ago (Oswald and Golueke, 1960). Park et al. (2011) reviewed the potential benefits and opportunities of using HRAPs for wastewater treatment and harvesting the algae for energy or fuel production. The feasibility and scale of such systems will be determined by the amount of wastewater, the availability of land near the facilities generating the wastewater and produced water, and the climatic conditions of the region. (See also .) If wastewater is used, the wastewater treatment rate and the harvesting schedule would determine the maximum volume of ponds or photobioreactors. A major goal of wastewater treatment is removal of nitrogen and phosphorus (Pittman et al., 2011). In conventional treatment systems, phosphorus is especially difficult to remove (Pittman et al., 2011). In advanced wastewater treatment, phosphorus typically is either chemically precipitated using aluminum- or iron-based coagulants to form an insoluble solid, or it is stripped from the water by microbial activity (EPA, 2007). The recovered phosphorus is then buried in a landfill or treated to create sludge fertilizer (Pittman et al., 2011). Given that readily available supplies of phosphorus may begin running out by the end of the 21st century (Vaccari, 2009), conservation and stewardship of U.S. phosphorus supplies are essential. Recycling nutrients from wastewater and using them for further algae production could be an attractive option for using otherwise discarded nutrients (Exhibit 9.7 and associated text in DOE, 2010b; see also section Nutrients in ). ""5 Environmental Effects."" National Research Council. 2012. Sustainable Development of Algal Biofuels in the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/13437. Algae-based treatments have been found to be as efficient as chemical treatment in removing phosphorus from wastewater (Hoffmann, 1998). Moreover, because harvested algal biomass contains the nutrients that were absorbed during cellular growth, wastewater-integrated systems can perform an important nutrient removal service. In laboratory-scale experiments, more than 90 percent of nitrogen and 80 percent of phosphorus were removed from primary treated sewage by the green alga (Lau et al., 1995). Similarly, laboratory cultures of and removed 80 to 100 percent of NH, nitrate, and total phosphorus from wastewater that already had undergone secondary treatment (Martinez et al., 2000; Zhang et al., 2008; Ruiz-Marin et al., 2010). Sturm et al. (2012) performed a six-month, pilot-scale algal production experiment using large (10 cubic meters) outdoor bioreactors fed by effluent from the secondary clarifier of the wastewater treatment facility in Lawrence, KS. They reported only a 19 percent removal of dissolved nitrogen and a 43 percent removal of dissolved phosphorus from this treated effluent. These differences in nutrient removal observed may be related, in part, to the different scales of the studies. The ultimate level of nutrient removal benefit may depend on the level of wastewater treatment that occurs prior to nutrient uptake in the algal cultivation systems and on the chemical and ecological conditions that exist in the wastewater-fed production system. Algae have the potential to remove nutrients from agricultural or industrial wastewater. Some studies have found high efficiencies of removal of nitrogen and phosphorus from wastewater containing manure (Gonzalez et al., 1997; Wilkie and Mulbry, 2002; An et al., 2003), and this wastewater also could be used as input to algal biofuel systems. Algal biofuel systems have the potential to increase water quality and to promote municipal or agricultural wastewater treatment systems with improved sustainability. However, the maintenance of lipid-rich strains and the manipulation of growth conditions to promote high lipid production have yet to be demonstrated consistently for outdoor pond systems, including wastewater treatment ponds (DOE, 2010b). Industrial wastewaters have lower nutrient concentrations and higher toxicant concentrations, and thus are less likely to be used to generate the algal biomass necessary for commercial-scale production of biofuels (Pittman et al., 2011). Integrated algal biofuel production systems can remove many other pollutants, such as metals and organic contaminants, including endocrine disruptors (Mallick, 2002; Munoz and Guieysse, 2006; Ahluwalia and Goyal, 2007; DOE, 2010b). Whether pollutant uptake by algae is desirable depends on whether coproducts are to be produced with algal biofuels or whether the lipid-extracted algae are to be used for nutrient recycling. Pollutant removal by these systems would improve water quality, but it also could pose a potential risk if organisms such as migrating waterfowl directly or incidentally consumed high metal content algae during the cultivation process, or if humans or wildlife were exposed chronically to the dried algae during biomass processing. Uptake of pollutants by algae is not desirable if residual biomass is to be used for human cosmetic products or animal feed. The pathways described in affect the types, probabilities, and magnitudes of water-quality effects (). For example, slow releases of nutrients to natural environments (and increased potential for eutrophication and groundwater pollution) are common for open systems but not for closed systems. Herbicides likely would be used only in open systems. The water quality benefit for wastewater treatment is achieved only if wastewaters are used as nutrient sources, but the scenarios in do not specify this. ""5 Environmental Effects.""

These indicators are standard measures for quality of water and wastewater (Eaton et al., 2005). Concentrations of nutrients are included because they relate to benefits or potentially adverse effects on water quality (for example, eutrophication). These usually are measured quantities, and baseline levels and natural variability also can be measured. Loadings are field measures or simulation results representing the contribution of released algal biofuel culture media to receiving waters. These may be compared to other loadings to those waters.

Good design and engineering would minimize the potential for releases of water and nutrients from open-pond systems to surface water and to ground water. Toxicant concentrations (for example, metals) need to be characterized, particularly if wastewater or produced water is used as culture medium. Information on the nutrient removal efficiencies of commercial-scale facilities would be needed if algal biofuel production is to be combined with wastewater treatment. Land-use change is a change in anthropogenic activities on land, which often is characterized in part by a change in land cover, including the dominant vegetation. Land-use changes play a role in the sustainability of algal biofuel development because of associated environmental effects, such as net GHG emissions, changes in biodiversity, and changes in ecosystem services such as food production. Moreover, there is growing societal concern about the spatial and temporal scales of some types of conversions, such as deforestation and urbanization. The impacts of algal biofuel development will depend in part on the type of land conversion, the extent (area) of land use that has changed, the intensity of land disturbance and management, and the duration of the change (for example, whether it is reversible). Commercial-scale production of algal biofuels will require substantial land area for each facility (see ), and the large-scale deployment of algal biofuels will lead to conversion of lands from other existing uses. Land conversion for ponds, processing facilities, and refineries for most products will be localized, and potential land conversion for related infrastructure, such as roads and power lines to the facilities, will be more diffuse and will involve linear features. This section focuses on land-use change (LUC) associated with algae cultivation, because change associated with feedstock processing or refining facilities is not different in kind from that of other liquid fuel sources. High-value lands used by agriculture, by other commodity industries, and for residential purposes are unlikely to be used for algae cultivation because algae cultivation does not require fertile soils and because capital and operating costs would have to be kept low for algal biofuel companies to operate close to the profit margin (). Similarly, the conversion of forestland is unlikely because of the high costs of clearing and site preparation and the high value for residential or recreational use. Land-use change for algal biofuels is ""5 Environmental Effects."" National Research Council. 2012. Sustainable Development of Algal Biofuels in the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/13437. A Summary of the Committee’s Judgment on the Likelihood of Land (or Water Surface) Conversion to Algae Cultivation Ponds and Facilities, Based on Value for Other Land (or Surface Water) Uses NOTE: Low-value land is assumed to be used to cultivate algae for biofuels. more likely to involve brownfields, rangelands, deserts, scrubland, abandoned farmland, or unproductive farmland, some of which may be on coasts or in near-shore marine waters. On coasts, dredge spoil islands might be additional options for use. For example, Phycal, an algal biofuel company, is using fallow land in Hawaii that was previously a pineapple plantation but is no longer economically viable for that use. Sapphire, another company operating in the Southwest, plans to develop nonagricultural land for algae cultivation. (Siting requirements are described in .) Competing land demands could change over time and may influence the landscape of algal biofuels. For example, some of the same lands that are attractive for algal biofuel development are also attractive for large-scale solar power development (BLM and DOE, 2010). Direct land-use change generally is defined as a direct cause-and-effect link between biofuel development and land conversion in the absence of strong external mediating factors. Direct land-use change occurs within the biofuel production pathway when land for one use is dedicated for biofuel production. However, in practice, direct land-use change from biofuel production generally is assumed to include lands used for feedstock production, processing, storage, and refining areas. Indirect land-use change occurs when biofuel production causes new land-use changes elsewhere domestically or in another country through market-mediated effects (NRC, 2011). Direct and indirect land-use changes could affect the net GHG emissions of biofuels (NRC, 2011). Direct land-use change can result in carbon sequestration or net GHG emissions, depending on the type of land conversion and prior land use. For example, converting from annual-crop production to perennial-crop production can enhance carbon storage on that piece of land (Fargione et al., 2008). Conversely, clearing native ecosystems to produce row-crops would result in a one-time release of a large quantity of GHGs into the atmosphere (Fargione et al., 2008; Gibbs et al., 2008; Ravindranath et al., 2009). In the Brownfields are “industrial or commercial propert[ies] that [remain] abandoned or underutilized because of environmental contamination or the fear of such contamination” (Environmental Law Institute, 2012). ""5 Environmental Effects."" National Research Council. 2012. Sustainable Development of Algal Biofuels in the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/13437. context of algae cultivation, converting pastureland to algal ponds is likely to contribute to GHG emissions. Perennial pasture is effective in sequestering carbon in soil (Franzluebbers, 2010; Gurian-Sherman, 2011). Removal of such vegetation would result in a one-time loss of carbon and the elimination of any potential for further carbon sequestration if the land is to be left as a pasture. In contrast, if the algae cultivation ponds are installed on degraded land that is not storing much carbon, immediate emissions from the conversion will be minimal. Indirect land-use change could occur if the use of land to cultivate biofuel feedstocks replaces and ultimately reduces the production levels of crops destined for a commodity market. The lowered production of those commodities could drive up market prices, which in turn could trigger agricultural growers to clear land elsewhere to grow the displaced crops in response to market signals (Babcock, 2009; Zilberman et al., 2010). However, as stated above, because algal feedstock cultivation does not require fertile cropland, arable land likely will not be used for algal biofuels (Sheehan et al., 1998; Gong and Jiang, 2011), and displacement of commodity crops by algae is unlikely. In addition, protein from lipid-extracted algae potentially can replace soybean or other terrestrial crops as feedstuff (Wijffels and Barbosa, 2010) and reduce the demand for land by terrestrial crops. The nutritional compatibility of algal feedstuff and the animal diet would have to be examined. Pasture and rangeland could be converted to algae cultivation, and displacement of these land uses by algae also may or may not result in other indirect effects. If the pasture or rangeland is surplus and not in use, then repurposing the land will not incur indirect land-use change (ILUC). In contrast, if algae cultivation displaces grass-fed cattle production, producers might decide to change to corn-fed cattle production. Changing from grass-fed to corn-fed cattle production also would exert pressure on the corn-grain market. Alternatively, if existing pasture and rangeland is limiting beef production, such that removing some of this land would decrease production, then grass-fed cattle production might be replaced elsewhere. The indirect land-use changes not only affect ecosystem services, but result in changes in GHG emissions that have to be considered in life-cycle GHG assessments for algal biofuels. If the indirect effects of algal biofuel production are to be quantified, then the potential biodiversity, water quality, and water balance impacts would include those associated with indirect land conversions. Previous quantification of indirect effects of biofuels generally has been limited to GHG effects and food security effects. As in the case of terrestrial-crop biofuels, market-mediated indirect land-use changes are difficult to ascertain, and estimates of associated GHG emissions are highly uncertain (NRC, 2011). Although complex models have been used to project the extent of indirect land-use changes as a result of terrestrial-crop biofuels, the committee is not aware of similar projections for algal biofuels. Algae cultivation is less likely to incur indirect land-use changes because it does not require prime agricultural land. Converting crop lands to new crops (algal biofuels) also will require new ownership or a willingness on the part of farmers to grow a new commodity. Growing algal biofuels will require differing work schedules than row crop farming. Even if cropland is not to be converted to algal ponds, the above discussion of potential pasture conversion illustrates a potential for indirect land-use change. With respect to land-use change, the primary relevant difference among the pathways in is the difference between the land required for open-pond and photobioreactor systems (see ). The spatial and temporal scales of land-use change would be commensurate with those of land use. ""5 Environmental Effects."" National Research Council. 2012. Sustainable Development of Algal Biofuels in the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/13437. In general, algal biofuel development will avoid forestland and land with agricultural value. Avoiding pastureland and areas of high biodiversity or recreational value also would eliminate some of the sustainability concerns associated with commercial development of algal biofuels. Land-use change is not consistently proposed as a criterion for sustainability, even though it often is considered a factor influencing aspects of the sustainability of biofuel (for example, GHG emissions, biodiversity, water quality, and soil quality). Therefore, some compilations of sustainability indicators do not include indicators of sustainable land use (for example, McBride et al., 2011). However, there are aspects of land use, such as infrastructure, impervious surfaces, and some disturbances, that may be long lasting or irreversible and may not be adequately considered using indicators of other categories of sustainability. Potential indicators of sustainable land use include percent impervious surface (Sutton et al., 2009; Uphoff et al., 2011; Weiland et al., 2011) and land disturbance area. Changes in impervious surface area affect the water cycle and watershed dynamics, as well as terrestrial and aquatic habitats. The area of land disturbed can be considered a measure of sustainability. Land disturbance areas can be normalized based on a land-condition factor (Eq. 5-1) that captures the degree to which aspects of development, processing, infrastructure, potential accidents, and use of energy change the land from its natural state (Lenzen and Murray, 2001, 2003) and its ability to provide ecosystem services. shows examples of land condition factors that can be multiplied by disturbed area to give a currency of disturbance. This metric relates to ecological footprint methods that sometimes are applied to energy comparisons (Stoglehner, 2003), but it does not attempt to encompass effects on water, GHG emissions, and other ecological impacts that can be more controversially subsumed in ecological footprints (Fiala, 2008; Özdemir et al., 2011).

Land condition factors capture the proportion of disturbed land or relative intensity of disturbance, with land in a natural state having a land condition factor of 0 and paved land having a land condition factor of 1. Land condition factors are multiplied by disturbance area to allow comparison of disturbed areas of different intensities and scales. ""5 Environmental Effects."" National Research Council. 2012. Sustainable Development of Algal Biofuels in the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/13437. Trends in land-use change related to algal biofuel production are important to quantify. However, until there is a history of commercial development of algal biofuel production facilities, probable land-use changes and trends will need to be projected based on economic and social drivers and environmental contributing factors. Where important or rare ecosystem services are provided by the baseline land use, a measure of those services could serve as a sustainability indicator for algal biofuels. The services of pastures, rangelands, and coastal waters that might be displaced by feedstock production facilities would be important to quantify. Relevant metrics would be: •  National or regional area of grassland and shrubland devoted to livestock grazing; however, data are lacking on the acreage used for livestock grazing (The H.

John Heinz III Center for Science and the Environment, 2008). •  Pasture yield calculated on a per-area or per-forage biomass basis (methods described in Burns, 2008). A less direct indicator of livestock numbers or biomass would be area covered by grassland and shrubland (West, 2003; The H. John Heinz III Center for Science and the Environment, 2008). Additional sustainability indicators have been suggested for brownfield redevelopment efforts. Some of these are summarized in Wedding and Crawford-Brown (2007) and would be appropriate where algal biofuel production is sited on brownfields. The potential to mitigate GHG emissions is one of the motivations to develop biofuels. The basis of mitigation is that carbon emissions from combusting a biofuel are cancelled by the corresponding capture in photosynthesis. This said, the net GHG emissions of producing biofuels and coproducts are not zero because of carbon and other GHGs emitted in processing. In this section, the results of life-cycle assessment (LCA) studies of GHG emissions are reviewed critically. Primary GHG emissions from algal biofuels are expected to be connected to the use of energy in the processing chain (see section Energy in ). The translation of energy use to GHG emissions is complicated by variability in the carbon overhead of different forms of energy, in particular electricity. The average direct GHG emissions of electricity production in the United States is 606 grams of CO equivalent per kilowatt hour (EIA, 2002). Depending on the mix of fossil fuels, hydropower, nuclear, wind, and other sources providing power to the grid, emissions vary by state from 13 to 1,017 grams CO equivalent per kilowatt hour (EIA, 2002). The approach taken by many analysts is to use a national average emission factor (Liu et al., 2011). LCA results for net GHG emissions for algae biofuel production vary from a net negative value (that is, a carbon sink) to positive values substantially higher than petroleum gasoline (). As with the case for energy use (see ), drivers of variability in CO emissions are nutrient source, productivity and process performance, and the credit associated with coproducts. For example, Sander and Murthy (2010) assumed that residual algal biomass substitutes for corn in ethanol plants. Corn is energy intensive to produce; the ""5 Environmental Effects.""

Results from Sample Studies of Life-Cycle CO Emissions of Algal Biodiesel Production in Common Normalization Life-Cycle CO Emissions (kg CO equivalent per liter of biodiesel) Meta-Analysis Results for Ranges in Carbon Emissions Over the Life Cycle of Algal Biofuel Estimated by Various Studies GHG Emissions (kilograms CO eq per liter biodiesel) NOTE: The direct carbon emissions of driving an average gasoline automobile is about 0.15 kg CO eq per kilometer. SOURCE: Liu et al. (2012). Reprinted with permission from Elsevier. GHG credit from replacing corn with oil-extracted algae as a feedstock for ethanol results in a negative carbon balance. For reference, the direct carbon emission of combusting gasoline is about 2.7 kg CO equivalent per liter of fuel (Farrell et al., 2006). The vast differences in results in , ranging from a net carbon credit to emissions far larger than those from petroleum-based diesel, present a challenge for interpretation. Liu et al. (2012) performed a meta-analysis of these studies to analyze variability in processing energy by replacing differences in data and assumptions for nutrients and coproducts with common data (Lardon et al., 2009; Clarens et al., 2010; Jorquera et al., 2010; Sander and Murthy, 2010; Stephenson et al., 2010; Campbell et al., 2011). Differences in nutrient sourcing and coproducts are treated via four scenarios: virgin versus recycled CO and no coproducts versus coproducts. The common coproduct system used is generation of bioelectricity from gas generated by anaerobic digestion with the electricity generated substituting for carbon emissions from the U.S. grid. shows the ranges in results from the six treated studies, after normalization, for the four scenarios. These meta-analysis results suggest that the CO source and coproducts are critical factors in the GHG balance. It is, however, premature to conclude that algal biofuels based on recycling CO and producing biogas has net negative GHG emissions. The variability in is based on differences in energy data and assumptions in the six existing studies. It is not yet clear if current LCA analyses of algal biofuel production systems will accurately reflect the energy use of a real-world, scaled-up system. None of the studies above addresses the potential issue of indirect land-use change from biofuels. As stated earlier, it is possible that conversion of pastureland to algae cultivation facilities would necessitate conversions to pastureland elsewhere. However, uncertainties are too great to quantify this probability or to calculate net GHG emissions under these assumptions. (See section Land-Use Change in this chapter.)

While many agricultural processes emit non-carbon GHGs such as nitrous oxide (NO) and methane (Weber and Matthews, 2008), these emissions have not been established empirically as significant for algae cultivation. NO could be emitted from cultivation systems, and these emissions would need to be quantified in the future for cultivation conditions that might promote NO or methane emission. One study of a single species quantified NO emissions from algal culture under laboratory conditions (Fagerstone et al., 2011). In this study of with nitrate as a nitrogen source, elevated NO emissions were observed under a nitrogen headspace (photobioreactor simulation) during dark periods, but NO emissions were low during light periods. In contrast, when the headspace consisted of air (open-pond simulation), NO emissions were negligible. Denitrifying bacteria were present. Denitrification is the microbial reduction of nitrate and nitrite with generation of NO and, ultimately, gaseous nitrogen. Anaerobic environments are required for the transformation, but high rates of denitrification occur where oxygen is available alternately, then unavailable (Kleiner, 1974). In rivers, ponds, lakes, and estuaries, the production of NO is correlated with nitrate concentrations in the water (Stadmark and Leonardson, 2005). The denitrification rate depends on the underlying soil and the liner’s permeability. Whether anaerobic denitrification is the only potential pathway for NO generation in algal cultivation systems is unclear. Weathers (1984) has shown that certain Chlorophyceae in axenic culture evolve NO when using nitrite as a nitrogen source. Florez-Leiva et al. (2010) found that coastal open-pond systems containing emitted large quantities of NO during senescence. They speculated that oxidation of ammonium (NH) by bacteria was the likeliest NO-generation pathway under the observed aerobic conditions. Proper management of the algal cultivation systems, which would prevent senescence of algae and maintain aerobic conditions in ponds, likely would keep NO emissions to low levels. Methanogenesis can occur in freshwater and marine sediments, waterlogged soils, marshes, and swamps where oxygen is low. These conditions might prevail in some ponds with substantial biomass or other organic matter in the sediment. Methane is released when organic acids, alcohols, celluloses, hemicelluloses, and proteins are degraded. Methane production is related to water temperature (Stadmark and Leonardson, 2005) and is maximized at neutral pH (Alexander, 1977). Methanogenesis is suppressed by nitrogen compounds that bacteria can use as electron acceptors, including nitrate and nitrite (Bollag and Czlonkowski, 1973), but these compounds may be reduced easily in oxygen-depleted environments. Methanogenesis and denitrification might be enhanced if the culture fails. During catastrophic failure of the culture, the dense algal cultures in algal biofuel ponds can become anaerobic and emit a variety of volatile nitrous or sulfur compounds as well as methane. However, culture failures would be expected to be short-term and rare occurrences if algal biofuel companies are to maintain a profit margin. The opportunities for mitigating energy use discussed in the section Energy in apply to reduction of GHG emissions. There is additional potential to mitigate GHGs by using low-carbon energy sources for processing and by substituting for carbon-intensive coproducts. For example, the carbon benefit of generating bioelectricity is larger in areas where the grid relies on fossil fuels. The yields for producing and properties of different coproduct options are poorly understood. The potential for NO and methane emissions could be reduced through thorough mixing and proper management of algae cultivation (Fagerstone et al., 2011). ""5 Environmental Effects."" National Research Council. 2012. Sustainable Development of Algal Biofuels in the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/13437. The data gaps for estimating energy use and the method gaps in reducing energy use discussed in the section Energy () apply to reduction of GHG emissions. An appropriate sustainability indicator for GHG emissions is the amount of CO equivalent emitted per unit energy produced, which has been selected as an indicator for GHG emissions of biodiesel and commonly has been used in discussing energy-related GHG emissions (GBEP, 2011; Mata et al., 2010). The introduction of large bodies of water in arid or semi-arid environments could alter the local climate of the area by increasing humidity and reducing temperature extremes. Similarly, the introduction of large-scale, open-pond algal cultivation systems in arid or semi-arid environments, where much of algae production in the United States is projected to take place (see ), could affect local climate and ecosystems. The use of photobioreactors would not likely alter local climate. Studies of reservoirs provide some useful ecological information. Reservoirs created by the damming of rivers could affect evaporation rates of the surrounding landscape, leading to changes in vegetation cover and terrestrial species diversity (Huntley et al., 1998). Large dams can affect surrounding climate and precipitation, particularly in Mediterranean and semi-arid climates (Degu et al., 2011). The sustainability indicators for potential changes in local climate are trends in relative humidity and trends in temperature distribution statistics. While parallels can be drawn from the introduction of large reservoirs in arid regions, the variability in size, geography, and production methods that will emerge as the algae industry grows will necessitate additional research to fully understand and address the impacts associated with local climate alteration. The air quality impacts of algal biofuel production will depend on system design. Different air quality issues arise in conjunction with the different steps of the algal biofuel supply chain. Thus, this section is organized by the steps along the production pathways. The wide range of potential organisms for producing algal biofuels and the wide range of final fuel products result in a broad range of possible air emissions. ""5 Environmental Effects."" National Research Council. 2012. Sustainable Development of Algal Biofuels in the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/13437. This section focuses on the air quality emissions unique to algal biofuel production and does not consider emissions of fossil fuels used to power processing equipment or emissions of fossil fuels that may be used in manufacturing fertilizer or pesticides. The purpose of the chapter is to consider emissions unique to algal biofuel production so that appropriate indicators are identified. However, emissions from fossil fuels used along the production pathway of algal biofuel would need to be considered in any LCA of the airquality impacts of different algal biofuel designs. Further, how algal biofuels will be scaled up and how air quality might change with increasing scale is uncertain. The committee is not aware of any measured emissions of atmospheric pollutants from algal biofuel feedstock ponds published in the literature. Under normal running conditions in open ponds, the cultures are aerobic, and low emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are expected (Rasmussen, 1974; A. Ben-Amotz, Israel Oceanographic and Limnological Research Ltd., personal communication on November 1, 2011; Zuo et al., 2012). However, macroalgae and microalgae growing in natural marine environments are known to be important sources of VOCs, including isoprene and monoterpenes (Giese et al., 1999; Shaw et al., 2010). Researchers from Texas A&M University currently are screening and quantifying VOCs from a wide variety of marine and freshwater algal cultures and algal paste. Three of the species tested are being grown for biofuels in open raceways, open ponds, and closed photobioreactors, with test samples derived from cultures being grown in treated wastewater with CO enrichment. In preliminary findings, 45 VOCs have been identified (P. Zimba, Texas A&M University, unpublished data). Other emissions expected are aerosols that may be emitted directly or created in the atmosphere through reactions of gaseous emissions of precursor gases of sulfur dioxide (SO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), NH, and VOCs. Aerosols could include algae and nutrients, as well as a wide range of compounds that are produced by microalgae, including toxins. (See section Pathogens and Toxins later in this chapter.) Microalgae in the natural marine environment are known sources of sulfate aerosols (for example, Liss et al., 1997). A large number of algae produce odorous secondary metabolites (reviewed in Smith et al., 2008), but those algae are not likely to be selected for large-scale production. The odors are produced during aerobic growth as secondary metabolites. Other odorous compounds are associated with the decay of algae under anaerobic conditions where bacteria break down the organic material and produce hydrogen sulfide and NH, both of which have a strong odor. In open ponds intended for algae cultivation, anaerobic conditions are minimized. Emissions from photobioreactors would be lower than those from open ponds if undesirable gaseous products and odorous chemicals are scrubbed before gas exchange with the outside environment is permitted. Drying processes may produce coarse and fine particulates, including algae and lysed algae. The concentrations of particulates in air will depend on the technologies used; for example, belt dryers and convective systems will lead to greater local emissions than passive solar drying. Whether emissions move beyond the facility will depend on the level of containment. Particulates could be an occupational hazard even in closed facilities. In confined areas, dust could be an explosion hazard. Poor drying methods also can give rise to decomposition of biomass and release of VOCs, amines, methane, and other compounds.

Most proposed algal biofuel processing methods involve extraction of lipids or other compounds from cells using organic solvents. Extraction with organic chemicals, by necessity, results in some solvent emissions, and the quantities emitted depend on the technology applied. The most common solvent that is openly discussed by manufacturers is hexane (Demirbas, 2009; Lardon et al., 2009; Gong and Jiang, 2011). In an environmental assessment, Sapphire Energy, Inc., an algal biofuel company, noted that “less than 50 ppm of hexane will remain in the algal solids after the hexane recovery process. This residual hexane will be emitted fugitively from the algal solids to the atmosphere during conveyance to the IABR [Integrated Algal Biorefinery] oil purification process” (USDA-RD, 2009). Desirable properties of these solvents are low cost, recoverability, low toxicity, nonpolar structure, and poor extractor of non-lipid cell components (Rawat et al., 2011). Hexane is used as an extractant of vegetable oils in biodiesel production with fugitive hexane emissions (Hess et al., 2009). Compliance with regulatory standards likely would minimize release of solvents. Technologies to convert total biomass to drop-in liquid fuels are being tested. These processes may have additional feed inputs and will have different air emissions from those from production of esterified or green diesels. Pyrolysis of biomass yields three energy products—solids (char), liquids (bio-oils), and gases—in various proportions depending on the temperature, pressure, residence time, and other factors. The gases are recycled to provide energy for the system and thus do not contribute directly to air emissions except for any fugitive emissions that might escape the system. The heating of the pyrolysis units might contribute a small amount of NOx and carbon monoxide (CO). Additional energy, likely supplied by natural gas may be required to sufficiently dry the algal biomass prior to pyrolysis. Particulate emissions, acid gases, and hydrocarbon emissions from pyrolysis are not characterized in the literature. The bio-oil produced from whole-cell pyrolysis will require additional upgrading to produce transportation fuels. The upgrading can be done with a separate hydrotreating step or a process similar to the Integrated Hydropyrolysis and Hydroconversion process. In either case, input of hydrogen is required. The production of hydrogen produces low levels of NOx (Spath and Mann, 2001) and makes a CO stream that could be used to supply the algae cultivation. Anaerobic digestion for processing wastewater from algal biofuel production facilities is described in . NH has been observed to be present in biogas from anaerobic digestion at concentrations up to 450 ppm (Schomaker, 2000). The concentration of NH in biogas would depend on the nitrogen content of the particular feed material. Early work by Golueke et al. (1957) found that anaerobic digestion of algae yielded N and NH concentrations of the order of 4 to 5 percent (volumetric average) of the total gas production. NH would not be released to air around the facility because of the desire to recycle nutrients required for cultivation. The primary categories of environmental effects associated with the end use of biofuels in vehicles are evaporative emissions and tailpipe emissions from fuel combustion. ""5 Environmental Effects.""

E85 is a fuel blend of up to 85% denatured ethanol. B20 is a blend of 20% biodiesel and 80% petroleum diesel and is the most common biodiesel blend in the United States. B100 is 100% biodiesel. Fischer-Tropsch (F-T)synthesis converts a mixture of CO and hydrogen (which may be derived from biomass) into liquid hydrocarbons. SOURCES: Dufey (2006), EPA (2002a,b,c), and Graham et al. (2008). Generally, the type and quantities of emissions vary depending on fuel characteristics (for example, chemical properties and blends), age of the vehicle or other equipment, power output of engine, operating condition of engine, how the vehicle or other equipment is operated, and ambient temperature (Graham et al., 2008; Yanowitz and McCormick, 2009; Ginnebaugh et al., 2010). Using biofuels in place of petroleum-based fuels decreases emissions of some air pollutants while increasing others (; NRC, 2011). EPA established emission standards for tailpipe emissions of CO, hydrocarbons, NOx, and particulate matter to which vehicle manufacturers and refiners have to comply (EPA, 2009a). Emissions of air pollutants need to be assessed over the life cycle of algal biofuels and compared to petroleum-based fuels and other alternatives. The Hill et al. study (2009) and data therein (NRC, 2011) illustrate the importance of such assessment. They found that although the uses of gasoline and terrestrial-plant biofuels (corn-grain ethanol and cellulosic ethanol) release similar amounts of VOC, PM, NO, SO, and NH, emissions from the production stages are significantly different between petroleum-based fuels and biofuels. Biofuels emit higher quantities of VOCs, NO, NH, and PM than petroleum-based fuels (Hill et al., 2009). The committee is not aware of any LCA of such air pollutants for algal biofuels. Such analysis is critical in assessing whether biofuel production and use result in air quality improvement compared to fossil fuel and it provides information on stages in the supply chain that are key contributors to air pollutants.

Algae produce a number of aerosols and secondary metabolites, some of which may be noxious (for example, malodorous) or harmful to humans. Similarly, some supply-chain processes, such as extraction and drying, may emit solvents or particulates that could affect local air quality if not contained. If an algal biofuel facility is located near human populations, measures likely will be taken to contain or limit the release of any products that negatively affect local air quality or are perceived to be a risk to public health. The health costs of some types of air emissions were discussed in Hill et al. (2009). Depending on the quantity of these outputs, and the proximity of population centers to a production facility, the reduction in air quality and perceived health and quality-of-life risks may impact the ""5 Environmental Effects."" National Research Council. 2012. Sustainable Development of Algal Biofuels in the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/13437. siting and permitting processes, making it more difficult for developers to secure land and obtain permits. If the public is not made aware of these potential effects prior to the siting and permitting of a facility, there is a risk that the production of undesirable compounds will be viewed as unacceptable after the construction of the facility has been completed. If this is the case, litigation or protests may slow or shut down operations, resulting in financial losses for the developer and negative attention for the industry at large. The more contained a process is, whether it is the biomass cultivation process, drying, solvent extraction, pyrolysis, or digestion, the lower the emissions to air will be. Therefore, photobioreactors could have reduced air-quality impacts compared to open-pond systems. However, full LCA of the air pollutant emissions associated with the production of the bioreactor materials and system operation also would be needed to assess whether photobioreactors represent a small or negligible impact on air quality. Although passive processes (for example, solar drying) reduce air quality impacts compared to active processes that generate dust or increase volatilization rates, they are not practical solutions at large scale. Siting facilities at a distance from human population centers and ecological species of concern would mitigate potential adverse effects of air pollution on humans. Appropriate sustainability metrics for air quality would depend on the processes used in algal biofuel production. Concentrations would have to be measured or modeled at scales appropriate to bound regulatory levels or potential human health or annoyance effects. These may include: •  For open pond systems, concentrations of VOCs and odorous secondary metabolites. •  For active drying processes, concentrations of particulates in air. •  For extraction processes, air concentrations of the solvent used. •  For pyrolysis, particulates, hydrocarbons, and acid gases. Measuring air emissions from large open ponds can provide information for occupational and other environmental exposure estimates that can be compared to thresholds for human health or environmental effects. Information and data gaps include the relationship between particular drying technologies and the types and concentrations of particulates released, releases of solvents during extraction, likely concentrations of NH in air during anaerobic digestion, and chemicals potentially released during pyrolysis. That information would be submitted when the biorefineries seek air-quality permits. Species invasiveness is a concern unique to biofuels produced from algae and vascular plants. In addition, changing land use or altering landscapes to produce algal biofuel feedstocks can affect biodiversity. Effects of many biofuel feedstocks on biodiversity and mechanisms leading to those effects are beginning to be understood. However, existing studies (Fargione et al., 2009; Fletcher et al., 2011; Wiens et al., 2011) focus primarily on ""5 Environmental Effects."" National Research Council. 2012. Sustainable Development of Algal Biofuels in the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/13437. terrestrial ecosystems and terrestrial plant biofuel feedstocks, rather than on aquatic systems and algal feedstocks. 5.6.1 Distributions of Algae in Natural Aquatic Environments Many cyanobacteria and eukaryotic microalgae are cosmopolitan in their spatial (biogeographical) distributions and therefore could not be invasive if released in regions included in their broad habitat range. However, they are not necessarily found in every location where their habitat requirements (for example, pH, salinity, temperature, moisture, and climate) are met, so their distribution is often mosaic-like (Hoffmann, 1996). Other algae may be endemic to particular regions, for example, some cyanobacteria in Swedish lakes (Rott and Hernandez-Marine, 1994) and particular marine species (Hoffman, 1994). Endemic species could become invasive if transported elsewhere, but these species could also exist in low numbers in other locations even though they have not been recorded there. Algae may have broader distributions than what has been recorded because of the lack of sampling on some continents (especially of benthic habitats) and because of the lack of detection of organisms at low densities (Hoffmann, 1996). Coastal marine macroalgae tend to be less cosmopolitan in their spatial distribution than phytoplanktonic cyanobacteria and microalgae. Macroalgae have narrower temperature, light, substratum, and nutrient preferences. The wide range of processes that could transport microalgae away from open water also could contribute to their dispersal and consequentially to a broad distribution. Many algal species can be transported by air (Grönblad, 1933). Vectors of algae include aquatic insects (Stewart et al., 1970), dragonflies, wasps (Maguire, 1963), fish (digestive tracts, Velasquez, 1940), beetles (references in Kristiansen 1996), water-living mammals such as raccoons (Maguire, 1963), minks (Irenee-Marie, 1938), and muskrats (Roscher, 1967). The most important vectors of algae are birds (Atkinson, 1972; Kristiansen, 1996). In one study of 16 species of waterfowl, 86 species of algae were found on the feet, 25 species on the feathers, and 25 species on the bills. Most algae survived out of surface waters for four hours, but most did not survive for more than eight hours (Schlichting, 1960). Some species of algae may appear to be rare. Whitford (1983) explains that species of freshwater algae may appear to be rare for several reasons (for example, infrequent historical collections, species with long-lived spores that do not easily germinate, and species that are highly specific in their habitat requirements), but that very few freshwater species are actually rare. This suggests that few rare species of algae could be displaced by invasive algae used to produce biofuel feedstocks. Releases of improved nongenetically engineered or genetically engineered strains of algae from biofuel production cultures to natural environments can be expected to be common, especially from open ponds. Releases may occur during the feedstock production stage or possibly during the harvesting or drying stages. Releases probably will occur most often through aerosolization, although leakages from ponds or weather-related spillage (for example, high tides and heavy storms) also are possible. The probability of release from an open pond would be related to pond area and freeboard space (that is, the distance between normal water level and the top of the cultivation pond), the direction and speed of prevailing winds, the frequency and quantity of ""5 Environmental Effects."" National Research Council. 2012. Sustainable Development of Algal Biofuels in the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/13437. precipitation (for example, rain splash), distance to water bodies, the probability and intensity of visitation by potential vectors such as aquatic birds and mammals, and the absolute abundance (in cells per mL) of the species that might be released into the environment. Humidity affects the survival of unicellular algae (Ehresmann and Hatch, 1975). Survival rates differ among algal groups. In one study climatic characteristics such as temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, wind velocity, and hours of sunshine affected the release and vertical transport of algae (Sharma and Singh, 2010). Atmospheric density of algae is affected by aerosolization rate (Sharma and Singh, 2010), wind speed, and rainfall, as well as survival rate. The abundance of algae in the atmosphere also depends on taxonomy of the algae. In one study, cyanobacteria had the highest density, whereas chlorophytes and diatoms were much less common (Sharma and Singh, 2010; Wilkinson et al., 2011). Dissemination to distant sites can occur through the air, through water, and by boats (Alexander, 1971) or animal vectors. The wide range of vectors that could remove algae from open ponds include aquatic insects (Stewart et al., 1970), dragonflies (Maguire, 1963), birds (Atkinson, 1972), and raccoons (Maguire, 1963), among others. Closed photobioreactor systems would have a much lower risk of release and transport of algae. Harvesting operations from open or closed systems could be a major potential route for loss of microalgae to the surrounding environment. If algae require culture media with characteristics substantially different from the surrounding natural environment (especially if the algae have narrow tolerance limits to nutrients concentrations, pH, or salinity), then releases to the local landscape likely would result in low survival rates. Survival rate would be further reduced if the cultured species is not tolerant of desiccation (Hoffmann, 1996). Environmental concerns associated with releasing algae from biofuel facilities into natural waters include the potential for species invasiveness, alteration of nutrient recycling and trophic relationships, and the displacement of rare algal species. Although some researchers and producers are considering the use of regionally native species that are adapted to the local climate (Odlare et al., 2011), other algal production facilities may use nonnative species or species that have been selected and bred or genetically modified for desirable characteristics for algal biofuel production. Some of the nonnative or improved species may be invasive in some environments. Invasive algae can compete with native species for light, space, or nutrients, and have different tolerances for stressors, compared to native species (White and Shurin, 2011). Thus, invasive species can affect community composition and ecosystem processes (Strayer et al., 2006). Successful invasions are characterized by the invasive potential of the invader and the invasibility of the native community (Lonsdale, 1999). Species that are not invasive in one environment may be invasive when introduced to a different habitat (Raghu et al., 2006). For example, an algal species that thrives in saline waters may not survive or may invade freshwater ecosystems, even if released in a large quantity. Whether the ecological niches of invaders and the invaded community overlap is a predictor of success as well (Mehnert et al., 2010). Whether a particular cultured algal species poses a threat as an invasive species to the surrounding aquatic environments needs to be considered. Some of the same characteristics that can make a species desirable as a biofuel feedstock, for example, rapid growth, vegetative propagation, pest resistance, and robustness in culture, also are those associated with invasiveness.

Blooms of exotic species could displace native species, with adverse impacts on organisms that feed on those species propagating through aquatic food webs. An example is the diatom (also known as Didymo or ) that can cause dense algal blooms. The blooms block sunlight and cause a local decline in native plant and animal life. Historically, occurred mostly in northern latitudes in nutrient-poor waters, but it now has been observed in nutrient-rich water at lower latitudes—possibly a genetic variant that has broader tolerances than the original genotype (see Global Invasive Species Database; ISSG, 2012). The primary variable that is different among the pathways in and would influence the likelihood of species invasions and changes in biodiversity is whether the pond system is open or closed (). Algal species known to be noninvasive or unlikely to cause harmful blooms could be selected for large-scale cultivation for fuels. Invasiveness varies in different natural environments, and site-specific assessments might be necessary to reduce risks of invasion. Moreover, species that are intolerant of conditions in natural waters (for example, salinity) in the vicinity of the biofuel facility may be selected to minimize the risk of invasion if released.

Landscape design also may be considered to limit any potential impacts of releases of algae from pond systems. Placing systems well away from waterways and wetlands where pond algae may thrive could reduce or minimize the likelihood of blooms of released species. When considering the factors that affect the probability of release and the abundance of released organisms above, then mitigation measures might include shields from wind and mechanisms to discourage vectors. Indicators of sustainable ecological communities include metrics of aquatic diversity and invasiveness of algae. One category of such metrics would be diagnostic traits for invasiveness. Qualitative metrics that are related to invasiveness, but not necessarily diagnostic, include: •  Wide habitat tolerances, for example, tolerances for temperature, light, and nutrients. •  Aggressive competition for resources, for example, light, nutrients, or space. More direct metrics of aquatic biodiversity that relate to the sustainability of biofuels are recommended by McBride et al. (2011) and are pertinent here: •  Presence of taxa of special concern. These may include rare fish, aquatic invertebrates, or macrophytes. •  Habitat area of taxa of special concern, which for aquatic organisms might translate to stream reach length for taxa of concern. Additional sustainability indicators for aquatic biodiversity might include the types of metrics found in recovery plans for species protected under the Endangered Species Act ().

Sustainable Development of Algal Biofuels in the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/13437. The pattern of landscape conversion for any new infrastructure could affect terrestrial species and community diversity through at least three distinct mechanisms that also apply to algal biofuel production or other energy production (McCabe, 1994; DOE, 2009, 2010a; Garvin et al., 2011): •   Displacement of terrestrial vegetation and wildlife habitat from the facility area and replacement with a pond or photobioreactor containing a monoculture or a few species of algae. •   Reduction in local wildlife habitat area below the threshold needed for the species. •   Fragmentation of wildlife habitat such that mates are more difficult to find or mi-gration corridors are disrupted. The magnitude of land requirements (discussed in ) and the types of conversions (discussed in section Land-Use Change in this chapter) influence the magnitude of potential effects on ecological populations and communities. Displacement of native vegetation and individual vertebrates usually is limited to the area of the facility, but some species are sensitive to human infrastructure and tend to be displaced to distances beyond the boundaries of the facility, for example, female sage grouse avoiding nesting within 950 meters of infrastructure associated with natural gas fields (Holloran et al., 2010). Extensive infrastructure, especially from multiple facilities, could fragment habitat for some wide-ranging vertebrates. Fragmentation of habitat is determined less by the area of a facility than by the dimensions compared to significant habitat types or corridors. One measure of fragmentation is the ratio of the perimeter (patch edge length) to the area of a habitat patch (Dale and Pearson, 1997). Thus, a linear facility would tend to be fragmenting in more environments than one that is closer to square. However, the latter configuration is more practical for system maintenance, so extensive linear facilities are not considered. Other potential measures of fragmentation include the percent of the landscape occupied by a given habitat, the number or density of habitat patches within a given area (more patches means greater fragmentation), and the degree of connectedness or isolation among habitats (McGarigal et al., 2005). Even where habitat is not fragmented, human infrastructure and associated disturbance could reduce the habitat area beyond minimum levels required by certain species. Carlsen et al. (2004) review critical patch sizes (contiguous habitat area necessary to conserve a population) required by many species, such as the minimum patch size that can sustain a viable population. They found that few studies examined behavioral or population dynamics associated with large areas of contiguous habitat, which also contained smaller patches of unsuitable or disturbed lands (as in algal biofuel development or oil and gas development). An exception is a theoretical study of American badger at an oil production site that investigated the effects of increasing areas of patches of disturbance on an otherwise highly suitable matrix of tallgrass prairie in Oklahoma (Jager et al., 2006). Critical disturbance areas would depend on the species of concern, the habitat type, habitat suitability, and type of infrastructure. ""5 Environmental Effects."" National Research Council. 2012. Sustainable Development of Algal Biofuels in the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/13437. Impacts on terrestrial vegetation and wildlife could vary widely, depending on the specific sites chosen and the land-use baseline and dynamics prevailing in the absence of algae cultivation and algal biofuel refineries. According to Wigmosta et al. (2011), within the land area potentially suitable for biofuels, land cover types consisted of 42 percent shrub or scrub, 19 percent herbaceous, 14 percent evergreen forest, 10 percent pastureland, 8 percent deciduous forest, and 7 percent other lands including mixed forest, barren, and low-intensity developed. As discussed in , the most favorable conditions in terms of land and water requirements were in the Gulf Coast region. Shrub-scrub habitat in the United States is widely distributed but is threatened by changes in land-use patterns; numerous bird species dependent on this habitat type are in decline (NRCS and WHC, 2007). Development of large areas of shrub-scrub for ponds, up to 181,000 square kilometers (using figures from Wigmosta et al., 2011), could accelerate this decline. The presence and abundance of wildlife need to be assessed prior to construction, as is done for facilities that are subject to environmental assessment (DOE, 2010a). Landscape design could minimize potential effects on biodiversity. Dale et al. (2011) suggest that incorporating design considerations recommended for bioenergy could prevent or minimize adverse effects on terrestrial biodiversity, for example by maintaining corridors for movement of terrestrial wildlife. In planning the size of individual ponds, their density on the landscape, and associated production facilities, managers would have to consider potential environmental impacts on biodiversity. Open algal ponds may be sources of water to wildlife that may prove beneficial in arid conditions or harmful if toxic to certain species. The risks of animals being exposed to salinity or chemicals in water from algae cultivation ponds and having adverse effects from drinking or dermal exposures are unknown. Toxicity from salt exposure is possible. This occurs when salt or chloride are accumulated in blood at toxic levels and, in the case of birds, at rates too high to be excreted by salt glands. For example, mortality from sodium toxicity has been observed at hypersaline playa lakes of southeast New Mexico (Meteyer et al., 1997). However, the water for algae cultivation is not likely to be hypersaline. Coastal bird species have specialized organs to accommodate high salt levels (Hughes, 2003). Lethal and sublethal salinity concentrations for some species are summarized in a U.S. Department of the Interior report (1998), with toxicity threshold values for ducks ranging from 9 to 20 parts per thousand (compared to the salinity of most seawater at 35 parts per thousand). Many chemical and behavioral factors could influence exposure of wildlife to salt and other chemicals in open-pond systems. For example, artificial water developments in desert environments are sometimes an important water source for local bird populations (Lynn et al., 2006), but can be less important for some migratory species (Lynn et al., 2006) or animals that may have a strong fidelity for specific water sources (Dickens et al., 2009). If ponds are sited near wastewater treatment facilities and CO sources (that is, near population centers), then water is unlikely to be rare in the landscape and wildlife will have many options for water sources. Ponds with dense algae might not be as attractive to wildlife as more pristine ""5 Environmental Effects."" National Research Council. 2012. Sustainable Development of Algal Biofuels in the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/13437. water, but this hypothesis is untested. Similarly, the effect of dense algae on the attractiveness of ponds for wildlife drinking is unknown. For oil-field wastewater evaporation ponds, bird exposures appear to be episodic, coinciding with migration behavior (Ramirez, 2010). To consider potential exposures of wildlife to toxicants in culture water from algal biofuel facilities and their potential effects, analogies may be made to agricultural evaporation ponds and oil-field wastewater evaporation ponds. In the western part of the San Joaquin Valley, California, agricultural evaporation ponds have been developed where other options for disposal of drainage water are limited. Birds use evaporation ponds for resting, foraging, and nesting (Evaporation Ponds Technical Committee, 1999). One study of shorebird use in California’s Central Valley found that agricultural evaporation ponds are very attractive to these birds (Shuford et al., 1998). In another study, northern pintails () wintering in Tulare Basin, CA, were found not to use or select agricultural drain-water evaporation ponds or sewage treatment ponds (which might appear similar to some algal biofuel ponds) and to prefer flooded fields and marshes (Fleskes et al., 2003). For agricultural evaporation ponds, the primary wildlife concern has been the concentration of selenium (Evaporation Ponds Technical Committee, 1999); its environmental transformations and accumulation have been studied (Gao et al., 2007). Whether selenium might represent a significant exposure in algal ponds depends on the availability of selenium in source water and in underlying soils if pond water seeps out. Some investigators suggest that waterfowl exposed to waters from agricultural evaporation ponds might be at risk from uranium toxicity (Duff et al., 1997). Uranium accumulation in pond sediments was attributed in part to decaying algae. Arsenic dynamics also have been studied as a potential concern (Ryu et al., 2010). In another potentially analogous example, birds (Ramirez, 2010), as well as bats, amphibians, reptiles, small mammals, game species, and insects (Ramirez, 2005), have been observed to be attracted to large (0.4 to 2 hectares) evaporation ponds from oilfield wastewater disposal facilities in the western United States. Bird fatalities from those ponds generally are attributed to oil, but sodium toxicity and surfactants have been implicated in some cases (Ramirez, 2010). Attraction to algal ponds could be a major problem if they contain toxic chemicals or pathogens at harmful concentrations. Fish injuries (ada, 1998) and bird fatalities (Osborn et al., 2000) have affected the social acceptability (and therefore the sustainable development) of hydropower and wind energy, respectively. Adaptive management can play a role in mitigating any adverse effects on wildlife through exposure via drinking. The committee is not aware of any reports of wildlife drinking being a concern in existing open-pond algae cultivation facilities. As the number and size of facilities increase, concentrations of potential toxicants in water and wildlife drinking exposure needs to be monitored to ensure that the latter is not a concern. The fail-safe mitigation for wildlife exposure to salinity or any toxicants in culture waters is to use closed photobioreactor systems. Moreover, salinity concerns would be eliminated through the use of fresh water, though discusses resource constraints for fresh water at commercial scales of development. Mitigations for open-pond systems might include netting to prevent exposure (as in the oilfield wastewater evaporation ponds), but this would be expensive and only necessary if wildlife exposure proves to be a problem. Rapid stirring could make ponds less suitable as wildlife drinking habitat than still water. Other wildlife deterrents may be ""5 Environmental Effects."" National Research Council. 2012. Sustainable Development of Algal Biofuels in the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/13437. An Illustration of Potential Environmental Effects on Wildlife from Different Pathways of Algal Biofuel Production Open-pond, salt water, producing biodiesel, recycling nutrients and water Open-pond, salt water, producing biodiesel + coproducts Open-pond, salt water, producing FAME, recycling nutrients and water Photobioreactor, salt water, direct synthesis, recycling water Open-pond, salt water, producing biomass, pyrolysis, recycling some nutrients and water Displacement of vegetation and vertebrates (habitat loss), possible fragmentation of habitat Displacement of vegetation and vertebrates (habitat loss), possible fragmentation of habitat Displacement of vegetation and vertebrates (habitat loss), possible fragmentation of habitat Displacement of vegetation and vertebrates (habitat loss), possible fragmentation of habitat, probably at a smaller spatial scale than for other pathways Displacement of vegetation and vertebrates (habitat loss), possible fragmentation of habitat Exposure to water in a closed system is not possible possible. Some of the mitigations used for oilfield wastewater evaporation ponds, such as covering the surface with plastic balls to make the ponds less attractive to birds (Ramirez, 2010), are not options for photosynthetic fuel sources. Similarly, mitigation strategies used in agricultural evaporation ponds, such as steepening pond slopes or maintaining deep water levels that reduce suitability of bird feeding habitat, are not practical for algae cultivation that requires shallow ponds (Evaporation Ponds Technical Committee, 1999). As open ponds are monitored for chemical contaminants, toxicity thresholds for these chemicals will help determine when culture waters need to be disposed and renewed. As with land-use change, regarding the landscape pattern of development, the primary relevant difference among the pathways in is the difference between the land required for open-pond and photobioreactor systems (see ). For wildlife drinking, the primary variable of interest is closed versus open systems (). Metrics of terrestrial biodiversity for the sustainability of biofuels that are recommended by McBride et al. (2011) and pertinent to issues related to the landscape pattern of development include: •  Presence of taxa of special concern (presence). •  Habitat area of taxa of special concern (hectare). ""5 Environmental Effects."" National Research Council. 2012. Sustainable Development of Algal Biofuels in the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/13437. Habitat area can be a proxy for population size (Turlure et al., 2010). As with aquatic diversity metrics, additional sustainability indicators for terrestrial biodiversity might be obtained from recovery plans for species listed under the Endangered Species Act (). For wildlife exposures to salinity and contaminants in drinking water, sustainability indicators would include: •  Number of vertebrate fatalities from drinking from algal ponds per year (direct measure). •  Concentrations of toxicants, toxins, or salinity in culture medium (less direct measure). •  Abundance of vertebrates drinking from open ponds per year (less direct measure). Patterns of development of algal biofuel facilities in relation to wildlife corridors have not been studied because locations for future development are uncertain. The spatial scale and landscape pattern of these developments needs to be understood to simulate the effects on wildlife populations. As algae cultivation expands in number and scale, the potential for wildlife drinking needs to be assessed at sites. If wildlife drinking is observed, then concentrations of toxicants in source waters and culture waters need to be measured to ensure that there is no threat to wildlife health. Alternatively, measures to deter wildlife drinking can be implemented. 5.8 ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS OF GENETICALLY ENGINEERED ORGANISMS The environmental sustainability of genetically engineered feedstocks for bioenergy (Wolt, 2009; Moon et al., 2010) and the potential implications of regulations on sustainable development of the industry (Moon et al., 2010; Strauss et al., 2010) have been considered previously, but the emphasis has been on engineered terrestrial crops (Moon et al., 2010) rather than algae. Some algal biofuel companies, such as Algenol and Synthetic Genomics, are conducting research on genetically engineered organisms for algal biofuel production (Gressel, 2008). In a hypothetical, worst-case scenario, genetically engineered algae that have been introduced to natural environments might persist and become so abundant that they create harmful algal blooms (Snow and Smith, 2012). Clearly, any adverse effects of released genetically engineered algae, if observed, would affect the sustainable development of algal biofuel technologies. The evaluation of potential effects of genetically engineered algae will be a complex undertaking, given the diversity of organisms, range of engineered functions, and range of environments potentially receiving the engineered organisms (Tiedje et al., 1989). This section of the report addresses the novel traits and genetic structure of genetically engineered cyanobacteria and microalgae for biofuels and whether they have unique or more uncertain risks. (Potential genetic manipulation methods are discussed in .) Past broad assessments of the risks of genetically engineered organisms have concluded that the product (novel traits) is more important than the process (genetic engineering techniques) for evaluating risk (NRC, 1987; Tiedje et al., 1989; Snow et al., 2005). However, novel traits may be more common when the process for creating new algae involves direct genetic manipulation than when horizontal gene transfer occurs in evolutionary time. ""5 Environmental Effects."" National Research Council. 2012. Sustainable Development of Algal Biofuels in the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/13437. Several traits of algae for biofuels may be modified through genetic engineering methods. Most are intended to increase biomass or oil productivity, though some could be designed to minimize survival or reproduction following release. Increasing productivity could involve objectives such as enhancing lipid content as a precursor to biodiesel (which could involve growing cells in nitrogen-deficient or silicon-deficient media), introducing biological pathways that permit direct production of fuels that need minimal processing prior to distribution and use, modifying cells to secrete feedstock or fuel directly into the culture medium, modifying carbohydrate metabolism in cells (increasing glucan storage, decreasing starch degradation), increasing tolerance to stressors (such as salt, light, pH, temperature, glyphosate) (Radakovits et al., 2010), and improving resistance to disinfectants. Some of these engineered traits and intended or unintended accompanying traits could affect either the suitability of algae for biofuel production purposes or their survival and physiology when released into natural systems. Phenotypic changes that could lead to potential major ecological effects of released organisms include those that result in increases in physiological tolerance or altered substrate use or that change the species’ geographic range (Tiedje et al., 1989). Predictors of potential adverse effects of genetically engineered algae include probability of release, abundance of organisms released (predictor of establishment), survival rate and fitness, reproduction rate, probability of dissemination to distant sites, interactions with other organisms, probability of genetic exchange, and probability of an adverse effect (Alexander, 1985). New traits potentially can influence these factors, but few of these relationships are understood. Cell density in the culture medium could be affected by engineered traits. The scale and frequency of releases might determine whether the release leads to a self-sustaining (established) population (Tiedje et al., 1989). The survival rate of a genetically engineered microalga or cyanobacterium will be determined by a combination of the species identity, the genetic modification(s), and the environment to which it is released. Algae with high lipid content probably will be more attractive to predators. Some researchers suggest that most genetically engineered organisms will have lower fitness in receiving environments than unmodified organisms (Tiedje et al., 1989). Algae could be cross-bred or engineered to have high growth rates under specific culture conditions, and some of these might have high growth rates under specific natural conditions. New traits conferred on algae by genetic modifications would determine whether and how community interactions might be altered. Radakovits et al. (2010) pointed out that it is uncertain how genetically engineered strains will perform in scaled-up production systems with varying conditions and with wild-type competitive strains. Genetic exchange might lead to unexpected effects. Snow et al. (2005) asserted that genetic exchange between recombinant microbes and indigenous microbes is probable. The three types of horizontal transfer are transformation of free deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), conjugation, and transduction. The transfer of genes between microorganisms is common in some species (Snow et al., 2005). About 1 to 20 percent of the genomes of bacteria consist of DNA acquired recently (in an evolutionary context), predominantly from other prokaryotes but also from eukaryotes, for example, metazoa (Ochman et al., 2000; Koonin et al., 2002; Snow et al., 2005). Genetic exchange between prokaryotes and eukaryotes is not well studied (Rogers et al., 2007) beyond specific pairwise interactions such as T-DNA transfer from species to plant cells (Gelvin, 2010). Some ancient, evolutionary scale transfers have been recorded. For example, a gene for plastidtargeted fructose bisphosphate aldolase was transferred from red algae to some and species (Rogers et al., 2007). Another study, for example, showed evidence for the horizontal transfer of a self-splicing, homing intron from a cyanobacterium ""5 Environmental Effects."" National Research Council. 2012. Sustainable Development of Algal Biofuels in the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/13437. () to the chloroplast genome of (Sheveleva and Hallick, 2004). Gene transfer between dissimilar organisms is possible, though rare. There is evidence that nuclear genes encoding chloroplast proteins have been transferred from an alga to an ascoglossan sea slug that consumes the algae (Pierce et al., 2003). Horizontally transferred genes can code for selectable traits, such as antibiotic resistance, pathogenicity, and metabolic enzymes (Snow et al., 2005). Horizontal gene transfer depends on the density of organisms with which exchange is possible. The principal adverse effects of any algae, whether genetically engineered or not, could include health and ecological effects from toxin production, ecological effects from blooms, and species replacement. These potential effects are discussed elsewhere in this report. The potential propagation of antibiotic resistance markers also would be a concern, but species containing these markers would unlikely be used for commercial-scale production of biofuels. Toxin production by genetically engineered algae is unlikely because toxin-producing strains would be avoided, or strains probably would be engineered to remove toxin genes. A genetically engineered strain might have a lower risk of adverse impact than a natural strain that has not had such modifications. Categories of potential ecological risks from genetically engineered organisms that were highlighted by Tiedje et al. (1989) and Snow et al. (2005) would need to be considered in assessments of released algae. These include creating new or more effective pathogens, affecting nontarget species, disrupting biotic communities and ecosystems, reducing biodiversity or species-genetic diversity, or degrading valuable biological resources, many of which are discussed in the section on invasive species. Little evidence is available to evaluate the potential for any of these effects. Species that are genetically engineered to become more tolerant of environmental stressors, such as salt or temperature, could bloom in habitat conditions where blooms previously have not occurred. Species replacement is a potentially delayed effect (Tiedje et al., 1989). Whether exposure to genetically engineered organisms or genetic exchange with these organisms poses any potential hazards depends on the particular traits of the organism (Snow et al., 2005). Most approaches to risk assessment suggest that familiarity with genetically engineered organisms is an important predictor of risk (Efroymson, 1999). That is, genetically engineered organisms that have a history of safe use in applications similar to proposed uses (for example, at similar densities in similar ecosystems) would not be likely to threaten environmental sustainability of algal biofuels. Similarly, microorganisms that are not developed from dissimilar source organisms but rather are created from closely related organisms (see EPA, 1990) are less likely to have new traits and to cause adverse effects. 5.8.2 Social Acceptability of Genetically Engineered Algae If algal biofuel companies are moving toward the use of genetically engineered algae, popular and political resistance could be anticipated. Some concerns over genetically engineered algae depend on the capability of these algae to survive and invade natural environments (as in the case of invasive algae) outside a production environment where temperature, nutrient loads, salinity, and pH all can be optimized. People have expressed concerns regarding the release of genetically engineered microorganisms, ranging from impacts of large-scale releases (and failure of control mechanisms) on biodiversity to ecosystem and evolutionary processes (Hagedorn and Allender-Hagedorn, 1997). Other concerns regarding genetic technologies relate to the unnaturalness of organisms (Tenbult et al., 2005; Connor and Siegrist, 2011); these cannot be abated through technical mitigation. It is the public ""5 Environmental Effects."" National Research Council. 2012. Sustainable Development of Algal Biofuels in the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/13437. perception of risk, and not necessarily the scientific basis for risk, that will be preeminent in determining acceptability of genetically engineered algae to communities. Concerns over genetically engineered algae and perceptions of risks associated with introducing nonnative species into new geographies will need to be addressed. While concerns surrounding the use of genetically engineered algae for energy production are likely to be raised as the industry continues to develop, the United States remains one of the most accepting countries in the developed world in terms of the adoption rates of genetically engineered crops (USDA-ERS, 2011). In 2008, U.S. farmers planted more than 32 million acres of Monsanto’s “triple-stack” genetically engineered corn, and it is estimated that this number will increase to approximately 56 million acres by 2015 (Kaskey, 2009). Nonetheless, social acceptability of gene technology depends on the type of application. In one study, medical applications were perceived to be more beneficial, less hazardous, and more ethical than food applications (Frewer et al., 1995). In a Swiss study, lay people distinguished between acceptability of medical and non-medical applications of gene technology but not among agricultural, nutritional, and industrial applications (Connor and Siegrist, 2011). Further, prevailing concerns over the use of genetically engineered crops in the United States are related to human health and food safety rather than potential ecological risks (Kamaldeen and Powell, 2000). However, concerns about genetically engineered microorganisms in surveys and in the popular press have related more to environmental effects than to health or ethical issues (Hagedorn and Allender-Hagedorn, 1997), and these concerns might be expected to dominate for microalgae. Coproduct markets such as health supplements, food additives, and cosmetics could attract additional scrutiny from consumers. It is unknown whether the U.S. public may be more tolerant of the use of biofuels from genetically engineered algae as an energy source than if the crops were grown for food. Social acceptability of a new technology also depends on how a decision is framed. For example, Wolfe and Bjornstad (2003) suggested that options regarding the use of genetically engineered organisms for hazardous waste remediation likely would be presented in the context of multiple technology options. It is less likely that stakeholders evaluating the use of genetically engineered algae in their regions would be explicitly weighing the relative benefits and risks of different liquid fuels produced elsewhere. Social acceptability of gene technology depends on trust (Siegrist, 2000). Whether the public is more willing to accept the use of naturally occurring algal strains than those that have been genetically altered for maximum fuel production might depend on the engagement of managers of the facility, other stakeholders, and the public. Containment of genetically engineered algae might be desirable as a precaution against unknown effects and societal concerns. Physical containment of released algae will be difficult or impossible. Physical containment solutions, such as those proposed for vascular plants (for example, fences and border plants; Moon et al., 2010), are ineffective against released algae. Containment options might include using species that require saline water in freshwater environments or those that have a nutrient requirement that is not met outside of the photobioreactor or pond. The use of environment-dependent “molecular switches” has been proposed to increase the likelihood of community acceptance of genetically engineered crops (Chapotin and Wolt, 2007). Similarly, some modified traits could reduce fitness in natural environments. For example, reduced light harvesting antennae not only would increase growth in ponds but also would reduce the ability to compete with native algal ""5 Environmental Effects."" National Research Council. 2012. Sustainable Development of Algal Biofuels in the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/13437. species for light in natural waters (Sayre, 2011). Moreover, removing bicarbonate pumps, which increases fitness in the cultivation environment with high CO, could reduce the competitive ability to take up inorganic carbon in natural waters (Sayre, 2011). If algicides are used, they would be effective against non-target organisms. Terminator genes that cause released cells to die could be developed so that those genes would be suppressed in a photobioreactor but derepressed in natural environments (Sayre, 2011). If algal strains that cannot produce toxins are used, potential risk is minimized. If genetically engineered organisms are released, monitoring should be undertaken so that effects of particular organism-environment combinations can be better understood (Snow et al., 2005). Sustainability indicators for genetically engineered algae generally would be the same as indicators for native algae. That is, if effects of concern include biodiversity or water quality, appropriate metrics are described in those chapters. However, the sustainability goals for genetically engineered algae likely would include two other issues: •  Minimizing dissemination of genetically engineered algae. •  Establishing methods to determine whether an observed effect was caused by a genetically engineered alga. Abundance of genetically engineered algae released to water could be measured through species-specific tests if the species were not native. Moreover, some modified traits, such as altered antennae, might be detectable microscopically and thus quantifiable in water. Particular DNA sequences also might be detectable. Moreover, markers could be added to algae to allow easy measurement in specific media. The ecological risks of a release of genetically engineered microorganisms have to be carefully assessed before they are used in commercial-scale algal biofuel production. Whether there are plausible scenarios under which genetically engineered algae, or organisms that acquire genes from the genetically engineered algae, could proliferate to levels that might harm humans or the environment in some way needs to be examined. More information is needed on potential relationships between traits that are targets for modification and behavior of cyanobacteria or microalgae that could alter rates of release, survival, growth, transport, genetic exchange, and ecological or human health effects. Little research to date has been conducted in the United States on behavior of genetically engineered algae in open ponds, in part because EPA notification guidelines can lead to delays for researchers. Information is needed on the social acceptability of the use of genetically engineered algae for biofuels, particularly in open systems. Sustainability of a production process is enhanced by recycling raw materials and minimizing of waste. If the oil-extracted biomass is recycled or made into coproducts, a ""5 Environmental Effects."" National Research Council. 2012. Sustainable Development of Algal Biofuels in the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/13437. source of waste would be reduced or eliminated. Anaerobic digestion is another method of waste disposal and can generate electricity as a coproduct (). For the disposal of waste biomass, blow down of solids from production and recycling ponds, and saltwater, companies are considering landfilling waste, underground injection, and diverting processed water to sewage systems. Solid waste from algal biofuel manufacturing processes is most likely to be generated as sludge from an anaerobic digester from which the volatile organic acids have been converted to methane and CO; the methane is useful as a fuel supplement for the process. Anaerobic digestion in many cases is followed by aerobic digestion to convert dissolved solids to sludge, concentrated by settling in the large aerobic settlers. Such systems have been operated commercially for decades and most likely will be incorporated into algal biofuel production + concentrations of digested processes. Golueke et al. (1957) reported average NH sludge in the range of 1600 to 1850 milligrams per liter for anaerobic digestion of algae, which is comparable to some of the high values reported for piggery waste (Sukias and Tanner, 2005; Sukias and Craggs, 2011). Another source of solid waste is the spent synthetic plastic liner from open ponds or closed bioreactors that will need to be disposed periodically. According to Jim Sears (J. Sears, A2BE Carbon Capture, personal communication on September 22, 2011), who chaired the “Committee on Technical Standards” for the Algal Biomass Organization, “there are as many proposed processes for producing algal biofuels as there are companies.” Thus, whether generation of waste products would be a concern cannot be known until operations at commercial scale are in place and compositions can be ascertained. Maximizing recycling would reduce the need for waste product disposal. Recycling of nutrients is the obvious mitigation for waste generation. Algenol, an algal biofuel company, plans to recycle seawater waste for cultivation (less than 6 liters of seawater waste per liter of ethanol is produced if photobioreactors last greater than 6 years). If digested sludge is produced, municipal waste treatment plants usually spread the nutrient-rich waste on designated land, with the benefit of conditioning and nourishing the soil. Algal fuel process sludge from wastewater treatment is not expected to be significantly different. The National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permitting process governs discharge of sludge; most states have a permitting process under this federal program. The composition of the sludge is monitored to ensure compliance with the permit. Many sustainability indicators relevant to waste are described elsewhere, for example, quantifying recycling of nutrients and salinity of ground water. If saline wastewater is injected to groundwater, then sustainability indicators also could include annual volume injected per volume of reservoir per year. Information is needed about the types and rate of waste generation for most algal biofuel production processes. When and if processes move toward commercialization, state and local regulations will govern the acceptable disposal of waste, which will necessarily be well characterized by then.

Known toxin-producing strains are not likely to be used in algal biofuel production systems. Indeed, many species have food grade status or are being used as feed in aquaculture. However, some species regarded as benign may in fact produce toxins previously unknown. Examples of these include newly discovered euglenoid toxins (Zimba et al., 2010) and free radical toxins (Moeller et al., 2007). In addition, contaminating toxin-producing algae and cyanobacteria could potentially colonize production systems, especially open ponds. Human toxins that are produced by cyanobacteria have been found in freshwater, marine, and estuarine organisms and include hepatotoxins, cytotoxins, dermatotoxins, and neurotoxins among others (Smith et al., 2008). Ecotoxicity from algal toxins is observed in fish (Zimba et al., 2001b), shellfish (Lance et al., 2011), or invertebrate herbivores such as and shrimp (Zimba et al., 2006; Sarnelle, 2010). Toxins can affect viability, growth, and fecundity of many organisms (Plumley, 1997). The chemical structures of freshwater toxins are probably more diverse than those of marine toxins, including alkaloids, phosphate esters, macrolides, chlorinated diaryllactones, and penta- and hepta-peptides (Rouhiainen et al., 1995; Smith et al., 2008). Species of toxin-producing algae in the divisions Euglenophyceae, Bacillariophyceae, Dinophyceae, Haptophyceae, and Raphidophyceae have been documented. Some cyanobacteria also are producers of toxins and probably are responsible for the production of most freshwater algal toxins from harmful algal blooms (Plumley, 1997). Toxicity of some compounds can exceed that of curare (Zimba et al., 2001a). Irritants and allergens also are produced by certain algae. Toxin production in some cyanobacteria is influenced by environmental variables and competition (Moeller et al., 2007; Briand et al., 2008), though the physiological and ecological causes of toxin production are largely unknown (Paerl and Millie, 1996; Carrick, 2011). Harmful blooms of toxin-producing algae are not the sole source of algal toxins, nor are algal toxins always associated with blooms (Plumley, 1997). Moreover, blooms cannot be predicted with accuracy in natural environments (Carrick, 2011), and this likely applies to open biofuel cultivation systems as well. Both freshwater and marine forms of toxin-producing algae could colonize production systems. The current state of knowledge about phytoplankton community composition is not sufficient to predict whether toxin-producing strains could invade and bloom in algal biofuel production systems, even if these systems are seeded either initially or continuously with non-toxigenic algal strains. Compounds presently not known to be harmful because of their presence in low concentrations in small-scale, low-intensity algal biomass production may have harmful impacts when concentrated 100,000 times during the harvesting and drying phases. Concentrated cultivation methods may lead to the identification of previously unknown toxic material (Moeller et al., 2007; Zimba et al., 2010). If the lipid-extracted algae are to be used in value-added coproducts, the quality of those products would have to be monitored. The outdoor open-pond production systems likely will develop diverse algal populations (Smith et al., 2010). Monitoring algal composition is critical to maintaining desired ""5 Environmental Effects."" National Research Council. 2012. Sustainable Development of Algal Biofuels in the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/13437. characteristics for processing biomass to fuels, ensuring that coproducts from lipid-extracted algae are safe for use, and minimizing downstream effects of water-soluble toxins. 5.10.1.2 Human and Animal Pathogens in Algal Cultivation Systems Cultivated , and have been used to produce foodgrade products, and the presence of pathogens has not been a concern. However, algal production systems are diverse communities that may contain pathogens particularly if municipal wastewater, wastewater from concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs), biosolids (sewage sludge), or manures are used as water or nutrient supplies. Although the algal cultivation systems using wastewater are similar to the thousands of algal wastewater ponds in the United States, different occupational exposures might arise because the algal biomass being handled in algal biofuel production is larger in quantity (that is, higher sludge mass in algae cultivation for fuels than in algal wastewater pond) and higher in concentration (from harvesting and drying before processing to fuels). The density and probability of particular pathogens in wastewater is related to the level of treatment, with greater pathogen numbers and diversity in primary treated sewage than secondary treatment. Primary treatment is the sedimentation of solids, secondary treatment is the removal of suspended and dissolved organic materials, and tertiary treatment is the removal of inorganic constituents such as nitrogen and phosphorus. Biosolids (sewage sludge), for example, may include bacterial, viral, protozoan, or helminth pathogens (EPA, 2011b). In a study of mesophilic anaerobic digested biosolids from 18 locations in the United States, , , , , enteric viruses, and adenoviruses were detected, but and 0157:H7 were not. The original wastewater would be expected to contain at least these species. In another study of treated wastewater and biosolids in Michigan, adenovirus, enterovirus, and norovirus were detected in 100, 70, and 10 percent of samples, respectively (Simmons and Xagoraraki, 2011). The taxonomic identities and abundances of pathogens in biosolids (and by extension, wastewater) are determined by the incidence of infection within the wastewater-generating community and the particular wastewater treatment process used (Straub, 1993; EPA, 2011b). Survival of some pathogens from biosolids in soil has been studied (Zerzghi et al., 2009), but the survival of human and animal pathogens in algal biofuel cultures is only beginning to be investigated. Where pathogens are present in algal cultures, there could be occupational health effects or environmental effects (if release occurs). The presence of fecal coliforms or other pathogens would limit the options for coproducts. The key difference in pathways is that photobioreactors are less likely to be colonized by toxin-producing strains than open ponds (). Selecting strains known not to produce toxins will mitigate toxin concerns in closed systems and aid in mitigating toxin concerns for open systems, though toxins could be ""5 Environmental Effects.""

Genomic approaches could be used to screen for genes required for toxin synthesis in candidate algal strains for biofuel production (La Claire, 2006; Ianora et al., 2011). Periodic monitoring could ensure that wellknown toxins are not produced. Minimizing sources of human and animal pathogens in algal culture could include: •   A high level of treatment or sterilization of wastewater. For example, Phycal passes wastewater through a 0.2 micrometer filter prior to use and uses ultraviolet sterilization for initial treatment as well as treatment of recycled water. Reuse of wastewater for algal biofuel production could follow established wastewater reuse regulations. •   Using agricultural grade fertilizers (for example, Sapphire Energy, Inc.). •   Use of high-pH brines to reduce survival of pathogen competitors of cyanobacteria (for example, Phyco BioSciences). 5.10.4 Sustainability Indicators for Algal Toxins and Pathogens Indicators of sustainable development of algal biofuels include metrics of algal toxins and pathogens in water, which consist of concentrations of toxins in water, measures of toxic effects (for example, in animal models) that are diagnostic of particular toxins, or ""5 Environmental Effects."" National Research Council. 2012. Sustainable Development of Algal Biofuels in the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/13437. genetic markers of toxin production. Methods to distinguish some toxin-producing strains from other strains are available. For example, an oligonucleotide probe can distinguish hepatotoxic from neurotoxic and these strains from spp. (Rouhiainen et al., 1995). Information supporting genetic markers of toxin production is increasingly available, for example, a PCR-based test to assess the potential for microcystin occurrence (Nonneman and Zimba, 2002). However, these tests cannot identify unknown toxins, and they can give false-positive results where toxins are not expressed, for example, where multigene families are needed for arrangement (Zimba et al., 2010). Directly measuring all pathogens in algal culture media is not generally practical. Indicator species are often microorganisms that are nonpathogenic, abundant, and associated with the presence of a suite of pathogens (EPA, 2011b). For example, densities of fecal coliform and can be used as indicators for assessing the efficiency of wastewater treatment (40 CFR 136). These can be measured via culture methods or through quantitative polymerase chain reaction tests for fecal indicator bacteria that provide sameday information (Dorevitch et al., 2011). The abundance of fecal indicator bacteria can be related to disparate pathogens, such as protozoa (Dorevitch et al., 2011). However, typical indicator organisms are not useful in all media or for all pathogens. For example, Pepper et al. (2010) found that indicator organisms in Class B biosolids were not correlated with the numbers of pathogenic organisms. Criteria for selecting non-pathogen indicator organisms of pathogens in waters have been summarized by EPA (2011b), based on information in Gerba (2009) and NRC (2004). These include attributes of organisms and testing methods. Analytical methods for detecting low densities of pathogens have not been sufficiently developed and tested to be recommended (EPA, 2011b). Any potential indicators would have to be tested in algal ponds or photobioreactors for potential relationships with pathogen levels. Attributes of non-pathogen indicator organisms of pathogens in waters and attributes of methods for detecting pathogen indicator organisms are described in an EPA report Problem Formulation for Human Health Risk Assessment of Pathogens in Land-applied (EPA, 2011b). 5.11.1 Potential Environmental, Health, and Social Acceptability Effects Health effects from and social acceptability of algal biofuels could be affected if open ponds are poorly managed and provide habitats for mosquito larvae. Photobioreactors and raceways would not represent mosquito habitat unless there is substantial leakage of culture fluid, and puddles are formed. Mosquitoes lay their eggs opportunistically in standing water, which can vary from large lakes to small puddles or buckets. The full area of algae cultivation ponds would not be optimal habitat because of the required stirring and agitation for adequate mixing of nutrients and light exposure. Females of most mosquito species only infrequently lay eggs in flowing or agitated water (Lothrop and Mulla, 1996; Mogi and Motomura, 1996). Moreover, waters that are in motion can interfere with the surface tension required for mosquitoes’ respiratory siphons to function (Schober, 1966). However, any relatively still edges of open ponds (analogous to stream banks and floodplains along moving streams) and outlying puddles or open-water storage vessels would be suitable for the growth of mosquito larvae. Because algae constitute food for mosquito larvae, the high nutrient and carbon content of algal cultivation systems (when and where the water is relatively still) can be prime habitat (Rydzanicz and Lone, 2003). The turbidity ""5 Environmental Effects."" National Research Council. 2012. Sustainable Development of Algal Biofuels in the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/13437. of some cultivation systems would provide refuges from visual predators (Jacob et al., 2008; Jackson et al., 2009). Fewer mosquito species can tolerate saline conditions than fresh water (Patrick and Bradley, 2000), but some species can tolerate salinities of 100 percent sea water (Grueber and Bradley, 1994). Providing habitat for mosquitoes could be a concern for human health and the acceptability of algal biofuel production for several reasons including: •   Mosquitoes are considered a pest and a nuisance that may not be tolerated by people living near a cultivation facility. Communities near proposed constructed wetland sites sometimes object to siting based on the anticipation of a mosquito problem (Anderson et al., 2007). •   Mosquitoes are vectors for numerous human infectious diseases in the United States, such as Eastern equine encephalitis, La Crosse encephalitis, St. Louis encephalitis, West Nile virus, Western equine encephalitis, and Dengue fever (recently reported in Florida). West Nile virus is also hypothesized to be a factor in the decline of sage grouse (Naugle et al., 2004). •   If the ponds for algae cultivation become breeding grounds for mosquitoes, there is a risk that the larvae will become a pest, reducing algal population densities below economically productive levels through predation. Measures could be taken to control mosquito and other pest populations in and around algae cultivation ponds. The extensive use of agitators, aerators, and fountains decrease the suitability of open ponds for mosquito habitat (Jackson et al., 2009) and distribute nutrients and algae in the system. If standing water at cultivation facilities is minimized, mosquitoes and associated health effects should not be a problem. Other mitigation options include site-specific surveys that can inform mosquito management agencies regarding the timing, species, and abundance of mosquitoes to develop disease-reduction plans (Anderson et al., 2007). Control options include chemical treatments like insecticides and biological methods such as the introduction of natural predators such as mosquitofish that consume mosquito larvae. If some of these measures are used without prior consultation and acceptance by the public, or if it is perceived that a population control method poses a threat to the human health or well-being, local communities might not accept algae production as a viable source of energy. The sustainability indicators for mosquito-borne diseases are density of mosquito larvae in ponds and changes in incidence of mosquito-borne diseases attributable to cultivation ponds. Reducing GHG emissions from the transportation sector has been one of the primary motivations for using alternative liquid transportation fuels. Therefore, the life-cycle GHG emissions are key factors in considering the sustainable development of algal biofuels. Published estimates of GHG emissions span a wide range, with some studies suggesting that algal biofuel production has high GHG emissions. The utility of these LCAs is that they point out key drivers of CO emissions in the algal biofuel supply chains and indicate ""5 Environmental Effects."" National Research Council. 2012. Sustainable Development of Algal Biofuels in the United States. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/13437. the aspects or processes that could benefit from research and development for improving GHG emissions. Some concerns of medium importance to consider include: •   The presence of waterborne toxicants or pathogens in algal cultivation systems if waste streams (flue gas or wastewater) are to be used as sources of nutrients or water. Their presence would affect occupational safety and the safety of coproducts if the residual algal biomass is used to produce certain coproducts to maximize recycling and to improve process economics. •   Effects from land-use changes if pasture and rangeland are to be converted to algae cultivation. Displacing pasture and rangeland could incur direct and indirect landuse changes that would affect the net GHG emissions of algal biofuels. •   Air quality emissions over the life cycle of algal biofuels. Emissions from the pro-cessing facilities and tailpipe emissions will be regulated, but emissions from other parts of the supply chain also need to be considered. The committee is not aware of any published studies that include measured emissions of air pollutants from open-pond cultivation. •   Potential effects on local climate. The introduction of large-scale algal cultivation systems in arid or semi-arid environments could alter the local climate of the area by increasing humidity and altering temperature extremes. •   Releases of cultivated algae to natural environments and potential alteration of species composition in receiving waters. •   Effects on terrestrial biodiversity from changing landscape pattern as a result of infrastructure development for algal biofuels. •   Potential adverse effects and unintended consequences of introduction of genetically engineered algae for biofuel production. •   Waste products from processing algae to fuels. This chapter discussed the potential environmental effects of algal biofuel production. Some of those effects require assessment and monitoring to ensure that they do not pose serious sustainability concerns (for example, potential land conversion, air emissions, effects on biodiversity, waste products from algal biofuel production systems, and potential presence of pathogens and unknown or unidentified toxins). Other environmental effects discussed could be avoided with proper management and good engineering designs (for example, release of culture water leading to eutrophication, seepage of culture water into local ground water, and habitats for mosquito larvae). Algal biofuels have the potential to contribute to improving the sustainability of the transportation sector, but the potential is not yet realized. Additional innovations that require research and development are needed to realize the full potential of algal biofuels. (See and for biological and engineering innovations needed and for resource recycling.) Engineering solutions to enhance algae cultivation, to facilitate biomass or product collection, and to improve processing of algae-derived fuels can increase the EROI and reduce the GHG emissions of algal biofuel production.

Biofuels made from algae are gaining attention as a domestic source of renewable fuel. However, with current technologies, scaling up production of algal biofuels to meet even 5 percent of U.S. transportation fuel needs could create unsustainable demands for energy, water, and nutrient resources. Continued research and development could yield innovations to address these challenges, but determining if algal biofuel is a viable fuel alternative will involve comparing the environmental, economic and social impacts of algal biofuel production and use to those associated with petroleum-based fuels and other fuel sources. was produced at the request of the U.S. Department of Energy. 6 A Framework to Assess Sustainable Development of Algal Biofuels Appendix A: Biographical Sketches of Committee Members Appendix G: Economics of Coproduct Production from Large-Scale Algal Biofuels Systems You're looking at OpenBook, NAP.edu's online reading room since 1999.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Aviation has a long and successful record of improving operational performance and fuel efficiency over time and is now seeking to reduce its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and offset emissions that may result from growing demand for air travel. U.S. and international airlines have committed to reducing lifecycle CO2 emissions from aircraft operations. The primary means for reducing these emissions is using alternative jet fuels produced from non-petroleum sources, referred to as sustainable alternative jet fuels (SAJF). The aviation industry uses an ASTM International specification standard (ASTM D7566) to define alternative fuels that have been approved by the industry as being safe for use in commercial aircraft. To date, five different fuel production pathways have been defined. Table ES-1 summarizes those fuels as well as the number of reports in the literature that evaluated emissions from testing of those synthesized fuels. The industry is presently reviewing additional alternative jet fuel production pathways, which may add new qualified fuels to this list in the future. Figure ES-1 summarizes those fuels and Section 2 of the report defines them in more detail.

All rights reserved. While the primary purpose for airlines to use SAJF is to reduce CO2 emissions, emissions of other pollutants may also be reduced, which could be significantly beneficial to airports. However, these reductions are not yet well defined, leaving airports unable to realize what may be substantial benefits. The research team team analyzed the published technical literature to validate that SAJF use does reduce air pollutant emissions (i.e., PM2.5, SOx, CO, UHC, NOx) and does not cause any of them to increase. Table ES-2 summarizes the body of literature that was screened to identify essential reports that include quantitative data on results from emissions testing of SAJF. The data in these reports was analyzed in detail to define the impact of using SAJF on air pollutants of interest to airports. The summarization of these reports and their emissions data shows that SAJF, when blended with conventional jet fuel as defined in D7566, significantly reduces SOx and PM, generally reduces CO and UHC emissions, and minimally reduces or has no effect on NOx emissions. Figure ES-2 summarizes the impact of SAJF on aircraft emissions. This report describes why these findings are expected based on an understanding of the mechanisms of pollutant production when burning jet fuel in aircraft engines and how this is repeatedly confirmed by the data collected from numerous tests and measurement campaigns. Following this Executive Summary, Section 2 provides a discussion of the scope of this report including emission testing campaigns, SAJF production and approved fuels, and pollutant species. Section 3 provides information on the source of the different pollutant species that result from fuel combustion. Section 4 describes the knowledge gaps in the current literature and testing to date. Section 5 is an annotated bibliography that highlights key findings from several reports, which influenced the findings of this literature survey. Section 6 includes a complete reference list, and Section 7 is an appendix, which summarizes the impacts of alternative fuels on the emissions of SOx, PM2.5, CO, UHC, NOx, and HAP from individual reports.

BACKGROUND This State of the Industry report is a âreference documentâ that captures the current status of knowledge regarding emissions from the use of sustainable alternative jet fuels (SAJF). The research team conducted a review of available research, literature, and measurement campaigns to enhance our current understanding of the local air quality emissions benefits and impacts of SAJF as well as SAJF blends relative to conventional jet fuel. We drilled down into the data and extracted and analyzed the essential emissions testing data to quantify typical emissions impacts of SAJF use. The review results are focused specifically on air quality emissions of criteria pollutants from SAJF. The report also includes an analysis of gaps in our current understanding of the production of pollutants from SAJF. 2.1. TEST CAMPAIGNS Department of Defense (DoD) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) have been primarily responsible for most of the SAJF testing to date. DoD conducted tests on many of the different aircraft they operate to qualify their use of SAJF. NASA has been conducting research on aircraft engine emissions to evaluate their environmental impact for several years. Many of these research programs included DoD research labs, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) experts, aircraft and engine manufacturers, universities, and scientific experts. Some of the more significant test programs were: â¢ APEX, September 2006 â¢ AAFEX-I, January 2009 â¢ AAFEX-II, March 2011 â¢ ACCESS-I, February-April, 2013 â¢ ACCESS-II, May, 2014 Much of the literature reviewed in this report comes from reports on these projects or analyses of the data produced during these projects. 2.2. AIRCRAFT ENGINES Todayâs commercial and military aircraft rely on modern, high-efficiency, sophisticated turbine engines to deliver the safety, operability, and efficiency demanded from the sector. Additionally, auxiliary power units (APU) are smaller turbine engines utilizing similar design principles which also perform consistently and reliably. Aircraft main engines and APUs were the primary test beds for SAJF emissions testing. The various testing campaigns showed that emissions testing on a given engine could produce repeatable and consistent results for any given fuel. However, engine to engine differences are significant. The age/pedigree of the engine, time since last overhaul, and cleanliness of fuel components, such as nozzles, can affect combustion and consequently emissions. For a series of tests performed on a given engine, the changes in emissions will be a reflection of the thrust setting (i.e., fuel flow) and fuel composition. In general, fuel chemistry has a much greater impact on emissions than the difference among engines. The relationship between fuel composition and emissions is discussed below. The emissions tests conducted in the reports included in this literature review were performed at various engine thrust settings intended to reflect an aircraftâs main engine performance. The basis for selecting specific thrust settings correlates with the landing-and-takeoff (LTO) cycle as defined by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and used for engine certification testing. As a general representation, taxiing aircraft use low thrust (4%). Full thrust (100%) is used to represent takeoff as the aircraft comes up to speed quickly to get off the ground. Once in the air, the thrust is reduced somewhat (85%) as the aircraft climbs to cruise altitude. A thrust setting of 30% is representative of the thrust an aircraft uses on approach to landing. These thrust settings are commonly used for emissions testing although in actual operation, thrust settings vary and typically are lower than these values. In a similar way, tests conducted on APUs use three power settings â âno loadâ or âready-to-load,â environmental control system, and âmaximum loadâ or âmain engine start,â which reflect in-use APU thrust settings. The no load setting is equivalent to idle on aircraft main engines. The environmental control system setting is an intermediate power setting used when the APU is providing secondary electric power and ventilation to an aircraft parked at the gate. The main engine start setting is a high-power setting used when starting the aircraft main engines. Aircraft main engines are designed to operate most efficiently at cruise power since the majority of fuel use is during cruise. Lower power operation, such as for idling and taxiing, is less efficient from a fuel combustion standpoint. As a result, emission species that reflect engine efficiency, notably CO and UHC, are higher per unit of fuel consumed at low power operation and lower at high power operation. Conversely, NOx emissions, which State of the Industry Report on Air Quality Emissions from Sustainable Alternative Jet Fuels opyright ational cade y of ciences. ll rights reserved. 7 State of the Industry Report on Air Quality Emissions from Sustainable Alternative Jet Fuels Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved. are produced at high temperature, are higher at high thrust and lower at low thrust. Similarly, with an APU, CO and UHC emissions are higher at the âno loadâ setting and lower at âmaximum loadâ while the reverse is true for NOx. 2.3. CONVENTIONAL JET FUEL Various emissions tests of jet fuel, SAJF, and blends of the two are evaluated in this literature review. Different research groups used different jet fuels in their experiments, which usually reflected the most readily available conventional jet fuel. The different fuels, based on different fuel specifications, however, are very similar. The Jet A specification is used commercially throughout the U.S. and generally not available outside of the country. Jet A-1 specification fuel, which is used outside the U.S., is very similar to Jet A with the primary difference being a slightly lower freeze point for Jet A-1. The U.S. military formerly used JP-8 jet fuel, which is very similar to Jet A-1 but includes a static dissipater, corrosion inhibitor, and anti-icing additives. They have recently changed to Jet A-1 with those additives. The combustion of these three fuels is very similar from an emissions standpoint and for the purpose of this report they are assumed to be equivalent. 2.4. SYNTHETIC FUELS ASTM International, an international standard setting organization, maintains a standard specification D1655 for aviation turbine fuels, referred to as conventional jet fuel. The organization also is responsible for establishing specifications for synthetic blending components, designated D7566. While most of the reports reviewed for this investigation used alternative fuels that would meet D7566, some of the fuels would not meet this specification (even though these studies were conducted prior to publication of the D7566 specification). These include fatty acid methyl ethers (FAME) and ethanol, which are both oxygenated compounds. These emission studies provided useful data illustrating the relationship of fuel composition and emissions. Also, the D7566 specification does not address the sustainability of the fuel per se. Generally, the sustainability of any alternative jet fuel production depends not only on the source of the hydrocarbons used to produce the fuel, but many other measures of societal acceptability associated with the fuelâs production, including economic, environmental, and social factors. Fuel produced from coal, petroleum, or natural gas feedstocks is not considered sustainable, as the feedstocks are fundamentally not renewable. Fuel produced from renewable biological feedstocks (e.g., plant-derived oils, agricultural wastes, forestry residues) or recycled carbonaceous sources (e.g., municipal solid waste, industrial off-gases, atmospheric CO2)), might be considered as meeting the minimum threshold for consideration of sustainability. However, being renewable or recyclable is not a sufficient criterion, and other aspects of societal impact must be evaluated to entitle such fuels as âsustainable.â Determining the sustainability of a given fuel type or production lot is often complex and beyond the scope of this report, but information exists that shows that there are examples of fuels being able to be sustainably produced per the definitions in ASTM D7566 annexes. To date, the aviation industry has added five annexes to D7566 for producing different synthetic blending components. Fuels produced according to these annexes are referred to in this report as sustainable alternative jet fuels (SAJF). 1. Fischer-Tropsch Hydroprocessed Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene (FT-SPK), uses a synthesis gas feedstock, produced by thermally converting hydrocarbon State of the Industry Report on Air Quality Emissions from Sustainable Alternative Jet Fuels opyright ational cade y of ciences. ll rights reserved. 8 State of the Industry Report on Air Quality Emissions from Sustainable Alternative Jet Fuels Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved. materials, which can include various sources of renewable biomass such as municipal solid waste, agricultural wastes, forest wastes, wood, and energy crops. Synthesis gas (CO and H2) is then converted employing catalytic processes in a Fischer-Tropsch (FT) reactor into liquid hydrocarbons such as diesel or jet fuel. FT-SPK must be blended with conventional jet fuel at levels up to 50%. 2. Synthesized Paraffinic Kerosene from Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA-SPK) is produced by reacting an oil or fat-based feedstock, such as fats and oils derived from vegetables, animals, or waste oil, with hydrogen. HEFA-SPK can be blended with conventional jet fuel up to 50%. 3. Synthesized Iso-Paraffins produced from Hydroprocessed Fermented Sugars (HFS-SIP), are produced by hydroprocessing and fractionation of synthetic hydrocarbons derived from the fermentation of plant-based sugars such as sugar, corn, or forest wastes, to produce farnesene, a 15-carbon hydrocarbon molecule. HFS-SIP must be blended with conventional jet fuel, at levels up to 10%. 4. Synthesized Kerosene with Aromatics Derived by Alkylation of Light Aromatics from Non-Petroleum Sources (SPK/A), includes aromatics that can possibly reach higher blend rates than other synthetic fuels. A minimum of 8% aromatics is required in SAJF blends to ensure sufficient seal swell as a way to prevent fuel system leaks. According to the ASTM D7566 specification, the SPK/A synthetic blending component shall be comprised of FT-SPK combined with synthesized aromatics from the alkylation of non- petroleum derived light aromatics, primarily benzene. These fuels must be blended with conventional jet fuel, at levels up to 50%. 5. Alcohol-to-Jet Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene (ATJ-SPK) is produced from alcohols that have been produced from fermentable sugars which in turn have been produced from renewable feedstocks such as sugar, corn, or industrial or forest wastes. ATJ-SPK to be blended with conventional jet fuel, at levels up to 30% (although as of this writing, an effort is underway to increase the maximum blending level to a higher 50%). Several other fuel production pathways are currently being evaluated under ASTM D7566 for approval as blending components. At the time of this report, the following fuels are in the approval process: 1. HDO-SAK â A bioforming process that converts aqueous carbohydrate solutions into a mixture of aromatic hydrocarbons via a process described as HydroDeOxygenation. 2. Catalytic Hydrothermolysis Jet (CHJ) â A two- step process of catalytic hydrothermolysis and hydroprocessing where bio-oils are converted to hydrocarbons in the jet fuel range using water (under high temperature and pressure) as a catalyst. Alkylation produces aromatics so it is possible the fuel could be used without the need for blending. 3. FHP-HEFA â High Freeze Point HEFA (aka Green Diesel, or HEFA+), is using hydrogenation-derived renewable diesel as a blending agent with jet fuel. 2.5. SUSTAINABLE ALTERNATIVE JET FUEL PRODUCTION The five SAJF approved by the industry in ASTM D7566 each follow a different production process beginning with somewhat different feedstocks, however, the resulting fuel when blended with conventional jet fuel meets the specification for conventional jet fuel. Fuels produced from non-sustainable feedstocks such as coal, petroleum, or natural gas can also meet the ASTM specifications under Annex 1 and perform identically to conventional jet fuel. Some of the emissions testing evaluated for this report were conducted on GTL (gas-to-liquid) fuels. Because they meet the D7566 specification, their emissions performance is equivalent to SAJF and a valid source of data for this analysis. Hydroprocessing is an important step in producing jet fuels, both conventional and SAJF. In refineries producing conventional jet fuel, one of the final steps is treating the fuel with hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst. The hydrogen reacts with sulfur, nitrogen, and other unwanted elements (heteroatoms) present in the fuel to reduce impurities required by internationally accepted fuel specifications. Hydroprocessing at the refinery reduces, rather than eliminates, these components to ensure they are below the allowable limits. Hydroprocessing is also the final step in the five SAJF production pathways approved to date. It is an important step in producing HEFA-SPK fuels to remove oxygen from feedstocks (i.e., deoxygenate). This is typical for feedstocks containing triglycerides such as animal fats and oils from soybeans, palm, algae, jatropha, and other oily plants. In all five SAJF production processes, hydroprocessing essentially removes all sulfur and heteroatoms that may be present.

Two of the reports use the chemical class âaldehydesâ as a surrogate for HAPs and one report measures formaldehyde (HCHO) as a representative of all aldehydes. This has proven to be reasonable in prior research as indicative of that component of the emissions. Formaldehyde is commonly the most prevalent aldehyde in aircraft engine emissions and the proportion of formaldehyde to the other hydrocarbons in the emissions remains consistent at different emission rates. PM (particulate matter), often referred to as soot, means nvPM (non-volatile PM) when used in this report. Some studies measured PM2.5, which is non-volatile PM smaller than 2.5 micrometers in diameter and is the regulated size classification of PM. Aircraft engine emissions of nvPM are even smaller, in the PM1.0 and smaller range. For the purpose of this report, these terms are assumed to be equivalent. 2.7. REPORT IDENTIFICATION The research team team collected, reviewed, and compiled data from research reports from all aircraft engine emission tests of SAJF and related research projects. This includes testing sponsored by DoD, NASA, FAA, aircraft and engine Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), fuel producers, and other organizations. Missouri University of Science & Technology (MS&T) technical library database, the open Internet, and frequently cited reports were searched to identify the reports in this literature survey. The collected information includes university and government publications, briefings, and other technical reports. Table 1 shows how the universe of reports was reduced to just the reports pertinent for this study. An analysis of these reports and data shows that SAJF, when blended with conventional jet fuel, significantly reduces SOx and PM, generally reduces CO and UHC emissions, and minimally reduces or has no effect on NOx emissions. The variability in emissions data will molecular weight hydrocarbon compounds into straight chain compounds (normal paraffins or n-paraffins). Finally, distillation separates the primary fuel components from lighter and heavier molecules to leave a fuel stream comprised mostly of molecules containing 8-18 carbon atoms. Some branched molecules (iso-paraffins) are present. One significant result of this process is that the synthetic fuels have a higher hydrogen content and higher energy mass density compared to conventional jet fuel. As the volumetric energy density goes up with increased hydrogen content, the mass of fuel used decreases. An indication of the changes to the fuel properties was that frequently during test campaigns, fuel flow and shaft speeds decreased with increasing SAJF blend percentage. These changes are consistent with higher energy mass density of the alternative fuels, which result in a constant energy input with lower fuel mass flow. Higher heating value (BTU/lbm) leads to lower fuel burn and reduced emissions on a mass basis. This improves fuel efficiency and reduces emissions. 2.6.

This report describes why these findings are expected based on analysis of the mechanisms of pollutant production when burning jet fuel in aircraft engines and how this is repeatedly confirmed by the data collected from numerous tests and measurement campaigns. 3. POLLUTANT EMISSIONS This section summarizes the findings of the impact of SAJF use on the pollutants of interest. It is an evaluation of the body of literature on SAJF emissions testing. Since we are in the early stages of SAJF production, fuels from only a few different production pathways have been tested. However, the fuels tested meet the D7566 specification so their emissions performance is expected to be an excellent indicator of the emissions performance of predominantly paraffinic fuels produced by future production pathways. 3.1. CO2 AND H2O CO2 and H2O are the primary products of hydrocarbon- based fuel combustion (>99%) and the relative proportion of each species is defined by the H/C ratio of a given fuel. SAJFs typically are found to have higher H/C ratios than conventional fuels (~1%), largely due to the additional hydroprocessing, which is the final step in most fuel production processes. 3.2. SOX SOx emissions are produced by the oxidation of sulfur present in the fuel, and emissions levels are directly proportional to the fuel sulfur content. Typically, the sulfur content in SAJFs is very low (< 0.003%wt) and in the case of blends of SAJFs with conventional fuels the sulfur content is dominated by the level of sulfur in the conventional jet fuel component of the blend (Corporan 2010, Stratton, Corporan 2012, Moses 2008). For conventional jet fuels, typical sulfur levels of 0.3%wt are reported. In Beyersdorf, the authors report the use of pure FT fuels resulted in EISO2 reductions of greater than 90%, and intermediate reductions for blends. Table A.1: Alternative Fuel Impact on SOx Emissions in the Appendix summarizes the SOx emission impacts reported in the literature reviewed for this project. 3.3. PM2.5 PM2.5 as defined in the U.S. National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), is a regulatory standard for the criteria pollutant described as fine particulate matter and is based on measuring the mass of the particles with diameters <2.5 micrometers. Particulate matter directly emitted from jet engines and detected at the engine exit plane falls into this category, however, these particles typically have diameters that range in the 10 to 100 nanometers (a nanometer is one thousand times smaller than a micrometer). These particles are the products of incomplete combustion within the engineâs combustor and are largely carbonaceous. The non-carbonaceous particles, referred to as volatile particles, are typically heavy hydrocarbons. The carbonaceous particles are often referred to as non-volatile particulate matter (nvPM) and sometime referred to as soot. They are found to vary monotonically with the aromatic content of the fuel. Suitable metrics for nvPM emissions are (1) the number-based emission index (EIn), which is the number of particles generated per kg of fuel burned, and (2) the mass-based emissions index (EIm), which is the mass of particulate matter generated per kg of fuel burned. The NAAQS is a mass-based regulation. The U.S. does not regulate for particle number emissions, however particle number may be more important for evaluating the health effects of particle emissions, therefore, Eln has attracted more interest recently. Changes in EIn ranged from -22 to -99% (Christy 2015, Timko, Andersen 2011, Dally, Moore, Christy 2017, Chen, Shila, Chan, Colker, Byersdorf, Li 2013, Cain, Huang, Moore, Lobo 2011, Corporan 2010). Changes in EIm ranged from -20 to -95% (Christy 2015, Timko, Andersen 2011, Dally, Moore, Christy 2017, Shila, Chan, Colker, Beyersdorf, Li 2013, Cain, Lobo 2011). And changes in GMD (geometric mean diameter) ranged from -2 to +16% for FAME (Lobo 2011, Timko) and from -12 to +1% for 100% FT and 50% blend (Lobo 2011). Similar reductions were observed but not quantified for SPK (Cain), FT coal (Vander Wal, Timko), and biofuels (Chen). Chen analyzed for sulfate ions present in the nvPM component of the exhaust and found them to be the dominant particle-bound anion. Chen also found them to be reduced in concentration for the range of alternative fuels studied compared to conventional jet fuel. Table A.2: Alternative Fuel Impact on PM2.5 Emissions in the Appendix summarizes the PM emission impacts reported in the literature reviewed for this project.

All rights reserved. 3.4. CO CO emissions are the product of incomplete combustion. They are quantitatively dependent on engine type, engine combustor technology, and engine combustion efficiency. Factors that influence the production of CO include fuel air ratio, fuel injection/atomization/mixing, combustor inlet conditions, and engine power settings. The net result being that, independent of fuel type burned, for a given engine type, CO emissions are found to decrease with increasing engine power setting since at low power engines operate less efficiently (Boeing). Fuels with higher hydrogen/carbon (H/C) ratios yield greater combustion efficiency and lower CO emissions and therefore modest reductions in CO emissions are observed when SAJFs with higher H/C ratios (10-25% Corpran 2011, Boeing) are compared with conventional fuels (Corpran 2010, Timko, Carter 2011, Corpran 2012, Christy 2015, Andersen 2011). In contrast to the generally observed reductions in CO emissions, for the case of SIP fuels no significant changes in CO were observed when compared to conventional fuels (Roland), and in the case of AATJ-SPK fuels CO was observed to increase compared to conventional fuels for low engine power settings (Edwards). Table A.3: Alternative Fuel Impact on CO Emissions in the Appendix summarizes the CO emission impacts reported in the literature reviewed for this project. 3.5. UHC UHC emissions are the products of incomplete combustion. Factors governing UHC emissions include engine type, combustion efficiency and associated parameters such as combustor temperature and pressure, engine power setting, and the H/C ratio of the fuel. Incomplete combustion can result in both cracking and partial combustion of the fuel. Both processes result in the formation of species not present in the original fuel composition. In seven studies using four engines and three combustor rigs and a range of alternative fuels, changes in UHC emissions appeared to be both engine/ combustor rig and fuel specific, sometimes decreasing (Cain, Beyersdorf, Chen, Li 2013), and in some cases no change was observed (Corporan 2010, Altaher, Chi). Table A.4: Alternative Fuel Impact on UHC Emissions in the Appendix summarizes the UHC emission impacts reported in the literature reviewed for this project.

All rights reserved. 3.6. NOX NOx emissions arise from the oxidation of nitrogen in the combustor. The primary source of nitrogen in the combustor is that which is present in the combustion air flow. Compared to this atmospheric source, nitrogen chemically bound in the fuel is not considered a significant source of engine NOx emissions. Factors affecting NOx emissions include flame temperature, flame residence time, fuel air ratio, combustor inlet conditions, engine power settings, humidity, ambient temperature, and fuel hydrogen content. Since thermal NOx is not specifically related to fuel composition, it is instead very similar between conventional jet fuel and SAJF. The increased H/C ratio in SAJF noted previously can produce small reductions in NOx emissions due to the lower mass of fuel burned and may also increase the rate of NOx creation due to higher combustion temperature. The evidence that fuel composition indirectly affects NOx emissions is mostly reported to be small, less than 10% (Wey, Li 2013, Cain, Corporan 2010, Bhagwan, Colker, Chan, Chi, Rahmes, Corpran 2010, Andersen 2011, Corpran 2011, TImko, Boeing, Carter 2011, Stratton, Corpran 2012, Del Rosario, Roland, Andersen 2015, Christy 2015, Edwards). The exception was from a study of biofuels by Chen where reductions in NOx of up to 70% were observed. However this study evaluated several oxygenated fuels including ethanol, which resulted in lower combustion temperature for these blends. Among all of the tests specifically reporting NOx emissions, 25 of 45 showed no change in NOx emissions, 9 showed NOx reductions of less than 10%, 7 showed NOx emissions either slightly up or slightly down depending on engine power setting, 2 showed NOx increases of 5% or less, and, as mentioned, 1 showed a 70% reduction. Table A.5: Alternative Fuel Impact on NOx Emissions in the Appendix summarizes the NOx emission impacts reported in the literature reviewed for this project. 3.7. HAP Hazardous air pollutants (HAP) are volatile organic compounds (VOC) found in the UHC component of aircraft exhaust emissions. ICAO reported some examples of HAPs that have been identified as representative pollutants from airport sources including formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acrolein, 1,3-butadiene, benzene, naphthalene, toluene, xylene and propionaldehyde (ICAO). These compounds play an important role in atmospheric chemistry and urban air quality (ICAO, Leikauf, Koenig) and have major health concerns (Li 2014). Studies concerning the impact of alternate fuels on HAP emissions are extremely limited. Four alternate fuels and their blends with Jet A-1 were studied by Li et al. using an APU as the emissions source. Overall, all four alternate fuels/blends showed equivalent (two HEFA blends) or lower aldehyde emissions (FAE blend) compared to Jet A-1. Formaldehyde appeared to be the dominant aldehyde species (Li 2014). In similar studies by Corporan (Corporan 2012) and Timko discussing the limit of uncertainty for HAPs measurements, no significant differences in HAPs production are seen for the alternate fuels studied. Table A.6: Alternative Fuel Impact on HAP Emissions in the Appendix summarizes the HAP emission impacts reported in the literature reviewed for this project. 4. KNOWLEDGE GAPS As noted in earlier sections of this report, there have been several emissions tests conducted to evaluate the performance of SAJF as well as to measure their emissions. The emissions testing was primarily focused on evaluating emissions of nvPM, however, many of the testing programs also recorded emissions of other criteria pollutants. In light of the evolution of SAJF development, the emissions testing was not systematic or extensive. However, the SAJF tested met the D7566 specification and when blended, the tested fuels met the commercial jet fuel specification D1655. As a result, the emissions performance should be representative of SAJF more broadly. Tests were conducted on a variety of engines ranging from auxiliary power units to commercial aircraft main engines as well as several military aircraft engines. Also, as noted earlier, different fuels produced from different feedstocks were used for blending which may have some (probably minor) effect on emissions. The result is a limited data set to be used for evaluating emissions performance across a range of engines, power settings, pollutant species, and blend percentages. A limited data set results in larger error bars and more limited confidence in the relationship between SAJF composition engine emissions. 4.1. SCOPE OF TESTING Table 2 shows the range of engines tested on different fuels. As noted earlier, emissions testing on a given engine could produce repeatable and consistent results for any given fuel. Engine to engine differences, however, are State of the Industry Report on Air Quality Emissions from Sustainable Alternative Jet Fuels opyright ational cade y of ciences. ll rights reserved. 13 State of the Industry Report on Air Quality Emissions from Sustainable Alternative Jet Fuels Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

All rights reserved. significant. The age of an engine, time since last overhaul, and cleanliness of fuel components, such as nozzles, can affect combustion and consequently emissions. This is even significant for engines of the same type and model number. This presents a challenge in comparing emissions data across multiple tests, hence the need for more systematic testing to refine the results. 4.2. SOX As noted in Section 2, SOx emissions are proportional to the sulfur content of the fuel. However, not all sulfur is emitted as SOx. Some sulfur is retained on the soot particles that make up a large component of nvPM, and there are some aerosol particles that contain sulfur. It would be very useful if researchers could partition sulfur in fuel into SOx, aerosol, and nvPM. While in general, fuel sulfur content is proportional to SOx it is not possible to complete a material balance without knowing where all sulfur emissions go. This is not essential for understanding the air quality impacts of SAJF per se but is important for understanding and tracking the fate of the fuel sulfur. 4.3. PM Significant reductions in PM emissions as a result of using SAJF blends are a positive outcome. For that reason it would be beneficial to more carefully/specifically relate the number based emission index (EIn) (the number of particles generated per kg of fuel burned), and the mass based emissions index (EIm) (the mass of particles generated per kg of fuel burned), to engine thrust to better quantify the overall benefits. Also, since PM emissions are found to vary monotonically with the aromatic content of the fuel, this relationship should be quantified. Additionally, more detailed study of the relationship between PM emissions and the concentration of naphthalene as a share of total aromatics in the fuel is needed. Naphthalene appears to play an outsized role in the production of nvPM emissions from aircraft engines. 4.4. CO Only modest changes are seen in CO emissions between conventional jet fuel and SAJF. They are largely related to engine design and operating conditions. However, the H/C ratio in the fuel influences combustion efficiency. SAJF often have a slightly higher H/C ratio compared to conventional jet fuel as a result of the hydrotreating of the fuel as one of the final steps in most SAJF processing, or due to a higher overall percentage of paraffins and iso-paraffins versus cyclo-paraffins and aromatics. Since the differences are small, the resulting impact on CO emissions is generally small. Specific testing to identify these changes is needed to more carefully relate CO emissions to H/C fuel ratio. Also, since CO emissions are higher at low power due to engines being less efficient at low power, testing should focus on lower power operations, although testing at multiple thrust levels (7%, 30%, 85%, and 100%) is recommended. 4.5. UHC Similar to CO, UHC emissions are related to engine efficiency and are higher at low power since engines are designed to maximize efficiency at high power when engines consume the most fuel. H/C ratio in the fuel influences combustion efficiency. SAJF often have a slightly higher H/C ratio compared to conventional jet fuel as a result of the hydrotreating of the fuel as one of the final steps in most SAJF processing, or due to a higher overall percentage of paraffins and iso-paraffins versus cyclo-paraffins and aromatics. Since the differences are small, the resulting impact on UHC emissions are generally small. Specific testing to identify these changes is needed to more carefully relate UHC emissions to H/C fuel ratio. Also, UHC emissions are higher at low power since engines are less efficient at low power so this testing should focus on lower power testing although testing at multiple thrust levels (7%, 30%, 85%, and 100%) is recommended. 4.6. NOX As noted in Section 3, NOx emissions reflect flame temperature, flame residence time, fuel air ratio, combustor inlet conditions, engine power settings, humidity, ambient temperature, and fuel hydrogen content. Thus, compared to conventional jet fuel, only minor changes in NOx emissions have been detected in SAJF testing and most commonly there has been no change that resulted from increasing the SAJF blend percentage. Because the differences in emissions are small, thorough testing is needed to evaluate NOx emissions, being careful to repeat the same engine conditions (e.g., fuel air ratio, humidity, and ambient temperature) with neat conventional jet fuel and different blend percentages of SAJF for different fuel composition.

ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY This section presents a short description of the scope and contents of the references that reported the most essential findings regarding emissions from SAJF. It includes key findings from emission tests project reports (APEX, AAFEX, etc.), ASTM research reports/annexes, and emissions analysis reports by researchers for FAA, CLEEN, DoD, NASA, ACRP, PARTNER, and ASCENT. Altaher, Mohamed A., Andrews, Gordon E., and Li, Hu, PM Characteristics of Low NOx Combustor Burning Biodiesel and its Blends with Kerosene, Proceedings of ASME Turbo Expo 2013: Turbine Technical Conference and Exposition GT2013, June 3-7, 2013, San Antonio, Texas, USA. This work investigated the particulate number concentrations and size distributions of exhaust gases emitted from a radial swirler based low NOx gas turbine combustor. The tests were conducted under atmospheric pressure and 600K at reference Mach number of 0.017 and 0.023. A baseline of natural gas combustion was compared with a waste rapeseed cooking oil methyl ester biodiesel (WME), its blend with kerosene B20, B50 and pure kerosene. â¢ The most common blending ratio is 20% of biodiesel, termed B20. â¢ The combustion test facility consisted of an air supply fan, venturi flow metering, electrical preheaters, 250mm diameter air plenum chamber, 76mm outlet diameter double passage radial swirler, 76mm diameter throat 40mm long wall fuel injector, 330mm long 140mm diameter uncooled combustor, followed by a bend in the water-cooled exhaust pipe with an observation window on the combustor center line. â¢ Lean combustion low NOx radial swirler flame stabilizers were operated close to 0.5 equivalence ratio at 600K and one atmosphere pressure and were shown to have extremely low PM mass emissions of about 1mg/kg for gas and liquid fuel. B100 could be burnt without any major increase in particle number emissions. Anderson, B.E., et al., Alternative Aviation Fuel Experiment (AAFEX), NASA Project Report NSAS/TM-2011-217059, February 2011. This is a report on the AAFEX project, probably the most extensively studied test of alternative jet fuel use in aircraft engines. All of the testing in this project was on-wing engines tested on the ground and evaluation of neat jet fuel (JP-8), a blend of 50% JP-8/50% Fischer-Tropsch fuel produced from natural gas, a blend of 50% JP-8/50% Fischer-Tropsch fuel produced from coal, neat Fischer-Tropsch fuel from natural gas, and neat Fischer-Tropsch fuel from coal. The test bed was a DC-8 with CFM56 engines owned by NASA. Emissions from the aircraftâs APU were also tested. In addition to NASA Langley and Glenn Research Centers, participating research organizations included: U.S. Air Force Arnold and Wright Patterson Air Force Bases, Aerodyne Research, Inc., General Electric, Harvard University, Missouri University of Science and Technology, Montana State University, Pennsylvania State University, Pratt and Whitney, U.S. EPA, and United Technologies. â¢ âRelative to JP-8, burning alternative fuels generally reduced engine CO, THC, and NOx emissions.â â¢ âHAPs emissions were significantly lower for FT fuels.â 4.7. HAP Only a few of the emissions testing programs had specific evaluations of the composition of the UHC emissions so very limited data on HAP emissions are available. To evaluate HAP emissions, UHC emissions must be evaluated for their component species. Additional testing of each SAJF fuel to measure HAPs in the UHC component of the engine exhaust is needed. 4.8. FUTURE TESTING Going forward, additional, more systematic testing would be beneficial to confirm the findings reported here and to fill gaps in our current understanding. In particular, being able to relate the molecular composition of SAJF, and in particular the H/C ratio, would be especially useful.

This is a briefing on the results of the ACCESS-2 Measurement Testing â¢ âSignificant Results â No difference in NOx, CO, HC emissions between fuels.â Beyersdorf, A. J., Timko, M. T., Ziemba, L. D., Bulzan, D., Corporan, E., Herndon, S. C., Howard, R., Miake-Lye, R., Thornhill, K. L., Winstead, E., Wey, C., Yu, Z., and Anderson, B. E., Reductions in Aircraft Particulate Emissions due to the use of FischerâTropsch Fuels, Atmos. Chem. Phys., 14, 11â23, 2014. Standard petroleum JP-8 fuel, pure synthetic fuels produced from natural gas and coal feedstocks using the FischerâTropsch (FT) process, and 50% blends of both fuels were tested in the CFM-56 engines on a DC-8 aircraft. â¢ Dramatic reductions in soot emissions were measured for both the pure FT fuels (reductions in mass of 86% averaged over all powers) and blended fuels (66%) relative to the JP-8 baseline with the largest reductions at idle conditions. â¢ At full power, soot emissions were reduced from 103 to 24 mg kgâ1 (JP-8 and natural gas FT, respectively). The alternative fuels also produced smaller soot (e.g., at 85% power, volume mean diameters were reduced from 78 nm for JP-8 to 51 nm for the natural gas FT fuel). â¢ For the pure FT fuels, reductions (94% averaged over all powers) in downwind particle number emissions were similar to those measured at the exhaust plane (84%). However, the blended fuels had less of a reduction (reductions of 30â44%) than initially measured (64%). The likely explanation is that the reduced soot emissions in the blended fuel exhaust plume resulted in promotion of new particle formation microphysics, rather than coating on pre-existing soot particles, which is dominant in the JP-8 exhaust plume. Downwind particle volume emissions were reduced for both the pure (79 and 86% reductions) and blended FT fuels (36 and 46%) due to the large reductions in soot emissions. In addition, the alternative fuels had reduced particulate sulfate production (near zero for FT fuels) due to decreased fuel sulfur content. â¢ Use of the FT fuels resulted in reductions in EIUHC of 40% and in EISO2 of over 90%. Blended fuel emissions of UHCs and SO2 were intermediate between JP-8 and the FT fuels. â¢ No trend with respect to power is seen in the EIBC mass reductions with average FT / JP-8 ratios of 0.14 Â± 0.05 and Blend/ JP-8 ratios of 0.34 Â± 0.15 for all powers. However, the largest EIN and EIV reductions were seen at mid-powers as a result of a shift in the soot size. These reductions were over 95% for the neat FT fuels and 85% for the blended fuels.

Bhagwan, R., Habisreuther, P., Zarzalis, N., and Turrini, F., An Experimental Comparison of the Emissions Characteristics of Standard Jet A-1 and Synthetic Fuels, Flow Turbulence Combustion (2014) 92:865â884. The investigated synthetic fuels are (a) Fully synthetic jet fuel (FSJF), (b) Fischer Tropsch synthetic paraffinic kerosene (FT-SPK), (c) FT-SPK+20% hexanol, and (d) FT-SPK+50% naphthenic cut. The measurements are performed in a tubular combustor equipped with a burner based on the principle of air-blast atomization. â¢ At 0.3 MPa of combustor pressure, blending of either hexanol or a naphthenic cut in FT-SPK led to increase in both, CO and NOX formations due to the probable decrease in their atomization qualities. FT-SPK had the highest NOX and Jet A-1 had the lowest NOX owing to the differences in their combustor temperatures (due to difference in their sooting tendencies) at same inlet conditions of reactants. â¢ All investigated fuels in the present work, except the blend of hexanol with FT-SPK, have almost similar characteristics concerning the CO2 production. â¢ At a combustor pressure of 0.8 MPa, lower formation of both CO and NOX were observed for all investigated fuels. With an increase in the combustor pressure from 0.3 MPa to 0.8 MPa, maximum values of EI CO for the all tested fuels were reduced by approximately 70%. The emissions characteristics of the investigated synthetic fuels with the burner are very close to that of standard Jet A-1 fuel at higher pressure conditions (0.54 MPa and 0.8 MPa).

This is the second ASTM research report on a new annex for producing SAJF under D7566. Six different companies provided Bio-SPK fuels for testing and testing was carried out at 50% and 100% alternative fuel. Emissions testing was carried out on three different engines: 131-9 APU (used on B737 and A320), TPE331-10, and CFM56-7B. For the first two the baseline fuel was JP-8 and for the latter Jet A. â¢ âThe fuel flow with the Bio-SPK blend was 1.3% lower at [the high power] condition on a mass basis due to the higher [lower heating value] of the biofuel.â â¢ âThe NOx emissions â¦ were 5% higher with the biofuel blend, but would be slightly less â¦ due to the lower biofuel blend fuel flow.â â¢ For the APU, âthe UHC and CO emissions were very low at the [high power] conditions, and were significant only at the [low power] condition. There was a 25% reduction in UHC emissions and a 20% reduction in CO emissions at [low power] conditions, indicating a small improvement in combustion efficiency.â â¢ For the TPE331-10 turboprop engine, âthere was no significant difference between the NOx levels from the biofuel or the baseline JP-8 at any power setting. NOx emissions were slightly higher at some conditions, and slightly lower at others. This is also true for the CO data except at the lowest power setting where the biofuel produces a slightly lower CO level.â â¢ âCO and UHC emissions are very low at the higher power settings, and small changes can result in large percentage changes. Unburned hydrocarbons were only significant at the lowest power settings, where they were 5 to 20% lower with the biofuel.â State of the Industry Report on Air Quality Emissions from Sustainable Alternative Jet Fuels opyright ational cade y of ciences. ll rights reserved. 18 State of the Industry Report on Air Quality Emissions from Sustainable Alternative Jet Fuels Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

M., and Vander Wall, R., Characterization of Gaseous and Particulate Emissions From a Turboshaft Engine Burning Conventional, Alternative, and Surrogate Fuels, Energy Fuels 2013, 27, 2290â2302. Allison T63-A-700 turboshaft engine operated at four power settings. Testing was performed with a specification JP-8, a synthetic paraffinic kerosene, and four two-component surrogate mixtures that comprise compound classes within current and future alternative fuels. â¢ Major gaseous emissions were only slightly affected, with trends consistent with those expected based on the overall hydrogen content of the fuels. However, minor hydrocarbon and aldehyde emissions were significantly more sensitive to the fuel chemical composition. â¢ Nonvolatile PM emissions (soot) were strongly affected by the fuel chemical composition. Paraffinic fuels produced significantly lower PM number and mass emissions relative to aromatic-containing fuels, with the paraffin structure affecting sooting propensity. â¢ The CO emissions for the paraffinic fuels were reduced by approximately 10â20% (compared to JP-8) over the full range of power conditions evaluated. Notably, the CO and CO2 emissions for the m-xylene/C12 blend were equivalent to those for JP-8, which could be expected since the hydrogen content of these fuels was almost identical. The trends for the total unburned hydrocarbon emissions were consistent with those for CO, with a 10â20% reduction (compared with JP-8) at the lowest power setting. The total NOx (NO + NO2) emissions were minimally affected during operation with the various fuels, which is reasonable since the formation of these species is primarily thermally driven and the turbine exit temperature was maintained constant. â¢ All fuels produced similar unimodal particle size distributions, with higher sooting fuels producing larger mean diameter particles. On the basis of similarities in the nonvolatile particle size distributions, it is hypothesized that the fuel composition primarily affects the overall PM formation rate, but the controlling growth and formation mechanisms are similar. This hypothesis was supported by TEM analysis that showed that the soot microstructure was similar during operation with the different fuels. The effect of fuel composition on the total PM mass emissions was consistent with that for the overall particle number emissions, but mass reductions were slightly higher due to shifts in the size distributions to smaller particle size.

This report compared emissions of NOx, PM2.5, CO, and UHC from conventional commercial and military jet fuels with SAJF from Fischer-Tropsch, Biomass-to-Liquid (BTL), and Hydroprocessed Renewable Jet (HRJ) processes. The data compared in this analysis is taken from multiple project reports, which are included in the bibliography for the present report. â¢ ââ¦NOx emissions from military aircraft tend to be lower while primary PM2.5, CO, and UHC emissions tend to be higher than their civilian aircraft counterparts. This is indicative of military aircraft being less efficient at lower power settings than civil aircraft during the LTO cycle.â â¢ âEmissions were â¦ energy normalized by the fuel specific energy using the lower heating value provided in each test document.â â¢ For 100% SPK with emissions normalized to conventional jet fuel, NOx ranged from 0.91-1.01, CO ranged from 0.74- 0.87, and UHC ranged from 0.68-0.76. â¢ For 50% SPK blends with emissions normalized to conventional jet fuel, CO ranged from 0.83-0.91 and UHC ranged from 0.76-0.86; NOx was not reported for fuel blends.

The test engine used in the investigation was a General Electric CF-700-2D-2 turbofan engine. Steady state operation was conducted at three engine load settings: ground idle, 80%, and 95%, corresponding to roughly 8000, 14,000, and 16,000 engine rpm, respectively. The latter two settings represent the aircraft cruise and takeoff conditions. Fully (unblended) SKA. This fuel is produced by a process known as catalytic hydrothermolysis (CH), which converts plant oils into high-density aromatic, cycloparaffin, and iso-paraffin hydrocarbons. The test fuel used in the study was derived from an industrial feedstock called brassica carinata, which is a high yield oilseed and optimally suitable for jet fuel production. This fuel is referred to as 100% CH-SKA in the paper. Fully (unblended) SPK derived from synthesis gas and through the FT process using iron or cobalt as catalyst. The FT-SPK fuel typically contains a complex mixture of paraffins and isoparaffins but contains no aromatics or sulfur. The test fuel used in the study was derived from coal and natural gas in a two-to-one ratio by volume. It is referred to as 100% FT-SPK in this paper. Semisynthetic HEFA synthesized paraffinic kerosene was blended (in 50â50 proportion by volume) with Jet A-1 fuel. The oilseed feedstock for HEFA-SPK fuel was Camelina sativa, which is an industrial nonfood crop. The production of this fuel involves the hydrotreating and/or hydrocracking processes, which produces paraffinic hydrocarbon, and the fuel typically contains no aromatics or sulfur. In the paper, the 50â50 fuel blend is referred to as 50% HEFA-SPK. â¢ In general, operating the engine on various fuels had a small impact on the gaseous emissions. Among all fuels, operating on Jet A-1 generated the highest CO2 emissions, followed by the 100% CH-SKA, 50% HEFA-SPK, and then 100% FT-SPK. The NOx emissions for various fuels at idle condition were about 2 g/kg fuel and slightly over 4 g/kg fuel at 95% engine load. â¢ Relative to Jet A-1, the particle number emissions from the 100% CH-SKA fuel showed moderate reductions of 7â25% over the range of engine load conditions. While for the 50% HEFA-SPK and 100% FT-SPK fuels, the particle number emissions reductions were from 40â60% and 70â95%, respectively. â¢ BC mass emissions from various alternative fuels indicated similar reduction trend with respect to Jet A-1. For 100% CH-SKA fuel the reduction was in the range of 38â50% over the various engine loads. When switching to the 50% HEFA- SPK fuel, the reductions were about 58â82% while the 100% FT-SPK fuel showed BC emissions reduction of 70â95%. The BC mass emissions for the Jet A-1 and the three alternative fuels correlated well with the variations in the aromatic and hydrogen contents and H/C ratio in the fuels.

This paper reports the gaseous pollutants and particulate matter (PM) emissions of a gas turbine combustor burning butyl butyrate and ethanol blends. The gas turbine has been tested under two operational conditions to represent the cruise (condition 1) and idle (condition 2) conditions of aero engines. Aviation kerosene RP-3 and four different biofuels using butyl butyrate (BB) and ethanol blends were tested and compared to evaluate the impact of fuel composition on CO, NOx, unburned hydrocarbon (UHC), and PM emissions under the two operational conditions. Results indicated that under idle and cruise conditions the CO emissions from butyl butyrate and ethanol blends were higher than that of RP-3 due to the relatively lower combustion temperature of the biofuels compared with that of RP-3. Results of the NOx emission comparison indicated the biofuels produced less NOx than RP-3 and the increase of ethanol content in the biofuels could reduce the NOx and UHC emissions.

All rights reserved. PM mass emission index at cruise was higher than that at idle for the biofuels, while the trend was opposite to that of RP-3. The concentration of CO emissions from biofuel blends was significantly higher than that of RP-3 during both cruise and idle states. The increase of the ethanol content in the biofuels led to a rise of CO emissions. The biofuel blends effectively reduced the NOx emissions by up to 70.4% compared with RP-3 under both cruising and idling states. The increase of ethanol fraction could further depress the NOx emissions. Biofuels produced less UHC than RP-3 by at most 60.9% (BE-50) except for pure butyl butyrate. The combustion temperature and the oxidation effect by oxygen compositions in the fuels are two primary factors influencing UHC emissions. To all biofuels, particles smaller than 20 nm dominated particle number emissions under cruise, and the concentrations decreased dramatically as particle size increased larger than 20 nm. Ca2+ turned out to be the majority ion among the five cation ions and its molar percentage increased from 18.1% to 36.6% with increasing ethanol content. Christie, S., D4.3 Emissions Report and Database of Systems Key Performance Parameters, ITAKA Collaborative Project, FP7-308807, 30 April 2015. This project report describes emissions testing of a HEFA fuel produced from used cooking oil. Emissions tests were performed using Garret Honeywell GTCP85 APU. Tests were run at 3 power levels typical of APU operation: idle/no load, environmental control system/intermediate load, and main engine start/highest power. The fuel was off-spec as a result of elevated aromatics (1.4% compared to 0.5% limit for ASTM D7566). The tested blends were from 0-100% HEFA combined with Jet A-1. â¢ ââ¦ engine performance data showed â¦ reduction in fuel flow in proportion to the mass-corrected specific energy density of the fuel blend.â â¢ ââ¦reduction in smoke number with blend ratio was linear to a good approximationâ and ââ¦ the rate of reduction with blend ratio was approximately the same for all engine conditions.â â¢ ââ¦ both the number and mass based emission indices for [nvPM] reduce almost linearly with increasing â¦ blend fraction.â â¢ âFor gaseous emissions, no statistically significant change in the emissions of NOx or UHC was observed with increasing â¦ blend fraction.â â¢ Changes in ambient conditions (temperature, relative humidity, and pressure) showed a slight correlation with UHC emissions. â¢ No correlation between NOx emissions and ambient conditions was observed. â¢ ââ¦ a small but statistically significant reduction in CO was observed with increasing â¦ biofuel fraction.â â¢ Slight correlation of CO emissions with ambient temperature and pressure. â¢ Data in this report show that âthe change in the emission indices for the species CO, UHC, NOx with increasing biofuel blend fraction is either null or edging towards a modest decrease with increasing blend ratio.â Christie, S., Lobo, P., Lee, D., Raper, D., âGas Turbine Engine Nonvolatile Particulate Matter Mass Emissions: Correlation with Smoke Number for Conventional and Alternative Fuel Blends,â Environ. Sci. & Techn. 2017, 51, 988- 996. â¢ This study evaluates the relationship between the emissions parameters of smoke number (SN) and mass concentration of nonvolatile particulate matter (nvPM) in the exhaust of a gas turbine engine for a conventional Jet A-1 and a number of alternative fuel blends. â¢ The data shows that correlation between SN and nvPM mass concentration still adheres to the first order approximation (FOA3), and this agreement is maintained over a wide range of fuel compositions. â¢ The study used a Garrett Honeywell GTCP85-129 auxiliary power unit (APU). â¢ The chemical composition of the test fuels was managed by introducing various blends of Jet A-1 and a used cooking oil derived, hydrotreated esters and fatty acid (UCO-HEFA) kerosene.

The AAFEX ground tests used the NASA DC-8 aircraft with CFM56-2-C engines, testing JP-8, Fischer-Tropsch (F-T), F-T blends, Hydrotreated Renewable Jet fuels (HRJ), HRJ blends, and high-sulfur F-T. Results showed that these alternative fuels and blends had a minor effect on gaseous emissions. No effect on engine performance was evident within the accuracy of the data. Volatile and non-volatile combustion-generated particulates were substantially reduced when operating with the alternative fuels. â¢ The follow-on to the AAFEX ground tests was the ACCESS (Alternative Fuel Effects on Contrails and Cruise EmiSSions) flight test program using a low-sulfur Jet-A and a 50/50 Jet-A/HEFA blend. Seven 4-hour test flights were conducted May 5-30, 2014 using the NASA DC-8 aircraft with CFM56-2-C engines. Sampling of engine exhaust was conducted using three chase aircrafts (NASA HU-25, DLR Falcon 20 and NRC Canada T-33) which measured gaseous species (CO2, CO, CH4, H2, hydrocarbons, H2SO4, NO, NO2, O3), fine (> 10 nm) and ultrafine (> 5 nm) aerosols, soot mass, and aerosol composition. There was no difference in DC-8 performance or fuel system operation between the fuels, nor any difference in NOx, CO or HC emissions. The 50/50 Jet-A/HEFA blend did reduce soot particle number and soot mass emissions by 50% relative to the low-sulfur Jet-A for ground and at cruise.

This is a report on emissions testing conducted on a military C-17 aircraft positioned on the ground. The aircraft engines were F117-PW-100, equivalent to PW2000, which are commonly used on Boeing 757-200 aircraft. The base jet fuel used was JP-8, which was tested neat and also blended with a beef-tallow-derived hydroprocessed renewable jet fuel and a coal derived Fischer-Tropsch fuel. Blends of 50/50 JP-8/HRJ and 50/25/25 JP-8/HRJ/FT were evaluated. â¢ ââ¦ significantly lower CO emissions (20-40%) were observed with the fuel blends. This could be attributed to the environmentally favorable chemical composition (lower carbon-to-hydrogen ratioâ¦) and reduced ring compounds in the fuel blends, which contributed to improved combustion characteristics particularly at lower combustion temperaturesâ (lower thrust levels). â¢ âTest data also show negligible differences in nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions between the fuels.â â¢ âResults show that HAPs are more prevalent at low engine power and that formaldehyde was the most dominant HAP for this engineâ¦â â¢ âLower [HAP] emissions â¦ were produced with both fuel blends compared to JP-8.â Corporan, E., Edwards, T., Shafer, L., DeWitt, M.J., Klingshirn, C.D., Zabarnick, S., West, Z., Striebich, R., Graham, J., Klein, J., Chemical, Thermal Stability, Seal Swell, and Emissions Studies of Alternative Jet Fuels, Energy & Fuels, 2011, 25, 955-966, 2 March 2011. This report presents the results of testing six alternative jet fuels, three Fischer-Tropsch fuels and three HRJ fuels. Emissions test results were compared to emissions testing of JP-8. The test bed for emissions testing was a T63-A-700 turboshaft engine.

The report summarizes the impacts of alternative jet fuels, both neat fuels and blends, on gaseous and particulate matter emissions of aircraft turbine engines. The following engines were studied: T63 (military turboshaft), CFM56-7, CFM56- 2, F117, TF33, and PW308. The fuels studied were Fischer-Tropsch fuels produced from coal and natural gas and hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) from animal fats and plant oils, all of which were compared to JP-8 for these studies. â¢ âGaseous emissions measurements show modest reductions of carbon monoxide, unburned hydrocarbons and hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) with the alternative fuels for several engines; however, no clear dependency of fuel impacts based on engine characteristics were observed.â â¢ Heats of combustion from all of the SAJF were higher than the conventional jet fuel. Similarly, and related, the hydrogen content of the SAJF were higher than the conventional jet fuel. â¢ âIdentifying a particular combustor characteristic [fuel atomizers, combustor type (annular or tubular)] to correlate with emissions was not possible in this study.â â¢ âIn general, differences in most gaseous emissions between baseline and blended fuels for all the engines tested were relatively small.â â¢ âMost relative CO emissions with the neat alternative fuels and blends were between 0.8-1.0, with no dependency on engine power.â â¢ âThe lower carbon content in the neat alternative fuels theoretically contributes to reduced CO emissions; however, these differences are relatively small.â â¢ âSimilar minor reductions in unburned hydrocarbons emissions were also observed.â â¢ âNegligible differences in NOx emissions for the fuel blends were observed.â â¢ âInvestigation of engine operation with alternative fuels and blends on the production of HAPs is of interest to determine if the selectivity of these trace compounds is impacted.â â¢ âFor the limited measurements performed, the aldehyde [HAP] emissions with the alternative fuels (and blends) show no significant differences from those for JP-8; however, additional measurements are merited to further evaluate if the production of these HAPs is affected.â â¢ âIt is notable that although the SPK/HEFA fuels are aromatic-free, they do produce aromatic species (soot precursors) and subsequently soot during combustion.â State of the Industry Report on Air Quality Emissions from Sustainable Alternative Jet Fuels opyright ational cade y of ciences. ll rights reserved. 23 State of the Industry Report on Air Quality Emissions from Sustainable Alternative Jet Fuels Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

This is the fifth ASTM research report on a new annex for producing SAJF under D7566. Five different fuel providers produced ATJ-SPK using a variety of alcohol feedstocks (also referred to as Alcohol-to-Jet ATJ). A blend of 50% ATJ- SPK and conventional jet fuel plus 100% ATJ-SPK were tested in a variety of engines (AE 3007 combustor section, TFE34 engine, PW615F engine, and TPE331 engine). â¢ The 50/50 fuel blend âproduced somewhat higher CO and UHC at low power conditions and comparable NOx levels to the baseline JP-8.â â¢ When tested on the PW 615F, âno negative impact was observed on [specific fuel consumption], gaseous emissions (CO, HC, CO2, NOx), smoke number, or PM. â¢ For the TPE331-10YGD engine, testing âdemonstrated an average of 0.9 percent lower fuel flow and 1.1 percent higher SFC (specific fuel consumption) with the 50/50 blend of â¦ ATJ and JP-8 compared to the baseline JP-8 fuel at the various ambient temperatures, engine speeds, and torque ranges tested in the dynamometer test cell.

The impact of fuel composition, engine power (idle and full power) and operation mode (cold and hot idle) on the gaseous emissions, particle number and mass concentrations, and size distributions from an aircraft auxiliary power unit (APU) was investigated. A re-commissioned Artouste MK113 APU engine was used. â¢ Alternate fuels studied (with respect to Jet A1): - 100% GTL - 50% HEFA/50% JetA1 State of the Industry Report on Air Quality Emissions from Sustainable Alternative Jet Fuels opyright ational cade y of ciences. ll rights reserved. 24 State of the Industry Report on Air Quality Emissions from Sustainable Alternative Jet Fuels Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved. - 50% HEFA/50% Napthenic cut - 10% FAE/90% JetA1 - 75% HEFA/25% JetA1 â¢ At the idle condition, NOx emissions were slightly greater for 50% HEFA/50% Napthenic cut; ~2.3g/kg than JetA1 (2.2g/ kg. â¢ Alternative fuels produced similar or slightly lower NOx emissions compared to JetA1. â¢ JetA1 produced the highest number and mass peak particle emissions, especially for mass size distributions. The GTL fuel produced the much lower number and mass peak particle emissions at cold and hot idle, indicating an excellent performance for low engine power combustion. â¢ There were clear correlations between fuel H/C ratio and particle number and mass emission distributions in terms of concentration, emission index EIn and EIm, and particle diameter GMD. As the fuel H/C ratio increased, particle concentration, EIn and EIm and GMD were decreased. This is because the fuel H/C ratio essentially is a reflection of fuel hydrocarbon compositions. â¢ In general, alternative fuels/blends had similar levels of NOx emissions with JetA1 at both idle and full power conditions due to the similar flame temperatures for all the fuels. The reduced CO and UHC at idle from alternative fuels/blends demonstrated improved combustion performance due to higher contents of paraffinic hydrocarbons and lower fractions of aromatic hydrocarbons in alternative fuels and their blends compared to JetA1. Li, H., Altaher, M., Wilson, C., Blakey, S., Chung, W., Rye, L., Quantification of Aldehydes Emissions from Alternative and Renewable Aviation Fuels using a Gas Turbine Engine, Atmospheric Environment 84 (2014) 373-379. In this research, three renewable aviation fuel blends, including two HEFA (Hydrotreated Ester and Fatty Acid) blends and one FAE (Fatty Acids Ethyl Ester) blend with conventional Jet A-1 along with a GTL (Gas to Liquid) fuel, have been tested for their aldehydes emissions on a small gas turbine engine. An Artouste MK113 APU (Auxiliary Power Unit) engine was used as a test bed for the emission measurements. Overall, all four alternative fuels/blends showed equivalent or lower aldehyde emissions compared to Jet A-1. Formaldehyde appeared to be the dominant aldehyde species. The detailed conclusions are as follow: â¢ Two HEFA/Jet A-1 fuel blends (fuels F and I) had similar emissions for all three aldehydes at three engine operational modes with Jet A-1. â¢ The FAE blend (fuel H) showed decreased values at idle and increased values at full power for formaldehyde emissions. The contradictory effect of the FAE blend between idle (lower than Jet A-1) and full power (higher than Jet A-1) could be due to the trade-off between positive effect (improved oxidation by fuel born oxygen) and negative effect (deteriorated atomisation caused by higher viscosity and low volatility) of FAE. â¢ Neat GTL fuel achieved notable reductions in formaldehyde (~30%) and acrolein (36-64%) at idle compared to Jet A-1. The lower formaldehyde emissions could be because of its lower tendency for scissions due to its straight carbon chain. Overall, formaldehyde emissions were 2-3 times higher at idle than that at full power.

This paper presents the results of a comparison of particulate matter (PM) emissions from a commercial jet engine (CFM56- 7B) burning several alternative biomasses (fatty acid methyl ester, FAME) and F-T-based fuels, and their blends with Jet A1. The engine was cycled through a matrix of reproducible engine power settings where for each power setting steady-state emissions and engine data were recorded. The engine power settings selected were as follows: 3%, 7%, 30%, 45%, 65%, 85%, and 100% rated thrust.

The largest reduction in EIn was observed when emissions at 7% power for the Jet A1 and 100% F-T fuels were compared, where the aromatic contents were 18.5% and ~ 0% respectively. â¢ Factors relating to fuel oxygen content and viscosity mitigate the reduction of PM associated with reduced fuel aromatic content for the 20% FAME and 40% FAME fuels.

This report presents observations from research aircraft that sampled the exhaust of engines onboard a NASA DC-8 (CFM56-2-C1) aircraft as they burned conventional Jet A fuel and a 50:50 (by volume) blend of Jet A fuel and a biofuel derived from camelina oil. â¢ It shows that, compared to using conventional fuels, biofuel blending reduces particle number and mass emissions immediately behind the aircraft by 50 to 70 per cent. â¢ The tests were conducted during 2013â2014 as part of the Alternative Fuel Effects on Contrails and Cruise Emissions Study (ACCESS) at NASA Armstrong Flight Research Center in Palmdale, California, USA. â¢ The greatest effect on emissions is associated with a reduction in black-carbon-equivalent mass, with the biofuel blend exhibiting emission that are 30%â50% of those seen for the petroleum-based Jet A fuels. â¢ ââ¦blending petroleum-based fuels with a HEFA biojet fuel reduces the volatile and non-volatile particle emissions by 50%â70% at atmospheric cruise conditions.â Moses, C.A, Comparative Evaluation of Semi-Synthetic Jet Fuels (FT-SPK), Final Report, Coordinating Research Council, Inc., Universal Technology Corporation, CRC project No. AV-2-04a, Alpharetta, GA, September 2008. This report to the Aviation Committee of the Coordinating Research Council was requested by ASTM to confirm production of alternative jet fuels on which specification D7566 initially was based. It reports on the testing of five semi-synthetic paraffinic jet fuels produced via Fischer-Tropsch technology, one fuel from coal and four fuels from natural gas. The fuels were blended with Jet A, Jet A-1, or JP-8 to a 50/50 blend. Following production of synthesis gas via Fischer-Tropsch and subsequent production of mixed hydrocarbon streams, the final step in each process was hydroprocessing, which produced a synthetic kerosene with high hydrogen content relative to base jet fuel and high net heat of combustion. The neat fuels are essentially free of sulfur and aromatic compounds. This led to approval of generic Fischer-Tropsch fuels under ASTM specification D7566. No emissions testing was reported in the report.

This is the fourth ASTM research report on a new annex for producing SAJF under D7566. This synthetic jet fuel is similar to FT-SPK with the inclusion of aromatics intentionally produced in a final reaction step. This annex to the D7566 specification allows for 50% SKA blended with conventional jet fuel. No emissions testing is presented in this research report used to support approval of the annex.

This report documents the progress in the use of sustainable, naturally derived oils to produce 50% Bio-SPK blends that were tested in commercial aircraft, systems, and engines. The feedstock selection and processing methods used to produce a SPK will be discussed, as will the fuel property testing, engine performance, operability and emissions results, and flight test results. A reduction in NOx and smoke emissions was observed with Bio-SPK addition to the conventional jet fuel, although the impact on NOx emissions (~1-5%) can be considered quite small, especially considering the level of uncertainty associated with the test. â¢ The large variation in HC levels cannot necessarily be attributed to fuel properties. â¢ The observed increase in CO and HC emissions might also be explained by the reduction in flame temperature. â¢ The addition of the Bio-SPK to the conventional jet fuel was found to have insignificant effects on emissions. â¢ There was a slight reduction in NOx (~1-5%), and an increase in the CO (~5-9%) and HC emissions (~20-45%). â¢ These observed changes in NOx, CO, and HC emissions are primarily explained by the anticipated reduction in the flame temperature. â¢ Additionally, the impact on spray quality and flame location is also expected to play a major role for emissions levels, especially for CO and HC. â¢ Lower smoke emissions (~13-30%) were also observed. â¢ The emissions tests of the regulated species were compared for the jet fuel, 50%, and 100% ratios used, and showed no significant changes in HC, CO, or NOx. The smoke number decreased as the percentage of the biofuel to Jet A-1 was increased.

This is the third ASTM research report on a new annex for producing SAJF under D7566. The approved SIP (also referred to as Direct Sugar to Hydrocarbons DSHC) fuels pathway limits blending to 10% SAJF with conventional jet fuel since the fuel produced is essentially a single compound (farnesane) with 15 carbon atoms that falls within the conventional jet fuel specification. Emissions testing was performed on SaM146 and CFM56-5C4 jet engines and a 131-9 APU with the biofuel blended with Jet A-1. â¢ Tests with the SaM146 showed no significant effect on CO, UHC, and NOx emissions of the SIP fuel compared to the reference Jet A-1. â¢ In testing the CFM56 engine, emissions of CO were âidentical for the SIP fuels and the reference Jet A-1.â â¢ For NOx ââ¦ some slight difference among the SIP fuels and the reference Jet A-1 is discernible: for most power settings, emissions from the SIP fuels are below the emissions from the reference Jet A-1, whereas for cruise they are above.â â¢ ââ¦ in conclusion, SIP fuels show similar, if not better, emission performances than the reference Jet A-1.â Shila, J., and Johnson, M., Estimation and Comparison of Particle Number Emission Factors for Petroleum-based and Camolina Biofuel Blends used in a Honeywell TFE-109 Turbofan Engine, AIAA SciTech Forum, 54th AIAA Aerospace Sciences Meeting, San Diego, California, 4-8 January 2016. â¢ This study investigated the particulate matter emissions coming out of the TFE-109 turbofan engine exhaust to calculate the particle number concentration emissions factors (EIn) for the three different types of fuels. The fuels were provided by the Air Force. The Air Force Research Lab conducted the fuel analysis and blending of the fuels.

The first type of fuel was 100% Jet A fuel, the second batch contained 75% Jet A and 25% camelina biofuel, and the third fuel type contained 50% Jet A and 50% camelina biofuel. â¢ These results are in agreement with other studies conducted in which the average EIn (in particles per kilogram of fuel) ranged between 3e16 and 1e17 for the AAFEX study, between 1e15 and 1e16 for the APEX study, and between 3e16 and 2e17 for the UNA-UNA study. The 75/25 blended fuel results were inconsistent with the two fuels in terms of range of emissions factors. Stratton, R.W., Wolfe, P.J., Hileman, J.I., Impact of Non-CO2 Combustion Effects on the Environmental Feasibility of Alternative Jet Fuels, Environmental Science & Technology 45 (24) 10736-10743, 22 November 2011. â¢ The upper and lower bounds of NOX reduction were based on experimental results from Bester and Yates (2009), Bulzan et al. (2010), and Dewitt et al. (2008). The functional form of the distribution was chosen to reflect a conservative estimate within the bounds of experimental data. NOX emissions are strongly dependent on engine throttle setting, specific engine/combustor technology, and ambient temperature. â¢ Soot reductions from SPK use in the PW308 varied from 95% at idle to 50% at 85% of full throttle; similarly, SPK fuel in the CFM56 led to a 98% reduction in soot at idle and a 70% reduction at 85% of full throttle. â¢ The mode of the distribution is consistent with measurements from Bester and Yates (2009) and Bulzan et al. (2010), who measured average reductions of 85% and 90% in soot emissions over the throttle range of a CFM-56-2C1 engine using coal based F-T jet fuel from Sasol and natural gas based F-T jet fuel from Shell, respectively. â¢ âThe purely paraffinic nature and lack of sulfur in SPK fuels result in increased specific energy, decreased energy density, and changes to the emissions characteristics of CO2, H2O, soot, sulfates, and NOx.â â¢ NOx emissions from the SPK fuel were 90-100% of those from conventional jet fuel.

This report presents combustion emissions data for a natural gas-derived Fischer-Tropsch alternative jet fuel both neat and blended 50/50 with Jet A-1 and both 20/80 and 40/60 blends of a fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) [FAME includes oxygenated compounds and does not meet the D7566 specification for SAJF] with Jet A-1. The emissions testing was performed using a CFM56-7 commercial jet engine. Emissions of NOx, CO, speciated VOC (including oxygenates, olefins, and aromatic compounds), and PM were measured. â¢ ââ¦ the effects of alternative fuels on [emissions of] CO and HCHO [formaldehyde, a surrogate for UHC] are relatively modest.â â¢ The lack of robust temperature-correction protocol for HCHO emissions and the sensitivity of HCHO emissions to fuel flow rate may obscure a modest decrease for alternative fuel combustion. â¢ For FT fuel combustion, NOx emissions are reduced by 10% (100% FT fuel) and 5% (50% FT fuel blend) compared to Jet A. however, ââ¦ the difference [in NOx emissions] between Jet A and 50% FT fuel combustion is not statistically significant.â â¢ ââ¦ replacing some or all of the Jet A-1 with the alternative fuels tends to reduce PM mass, number, and size.â Soot mass, particle number density, and size are reduced for combustion of alternative fuels when compared to Jet A. The PM reduction effect is most pronounced at low power and diminishes as power is increased. â¢ âOverall, emissions performance improved or stayed the same when all or part of the Jet A-1 content was replaced by an alternative fuel.â â¢ âFor FT fuel combustion, NOx emissions are reduced by 10% (100% FT fuel) and 5% (50% FT blend) compared to Jet A.â State of the Industry Report on Air Quality Emissions from Sustainable Alternative Jet Fuels opyright ational cade y of ciences. ll rights reserved. 28 State of the Industry Report on Air Quality Emissions from Sustainable Alternative Jet Fuels Copyright National Academy of Sciences.

Vander Wal, R., Bryg, V., Huang, C., Insights into the Combustion Chemistry Within a Gas-Turbine Driven Auxiliary Power Unit as a Function of Fuel Type and Power Level using Soot Nanostructure as a Tracer, Fuel 115 (2014) 282â 287. â¢ Particulate emissions were collected from an auxiliary power unit (APU) directly upon TEM grids for particle characterization by HRTEM. Carbonaceous emissions from two fuels, a coal-based FischerâTropsch and standard JP-8 were compared, each at three power levels. Differences in soot nanostructure, specifically fullerenic content, reveal changes in the combustion chemistry with engine power level, as do differences in aggregate size between the two fuels. As inferred from the soot nanostructure, comparison between fuels demonstrates the impact of fuel structure upon soot formation chemistry. â¢ The APU is a small gas-turbine engine, Honeywell Model GTCP85-98CK whose exhaust is mixed with bleed air and exhausted just before the wing spar. â¢ Comparisons between the FT and JP-8 fuels provides further support in that for the same power level, soot from the JP-8 fuel contains less fullerenic nanostructure, reflecting its substantial aromatic content that accelerates soot formation and minimizes the impact of partial premixing. Differences in aggregate size between the two fuels at each power level are consistent with this interpretation. At each power larger aggregates, indicative of a locally higher fuel concentration is observed for the JP-8 fuel. Therein soot structure across length scales preserves a record of the gas phase species concentration and identity contributing to its formation and growth. This suggests nanostructure can be used as an in situ tracer of the early combustion chemistry within the engine. Wey, C, and Bulzan, D., Effects of Bio-Derived Fuels on Emissions and Performance Using a 9-Point Lean Direct Injection Low Emissions Concept, Proc. ASME Turbo Expo 2013, GT2013-94888. A 9-point lean direct low emissions combustor concept was utilized to evaluate gaseous emissions performance of two bio- derived alternative jet fuels and a JP-8 fuel for comparison. â¢ The bio-derived jet fuels utilized for the testing included a Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) or sometimes termed Hydrotreated Renewable Jet (HRJ) fuel, and a fuel produced from direct fermentation of sugar called AMJ-710 from Amyris. â¢ For the conditions evaluated in the present study, there were no significant differences in NOx emissions between the three fuels for the conditions tested for the 9-point LDI configuration. â¢ At 350 and 250 psia, CO emissions do not show any significant differences between the three fuels. At 150 psia, CO emissions from the HRJ fuel were slightly lower at higher fuel/air ratios. â¢ Combustion efficiencies were very high, greater than 99.9% for the operating ranges examined and again, no significant differences were found between the fuels. There were no significant differences in CO EI emissions between the various fuels and JP-8/alternative fuel blends. â¢ Gaseous emissions measured using a 9-point LDI concept showed no significant differences between the fuels.

TRB's Airport Cooperative Research Program (ACRP) Web-Only Document 35: State of the Industry Report on Air Quality Emissions from Sustainable Alternative Jet Fuels captures the current status of knowledge to reduce carbon dioxide emissions using sustainable alternative jet fuels (SAJF). In the process of reducing SAJF, emissions of other pollutants may also be reduced, which could be significantly beneficial to airports. These reductions are not yet well defined, leaving airports unable to realize what may be substantial benefits. The research team analyzed the published technical literature to validate that SAJF use reduces air pollutant emissions and does not cause any air pollutant emissions to increase.

cae4a0fb-028b-4fab-83cf-d71a8a08628e,"by last updated - Shedding the pounds with a strict diet or regimen is great for your health, but this can often result in loose after . Fortunately, there are many effective ways to tighten this loose skin and get your body back into ideal shape. Having loose skin after weight loss is quite common, and often occurs following a drastic loss of weight, or after a woman gives birth. After significant weight loss, the skin on your abdomen, arms, legs or back may not be as quick to snap back into place, as it had likely been stretched for many years to accommodate your excess pounds. This can be frustrating for people who have worked hard to , as the folds of skin are often unsightly, or hide the muscles you have developed. The key to addressing this loose skin after weight loss is improving elasticity and restoring the tight fit of the skin over your muscles and frame. Some serious cases of loose skin, such as when people were obese for many years, or lost more than 20% of their body weight, may require surgery or cosmetic  to fully fix. At that point, the skin has simply been stretched for too long, and regaining elasticity is likely impossible. However, for people who regularly experience fluctuating weight, or if the loss of weight isn’t too significant, certain exercise, dietary and remedies can fix this problem, leaving you tight, toned and confident in your slimmed down appearance. Some of the best ways to tighten loose skin after weight loss include adding to your diet, cutting back on , increasing your muscle tone, slowing your diet, drinking more water and by using ultrasound therapy. Lose weight and keep it off for good Photo Credit: Shutterstock One of the key components in every part of our body is protein, as it is of tissues, cells and muscles. After you lose the weight and are trying to eliminate the loose skin, you will need more protein than usual to build muscle and strengthen the skin cells’ elasticity. If you have a long-term weight-loss goal, but are already beginning to see signs of loose skin appearing, you may choose to your diet. The skin of your body requires time to adjust; just as it took months and years to stretch out, it may also take months to return to its original tightness. If you slow the pace of your weight loss, or ease off an extremely strict weight-loss program, you may be able to prevent loose skin from forming or being so obvious. Loose skin after weight loss is tricky because in many cases, there is simply no place for the skin to go. Filling out the area that had once been fat with muscle is a good strategy, so your exercise on your arms and muscles can speed up the process of tightening the skin. That being said, there is a limit to how large your muscles can grow, so this approach works more for people recovering from a small increase and loss of weight. Water is the base of life and health for human beings, and without it, cannot form, which is essentially the binding agent for skin cells, helping to increase . While drinking a lot of water can add a bit of water weight, it can also help get your skin back to normal fast! One of the more formal treatments for loose skin is ultrasound therapy, in which ultrasound technology (the same as is used for providing fetal scans) is employed to of collagen beneath the skin. This can measurably increase the elasticity of your skin and improve its level of tightness following weight loss or pregnancy. Your dietary choices are critical when trying to eliminate loose skin after weight loss. Aside from increasing your protein levels, you should also try to avoid overly sugary foods and empty , as these can not only be in nature, but also compromise the progress you’ve made in terms of weight loss. The two main causes of loose skin on the body is a rapid loss of weight or aging, and sometimes both. Over time, the elasticity of your skin weakens, particularly if you don’t take care of your skin. Therefore, when the fat that has been out and supporting your skin is suddenly gone, the skin has nowhere to go, so it hangs loose against our body. As we age, there is also less collagen production to keep our skin taut and toned. Pregnant women often experience loose skin following the birth of their child, as that skin has been stretched out for nine months, and is then suddenly allowed to “deflate”. It is important to remember that excessive weight loss may result in loose skin that simply cannot be treated without to remove it. The and strategies laid out in this article are for relatively minor cases of loose skin. In addition to the behavioral, dietary and lifestyle changes outlined above to eliminate the appearance of loose skin after weight loss, there are also quite a few effective home remedies, including the use of , oil, , white, juice and cinnamon, just to name a few. For people who are trying to eliminate small amounts of loose skin and keep them tight and toned, using -rich remedies is a good choice. These have anti-aging qualities that will tighten skin, promote cell growth and make the skin . If you are suffering from any type of skin condition, can help, including loose and sagging skin. The antioxidants and active ingredients, such as , can increase elasticity of the skin, while the soothing and anti-inflammatory properties can improve speed and likelihood of stress. This remedy is particularly effective for sagging or loose neck skin, which can often happen after weight loss. Blend an egg white and 1 teaspoon of into a cream and then apply it directly to the loose skin. This works as a natural , and also delivers certain lipids to the skin that can strengthen and it. You can blend 1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon with 1/2 teaspoon of , forming a paste or thick cream. The active ingredients in cinnamon can penetrate the skin and stimulate the production of collagen in the affected cells, speeding up the and preventing oxidative stress on those areas of skin. This home remedy works in two ways to counter loose skin after weight loss; the high content is essential in the production of collagen, while the astringent nature of this citrus juice can keep the skin tight and improve its appearance. As one of the densest sources of , this , antioxidant, anti-aging and anti-inflammatory substance can definitely help with loose skin. You can also mix the honey with an astringent substance to help it tighten your skin even more! https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11695-011-0551-6 http://journals.lww.com/annalsplasticsurgery/Abstract/2003/10000/Is_It_Safe_to_Combine_Abdominoplasty_With_Other.5.aspx https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-662-02894-0_1#page-1 http://annals.org/aim/article/668724/short-term-medical-benefits-adverse-effects-weight-loss http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07315724.2004.10719434 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022480485712279 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0190962209007245 https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Akhtar_Naveed/publication/23394474 http://www.e-ijd.org/article.asp?issn=0019-5154;year=2008;volume=53;issue=4;spage=163;epage=166;aula... https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2013/827248/abs/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3611628/ John Staughton is a traveling writer, editor, publisher and photographer with English and Integrative Biology degrees from the University of Illinois in Champaign-Urbana (USA).

All rights reserved. 2. BACKGROUND This State of the Industry report is a âreference documentâ that captures the current status of knowledge regarding emissions from the use of sustainable alternative jet fuels (SAJF). The research team conducted a review of available research, literature, and measurement campaigns to enhance our current understanding of the local air quality emissions benefits and impacts of SAJF as well as SAJF blends relative to conventional jet fuel. We drilled down into the data and extracted and analyzed the essential emissions testing data to quantify typical emissions impacts of SAJF use. The review results are focused specifically on air quality emissions of criteria pollutants from SAJF. The report also includes an analysis of gaps in our current understanding of the production of pollutants from SAJF. 2.1. TEST CAMPAIGNS Department of Defense (DoD) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) have been primarily responsible for most of the SAJF testing to date. DoD conducted tests on many of the different aircraft they operate to qualify their use of SAJF. NASA has been conducting research on aircraft engine emissions to evaluate their environmental impact for several years. Many of these research programs included DoD research labs, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) experts, aircraft and engine manufacturers, universities, and scientific experts. Some of the more significant test programs were: â¢ APEX, September 2006 â¢ AAFEX-I, January 2009 â¢ AAFEX-II, March 2011 â¢ ACCESS-I, February-April, 2013 â¢ ACCESS-II, May, 2014 Much of the literature reviewed in this report comes from reports on these projects or analyses of the data produced during these projects. 2.2. AIRCRAFT ENGINES Todayâs commercial and military aircraft rely on modern, high-efficiency, sophisticated turbine engines to deliver the safety, operability, and efficiency demanded from the sector. Additionally, auxiliary power units (APU) are smaller turbine engines utilizing similar design principles which also perform consistently and reliably. Aircraft main engines and APUs were the primary test beds for SAJF emissions testing. The various testing campaigns showed that emissions testing on a given engine could produce repeatable and consistent results for any given fuel. However, engine to engine differences are significant. The age/pedigree of the engine, time since last overhaul, and cleanliness of fuel components, such as nozzles, can affect combustion and consequently emissions. For a series of tests performed on a given engine, the changes in emissions will be a reflection of the thrust setting (i.e., fuel flow) and fuel composition. In general, fuel chemistry has a much greater impact on emissions than the difference among engines. The relationship between fuel composition and emissions is discussed below. The emissions tests conducted in the reports included in this literature review were performed at various engine thrust settings intended to reflect an aircraftâs main engine performance. The basis for selecting specific thrust settings correlates with the landing-and-takeoff (LTO) cycle as defined by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and used for engine certification testing. As a general representation, taxiing aircraft use low thrust (4%). Full thrust (100%) is used to represent takeoff as the aircraft comes up to speed quickly to get off the ground. Once in the air, the thrust is reduced somewhat (85%) as the aircraft climbs to cruise altitude. A thrust setting of 30% is representative of the thrust an aircraft uses on approach to landing. These thrust settings are commonly used for emissions testing although in actual operation, thrust settings vary and typically are lower than these values. In a similar way, tests conducted on APUs use three power settings â âno loadâ or âready-to-load,â environmental control system, and âmaximum loadâ or âmain engine start,â which reflect in-use APU thrust settings. The no load setting is equivalent to idle on aircraft main engines. The environmental control system setting is an intermediate power setting used when the APU is providing secondary electric power and ventilation to an aircraft parked at the gate. The main engine start setting is a high-power setting used when starting the aircraft main engines. Aircraft main engines are designed to operate most efficiently at cruise power since the majority of fuel use is during cruise. Lower power operation, such as for idling and taxiing, is less efficient from a fuel combustion standpoint. As a result, emission species that reflect engine efficiency, notably CO and UHC, are higher per unit of fuel consumed at low power operation and lower at high power operation. Conversely, NOx emissions, which State of the Industry Report on Air Quality Emissions from Sustainable Alternative Jet Fuels opyright ational cade y of ciences. ll rights reserved. 5 State of the Industry Report on Air Quality Emissions from Sustainable Alternative Jet Fuels Copyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved. While the primary purpose for airlines to use SAJF is to reduce CO2 emissions, emissions of other pollutants may also be reduced, which could be significantly beneficial to airports. However, these reductions are not yet well defined, leaving airports unable to realize what may be substantial benefits. The research team team analyzed the published technical literature to validate that SAJF use does reduce air pollutant emissions (i.e., PM2.5, SOx, CO, UHC, NOx) and does not cause any of them to increase. Table ES-2 summarizes the body of literature that was screened to identify essential reports that include quantitative data on results from emissions testing of SAJF. The data in these reports was analyzed in detail to define the impact of using SAJF on air pollutants of interest to airports. The summarization of these reports and their emissions data shows that SAJF, when blended with conventional jet fuel as defined in D7566, significantly reduces SOx and PM, generally reduces CO and UHC emissions, and minimally reduces or has no effect on NOx emissions. Figure ES-2 summarizes the impact of SAJF on aircraft emissions. This report describes why these findings are expected based on an understanding of the mechanisms of pollutant production when burning jet fuel in aircraft engines and how this is repeatedly confirmed by the data collected from numerous tests and measurement campaigns. Following this Executive Summary, Section 2 provides a discussion of the scope of this report including emission testing campaigns, SAJF production and approved fuels, and pollutant species. Section 3 provides information on the source of the different pollutant species that result from fuel combustion. Section 4 describes the knowledge gaps in the current literature and testing to date. Section 5 is an annotated bibliography that highlights key findings from several reports, which influenced the findings of this literature survey. Section 6 includes a complete reference list, and Section 7 is an appendix, which summarizes the impacts of alternative fuels on the emissions of SOx, PM2.5, CO, UHC, NOx, and HAP from individual reports.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Aviation has a long and successful record of improving operational performance and fuel efficiency over time and is now seeking to reduce its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and offset emissions that may result from growing demand for air travel. U.S. and international airlines have committed to reducing lifecycle CO2 emissions from aircraft operations. The primary means for reducing these emissions is using alternative jet fuels produced from non-petroleum sources, referred to as sustainable alternative jet fuels (SAJF). The aviation industry uses an ASTM International specification standard (ASTM D7566) to define alternative fuels that have been approved by the industry as being safe for use in commercial aircraft. To date, five different fuel production pathways have been defined. Table ES-1 summarizes those fuels as well as the number of reports in the literature that evaluated emissions from testing of those synthesized fuels. The industry is presently reviewing additional alternative jet fuel production pathways, which may add new qualified fuels to this list in the future. Figure ES-1 summarizes those fuels and Section 2 of the report defines them in more detail.

Some calories can be stored as glycogen (carbs), but the majority is stored as body fat. This article explains how many are in a pound of body fat. It also discusses the 500-calorie deficit myth and presents some tools for predicting realistic weight loss. Let’s take a moment to define what we mean by body fat. Pure fat has a very high energy content, or about 9 calories per gram. This amounts to about 4,100 calories per pound of pure fat. However, body fat is not just pure fat. Body fat consists of fat cells, called adipocytes, which also contain some fluids and proteins in addition to fat. Therefore, the calorie content of body fat is going to be a bit less than the calorie content of pure fat (, ). Body fat is mixed with fluid and protein. Therefore, its composition and calorie content is not the same as pure fat. Does One Pound of Body Fat Contain 3,500 Calories? In 1958, a scientist named Max Wishnofsky concluded that the caloric equivalent of one pound of body weight lost or gained was 3,500 calories (). He based his conclusion on the scientific evidence available at the time. Decades later, his result has been cited thousands of times in the media and scientific literature (, , , ). It’s basically become common knowledge that one pound of body fat contains 3,500 calories. But is it true? Let’s attempt to find out. We will be using generally accepted values for this calculation. However, some research does show slight variations (). Using those values, we can conclude that a pound of body fat actually contains anywhere from 3,436 to 3,752 calories. However, it is important to note that these calculations are based on old research. Some of the studies state that body fat tissue contains only 72% fat. Different types of body fat may also contain varying amounts of fat. A pound of body fat may contain anywhere between 3,436 and 3,752 calories, roughly estimated. It is a common myth that if you eat 500 fewer calories each day, or 3,500 fewer calories a week, you will lose one pound of fat each week. The 500-calorie deficit myth overestimates the potential that can be achieved over a period of time (, , ). This estimate seems to work fairly well in the short term, for moderate weight loss in overweight and obese people. But it falls apart in the long term, and sets people up for failure and disappointment. What this myth fails to account for is the body’s response to the changes in body composition and diet (). When you reduce calorie intake, your body responds by making you burn fewer calories. You start moving around less, and the body becomes more efficient. It does the same amount of work, but uses fewer calories than before (). You may also lose muscle mass along with the fat, which also makes you burn fewer calories. This is often called , although the technical term is “adaptive thermogenesis” (). Weight loss is not a linear process, and typically slows down over time (). The 500-calorie deficit diet overestimates the potential for weight loss. It does not account for changes in body composition and a reduction in calories burned. Nowadays, there are apps and online tools that may provide a better, more realistic assessment of your predicted weight loss. , developed by the National Institute of Health, provides calorie levels for both weight loss and maintenance. It takes into account how diet and exercise contribute to weight loss, as well as how your body responds to reduced calorie intake. It has an immense amount of mathematical calculations behind it (). Another good tool to predict weight loss is the , developed by the Pennington Biomedical Research Center. This tool also allows you to calculate weight loss, based on dietary intake and exercise. The 500-calorie deficit rule is not a realistic way to predict weight loss. Better tools exist to predict weight loss over a period of time. When you’re trying to lose weight, what you really want to get rid of is body fat — both under the skin and around the organs. Unfortunately, weight loss doesn’t necessarily equal fat loss. One unwelcome side effect of losing weight is the loss of muscle mass (). The good news is that there are some ways to minimize the loss of muscle mass. Studies show that resistance training can be incredibly helpful in preventing the loss of muscle mass when losing weight (, , ). With a high protein intake, your body is much less likely to break down your muscles for energy (, , ). Both of these strategies are also useful to prevent a reduction in calories burned as you lose weight. Weight lifting and high protein intake may help prevent muscle loss for people who are trying to lose weight. They can also help prevent a reduction in the amount of calories you burn. A pound of body fat may contain anywhere from 3,436 to 3,752 calories. However, it is that just eating 500 fewer calories per day (3,500 per week) causes weight loss of one pound. This may work in the short-term, but the body will soon adapt by making you burn fewer calories. For this reason, weight loss slows down over time.

Airport Greenhouse Gas Reduction Efforts MyNAP members save 10% online. or to save! Airports in the United States are responding to the demand for increased air travel with sustainable development that incorporates more energy-efficient and lower-emission technologies. Funding for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions-reducing technologies, such as electrification, alternative fuels, and renewable energy, has also become more accessible as technologies are proven to be safe, reliable, and cost-effective. Newer strategies and programs to reduce GHG emissions reach beyond airport operations to incorporate the traveling public. These are among the findings in the TRB Airport Cooperative Research Program's ACRP Synthesis 100: Airport Greenhouse Gas Reduction Efforts. The report assesses (1) the state of practice of GHG emissions reduction initiatives at airports, and (2) the lessons learned to support the successful implementation of future GHG reduction projects. The report also finds that large airports are taking the lead in moving beyond reduction strategies for their own emissions and tackling those produced by tenants and the traveling public by supporting the use of alternative fuels and directing passengers to airport carbon offset platforms. It is clear that airports regard energy-efficiency measures to be the most effective practice to reducing GHG emissions. Smaller airports, in particular, are adopting new technologies associated with more efficient heating and cooling infrastructure and lighting systems because they decrease energy consumption and make economic sense. GHG reduction projects are being implemented by different types of airports across the industry because of the cost savings and the environmental benefits of the new technology. Airports are actively benchmarking emission-reduction progress in comparison with similar efforts at airports around the world by using frameworks employed by the industry globally, such as the Airport Carbon Accreditation Program and the airport carbon emissions reporting tool (ACERT), to measure their GHG emissions. Innovative approaches are allowing airports to address rapidly changing consumer behaviors, like those presented in recent years by transportation network companies (TNCs) such as Uber and Lyft. These policy-based solutions offer the potential for wider adoption as they enable airports to act without significant capital expenditures.

Bridging the Evidence Gap in Obesity Prevention: A Framework to Inform Decision Making. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/12847. Addressing the obesity epidemic requires complex thinking that to date has not been fully employed in prevention efforts. The demand for results-oriented research is gradually forcing a shift beyond linear models to models that also address the dynamic, multilevel complexity of real-world contexts. The systems approach is one such model. It encompasses the whole picture, highlights the broader context, considers interactions among multiple levels, recognizes the dynamic shifts that occur over time, and encourages collaboration among investigators from a variety of disciplines. besity is a multifaceted problem that warrants complex thinking and a broad systems perspective to frame the problem, understand potential causes, identify critical leverage points of influence, and take effective action. Linear approaches to complex public health problems such as the obesity crisis are clearly useful, but cannot address the multiple dimensions of the real world and the many influences on the energy balance equation (Foresight, 2007). It is necessary to embrace complexity and to develop strategies and implement change at multiple levels to influence human behavior and reverse the current upward trends in weight. A systems perspective offers a new approach to obesity research and action that can meet this challenge (Huang et al., 2009). ""4 Defining the Problem: The Importance of Taking a Systems Perspective."" Institute of Medicine. 2010. Bridging the Evidence Gap in Obesity Prevention: A Framework to Inform Decision Making. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/12847. The systems approach has a nearly 50-year history since its development by Forrester at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (Forrester, 1991). Increasingly, obesity scholars are looking to other disciplines, from biology to psychology to computer sciences and engineering, that use this approach. In the health arena, the approach has been used to elucidate seemingly intractable problems, including cardiovascular disease (Homer et al., 2004), diabetes (Milstein et al., 2007), mental health (Smith et al., 2004), public health emergencies (Hoard et al., 2005), and tobacco control (National Cancer Institute, 2007). The complex issue of obesity lends itself to a systems approach quite well. Like tobacco control, which employed diverse and multilevel strategies (Abrams et al., 2003, 2010), progress in the obesity field will require a paradigm shift toward an interdisciplinary knowledge base that integrates systems theory with concepts and practice from community development, social ecology, social networks, and public health (Best et al., 2003). This chapter explains how systems thinking expands upon the multilevel, multisector strategies already proposed or in use to prevent obesity. It provides a primer on the concepts of such thinking and examines how the systems approach can be applied to identify the determinants, strategies, and actions that must be considered to address the obesity crisis. The chapter provides several practical examples of how systems thinking can be used in both small and large ways to expand the boundaries of current models and advance effective change in public health. The chapter also links the systems approach and its application to the L.E.A.D. framework (), describing how it enhances the ability to generate, use, and learn from evidence and explaining how specific content pertaining to each step of the framework will differ according to the system on which one is focusing. defines the key systems concepts pertinent to the discussion. As explained in , multilevel, multisector strategies, often based on ecological models (e.g., in ), have gained widespread acceptance for understanding the determinants of obesity and for framing prevention and control activities (Glass and McAtee, 2006). While these models acknowledge the multiple levels of a system and show their interrelationships, however, they may not always be complex enough to capture the dynamic interactions and the short- and long-term feedback loops among the many influences on the energy balance (Foresight, 2007; Sterman, 2006). Systems investigation can complement other methods by capturing this complexity, translating it into actions that can have an impact on the obesity problem and making it possible to predict unintended consequences and time-delayed effects (Mabry et al., 2008). An ecological model captures the many factors—individual, interpersonal, organizational, community (both social and economic), and health policy—that affect individual behavior change and therefore health.

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/12847. The ocate Evidence, valuate Evidence, ssemble Evidence, Inform ecisions (L.E.A.D.) framework for obesity prevention decision making. NOTE: The element of the framework addressed in this chapter is highlighted. A systems approach requires seeing the whole picture and not just a fragment, understanding the broader context, appreciating interactions among levels, and taking an interdisciplinary approach (Leischow and Milstein, 2006). A systems approach highlights the importance of the circumstances, or context, in which an action is taken in order to understand its implementation and potential impact. Thus while investigators must, for practical reasons, establish boundaries to define the system being studied, they must also recognize that each system exists within and interacts with a hierarchy of nested systems (Midgley, 2000). In addition, appreciating leverage points or points of power within a system can help explain how a small shift in one element of a complex system can produce larger changes in other elements (Meadows, 1999). These advantages of systems investigation are particularly important for interventions targeting obesity, given their far-reaching impact on the population; solutions should be designed to maximize benefit and minimize negative consequences. The systems approach offers a further advantage with respect to the well-recognized gap between research and practice, which limits the extent to which advances in research translate to advances in improving public health. Most efforts to ""4 Defining the Problem: The Importance of Taking a Systems Perspective."" Institute of Medicine. 2010. Bridging the Evidence Gap in Obesity Prevention: A Framework to Inform Decision Making. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/12847. A paradigm or perspective involving a focus on the whole picture and not just a single element, awareness of the wider context, an appreciation for interactions among different components, and transdisciplinary thinking (Leischow and Milstein, 2006). A promising new frontier for research and action in response to complex and critical challenges (Leischow and Milstein, 2006). An iterative learning process in which one takes a broad, holistic, long-term, perspective of the world and examines the linkages and interactions among its elements (Sterman, 2006). An interdisciplinary theory that requires merging of multiple perspectives and sources of information and deals with complex systems in technology, society, and science (Best et al., 2003). Research related to systems theory that offers insight into the nature of the whole system that often cannot be gained by studying the system’s component parts in isolation (Mabry et al., 2008). A methodology for mapping and modeling the forces of change in a complex system in order to better understand their interaction and govern the direction of the system; it enables stakeholders to combine input into a dynamic hypothesis that uses computer simulation to compare various scenarios for achieving change (Milstein and Homer, 2006). link research to practice and policy have merely highlighted the challenges of transferring knowledge from single-discipline, highly controlled research to practice settings. Interdisciplinary investigation using a systems approach can potentially help close this gap (Mabry et al., 2008). A systems approach to solving health problems requires new tools, including data, methods, theories, and statistical analysis different from those traditionally used in linear approaches. No single discipline can provide these tools. Therefore, it is necessary to approach health research with a collaborative team of investigators who bring knowledge and expertise from a variety of disciplines and sectors (Leischow et al., 2008). The theoretical frameworks and methodologies that result from such collaboration can generate new conceptual syntheses, new measurement techniques (e.g., social network analysis), and interdisciplinary fields of inquiry (e.g., behavioral genetics) with the capacity to tackle complex population health problems (Fowler et al., 2009). Sterman (2006) explains how the dynamics of a system work, using policy resistance as an example. His explanation, reproduced in , encompasses the key concepts and variables in systems thinking: stocks, flows, feedback processes (positive or self-reinforcing and negative or self-correcting), side effects, and time delays. ""4 Defining the Problem: The Importance of Taking a Systems Perspective."" Institute of Medicine. 2010. Bridging the Evidence Gap in Obesity Prevention: A Framework to Inform Decision Making. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/12847. USES OF SYSTEMS THINKING, APPROACHES, MAPPING, AND MODELING Systems can be small or large and often coincide with the levels defined in an ecological model. For example, a school can be thought of as a micro-system within a larger community; as a meso-system within the even larger national, political, and social milieu; or as a macro-system within a global-system context. This section provides several examples of how systems thinking pertains to public health problems: body mass index (BMI) screening in schools, tobacco control in the United States, obesity modeling in the United States, and obesity prevention in the United Kingdom. The monitoring of childhood growth has been a contentious issue for several decades (James and Lobstein, 2009). In recent years, school districts have been under pressure to respond to the childhood obesity epidemic. Despite limited evidence on the value of schools providing individually directed help for children with higher BMIs, the establishment of school-based surveillance to document obesity prevalence and to inform the development of prevention and treatment policies has been recommended (e.g., Massachusetts Department of Public Health, 2009). Although the measurement of weight and height within schools appears relatively simple and in fact has been taking place for decades, the development of rigorous measurement and reporting protocols has been limited until recently. This lack of a well-defined process, together with the failure to take a systems perspective, can result in a number of unintended consequences and perturbations to the system. For example, children may feel embarrassed or stigmatized during the process, parents may feel unequipped to act on the information they receive, health care providers in the community may not be educated about obesity treatment, the community may lack adequate pediatric programming to which children can be referred, and schools may forego other screening programs to make room for BMI screening (for example, hearing and vision screenings were cut back when the Massachusetts Public Health Council voted to require BMI screening of schoolchildren [Mullen, 2009]). In addition, although obesity rates may be high, insufficient funds or a lack of political will may prevent the school system from accessing the funding and assistance needed to address these unintended consequences, leaving the community feeling frustrated and helpless. Although historically the tobacco control movement targeted individuals and their behaviors, it evolved into a multilevel systems approach to the problem (Abrams, 2007). Clearly, individual behavior change was the goal, but strategies involving industry, legislation, public health programming and messaging, and the health care system worked together to create that change. None of the strategies implemented as part of the movement worked alone. State by state, it was demonstrated that a combi- ""4 Defining the Problem: The Importance of Taking a Systems Perspective.""

Primer on Concepts and Variables in Systems Thinking Social systems contain intricate networks of feedback processes, both self-reinforcing (positive) and self-correcting (negative) loops. Failure to focus on feedback in policy design has critical consequences. Suppose the hospital you run faces a deficit, caught between rising costs and increasing numbers of uninsured patients. In response, you might initiate quality improvement programs to boost productivity, announce a round of layoffs, and accelerate plans to offer new high-margin elective surgical services. Your advisors and spreadsheets suggest that these decisions will cut costs and boost income. Problem solved—or so it seems. Contrary to the open-loop model behind these decisions, the world reacts to our interventions (). There is feedback: our actions alter the environment and, therefore, the decisions we take tomorrow. Our actions may trigger so-called side effects that we did not anticipate. Other agents, seeking to achieve goals, act to restore the balance that we have upset; their actions also generate intended and unintended consequences. Goals are also endogenous, evolving in response to changing circumstances. For example, we strive to earn more in a quest for greater happiness, but habituation and social comparison rapidly erode any increase in subjective well-being (Kahneman et al., 1999). Policy resistance arises because we do not understand the full range of feedbacks surrounding—and created by—our decisions. The improvement initiatives you mandated never get off the ground because layoffs destroyed morale and increased the workload for the remaining employees. New services were rushed to market before all the kinks were worked out; unfavorable word of mouth causes the number of lucrative elective procedures to fall as patients flock to competitors. More chronically ill patients show up in your ER with complications after staff cuts slashed resources for patient education and follow-up; the additional workload forces still greater cuts in prevention. Stressed by long hours and continual crisis, your most experienced nurses and doctors leave for jobs with competitors, further raising the workload and undercutting quality of care. Hospital-acquired infections and preventable errors increase. Malpractice claims multiply. Yesterday’s solutions become today’s problems. NOTE: Arrows indicate causation, e.g., our actions alter the environment. Thin arrows show the basic feedback loop through which we seek to bring the state of the system in line with our goals. Policy resistance (thick arrows) arises when we fail to account for the so called “side effects” of our actions, the responses of other agents in the system (and the unanticipated consequences of these), the ways in which experience shapes our goals, and the time delays often present in these feedbacks. Ignoring the feedbacks in which we are embedded leads to policy resistance as we persistently react to the symptoms of difficulty, intervening at low leverage points and triggering delayed and distant effects. The problem intensifies, and we react by pulling those same policy levers still harder in an unrecognized vicious cycle. Policy resistance breeds cynicism about our ability to change the world for the better. Systems thinking requires us to see how our actions feed back to shape our environment. The greater challenge is to do so in a way that empowers, rather than reinforces, the belief that we are helpless victims of forces that we neither influence nor comprehend. Time delays in feedback processes are common and particularly troublesome. Most obviously, delays slow the accumulation of evidence. More problematic, the short- and long-run impacts of our policies are often different (smoking gives immediate pleasure, while lung cancer develops over decades). Delays also create instability and fluctuations that confound our ability to learn. Driving a car, drinking alcohol, and building a new semiconductor plant all involve time delays between the initiation of a control action (accelerating/braking, deciding to “have another,” the decision to build) and its effects on the state of the system. As a result, decision makers often continue to intervene to correct apparent discrepancies between the desired and actual ""4 Defining the Problem: The Importance of Taking a Systems Perspective."" Institute of Medicine. 2010. Bridging the Evidence Gap in Obesity Prevention: A Framework to Inform Decision Making. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/12847. state of the system even after sufficient corrective actions have been taken to restore equilibrium. The result is overshoot and oscillation: stop-and-go traffic, drunkenness, and high-tech boom and bust cycles (Sterman, 1989). Public health systems are not immune to these dynamics, from oscillations in incidence of infectious diseases, such as measles (Anderson et al., 1984) and syphilis (Grassley et al., 2005), to the 2004-2005 flu vaccine fiasco, with scarcity and rationing followed within months by surplus stocks (U.S. House Committee on Government Reform, 2005). Stocks and the flows that alter them (the concepts of prevalence and incidence in epidemiology) are fundamental in disciplines from accounting to zoology: a population is increased by births and decreased by mortality; the burden of mercury in a child’s body is increased by ingestion and decreased by excretion. The movement and transformation of material among states is central to the dynamics of complex systems. In physical and biological systems, resources are usually tangible: the stock of glucose in the blood; the number of active smokers in a population. The performance of public health systems, however, is also determined by resources such as physician skills, patient knowledge, community norms, and other forms of human, social, and political capital. Research shows people’s intuitive understanding of stocks and flows is poor in two ways. First, narrow mental model boundaries mean that people are often unaware of the networks of stocks and flows that supply resources and absorb wastes. California’s Air Resources Board seeks to reduce air pollution by promoting so-called zero emission vehicles (California Air Resources Board, 2010). True, zero emission vehicles need no tailpipe. But the plants required to make the electricity or hydrogen to run them do generate pollution. California is actually promoting emission vehicles, whose wastes would blow downwind to other states or accumulate in nuclear waste dumps outside its borders. Air pollution causes substantial mortality, and fuel cells may prove to be an environmental boon compared with internal combustion. But no technology is free of environmental impact, and no legislature can repeal the second law of thermodynamics. Second, people have poor intuitive understanding of the process of accumulation. Most people assume that system inputs and outputs are correlated (e.g., the higher the federal budget deficit, the greater the national debt will be) (Booth Sweeny and Sterman, 2000). However, stocks integrate (accumulate) their net inflows. A stock rises even as its net inflow falls, as long as the net inflow is positive: the national debt rises even as the deficit falls—debt falls only when the government runs a surplus; the number of people living with HIV continues to rise even as incidence falls—prevalence falls only when infection falls below mortality. Poor understanding of accumulation has significant consequences for public health and economic welfare. Surveys show most Americans believe climate change poses serious risks, but they also believe that reductions in GHG emissions sufficient to stabilize atmospheric GHG concentrations can be deferred until there is greater evidence that climate change is harmful (Sterman and Booth Sweeny, 2007). Federal policy makers likewise argue that it is prudent to wait and see whether climate change will cause substantial economic harm before undertaking policies to reduce emissions (Bush, 2002). Such wait-and-see policies erroneously presume that climate change can be reversed quickly should harm become evident, underestimating immense delays in the climate’s response to GHG emissions. Emissions are now about twice the rate at which natural processes remove GHGs from the atmosphere (Houghton et al., 2001). GHG concentrations will therefore continue to rise even if emissions fall, stabilizing only when emissions equal removal. In contrast, experiments with highly educated adults—graduate students at MIT—show that most believe atmospheric GHG concentrations can be stabilized while emissions into the atmosphere continuously exceed the removal of GHGs from it (Sterman and Booth Sweeny, 2007). Such beliefs are analogous to arguing that a bathtub filled faster than it drains will never overflow. They violate conservation of matter, and the violation matters: wait-and-see policies guarantee that atmospheric GHG concentrations, already greater than any in the past 420,000 years (Houghton et al., 2001), will rise far higher, increasing the risk of dangerous changes in climate that may significantly harm public health and human welfare.

The movement can be seen as a good example to inform the field of obesity prevention. To explore this paradigm shift, a pilot project, the Initiative on the Study and Implementation of Systems (ISIS), was conducted with funding from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) (Best et al., 2006). ISIS was designed to (1) explore how systems thinking approaches might improve understanding of the factors contributing to tobacco use, (2) inform strategic decision making on which efforts might be most effective for reducing tobacco use, and (3) serve as an exemplar for addressing other public health problems. Contextually, tobacco control can be viewed as a system comprising smaller systems and existing within the broader systems of public health; economics; and society at the local, regional, and global levels. shows the evolution of tobacco control approaches toward systems thinking (NCI, 2007). The ISIS project was an attempt to understand the whole problem of tobacco use comprehensively, and ultimately to address the problem through systems change. As a result of strategic planning, the ISIS group identified four priority areas () that together serve as a synergistic foundation for understanding and improving public health from a systems perspective (Leischow et al., 2008; NCI, FIGURE 4-2 Evolution of tobacco control approaches toward systems thinking.

SOURCE: Reprinted from Leischow et al., Copyright © 2008, with permission from Elsevier. 2007). Simulation modeling, conducted in the third of ISIS’s priority areas, has been useful for exploring the impact of changes in various parameters within the complex systems that have an impact on population-level outcomes related to tobacco use behaviors and policies (Abrams et al., 2010; Levy et al., 2010a,b). System dynamics modeling can help map causality by addressing risks and outcomes; when performed prospectively, it can be used to predict future outcomes, and when performed retrospectively, it can be used to understand how strategies and delivery systems interacted with a population during an intervention. The process proceeds iteratively through the general steps shown in , beginning with the identification of a persistent problem (Milstein and Homer, 2006). Milstein and Homer Iterative steps in system dynamics modeling. ""4 Defining the Problem: The Importance of Taking a Systems Perspective."" Institute of Medicine. 2010. Bridging the Evidence Gap in Obesity Prevention: A Framework to Inform Decision Making. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/12847. (2009) use system dynamics modeling to map the forces that contribute to the persistent obesity problem (see ). This exercise helps in understanding the causes of obesity, the broader systems to which they belong, and how they are thought to interact. Such mapping can therefore elucidate potential mechanisms and dynamic pathways on which intervention strategies should focus. Once such maps have been developed, they can be converted into computer simulation models that can be used to identify interventions and policies with the potential to alleviate the problem. These experiments are followed by sensitivity analyses to assess areas of uncertainty in the models and to guide future research. Once the models have been finalized, stakeholders are convened to participate in “action labs,” in which the models allow them to discover for themselves the likely consequences of alternative policy scenarios (Milstein and Homer, 2009). A broad array of modeling techniques are used for different purposes in many different fields. Because of the complexity of the obesity problem, the most suitable modeling techniques will have several characteristics (Hammond, 2009). First, because of the scale of the epidemic, models may provide the most insight if they capture multiple levels of analysis. Second, to capture the dynamics of such a complex system, models must be able to incorporate individual heterogeneity and adaptation over time. Finally, models must be able not only to provide a better understanding of the problem and the mechanisms behind it, but also to aid in the design of new and better interventions to slow and reverse the epidemic. The most comprehensive effort to both understand and map the obesity epidemic and formulate a national action plan was carried out by the Foresight Group in the United Kingdom (Foresight, 2007). The Foresight Tackling Obesities: Future Choices Project was aimed at producing a sustainable response to obesity in the United Kingdom over the 40 years following the plan’s release. Using a systems approach, the group pursued objectives that included using the scientific evidence base across a wide range of disciplines to identify the many factors that influence obesity, looking beyond the obvious to achieve an integrated understanding of the relationships among these factors and their relative importance, building on this evidence to identify effective interventions, analyzing how future levels of obesity might change, and identifying what the most effective future responses might be. A detailed causal loop obesity system map was produced to display the interrelationships among the various contributors to energy balance; a simplified version of this map is shown in . In addition, a strategic framework was developed to identify gaps in current initiatives that would have to be filled to mount an integrated policy response. Its authors identify six key elements of this framework (Jebb, 2009): ""4 Defining the Problem: The Importance of Taking a Systems Perspective."" Institute of Medicine. 2010.

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/12847. diverse interventions that combine focused initiatives (which impose change), “enablers” (which inform and facilitate change), and “amplifiers” (which address social norms and the cultural context); actions planned over time such that early initiatives build a climate for subsequent interventions; and ongoing evidence gathering, including population-level surveillance and evaluation of interventions. The Foresight Group identified as a key research challenge “the evaluation of new policy initiatives at all levels (process audits, behaviors and biomarkers, long-term health and economic outcomes)” (Jebb, 2009, p. 39). These types of causal loops magnify the need for new ways of evaluating and incorporating evidence not only from research studies, but also from the real-world experience of obesity initiatives undertaken not just within a particular country but around the world. Although outcomes of systems approaches such as the Foresight Group’s causal loop system map appear complex, they are useful for informing practical, real-world intervention strategies. For example, Foresight’s Tackling Obesities: Future Choices Project was used to inform a cross-government strategy for England that was part of a sustained program to reduce obesity and support healthy weight maintenance (Cross-Government Obesity Unit, 2010). The idea that evidence should be identified, evaluated, and summarized from a systems perspective is fundamental to the framework proposed in this report. A systems perspective broadens the traditional approach to locating, evaluating, and assembling evidence (which generally limits the evidence to results of rigorous randomized controlled trials) to encompass evidence that reflects the complexity of the problem. Users of the framework are encouraged to approach every aspect of decision making with a comprehensive lens, considering the complex context in which programs and policies will be implemented and how it may affect their implementation and impact. A systems perspective enables the decision maker to understand interactions among smaller systems within the larger system and identify potential synergies or harms that should be explored before implementation. Creating “what if” scenarios based on systems maps can help decision makers and stakeholders think about various approaches and where to focus efforts, as well as potential costs; elements that are critical in the design of interventions or program and policy evaluations; and feedback loops that can be sources of evaluation data (see ). According to Hammond (2009), the most effective models for addressing the obesity epidemic are likely to be those that capture multiple mechanisms at multiple levels, ""4 Defining the Problem: The Importance of Taking a Systems Perspective."" Institute of Medicine. 2010. Bridging the Evidence Gap in Obesity Prevention: A Framework to Inform Decision Making. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/12847. integrate micro and macro data and dynamics, account for significant heterogeneities, and allow for policy experimentation. To fully realize the potential application of systems theory to obesity prevention, a number of strategies will be required. First, current and future leaders should be trained in the science and understanding of systems and their application to the obesity crisis. This training would include causal mapping, conceptualization of interventions, and computational and simulation modeling techniques. The application of these methods to the obesity epidemic will be challenging—there will be important data that are not yet available, uncertainty about a number of assumptions, and many key mechanisms whose inner workings are unknown (Hammond, 2009). In some cases, smaller systems will have to be studied independently, perhaps with relatively homogeneous populations, before being integrated into a more comprehensive model. Various combinations of models can then be explored and tested against the same outcome data, building slowly toward a model that encompasses the full breadth of the system by integrating all those narrower models. Second, empirical research should be funded and executed using systems theory as a guide. Focused studies can be used to confirm and quantify relationships and to test their effects. Ideally, this research would be carried out in conjunction with modeling studies to produce the most informative data and to guide future research. Third, both knowledge generators and users must work collaboratively with different disciplines to build interdisciplinary capacity. Caution will be necessary regarding the use of models and the need to link their application with empirical research. The interplay between systems theory and research requires high-quality experimental and quasi-experimental designs. Systems thinking puts researchers in a better position to ask the right questions. Research applications allow a systems model to make the right predictions. In conclusion, systems thinking in public health cannot be encompassed by a single discipline or even a single “systems thinking” approach (e.g., system dynamics models). Rather, it requires interdisciplinary integration of approaches to public health aimed at understanding and reconciling linear and nonlinear, qualitative and quantitative, and reductionistic and holistic thinking and methods to create a federation of systems approaches (NCI, 2007).

Global Footprint Network estimates that, as of 2014, humanity has been using 1.7 times as fast as Earth can renew it, which they describe as meaning humanity's ecological footprint corresponds to 1.7 planet Earths. Ecological footprint analysis is widely used around the world in support of assessments. It enables people to measure and manage the use of resources throughout the economy and explore the sustainability of individual , , organizations, , neighborhoods, cities, regions and nations. The first academic publication about ecological footprints was by in 1992. The ecological footprint concept and calculation method was developed as the PhD dissertation of , under Rees' supervision at the in Vancouver, Canada, from 1990–1994. Originally, Wackernagel and Rees called the concept ""appropriated carrying capacity"". To make the idea more accessible, Rees came up with the term ""ecological footprint"", inspired by a computer technician who praised his new computer's ""small footprint on the desk"". In 1996, Wackernagel and Rees published the book Our Ecological Footprint: Reducing Human Impact on the Earth. The simplest way to define ecological footprint is the amount of the environment necessary to produce the goods and services necessary to support a particular lifestyle. The model is a means of comparing consumption and lifestyles, and checking this against . The tool can inform policy by examining to what extent a nation uses more (or less) than is available within its territory, or to what extent the nation's lifestyle would be replicable worldwide. The footprint can also be a useful tool to educate people about , with the aim of altering personal behavior. Ecological footprints may be used to argue that many current lifestyles are not . Such a global comparison also clearly shows the inequalities of resource use on this planet. The or the more narrow are a component of the ecological footprint. Often, when only the carbon footprint is reported, it is expressed in weight of (or CO2e representing GHG warming potential (GGWP)), but it can also be expressed in land areas like ecological footprints. Both can be applied to products, people or whole societies. The of are , and unsustainable given current levels of use. The focus of ecological footprint accounting is renewable resources. The total amount of such resources which the planet produces according to this model has been dubbed biocapacity. Ecological footprints can be calculated at any scale: for an activity, a person, a community, a city, a town, a region, a nation, or humanity as a whole. Footprint values are categorized for carbon, food, housing, goods and services. This approach can be applied to an activity such as the manufacturing of a product or driving of a car. This resource accounting is similar to wherein the consumption of , (, ), , and other are converted into a normalized measure of land area called (gha). Since 2003, has calculated the ecological footprint from UN data sources for the world as a whole and for over 200 nations (known as the National Footprint Accounts). The total footprint number of Earths needed to sustain the world's population at that level of consumption are also calculated. Every year the calculations are updated to the latest year with complete UN statistics. The time series are also recalculated with every update since UN statistics sometimes correct historical data sets. Results are available on an open data platform. Lin . (2018) finds that the trends for countries and the world have stayed consistent despite data updates. Also, a recent study by the Swiss Ministry of Environment independently recalculated the Swiss trends and reproduced them within 1–4% for the time period that they studied (1996–2015). Since 2006, a first set of ecological footprint standards exist that detail both communication and calculation procedures. The latest version are the updated standards from 2009. The ecological footprint accounting method at the national level is described on the website of Global Footprint Network or in greater detail in academic papers, including Borucke . The National Accounts Review Committee has published a research agenda on how to improve the accounts. For 2014 Global Footprint Network estimated humanity's ecological footprint as 1.7 planet Earths. According to their calculations this means that humanity's demands were 1.7 times more than what the planet's ecosystems renewed. In 2007, the average biologically productive area per person worldwide was approximately 1.8 (gha) per capita. The footprint per capita was 9.0 gha, and that of was 5.6 gha, while 's was 1.8 gha. The claims that the human footprint has exceeded the (the available supply of natural resources) of the planet by 20%. Wackernagel and Rees originally estimated that the available biological capacity for the 6 billion people on Earth at that time was about 1.3 hectares per person, which is smaller than the 1.8 global hectares published for 2006, because the initial studies neither used global hectares nor included bioproductive marine areas. Ecological Footprint per person and HDI of countries by world regions (2014) and its natural resource consumption According to the 2018 edition of the , humanity's total ecological footprint has exhibited an increasing trend since 1961, growing an average of 2.1% per year (SD= 1.9). Humanity's ecological footprint was 7.0 billion gha in 1961 and increased to 20.6 billion gha in 2014. The world-average ecological footprint in 2014 was 2.8 global hectares per person. The carbon footprint is the fastest growing part of the ecological footprint and accounts currently for about 60% of humanity's total ecological footprint. The Earth's biocapacity has not increased at the same rate as the ecological footprint. The increase of biocapacity averaged at only 0.5% per year (SD = 0.7). Because of , biocapacity was at 9.6 billion gha in 1961 and grew to 12.2 billion gha in 2016. According to Wackernagel and his organisation, the Earth has been in """", where humanity is using more resources and generating waste at a pace that the ecosystem can't renew, since the 1970s. In 2018, , the date where humanity has used more from nature than the planet can renew in the entire year, was estimated to be August 1. Now more than 85% of humanity lives in countries that run an ecological deficit. According to Rees, ""the average world citizen has an eco-footprint of about 2.7 global average hectares while there are only 2.1 global hectare of bioproductive land and water per capita on earth. This means that humanity has already overshot global biocapacity by 30% and now lives unsustainabily by depleting stocks of 'natural capital'."" Ecological footprint for different nations compared to their . Main article: The world-average ecological footprint in 2013 was 2.8 global hectares per person. The average per country ranges from over 10 to under 1 global hectares per person. There is also a high variation within countries, based on individual lifestyle and economic possibilities. The government State of the Environment Report included an Ecological Footprint measure for the average Western Australian seven times the average footprint per person on the planet in 2007, a total of about 15 hectares. The UK's average ecological footprint is 5.45 per capita (gha) with variations between regions ranging from 4.80 gha (Wales) to 5.56 gha (East England). , a 96-home development in South , was designed by Bill Dunster Architects and sustainability consultants BioRegional for the . Despite being populated by relatively average people, BedZED was found to have a footprint of 3.20 gha (not including visitors), due to on-site renewable energy production, energy-efficient architecture, and an extensive green lifestyles program that included London's first club. , a rural in , , had a total footprint of 2.56 gha, including both the many guests and visitors who travel to the community. However, the residents alone had a footprint of 2.71 gha, a little over half the UK national average and one of the lowest ecological footprints of any community measured so far in the industrialized world. Keveral Farm, an organic farming community in Cornwall, was found to have a footprint of 2.4 gha, though with substantial differences in footprints among community members. Ecological Footprint per person and HDI of countries by world regions (2014) In a 2012 study of consumers acting 'green' vs. 'brown' (where green people are ""expected to have significantly lower ecological impact than 'brown' consumers""), the conclusion was ""the research found no significant difference between the carbon footprints of green and brown consumers"". A 2013 study concluded the same. Early criticism was published by and Verbruggen in 1999, which was updated in 2014. Their colleague Fiala published similar criticism in 2008. A comprehensive review commissioned by the Directorate-General for the Environment (European Commission) was published in June 2008. The European Commission's review found the concept unique and useful for assessing progress on the EU’s Resource Strategy. They also recommended further improvements in data quality, methodologies and assumptions. Blomqvist . published a critical paper in 2013. It lead to a reply from Rees and Wackernagel (2013), and a rejoinder by Blomqvist . (2013). An additional strand of critique is from Giampietro and Saltelli (2014), with a reply from Goldfinger et al., 2014, and a rejoinder by Giampietro and Saltelli (2014). A joint paper authored by the critical researchers (Giampietro and Saltelli) and proponents (various Global Footprint Network researchers) summarised the terms of the controversy in a paper published by the journal Ecological indicators. Additional comments were offered by van den Bergh and Grazi (2015). A number of national government agencies have performed collaborative or independent research to test the validity of the ecological footprint accounting method and its results. They have largely confirmed the accounts' results; those who reproduced the assessment generating near-identical results. Such reviews include those of Switzerland, Germany, France, Ireland, the United Arab Emirates and the European Commission. Global Footprint Network has summarized methodological limitations and criticism in a comprehensive report available on its website. Some researchers have misinterpreted ecological footprint accounting as a social theory or a policy guideline, while in reality it is merely a metric that adds up human demands that compete for the planet's regenerative capacity. Examples of such confusions include Grazi . (2007) who performed a systematic comparison of the ecological footprint method with spatial welfare analysis that includes environmental , agglomeration effects and trade advantages. Not recognizing that the ecological footprint is merely a metric, they conclude that the footprint method does not lead to maximum social welfare. Similarly, (2006) has argued that the ecological footprint concept may have an anti-urban bias, as it does not consider the opportunities created by urban growth. He argues that calculating the ecological footprint for densely populated areas, such as a city or small country with a comparatively large population — e.g. New York and Singapore respectively — may lead to the perception of these populations as ""parasitic"". But in reality, ecological footprints just document the resource dependence of cities - like a fuel gauge documents a car's fuel availability. Newman questions the metric because these communities have little intrinsic biocapacity, and instead must rely upon large . Critics argue that this is a dubious characterization since farmers in developed nations may easily consume more resources than urban inhabitants, due to transportation requirements and the unavailability of . Furthermore, such moral conclusions seem to be an argument for . This is similar to blaming a scale for the user's dietary choices. Some even take this train of thought a step further, claiming that the footprint denies the benefits of trade. Therefore such critics argue that the footprint can only be applied globally. Others have made the opposite argument showing that national assessments do provide helpful insights. Since this metric tracks biocapacity, the replacement of original ecosystems with high-productivity agricultural can lead to attributing a higher biocapacity to such regions. For example, replacing ancient woodlands or tropical forests with monoculture forests or plantations may therefore decrease the ecological footprint. Similarly if were lower than those of conventional methods, this could result in the former being ""penalized"" with a larger ecological footprint. Complementary indicators attempt to address this. The 's combines the footprint calculations with the Living Planet Index of biodiversity. A modified ecological footprint that takes biodiversity into account has been created for use in Australia. formerly also called Ecological Debt Day . . Global Footprint Network. . .

In short, it is a measure of . Footprint and biocapacity can be compared at the individual, regional, national or global scale.

The National Accounts Review Committee has published a research agenda on how to improve the accounts. For 2014 Global Footprint Network estimated humanity's ecological footprint as 1.7 planet Earths. According to their calculations this means that humanity's demands were 1.7 times more than what the planet's ecosystems renewed. In 2007, the average biologically productive area per person worldwide was approximately 1.8 (gha) per capita. The footprint per capita was 9.0 gha, and that of was 5.6 gha, while 's was 1.8 gha. The claims that the human footprint has exceeded the (the available supply of natural resources) of the planet by 20%. Wackernagel and Rees originally estimated that the available biological capacity for the 6 billion people on Earth at that time was about 1.3 hectares per person, which is smaller than the 1.8 global hectares published for 2006, because the initial studies neither used global hectares nor included bioproductive marine areas. Ecological Footprint per person and HDI of countries by world regions (2014) and its natural resource consumption According to the 2018 edition of the , humanity's total ecological footprint has exhibited an increasing trend since 1961, growing an average of 2.1% per year (SD= 1.9). Humanity's ecological footprint was 7.0 billion gha in 1961 and increased to 20.6 billion gha in 2014. The world-average ecological footprint in 2014 was 2.8 global hectares per person. The carbon footprint is the fastest growing part of the ecological footprint and accounts currently for about 60% of humanity's total ecological footprint. The Earth's biocapacity has not increased at the same rate as the ecological footprint. The increase of biocapacity averaged at only 0.5% per year (SD = 0.7). Because of , biocapacity was at 9.6 billion gha in 1961 and grew to 12.2 billion gha in 2016. According to Wackernagel and his organisation, the Earth has been in """", where humanity is using more resources and generating waste at a pace that the ecosystem can't renew, since the 1970s. In 2018, , the date where humanity has used more from nature than the planet can renew in the entire year, was estimated to be August 1. Now more than 85% of humanity lives in countries that run an ecological deficit. According to Rees, ""the average world citizen has an eco-footprint of about 2.7 global average hectares while there are only 2.1 global hectare of bioproductive land and water per capita on earth. This means that humanity has already overshot global biocapacity by 30% and now lives unsustainabily by depleting stocks of 'natural capital'."" Ecological footprint for different nations compared to their . Main article: The world-average ecological footprint in 2013 was 2.8 global hectares per person. The average per country ranges from over 10 to under 1 global hectares per person. There is also a high variation within countries, based on individual lifestyle and economic possibilities. The government State of the Environment Report included an Ecological Footprint measure for the average Western Australian seven times the average footprint per person on the planet in 2007, a total of about 15 hectares. The UK's average ecological footprint is 5.45 per capita (gha) with variations between regions ranging from 4.80 gha (Wales) to 5.56 gha (East England). , a 96-home development in South , was designed by Bill Dunster Architects and sustainability consultants BioRegional for the . Despite being populated by relatively average people, BedZED was found to have a footprint of 3.20 gha (not including visitors), due to on-site renewable energy production, energy-efficient architecture, and an extensive green lifestyles program that included London's first club. , a rural in , , had a total footprint of 2.56 gha, including both the many guests and visitors who travel to the community. However, the residents alone had a footprint of 2.71 gha, a little over half the UK national average and one of the lowest ecological footprints of any community measured so far in the industrialized world. Keveral Farm, an organic farming community in Cornwall, was found to have a footprint of 2.4 gha, though with substantial differences in footprints among community members. Ecological Footprint per person and HDI of countries by world regions (2014) In a 2012 study of consumers acting 'green' vs. 'brown' (where green people are ""expected to have significantly lower ecological impact than 'brown' consumers""), the conclusion was ""the research found no significant difference between the carbon footprints of green and brown consumers"". A 2013 study concluded the same. Early criticism was published by and Verbruggen in 1999, which was updated in 2014. Their colleague Fiala published similar criticism in 2008. A comprehensive review commissioned by the Directorate-General for the Environment (European Commission) was published in June 2008. The European Commission's review found the concept unique and useful for assessing progress on the EU’s Resource Strategy. They also recommended further improvements in data quality, methodologies and assumptions. Blomqvist . published a critical paper in 2013. It lead to a reply from Rees and Wackernagel (2013), and a rejoinder by Blomqvist . (2013). An additional strand of critique is from Giampietro and Saltelli (2014), with a reply from Goldfinger et al., 2014, and a rejoinder by Giampietro and Saltelli (2014). A joint paper authored by the critical researchers (Giampietro and Saltelli) and proponents (various Global Footprint Network researchers) summarised the terms of the controversy in a paper published by the journal Ecological indicators. Additional comments were offered by van den Bergh and Grazi (2015). A number of national government agencies have performed collaborative or independent research to test the validity of the ecological footprint accounting method and its results. They have largely confirmed the accounts' results; those who reproduced the assessment generating near-identical results. Such reviews include those of Switzerland, Germany, France, Ireland, the United Arab Emirates and the European Commission. Global Footprint Network has summarized methodological limitations and criticism in a comprehensive report available on its website. Some researchers have misinterpreted ecological footprint accounting as a social theory or a policy guideline, while in reality it is merely a metric that adds up human demands that compete for the planet's regenerative capacity. Examples of such confusions include Grazi . (2007) who performed a systematic comparison of the ecological footprint method with spatial welfare analysis that includes environmental , agglomeration effects and trade advantages. Not recognizing that the ecological footprint is merely a metric, they conclude that the footprint method does not lead to maximum social welfare. Similarly, (2006) has argued that the ecological footprint concept may have an anti-urban bias, as it does not consider the opportunities created by urban growth. He argues that calculating the ecological footprint for densely populated areas, such as a city or small country with a comparatively large population — e.g. New York and Singapore respectively — may lead to the perception of these populations as ""parasitic"". But in reality, ecological footprints just document the resource dependence of cities - like a fuel gauge documents a car's fuel availability. Newman questions the metric because these communities have little intrinsic biocapacity, and instead must rely upon large . Critics argue that this is a dubious characterization since farmers in developed nations may easily consume more resources than urban inhabitants, due to transportation requirements and the unavailability of . Furthermore, such moral conclusions seem to be an argument for . This is similar to blaming a scale for the user's dietary choices. Some even take this train of thought a step further, claiming that the footprint denies the benefits of trade. Therefore such critics argue that the footprint can only be applied globally. Others have made the opposite argument showing that national assessments do provide helpful insights. Since this metric tracks biocapacity, the replacement of original ecosystems with high-productivity agricultural can lead to attributing a higher biocapacity to such regions. For example, replacing ancient woodlands or tropical forests with monoculture forests or plantations may therefore decrease the ecological footprint. Similarly if were lower than those of conventional methods, this could result in the former being ""penalized"" with a larger ecological footprint. Complementary indicators attempt to address this. The 's combines the footprint calculations with the Living Planet Index of biodiversity. A modified ecological footprint that takes biodiversity into account has been created for use in Australia. formerly also called Ecological Debt Day . . Global Footprint Network. . .

Summary of a Workshop on Innovation in Computing and Information Technology for Sustainability On May 26, 2010, the Committee on Computing Research for Environmental and Societal Sustainability held the Workshop on Innovation in Computing and Information Technology for Sustainability in Washington, D.C. The goal of the workshop was to survey sustainability challenges, current research initiatives, and results from previously held topical workshops and related industry and government development efforts in these areas. The workshop featured invited presentations and discussions that explored research themes and specific research opportunities that could advance sustainability objectives and also could result in advances in computer science (CS). Participants were also asked to consider research modalities, with a focus on applicable computational techniques and long-term research that might be supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF), with an emphasis on problem- or user-driven research. This appendix summarizes the discussion of the workshop panelists and the attendees. The summaries of the four workshop sessions provided in this appendix are a digest both of the presentations and of the subsequent discussion, which included remarks offered by others in attendance. Although this summary was prepared by the committee on the basis of workshop presentations and discussions, it does not, in keeping with the guidelines of the National Research Council on the development of workshop summaries, necessarily reflect a consensus view of the committee.

The workshop agenda is provided at the end of . SESSION 1: EXPANDING SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING WITH NOVEL CS/IT METHODS: “THE NEED TO TURN NUMBERS INTO KNOWLEDGE” Discussions during the first session of the workshop focused on the role of computer science in helping solve sustainability challenges. A broad definition of sustainability was employed. Vijay Modi, Columbia University, provided examples of sustainability areas where computer science could help address some challenges; Robert Pfahl, International Electronics Manufacturing Initiative, discussed changes in electronic systems and products to improve sustainability; Neo Martinez, Pacific Ecoinformatics and Computational Ecology Lab, explored the role of computer science in improving ecological sustainability; Adjo Amekudzi, Georgia Institute of Technology, examined planning and management issues around infrastructure; and Thomas Harmon, University of California, Merced, discussed water challenges. Following are examples given of the ways in which computer science can play a role in addressing sustainability challenges: • Gathering fine-grained accurate measurements and statistics on energy usage of individual buildings can be difficult, due in part to the variety and diversity of building types. With better measurements, one could develop a useful model of energy usage over the course of a day and find opportunities, for instance, to store extra energy throughout the day for use at peak times. • The planning and development of effective infrastructure are very difficult to do at scale for the time span required. Compounding these challenges is a dearth of data on how and where people actually live and what their movements are throughout the day. ""Appendix A: Summary of a Workshop on Innovation in Computing and Information Technology for Sustainability."" National Research Council. 2012. . Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/13415. This limited knowledge of the movement of people and the limited understanding of where infrastructure needs exist make it difficult to plan infrastructure accordingly. Advances in remote sensing, to improve understanding of the use of current infrastructure, can help cities and utilities to formulate better infrastructure planning. • Access to clean water is an ongoing and increasingly challenging problem worldwide. One of the more difficult components of this challenge is detecting water below the surface of Earth. Although detection of water at and just below the surface is well understood, technology for finding water at deeper levels is limited. Better sensing technologies are needed to help differentiate between sand, wet sand, water that is flooding the sand, and so on. The examples above are a just a few of the areas in which computer science has contributions to make to sustainability. Workshop participants examined a wide array of sustainability challenges in which specific CS/ information technology (IT) advances could contribute to resolving these challenges. In many cases, it is a matter of developing new approaches for turning raw data (numbers) into knowledge and, ultimately, prompting action that results in more sustainable outcomes. Research opportunities cited by workshop participants in the areas of ecological sustainability (that is, relating to diverse and productive biological systems), transportation, and water resources are described below, along with associated computer science challenges. The first session concluded with a brief examination of the policy challenges of interdisciplinary work and of turning knowledge into actionable items. Electronic Systems and Products and Sustainability The International Electronics Manufacturing Initiative (iNEMI) is a consortium of electronics manufacturers and affiliates focused on environmental issues in electronics. Every 2 years, iNEMI creates a roadmap that charts future opportunities for and challenges to electronics manufacturing for reaching sustainability objectives. The iNEMI efforts began by focusing on hazardous materials. The early goals of the consortium were aimed at eliminating chlorofluorocarbons from the cleaning of electronics, removing lead from electronics, and reducing the use of halogenated flame retardants and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) materials. More recently, the focus has been on the complete energy use of products, as discussed A list of iNEMI members is available at . The 2011 iNEMI roadmap is available at . ""Appendix A: Summary of a Workshop on Innovation in Computing and Information Technology for Sustainability."" National Research Council. 2012. . Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/13415. below. Sound scientific methodologies are needed to take into account total trade-offs among conflicting device requirements and to model longterm reliability and life of these devices. Products that are recyclable, use non-hazardous materials, or minimize the use of energy and matter tend to be less harmful for the environment. Often there are trade-offs among these concerns. For example, using fewer hazardous materials may increase the resources needed to manufacture a certain type of equipment. When considering the size of items, there is often a trade-off of size for function. For example, cellular telephones have grown larger in recent years as functionality has increased. This matters especially with regard to calculating potential waste over a product’s entire life cycle, although in the case of cell phones, the increased functionality may mean that other, even larger devices are no longer needed. Digitization is another example in which the functionality of electronics has decreased the amount of hardware needed. As digital music players have become more ubiquitous, compact disc players—and discs—are becoming less and less necessary. Life-cycle analysis is key to understanding the complete energy use of products, including the energy used in mining raw materials, producing semiconductors and other components, assembly, transportation, and, ultimately, consumer use of the product. Computing research can assist in the tracking and understanding of all of these inputs throughout the life cycle of products. “Green computing”—making computers themselves more environmentally friendly—plays a role in the reduction of energy consumption. For example, basic assumptions about computers’ operating environments can be rethought, to yield significant energy savings. The 2011 iNEMI roadmap recommends that server farms and machines be redesigned so that the temperatures of server rooms can be increased in order to reduce the amount of energy required for cooling. Participants noted that a holistic approach to technology is needed to contribute further to sustainability in electronics. Continued work in the following areas is needed: in digital semiconductor technology, work is needed in order to increase density and reduce cost; in the incorporation of sensor networks, work is needed to provide detailed energy-use data; in electronic packaging technology; and in innovation in CS and IT algorithms and applications. Additionally, participants suggested that standards may play an important role here. Threats to ecological sustainability include loss of biodiversity, species extinction and invasion, and the exploitation of ecosystems. Each of ""Appendix A: Summary of a Workshop on Innovation in Computing and Information Technology for Sustainability."" National Research Council. 2012. . Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/13415. these threats has consequences for the robustness, resilience, and stability of the respective ecosystems. Computer science can play an important role in enhancing the understanding of the consequences to ecosystems of particular courses of action by assisting in measuring the current impacts of actions and predicting future impacts on these ecosystems. Databases play a crucial role in the understanding of ecosystems. For example, the Global Ex-vessel Fish Price Database of the Fisheries Economics Research Unit is a valuable, large data set. The database provides information on hundreds of types of fish and their market prices over an extended period, thus enabling a better understanding of conditions in the oceans and of the potential effects of fishing. Computing will also play a vital role in helping researchers and decision makers understand collected data, which come from a variety of sources. Hardware and software will be needed to help analyze large sets of heterogeneous data. Advances in modeling and simulation will also contribute to the understanding of the information collected. Ecological networks are complex, high-dimensional, non-linear systems. Therefore, simpler mathematical representations are not adequate. Ecological systems need to be simulated over time. Participants noted that currently, the various time series and relevant data for the simulation of an ecological system can only be summarized. More accessible data including quantitative information from simulations is needed so that others can use the data and contribute to the work. Some of the challenges created by large, heterogeneous data sets and researchers’ resource limitations have been resolved with remote-computing capabilities (currently referred to as cloud computing). The shared resource of cloud computing can allow for simulations to be run much faster. Additional advances are needed so that data simulations can be stored easier and computing power can be more easily shared. Interdisciplinary research on networks has led to a greater understanding of food webs and other ecological systems. For example, paleontological food web analysis has provided a better understanding of the network structures of current food webs. Gaining an understanding of food chains on the globe over vast timescales can help provide researchers with a sense of how some kinds of ecosystems evolved. If economic The Global Ex-vessel Fish Price Database and its various uses are described in U. Rashid Sumaila, Dale Marsden, Reg Watson, and Daniel Pauly, Global Ex-Vessel Fish Price Database: Construction, Spatial and Temporal Applications, Fisheries Centre Working Paper #2005-01, Vancouver, B.C., Canada: University of British Columbia (2005). The Pacific Ecoinformatics and Computational Ecology Lab has done much of the work related to paleontological food web analysis. A list of its publications is available at . ""Appendix A: Summary of a Workshop on Innovation in Computing and Information Technology for Sustainability."" National Research Council. 2012. . Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/13415. information to account for things such as price and biomass can be incorporated into models based on the understanding of modern food webs, the effect of economic exploitation on ecological systems can be better understood. For example, in a simple three-species food chain (such as large fish eating small fish eating plants), adding economic information to the model also allows for a separation of the effects of exploitation by humans for economic reasons from the effects of human exploitation for the purpose of subsistence. Participants discussed how network-based analyses might be useful in other areas of sustainability. Rules derived about ecological networks, for instance, may also apply to energy and economic networks. Can useful comparison be made between economic and food networks? Does food function like money in any sort of actionable way? Computing-enabled “citizen science” provides ways for volunteers to collect and report information from their own environments and to contribute to the sustainability of those environments. Citizen science programs have existed since the early 1900s, beginning with the Audubon Society’s Christmas Bird Count. Now, new mobile technologies and social networking tools make collecting and reporting much easier. Volunteers can easily collect data, for example, on a particular invasive species and send the information to experts to examine. Participants discussed the connections between traditional measures of sustainability, which may typically be functions of space and time, and measures of social sustainability. With social sustainability, as shown in , the sustainability footprint becomes the rate of change of quality of life as a function of one’s impact on the environment. Participants argued that social sustainability can be and needs to be more rigorously accounted for in discussions about other forms of sustainability. Social sustainability can be considered when looking at transportation sustainability, for instance. Definitions of “transportation sustainability” typically focus on moving items (people, goods, and information) in ways that reduce the impact on the environment, economy, and society. Transportation plans have been required in all major metropolitan areas since the 1960s. Although customer satisfaction has been included in transportation planning for some time, assumptions regarding customer needs are often incorrect. Traditionally satisfaction has been seen as a For information on and a history of the Audubon Christmas Bird Count, see .

Research in this space has found, however, that this curve does not apply to all performance attributes. Gains in positive performance often have less of an impact on satisfaction, whereas reductions in negative performance are often more important to customers. In this case, to build transportation plans that are sustainable both in the traditional sense and socially, customer satisfaction data, both subjective and objective, need to collected and woven into these plans. Data need to be collected on a wide range of attributes (safety, quality of life, smoothness), on the relative importance of the different factors, and on how customers rate the different attributes. Such information allows planners to distinguish between performance improvements that have positive and negative effects on quality of life and to negotiate the trade-offs between the two.

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/13415. Computer science can contribute to such efforts by developing effective systems for collecting data from the public and providing better dataanalysis tools to help, for instance, in the assessment of different choices regarding routes and other planning decisions. Real-time data processing and tools for planning and forecasting transportation needs can help urban planners and decision makers balance economic and policy challenges in planning future infrastructure. Computer science research can help with the complicated problems of finding, tracking, and monitoring the sources of, need for, and sustain able use of water. Better sensors for measuring, better models for analyses, and better algorithms for optimization are all areas in which CS research can contribute. For example, more hydrological data and better models could help scientists to create a virtual watershed that would allow for quick studies of impacts and could potentially enable forecasts of the amount and quality of water available, much like weather forecasts. In addition to creating virtual watersheds for analysis, areas in which improvements in CS and IT are needed in order to add to the understanding of water resources include the following: • Because it is not feasible to have sensors everywhere, models will continue to be important. Research is still needed on model-oriented science. Sensors, however, can be used to calibrate and fine-tune these models. A multiscale observation network can combine coarse-grained collection with more densely nested sensors deployed at a smaller scale. • A wealth of information can be garnered from the reflected visible and non-visible energy from plants and water. Although much has already been learned from analyzing this information, more can be learned through a better understanding of the reflective spectrum patterns. • Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and spatial analysis could be used for novel recognition and classification techniques and to identify the characteristics of an ecosystem. GIS imagery could also be used to detect shifts in an ecosystem. • Data combined from embedded sensors in rivers and from satellite images could provide a valuable picture of resources. • Tools are needed that are adept at scraping data from a variety of sources and combining them with spatial data repositories. The software tools could create input files and capture the history of simulations ""Appendix A: Summary of a Workshop on Innovation in Computing and Information Technology for Sustainability."" National Research Council. 2012. . Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/13415. so that researchers need not start from scratch. See the discussion in the section entitled “Scientific Workflows,” below. • Non-trivial optimization tools are needed in order to search for solutions to sustainability problems and to manage trade-offs. Powerful computing is needed to facilitate the scaling up of systems and to couple these with other contributing factors (economics, subsistence, and so on). Although the solving of computing challenges will be one bridge to reaching further sustainability goals, challenges in interdisciplinary partnerships and in turning research into action and policy will need to be addressed as well. Participants noted that the traditional ways of building models tend to be incredibly time-consuming and isolating. Steps include the following: collecting the data, archiving the data, and selecting an individual (typically a doctoral student) to learn the model and then to deploy the model. A result of such an endeavor tends to be that several years later, only one person knows how to use the model effectively. Some progress might be achieved in this way, but to have a larger impact, computing support involving large data sets and complicated workflows will be needed. But such progress can only take place as far as unique partnerships across disciplines will push it. Participants noted that there tends to be a limited connection between the CS researchers and domain practitioners. More and better communication between the field and the laboratory could inform more useful research. Better partnerships with computing and software experts could move research toward higher-impact results more quickly. As noted throughout the workshop, science and engineering are becoming increasingly dependent on software development. Fostering close collaboration between software experts and domain scientists is likely to be more effective than forcing domain scientists to learn advanced software engineering. In addition to the computing research opportunities discussed above, participants urged that shifts be made in how research is translated into policy and action. More bridges need to be built between computer scientists and other disciplines, between researchers and practitioners, and between the academic and the industrial and the consumer settings. Technology from academic laboratories needs to move more quickly to the industrial and consumer world. This change would require collaboration and coordination at the research and development (R&D) level and the intervention of the research supply chain. With fewer and fewer industry-managed research labs, participants suggested that there has been a reduction in the integration of research and consumer products ""Appendix A: Summary of a Workshop on Innovation in Computing and Information Technology for Sustainability."" National Research Council. 2012. . Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/13415. (of the sort that used to exist at Bell Labs) and that collaboration tends not to happen as smoothly. This lack of collaboration may prevent new technologies that would improve sustainability from reaching consumers. Furthermore, planning and design are frequently done by economists, urban planners, and other decision makers, not by domain scientists or sustainability experts. Participants noted that these domain scientists need to be part of the process in order to provide feedback and more timely data, and they urged that academics more actively engage with policy makers. SESSION 2: UNDERSTANDING, TRACKING, AND MANAGING UNCERTAINTY THROUGHOUT THE SCIENCE-TO-POLICY PIPELINE When scientific information is provided to decision makers by the scientific community, explicit representation of uncertainty is rare. The loss of uncertainty information along the science-to-policy pipeline begins with the initial measurements, which may be recorded into databases just as numbers and without any additional information on how the data were captured or intercepted. From such a data set one might produce a predictive map, and any uncertainty that was captured may then be lost by means of an optimization process. Workshop participants noted that outputs from predictive and simulation models are often treated as exact or overly precise and accurate during policy making. In the end, without careful consideration of uncertainty, policy and decision mechanisms cannot be expected to achieve results. The goal of the second session of the workshop was to explore some of the computational methods available to address loss of information about uncertainty, to consider what additional methods are needed, and to outline a potential research agenda. Panelists were asked to examine the following questions in relation to sustainability challenges during their talks: • What are the sources of uncertainty that should be explicitly captured? • What methods are suitable for explicitly representing uncertainty? • Is the technological state of the art sufficient to model the many different flavors of uncertainty present in large-scale sustainability problems? If not, what characterizes the types of uncertainty that are insufficiently modeled? • What methods are suitable for assessing uncertainty in each stage of the pipeline? What shortcomings need to be addressed? ""Appendix A: Summary of a Workshop on Innovation in Computing and Information Technology for Sustainability."" National Research Council. 2012. . Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/13415. • Is the state of the art in human factors, interfaces, and computersupported cooperative work sufficient to support the large-scale systems, models, and data sets that are necessary to tackle large-scale sustainability problems? If not, what needs are unmet? • What are the appropriate techniques for working with uncertain data in data fusion, data assimilation, predictive modeling, simulation modeling, and policy optimization? • How can explicit uncertainty representations be integrated into scientific workflow tools? • Are there alternatives to explicit uncertainty representations that can improve the robustness of management policies to all of these sources of uncertainty? Chris Forest, Pennsylvania State University, provided information on the sources of uncertainty and the tracking of uncertainty in climate models; Peter Bajcsy, National Institute of Standards and Technology, discussed the development of scientific workflows for tracking uncertainty through the science process; David Brown, Duke University, highlighted new methods for optimization problems under uncertainty; and John Doyle, California Institute of Technology, explored theories for analyzing “robust-yet-fragile” systems. Assessment and understanding of climate change and its impacts are critical to meeting many sustainability challenges. Scientists use a variety of techniques, including a variety of climate models, to assess and understand climate change. The potentially high impact of climate change means that policy makers are faced with hard choices, including but not limited to the reduction of emissions, adaption to climate change, and/ or geoengineering that might help mitigate the effects of climate change. Participants discussed the role of uncertainty in the development and understanding of climate models. Scientists working on the problem of climate prediction must also address uncertainty. This could be done using a workflow plan that captures uncertainty information at each stage of the climate-prediction process. Within each stage, there are data, a model, predictions, assessment of likely impacts, and decision making. At each point there are sources of uncertainty that have to propagate National Research Council, Washington, D.C.: The National Academies Press (2011). ""Appendix A: Summary of a Workshop on Innovation in Computing and Information Technology for Sustainability."" National Research Council. 2012. . Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/13415. through the system, ultimately leading to an estimate of the probability of the outcomes. Uncertainty analysis is driven by multiple goals, including the mitigation of climate change, adaption to changing environmental conditions stemming from climate change, and vulnerability assessments. There are two types of uncertainty in climate models: structural and parametric. (The level of uncertainties within each model creates a hierarchy of climate models, as described in . then presents data summarized from the highly complex models used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [IPCC].) stems from the hierarchy of models and attempts to balance the speed of the model with the complexity and components of individual models. Models take significant time to build; their complexity increases as more components are added. Modern tools and approaches in software systems, such as modularity, are important in creating current models. However, several of the models were built in the 1960s and 1970s before these tools existed. For example, participants observed that it is not possible to do comparisons between several of the older models, such as that of the United Kingdom’s Met Office Hadley Centre and the National Center for The first climate change assessments were done using the global energy balance model. Over the past 50 years, a number of additional types of climate models have been developed, creating a hierarchy of climate models. Each model typically has five major components—atmosphere, ocean, ice, land, ecosystems, and human action—and each component can be incorporated at various levels in the models, making the models significantly complex. The most basic of the models is the energy balance model, which is very fast to run but lacks a lot of detail. In terms of complexity, the next level up includes Earth-system models of intermediate complexity (EMICs), which are reasonably fast and able to explore feedback and uncertainty. Fifteen years ago, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology created one of the first EMICs, which included all of the major components listed above. The model is very fast and can explore feedbacks between systems, is flexible enough to do uncertainty analysis, and can propagate uncertainty through the different stages. At the next complexity level are the atmosphere-ocean general circulation models and Earth-system models, which are used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) (and from which the data for were drawn).

Atmospheric Research’s community climate model, or the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory climate models, by swapping in different components from each model; the software is too in flexible. encompasses the adjustable parameters in a particular model. Model complexity and model expense limit the ability to do a full sampling of the parametric uncertainty space. There are numerous uncertainties in each model—those in observations, those stemming from ""Appendix A: Summary of a Workshop on Innovation in Computing and Information Technology for Sustainability."" National Research Council. 2012. . Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/13415. natural variability in the climate system, and those in the model components themselves. As each of these parameters is added to the model, the model becomes less flexible. Various techniques have been tried for incorporating each of the uncertainties. However, these techniques have limited use because building adjunct models is as complicated as building a climate model itself. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s (MIT’s) Integrated Global System Model (IGSM) (), a coupling of a human systems model and Earth-system model, illustrates how uncertainty analysis is being applied to climate models. The model uses several components: human activity; atmospheric, ocean, land, and ecosystem interactions; and biogeochemical exchanges. The model also runs comparatively fast. The following uncertainties are included in the IGSM: emissions uncertainty from MIT’s Economic, Emissions, and Policy Cost model; climate system response (climate sensitivity, rate of heat uptake by deep ocean, and radiative forcing); carbon cycle uncertainty; and trends in precipitation frequency. Climate sensitivity and ocean heat uptake, part of climate response, are a large source of uncertainty. Observational data can be used to calculate a probability distribution for climate sensitivity and the rate of ocean heat uptake. This calculation can be included in the MIT IGSM, and researchers can examine the resulting probability distribution of global average surface-temperature changes. Explaining these uncertainties to decision makers is also a challenge that computer science may be able to help with. For example, researchers have compared the resulting global average surface temperatures with no greenhouse gas (GHG) policy intervention, or business-as-usual policies, and the resulting global average surface temperatures from implementation of GHG policy that limits carbon dioxide (CO concentration to about 550 parts per million. To communicate the resulting difference in temperatures and the probability of the prediction, researchers created the A.P. Sokolov, C.A. Schlosser, S. Dutkiewicz, S. Paltsev, D.W. Kicklighter, H.D.

The climate modeling community does not currently have the tools to sample the models for regional uncertainty information. Computer scientists are needed, for instance, to help determine what parameters in the climate system are driving uncertainty at the regional level, which are not the same parameters that drive uncertainty at the global level. As noted in the section above entitled “Assessing Uncertainty,” several models are quite old. Simulation code dates back to the 1960s and 1970s, much of it written in Fortran. This code needs to be redesigned to take advantage of advances in computing language, software modules, and interoperability. Expert decision making is imperative to the climate modeling process. Although researchers seek to be as objective as possible in examining data and determining probability, the number of systems involved means that much calibration is done by hand. Experts must identify and rank uncertainties at each stage of the process, but experts have limited knowledge and will focus on what is known, while the edges and boundaries of the modeling system may be left unexplored. ""Appendix A: Summary of a Workshop on Innovation in Computing and Information Technology for Sustainability."" National Research Council. 2012. . Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/13415. Participants discussed the typical nature of scientific workflows and the importance of uncertainty analysis to their effectiveness. Uncertainty information about data collected and generated for analysis is often unavailable. When it is available, there are no standardized data structures for sharing and managing this information. Due to the complexity of uncertainty modeling, there are very few software tools that can incorporate, compute, and propagate uncertainty information. If information regarding uncertainty can be propagated somehow, there are still challenges in visualizing and disseminating the uncertainty information. One example of the difficulty of tracking uncertainty is in the use of multiple sensing and data-collection instruments. Often more than one type of instrument, such as a camera and a point sensor, is used in the same area or space to measure the same phenomenon. A question then arises: Which measurement is more accurate, where, and at what time? Using multiple instruments introduces several types of uncertainty, including that related to the transformation that researchers apply in order to display measurements, that related to spatial registration, and that related to the temporal synchronization. In order to grapple with these uncertainties, a theory of uncertainty is developed on the basis of a formalized framework that describes how to compute uncertainty. Researchers select a measurement based on the uncertainty level of each type of uncertainty. As the uncertainty framework is built and used, the error propagation rules and methodology allow one to build workflows that can be applied to future models and calculation. A second example of the difficulty of tracking uncertainty is in managing and tracking data. Data often come from a variety of sources and are then processed by various computing techniques. As data move from analog instrumentation to a visual representation of research findings, uncertainty generally increases. For example, visualization features may be derived or elevation and/or slope may be computed. Moreover, there may be many users of the collected data, and each one may be using a different suite of software tools to process and analyze the data. These examples provide some sense of the complexity involved in tracking and accounting for uncertainty. Some lessons become apparent. First, uncertainty information is vaguely defined; typically it is either a range or a distribution set. Second, the complexity of uncertainty modeling using error propagation is greater than that of the underlying phenomenon itself. Third, and most importantly, scientific workflows are suitable for managing uncertainty modeling; software modules could be reused and could track how collected data are being manipulated. ""Appendix A: Summary of a Workshop on Innovation in Computing and Information Technology for Sustainability."" National Research Council. 2012. . Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/13415. The traditional objective of scientific workflows is to automate a science process leading to a science product, usually a data set or a visualization. Workflows make it easier for scientists to manipulate, communicate, and reuse or repurpose data sets. Workflows also allow the computation to be done locally, or, when managing especially large or complicated data sets, scientists can take advantage of remote computational resources. As noted earlier, workflows can be used to track and manage uncertainty propagation and need to become part of the general scientific infrastructure. Capturing the workflow and managing the computation are particularly useful if all of the calculated information, including uncertainty information, can be delivered to third parties and end users. Workflows can become a communication mechanism for the management of uncertainty. Using dynamic visualization and the sharing of workflows, scientists can more readily engage policy makers. Workflows can be designed with sharing in mind. For example, social media concepts such as tagging and networking can be incorporated into the designs of workflows, making them more accessible. Several open questions regarding the tracking and managing of uncertainty will have to be addressed before these uncertainties can be effectively calculated and, importantly, communicated using scientific workflow mechanisms. These include the following: • How can uncertainty and information loss due to data translations best be captured? • How can provenance information about uncertainty methods and parameters best be gathered automatically during computations? • How can uncertainty best be propagated in computation workows, or perhaps, how can uncertainty propagation rules best be offered for software tools without such rules? • How can uncertainty best be delivered and presented to decision makers, who may require a customizable view so as to increase its effectiveness, as well as a universal viewer for other interested parties, who may require more widely accessible information? • Can workflow services managing the uncertainty be integrated with other web services, such as mapping or sharing tools, to deliver uncertainty to scientists and policy makers? Participants argued that a CS research agenda for sustainability needs to support research on the representations and propagation of uncertainty. In the past there has been little information on uncertainty. Content ""Appendix A: Summary of a Workshop on Innovation in Computing and Information Technology for Sustainability."" National Research Council. 2012. . Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/13415. managers should be encouraged to include uncertainty with data, use workflows to manage and track uncertainty, and incorporate other information-sharing services, ultimately leading to better information on which decisions can be made. Optimization has progressed rapidly in recent decades due in part to the rapid improvement of computer systems generally and to the development of increasingly sophisticated algorithms. The solving of large-scale, linear problems, with millions of variables, is computationally feasible. However, the inclusion of and calculations regarding the uncertainty in these optimization problems is still a challenge. For policy decisions, for instance, models and calculations are run many times, and changes are made during each iteration. Because uncertainty has to be calculated at each iteration, running models that include uncertainty is extremely inefficient. The goal is to make accounting for uncertainty computationally tractable so that each model can be run faster and more efficiently. Robust optimization is one method for coping with uncertainty in optimization problems. Robust optimization provides computational tractability and supports parsimonious modeling demands—one does not have to worry about the specifics of probability distribution. Robustness is an inherent and essential feature of many important methods across many disciplines, including machine learning and decision theory. Robust optimization is different from sensitivity analysis. Although robust optimization and sensitivity analysis are motivated by similar factors, sensitivity analysis is a post-optimization tool; if robustness is ensured beforehand, solutions will not be overly sensitive. Robust optimization is also sometimes considered too conservative. The conservativeness relates to the uncertainty set that is used and on how large it is. An improved datadriven theory of optimization is needed. There are many approaches to building uncertainty sets, but there is the open theoretical question regarding the right way to use data in optimization problems. In some problems, when there are not enough data, the questions become these: How does one properly incorporate subjective opinion about the data? What is the right way to describe uncertainty? An additional challenge is that idealized problems tend to be studied without enough application to realworld problems. There is also the challenge of ensuring that uncertainty is acknowledged and taken into account in any decision-making process. Theory and Methodology of Robust-Yet-Fragile Systems Analysis Participants noted that fundamental research is needed to improve the understanding of the various trade-offs in computational methodologies, ""Appendix A: Summary of a Workshop on Innovation in Computing and Information Technology for Sustainability."" National Research Council. 2012. . Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/13415. such as efficiency versus robustness. Complexities of real systems—not the complexity of the mechanisms used to study the systems—embody these trade-offs. Some theories already exist for examining the trade-offs among robustness, fragility and efficiency. For example, researchers know that efficiency has hard limits and is bounded. Robustness and fragility have conservation laws as well, and the trade-offs between the two are tangible. Theories from other disciplines, including systems engineering, control theory, information theory, and computational complexity theory, provide complementary approaches and can be integrated into theories on robustness, fragility, and efficiency. Efficiency and robustness exist in many dimensions, and although each in itself is reasonably well understood, a theoretical framework is needed for conveying the interactions and examining the inherent tradeoffs. Firm trade-offs exist among the following: — Small amounts of resources consumed, small amounts of waste produced. — Inexpensive components, small capital investment. — Efficient processes: design, manufacture, maintenance, management. — Rejection of external disturbance and suppression of internal noise. — Tolerance for component failures and uncertainty. —Evolvability on long timescales to large changes. — Models (simple and analyzable), short theorems, proofs. — Experience that is a reliable guide to the future. One can start building toward a theory with comparisons across disciplines. Although efficiency limits are understood, it is very difficult, if not impossible, to reach 100 percent efficiency rates. By contrast, robust fragility is much less understood. Robustness in one part of a system may induce fragility in another. Fortunately, evolvability and robustness seem John Doyle, “Theory and Methodology of Robust-Yet-Fragile Systems Analysis” presentation at the Workshop on Innovation in Computing and Information Technology for Sustainability, Washington, D.C., May 26, 2010. ""Appendix A: Summary of a Workshop on Innovation in Computing and Information Technology for Sustainability."" National Research Council. 2012. . Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/13415. to be compatible. Architectures and platforms that enable innovation well can also enable robustness well. Examples were discussed of how new theories can be developed to encompass needed robustness requirements. Network theory might be able to help sort out what is an accident of similarity and what is deeply structural. However, the fact that reasonably well understood networks exist in one domain does not mean that these understandings translate well to another domain. There may be useful knowledge to be gained by comparing network structures and properties in different domains (for example, contrasting and comparing climate history, cell systems, and Internet architectures), but this knowledge needs to be validated first. Additionally, participants noted that a better understanding of what is meant by complexity, non-linearity, modularity, architecture, and evolvability in different domains is needed so that scientists can communicate more effectively with policy makers and with one another. Furthermore, big data and big models mean that many things can be demonstrated by means of data or models. As computational capacity has increased, in many ways research efforts have moved from coping with impoverished data and elegant models that are not well understood to coping with massive data sets and sophisticated simulations that are not well understood. In this new environment, larger gaps between the demonstration and the reality can be unintentionally created, and unanticipated fragilities may become overwhelming. SESSION 3: CREATING INSTITUTIONAL AND PERSONAL CHANGE WITH HUMANS IN THE LOOP Behavioral changes at both the institutional and the individual level are needed in order to achieve sustainability objectives. Important questions in designing and developing smarter systems involve the level of information and the interface design that will induce behavior change. Human-system interaction (HSI) issues arise both for individuals in homes and offices and for administrators of larger systems and facilities. These interactions can occur at different timescales, encompassing both day-to-day decisions made by users and operators and planning decisions involving longer periods of time. Moreover, although there have been many advances in HSI, the literature is replete with failed cognitive models, serving as cautionary tales for HSI in sustainability applications. Panelists were asked to examine the following questions in relation to sustainability challenges during their talks: ""Appendix A: Summary of a Workshop on Innovation in Computing and Information Technology for Sustainability."" National Research Council. 2012. . Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/13415. • How can data and information be presented at the appropriate granularity and time frame to be most effective? What system, application, and user factors bear on the human-system interaction design choices? • Describe the potential impacts of the various contexts and trade-off decisions that might need to be made, including the following: the impact of context (e.g., stakeholders, and so on), the impact of large versus small groups versus individuals, the impact of income, the impact of use by or for cities versus businesses versus individuals, the role of middleware, the supply chain, and so on. • How do human factors affecting sustainability challenges drive the use and design of technology? How can this interaction be accounted for? When are power, networking, products, and other information and communication technologies (ICTs) really needed? Discuss human choice and its impact on consumption, disposal, and reuse. Bill Tomlinson, University of California, Irvine, examined current use and research on computing initiatives that provide information for more sustainable decision making; Shwetak Patel, University of Washington, explored the challenges of providing utility-use data to consumers; and Eli Blevis, Indiana University, examined the possibility of incorporating sustainability ideas into the design process. Better Information for More Sustainable Decision Making One way to use information technology to lead to more sustainable outcomes is through the provision of information to individuals and organizations to assist in decision making. Participants noted that this type of assistance can be provided at many levels. They discussed various types of tools ranging from those that can help inform comparatively simple sorts of personal decision making; to tools that can help people understand large, complex challenges and how their individual actions and behaviors might help; to tools that can assist in understanding and resolving complex challenges that require complex and/or coordinated responses. Several examples of how IT can be used to perform small-scale sustainability-related tasks more effectively were described. They include the following: • Cellular telephone use for coordinating the sale of fish catches. During the early 1990s, fishermen in Kerala, India, would typically have 6 to 8 percent waste from their catch. The waste was primarily due to lack of ""Appendix A: Summary of a Workshop on Innovation in Computing and Information Technology for Sustainability."" National Research Council. 2012. . Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/13415. buyers for these fish. Cell phone availability in the late 1990s quickly changed this mismatch. As they were coming ashore, fishermen could more easily locate buyers, and waste was quickly eliminated. Cell phones were not developed to tackle environmental issues, but did enable this unintended positive outcome. • The use of various communication tools by non-profit and non-governmental organizations in coordinating activities. The Surfrider Foundation organizes beach cleanups using various IT infrastructures, including text messages, e-mail campaigns, and social media tools. • Researchers are examining ways to apply Internet-inspired architectural principles to the energy grid. For consumers, questions are being explored regarding smart appliances that automatically run when electricity is in less demand or when renewable sources are available. Another class of tools is designed to help educate the public on their choices regarding sustainability. Examples discussed by participants range from tools for educating school-age children about ecological interdependency to those for helping consumers make more sustainable purchases at the market. The Social Code Group, which Bill Tomlinson leads, has developed several of these tools. A selection of these tools and projects was discussed: • This application was designed, with contributions from ecologists, to help 8- to 12-year-old children learn about ecology in the museum environment. A large monitor and several tablets represent various ecosystems. The tablets allow interaction and can be used to simulate the transplanting of species from one ecosystem to another, encouraging children to explore the interdependencies among species and the interconnections between restoration and conservation. A key aspect of EcoRaft is a button at the bottom of the main screen that would remove all species from the simulation. In science museums, the first thing that children tend to do with interactive displays is to push whatever buttons are available. In this case, the button was not labeled, which meant that current users had to guard the button or educate newcomers to the game, simulating the value of education and activism.

The vision was that using cell phone cameras and large databases that linked universal product codes (UPCs) to environmental data, consumers could quickly identify which available foods had the least environmental impact. When GreenScanner was first developed as a web application in 2006, sufficiently capable hardware was not in wide use to make this tool feasible for everyday consumer use. However, as cell phones have advanced, a tool similar to GreenScanner has become commercially available through the company Good Guide. • This tool was designed to help people track their activities and the environmental impact of those activities. People may be aware that they often travel by airplane or car, but they might not understand the cumulative time spent doing these activities in a year or the cumulative impact that such travel can have. By tracking their activities, people can better understand their carbon footprint and where the opportunities are for lessening that footprint. • This web application uses collaborative filtering techniques to reduce the amount of information that a user needs to input into carbon-footprint calculators. With current carbon-footprint calculators, users have to enter a great deal of information before receiving an answer. With collaborative filtering, they can enter much less information (which is compared to similar information provided by other users) and then be provided with meaningful defaults for the additional information required. Participants noted that tools such as these can help individuals better understand their contributions to sustainability problems as well as to sustainability solutions. However, a complete toolbox for resolving large, complex environmental problems does not yet exist. The scale of environmental challenges on the planet today—including global climate change, biodiversity loss, sea-level rise, and various kinds of pollution—is much greater than the scale of other challenges that humans typically face. People are generally good at cooperation in small-scale tasks and at understanding and resolving smaller challenges, especially those with The web application, GreenScanner, is available at .

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/13415. smaller scales of time, space, and complexity. However, the largest and most challenging environmental problems are not at scales that people can readily understand. Examples of the complex scales involved in sustainability include the following: • Consider the prospect of the sea level rising, perhaps 40 centimeters, over the course of 120 years. How can the general population understand the risks and consequences? • Another example of a scale that is difficult to comprehend is global supply chains. Products purchased in the United States arrive through a supply chain that may begin as far away as a palm oil plantation in Sumatra. How does one communicate to the consumer the potential environmental repercussions of the manufacture, transport, and life cycle of products that they purchase? • The complexity of climate change stems from the large number of factors—such as cloud cover, carbon dioxide emissions, rainforest depletion—and the interaction of these factors that make up the global climate system. How can IT—and the way that sustainability information is communicated using IT—assist in developing an understanding of the increasing scales of time, space, and complexity that characterize climate change? There may be lessons to learn from general IT and CS approaches when it comes to these complex problems. Good architecture design can remove extraneous decision-making requirements and afford consumers the ability to select sustainable options quickly and easily. When the Internet works well, for example, users do not typically know or need to know where the information they are receiving is coming from: e-mails move through various wires, routers, and servers around the globe; web pages are populated by widgets whose data could be sourced from anywhere. One attendee suggested that analogous architectural approaches may be applicable to certain sustainability challenges. Another big challenge in sustainability issues is the legacy and fixed nature of our utilities and infrastructure. There is a great deal of legacy There are several challenges in educating the public on climate and sustainability issues, one of which involves differentiating between weather and climate. It is too easy to overinterpret extremely hot or cold days. Interactive design techniques could help communicate the difference as well as the subtle scale changes, such as highlighting the shifting state of Alaskan glaciers or the sea level. The climate research community also struggles to define what is “normal” for weather and climate: “normal” from 1950 to 1980 is different from what would be considered normal from 1980 to 2010. Some advocate taking a first-order linear trend of the past 30 years as an estimate of a baseline to use to compare changes. ""Appendix A: Summary of a Workshop on Innovation in Computing and Information Technology for Sustainability."" National Research Council. 2012. . Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/13415. infrastructure in most systems that pose significant challenges. For example, one can certainly contemplate autonomous vehicles, which are much more environmentally friendly, but moving from a highway of all individually controlled vehicles to a highway of all autonomous vehicles is difficult; the upgrade path is bumpy, to say the least. Residential Energy Measurement and Disaggregated Data Participants discussed how better information can assist consumers in making effective changes in their use of home resources such as power, water, and gas. Current literature suggests that high-granularity or highresolution data—for example, information about the usage patterns of individual appliances—are the most useful. Participants observed that literature from the past several decades suggests that if this information were provided to consumers, a 15 to 20 percent reduction in consumption would be possible. In the past, the technologies that collected and provided this information were typically tedious to install and required installation by trained technicians. Such difficulties make them impractical for largescale deployment. Tools were not successful in the past because too much burden was placed on the individuals who were installing them in their homes. New technologies, such as embedded systems and sensors, can make information gathering and feedback tools much more practical. An ongoing research challenge is to determine what information and interfaces work best. One cannot start answering more in-depth questions about the effectiveness of novel, engaging, and persuasive feedback applications, however, until there are more information and data from end users. Sensing and feedback work hand in hand in creating the most effective tools for consumers. Consumers, appliance manufacturers, and utility companies can all benefit from any data collected from in-home deployment of sensors. Consumers could use disaggregated data to understand their utility use and to make changes in it. By contrast, what is typically available to consumers is only simple end-of-month billing, which provides very little actionable information. If consumers knew the consumption of resources by individual devices, they might start to tailor their behavior for more efficient consumption. Use data could also help manufacturers gain a better understanding of the use of their appliances. Manufacturers do not have a lot of information on how often their appliances are used. Better ""Appendix A: Summary of a Workshop on Innovation in Computing and Information Technology for Sustainability."" National Research Council. 2012. . Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/13415. understanding of typical duty cycles could be incorporated into future designs. To the extent that utilities are motivated to promote energy-conservation activities, they have few ways to assess or validate whether those activities are working. Relevant data for utilities would include device use over time and any regional difference in use. Currently utilities tend to use self-reporting and polling to determine whether or not their initiatives influenced consumer activities. Another challenge is that utilities have little experience in deploying technologies inside the home. Moreover, utilities do not want the added expense of installing monitoring tools in the home. Sensors that are easily deployable by end users could provide validation and verification of usage for utilities as well as for consumers. Once validation and verification are widely available, utilities would be able to provide better incentives to customers for conservation. Additionally, the information could allow utilities to create better demand-response models. Better usage models could also be developed by researchers. One goal would be to create a national energy data corpus, which would be very useful to researchers across disciplines as well as in helping meet large-scale energy and sustainability information needs. The research discussed in this session of the workshop focused on the creation of technology that (1) provides highly granular, disaggregated data on home energy use and (2) is deployable by end users. The traditional way of collecting such data would be to deploy a network of sensors at each outlet, light, or water fixture—a method that is cumbersome, expensive, and, as past experience shows, something that consumers are unlikely to do. This suggests the need to find an approach that is easier from the perspective of the consumer and, ideally, is a device that plugs in to a single outlet yet monitors electrical consumption or events that occur in the home at the appliance level. Below are examples of research being done along these lines to collect data on three main resources: power, water, and gas. • Research is being done to examine the propagation of electrical noise over power lines to infer what devices are being activated. This research incorporates work in signal processing, machine learning, and embedded systems. These types of devices are better than smart meters, which may only provide information every 15 or 20 minutes. In certain circumstances, homeowners or researchers may want shorter time intervals. Tools built directly in to appliances are not particularly helpful because the timescale for replacing many in-home appliances is often measured in decades. ""Appendix A: Summary of a Workshop on Innovation in Computing and Information Technology for Sustainability."" National Research Council. 2012. . Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/13415. To provide real-time consumption, a magnetoresistive sensor was developed that attaches outside the breaker panel, but can be read inside the home. This tool has been field-tested with some success by utilities to determine whether consumers are capable of installing it. • Measuring and tracking water usage provides similar challenges. Obviously, any sensor whose installation requires cutting into pipe will not work for consumers. A single-point water-sensing solution, attached to a washing-machine hose spigot, could look at the water hammer phenomenon that occurs when a valve is opened and closed, which could infer which water fixture was being used inside the house. Because the hot- and cold-water systems are interconnected, one could even begin to discern hot- and cold-water use with a single sensor. In apartment complexes, individual units may not have hose spigots. In that case, the hot-water heater would be another location for installing a sensor. • Collecting gas data is much more difficult. There is not typically a good place to locate a single sensor that determines when an appliance is activated, and there are safety concerns about customer-installation of gas fixtures. However, a sensor could be installed by clipping it to the nationally mandated regulator on appliances. The acoustic vibrations of the diaphragm are linearly proportionate to flow. By measuring these vibrations, real-time consumption information can be determined. In addition, transient events that occur from the opening and closing of gas valves manifest themselves through the valve itself. This information can be used to determine exactly what appliance is being used. Participants noted that interfaces for providing the disaggregated sorts of data and feedback discussed above are critical to the successful and effective deployment of sensors. The typical “interface” is the simple electric bill and meter in homes. The meter was not designed for consumers to read, and the bill, which for the consumer, usually provides only an end-of-cycle reading. Even the units used in the typical electric bill are not very user-friendly: do most consumers understand, for example, what a kilowatt-hour means? Water bills are typically even more aggregated; most include up to 3 months of water use. If a spike occurred in water usage due to, for instance, a leaky valve, the consumer would not have any knowledge of it until the end of the billing cycle. Clearly there are opportunities for interface design to play a role in communicating better and more actionable information. Unfortunately, there are currently only limited examples of interfaces that provide disaggregated feedback in approximately real time. One obvious example is gas-electric hybrid ""Appendix A: Summary of a Workshop on Innovation in Computing and Information Technology for Sustainability."" National Research Council. 2012. . Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/13415. automobiles, which display approximate instantaneous mileage while the car is running, as well as relative use of engine and battery. Given more information about their own driving habits in accessible and understandable fashion, consumers can (and do) alter their behavior and conserve gas, participants observed. Participants described how research that validates the functionality of the devices described earlier has started with in-home trials. In order to evaluate the installation process, researchers have observed consumers self-installing devices. Once the devices are in place, researchers can evaluate the effectiveness of the energy-management systems provided to users. Some of the questions being asked by researchers are: Can you elicit behavior change, up to 15 to 20 percent reduction in usage, with disaggregated feedback, and does the behavior change really hold over time? As more data have been collected on how users react to various interfaces, researchers have begun to iteratively refine individual interfaces. Some of the deployed devices were also being integrated with Microsoft Hohm and Google’s PowerMeter projects. Before devices and systems such as those exemplified here can be deployed commercially, large-scale studies are needed. Utilities are open to participating in large-scale studies, but when deploying research technology it can be a challenge to create enough devices to do even smallscale deployments in 20 or 30 homes; research laboratories are not often equipped for production. One solution has been to commercialize the technologies being used in research settings so that devices are available from retail stores as well as directly from the utilities. For example, Belkin International, which sells a wide array of computer peripherals and other consumer electronics, recently purchased a demand-side monitoring solution developed at a university research laboratory. The timescales and complexity of general sustainability issues are difficult to understand. Feedback mechanisms are being developed, and there is some evidence that information does change behavior. Additional knowledge is still needed on how much this feedback will influence behaviors and what the best feedback over what timescale produces the most change. In June 2011, both Microsoft and Google announced the discontinuation of these projects. Both cited the slow market adoption of the services as the reason for the termination. For additional information, see http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/technologybrierdudleysblog/2011667981_uw_gets_slice_of_profs_startup.html. Examples of the Belkin products can be seen at .

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/13415. Participants also discussed some general high-level principles regarding sustainable interaction design—the notion that the design of systems should incorporate sustainability considerations. A few design principles for sustainable interaction design, including the following, were discussed: • Any new design should also include information on what will happen to the materials or products that it replaces. • Human-computer interaction (HCI) research can play a large role by highlighting the future value of objects. • The second and third user of any product should receive the same satisfaction as the original owner. A number of projects incorporate at least some aspects of sustainable interaction design, and several are described in the previous sections. Additional examples include corporate research done by SAP, Inc., and academic work done by HCI researchers at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). SAP has developed Sourcemap, which provides a way to track and improve supply chains. Using an open-data platform, users can track where each of their foodstuffs comes from. For example, a catering company can provide a map showing the route by which of all of its products were shipped, or individuals can determine how far each of their breakfast items traveled. Stepgreen, created by CMU’s HCI researchers, is another example that allows users to track the benefits of making sustainable choices. Users can identify sustainable actions that they are already taking, such as turning off lights not being used or walking to locations less than a mile away, or they can commit to future sustainable choices. Stepgreen tracks the amount of savings in dollars and carbon dioxide emissions for each action. Interaction design can also be used to encourage dialogues among scientists, decision makers, and citizens. Interaction designers can help bridge the gap between scientific knowledge and public perception, can build support, and can promote discourse leading toward solutions. Participants Eli Blevis, Sustainable interaction design: Invention and disposal, renewal, and reuse, in Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing, New York, N.Y.: Association for Computing Machinery (2007). ""Appendix A: Summary of a Workshop on Innovation in Computing and Information Technology for Sustainability."" National Research Council. 2012. . Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/13415. noted that bridging this gap has been a particular challenge in climate science and that there is an opportunity for interaction design to play a role. For instance, whereas some of the previously mentioned tools can help people make more informed choices about reducing their negative impact on the climate, tools are also needed that inform people’s preparation and responses to climate change as a chronic sustainability challenge. Interaction systems are also needed to deal with the likely increase in the severity of natural disasters and crises due to climate change. Participants discussed the concept of a “Dashboard Earth” that could be used to provide information about what is happening and where. Interaction design can also be used to develop interactive systems that could help with orderly evacuation in a natural disaster, for example, providing the information to local, regional, national, and intergovernmental policy makers about who can go where and how many people each location can absorb. Interaction design can be used to persuade and show people how to live with fewer resources, as matters of sustainability and preparation and adaptation. The interaction design of tools like social media is needed to help persuade people and various levels of organizations to care for others in the face of climate change and its effects. Interaction design can also assist in the public discourse about and support for certain sorts of solutions and in fostering public understanding. Participants argued that all of these tools and more need to provide information at the local, regional, national, and global level and to help people respond efficiently during crises. SESSION 4: OVERCOMING OBSTACLES TO SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERY AND TRANSLATING SCIENCE TO PRACTICE Committee member David Culler, University of California, Berkeley, and David Douglas, National Ecological Observatory Network, led the discussion during the final session, which highlighted some of the impediments to developing and deploying innovative information technologies for sustainability challenges. Guiding questions for this session were as follows: • What are the motivations for and impediments to applying innovative information technologies to sustainability challenges and how do they differ by domain? National Research Council, , Washington, D.C.: The National Academies Press (2010). ""Appendix A: Summary of a Workshop on Innovation in Computing and Information Technology for Sustainability."" National Research Council. 2012. . Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/13415. • How can large-scale science addressing real-world problems be made credible, if reproducibility is not possible? • What lessons can be applied from the transformation of the Internet into a critical infrastructure that must avoid ossification? • What is the appropriate mix of empiricism, innovation, and application in order for computer science to have an impact in the area of environmental sustainability? Participants suggested considering broad sustainability challenges in the context of the energy challenge. The interconnected nature of people’s basic resource needs, such as water, energy, and transportation, and the economic arrangements among these resources create a very complex problem. However, these interactions also mean that the energy challenge can serve as a useful proxy for sustainability challenges related to other limited resources. The primary function of the electric grid is to deliver high-quality, low-cost power to millions of customers who are geographically distributed over thousands of miles. The fact that consumers have been able to make use of the grid without needing much knowledge about their own consumption patterns, or about where the power is coming from, has contributed to rapid economic and industrial growth. People have been able to use a comparatively inexpensive resource—energy created mostly through the burning of fossil fuels—essentially indiscriminately to expand the production of products that spur the economy. Additionally, enabling a usage model in which consumers could remain ignorant of their own consumption patterns meant that the grid has been tasked with delivering a high-quality commodity at extremely low cost. Moreover, the expectation has been that power would be delivered immediately as needed. The power grid is expected to meet these goals with minimal forecasting or anticipation of that need, except at very coarse granularity, and without inventory storage along the energy supply chain. The current energy model is increasingly complex, with numerous sources of energy, a variety of stakeholders and consumers, and a not insignificant fraction lost during transport. A pressing sustainability challenge revolves around these questions: How can energy use be reduced, and can it be done without significant economic hardship? The following question was discussed: Where and how can computer science fit into this picture? shows the percentage of energy use in the United States by type. Each of these types represents an opportunity for reduction in ""Appendix A: Summary of a Workshop on Innovation in Computing and Information Technology for Sustainability."" National Research Council. 2012. . Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/13415. FIGURE A.4 Energy consumption in the United States, by type of use. SOURCE: Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. demand. Commercial light use and residential heating make up the bulk of their respective building types, but several other smaller items make up the rest of the energy usage. Perhaps reductions in several of these “low-hanging fruit” items can contribute significantly in reducing total energy consumption. Insufficient Scope and Scale of Research and Development Funding to Fuel IT-Enabled Innovation in the Electricity Sector Challenged to consider opportunities for IT and CS research to contribute to sustainability, participants reflected on the history of IT successes and on whether those successes might offer important lessons. The enormous payoffs from IT R&D investment have been investigated by several studies of the National Research Council’s Computer Science and Telecommunications Board, including Evolving the High Performance Computing and Communications Initiative to Support the Nation’s Infrastructure (1995); Funding a Revolution: Government Support for Computing Research (1999); Making IT Better: Expanding Information Technology Research to Meet ""Appendix A: Summary of a Workshop on Innovation in Computing and Information Technology for Sustainability."" National Research Council. 2012. . Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/13415. (2000); and (2003). These reports have shown how research partnerships between the federal government and industry ultimately led to the creation of many wellknown multibillion-dollar industries. These results suggest the potential sustainability payoffs from the right investments in IT. Many of the advancements presented in the CSTB reports, such as those in processors or networking, required significant financial investment from both industry and government. The software industry spends approximately 13.5 percent of revenues on R&D, the health care industry spends about the same, and the computer hardware industry spends about half of that. By contrast, R&D spending by the electric utility sector is about 0.1 percent of revenues, perhaps due to the fact that the sector has been very stable, with little innovation or push for innovation, a context that seems to be changing rapidly. Sustainability is a large, broad-ranging problem, and apportioning limited research dollars to effective ends is a difficult challenge. One consequence of this low level of support and the resulting small number of technical researchers at utility companies is that opportunities for partnership between academic researchers and utility companies are rare. Government funding is also limited. In 2010, the U.S. Department of Energy provided $130 million and created three different energy hubs in innovation. However, a workshop attendee commented that even this amount is much smaller than would be needed if a significant shift were to be made toward sustainable energy sources or if total energy consumption were to be decreased. Misalignment of Incentives for More Sustainable Generation and Use The energy-utility market, as described earlier, has evolved to provide a critical resource, at low price, with supply almost instantaneously National Research Council, Evolving the High Performance Computing and Communications Initiative to Support the Nation’s Infrastructure, Washington, D.C.: National Academy Press (1995); National Research Council, Funding a Revolution: Government Support for Computing Research, Washington, D.C.: National Academy Press (1999); National Research Council, Making IT Better: Expanding Information Technology Research to Meet Society’s Needs, Washington, D.C.: National Academy Press (2000); National Research Council, Washington, D.C.: The National Academies Press (2003).

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/13415. matched to demand. Although historically it required considerable innovation and tremendous capital investment to meet these constraints, there are additional market impediments to creating a more sustainable system. Perhaps the most obvious is that, generally speaking, utility companies have historically charged for usage by the kilowatt-hour, resulting in little economic incentive to reduce the number of kilowatt-hours used. regulation prevents vertical monopolies, but there is often an interest in owning an entire vertical market—one organization owning or operating both the production and the delivery systems—and extracting marginal profit mostly by locking customers in to the system. Participants observed that horizontal market stratification would help drive efficient markets. This limited-competition system means that the utility industry is not particularly motivated to shift technologies, which may drive up the cost of production in the short term. The question again is where the investment to drive new technologies is going to come from. While the utility companies have little incentive to encourage reductions in energy use, consumers themselves have undervalued energy. As noted earlier, consumers have become accustomed to inexpensive power and also have little understanding of how power is produced and of the resulting environmental damage. Consumers have even less knowledge or easy insight into the energy costs of producing and transporting foods and goods. The energy cost, including the accompanying externalities such as environmental and social damage, is not easily reflected in the price of goods. If these costs were reflected directly in the price, more energy-efficient choices might be made. Impediments to making progress on sustainability in addition to those discussed above include infrastructural and organizational realities. The scale of the sustainability problem is immense, and the infrastructure systems that bear on sustainability—such as energy, water, and food distribution—are just as massive. In addition, diversity of use within the system adds a level of complexity. The use and design of each building site and the water distribution and transportation system of each city have unique characteristics that make a one-size-fits-most solution impractical. Furthermore, the traditional production cycle does not apply; infrastructures are not projects that are developed, improved, and shipped; they are built once. Cities are developed over a span of 100 years or more, with refinements, changes, and “debugging” taking place little by little. Once these systems are rolled out, even if they do not function as well as they could, they become, in effect, stranded assets. The market structure also creates impediments to better technological change. The market is highly fragmented; energy sources vary, and ""Appendix A: Summary of a Workshop on Innovation in Computing and Information Technology for Sustainability."" National Research Council. 2012. . Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/13415. energy use is even more dispersed. Each industry that participates in the energy market has its own unique needs, regulatory requirements, and certification programs. Individual industries and companies create their own technology standards. Unique industry and corporate technology standards also make one-size-fits-most solutions impractical. Efforts to deploy, say, monitoring and data-collection tools in these sorts of environments are challenged. Equipment used for monitoring the use of each resource system—energy, water, food—within cities becomes difficult to build and deploy. Additionally, these monitoring devices, if built in to the initial infrastructure, need to be able to collect a wide variety of data and be sturdy enough to function over long periods of time. The critical nature of the sustainability problem and energy crisis combined with their scale and complexity often means that researchers are dedicating entire careers working to address pieces of the problem. This scale and complexity mean that choosing avenues of investigation is a high-risk proposition. If a path that a researcher follows turns out to be incorrect or a dead end, the mistake can be career ending. Furthermore, these sustainability and energy problems are inherently multidisciplinary, which adds another barrier to academic work often confined to single disciplines. In many subfields of computer science, the ultimate goals can be defined reasonably clearly, even if the description of the goal is as simple as: Make computers faster. Well-defined goals also imply a clear definition of success. While there are some goals to work toward in addressing the sustainability problem, such as decreasing the levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, they tend to be less well defined (should the focus be on lowering energy use or on the use of more sustainable energy sources?) and have less clear benchmarks for success. In the fourth session of the workshop, participants brainstormed about potential further contributions of computer science to sustainability. Computer science is well positioned to provide technical options that could help address some sustainability challenges. Additionally, the distinctive culture, methodologies, and approaches of computer science may shed new light on methodologies, processes, and concepts that could be useful in sustainability. Speakers discussed several such cultural attributes, including the following: ""Appendix A: Summary of a Workshop on Innovation in Computing and Information Technology for Sustainability."" National Research Council. 2012. . Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/13415. • Computer scientists are used to developing and deploying new tools almost constantly and to doing these things quickly. Participants argued that this flexible, catch-all approach allows for broader ideas and more creativity. • Computer scientists have experience building big things, such as massive integrated circuits, which have tens of millions of design points that need to be correct when built, and software artifacts that today measure in the millions of lines of code. Computer scientists also understand system approaches. • Computer scientists tend to understand the value of open systems and are often forced to engage with demands for system-level considerations such as compatibility and interoperability. Distributed grid management, ecosystems understanding, crisis and disaster response, and resource tracking and optimization can all benefit from open, interoperable information systems. With large amounts of data being collected, privacy and security become an issue, which, again, computer scientists have experience managing. • Business transformation, often with efficiency as a goal. As new technologies have become available, the computer science industry has transformed itself several times. For example, participants noted that data centers are drastically different now than they were just 2 years ago. This change has been driven partly by efficiency concerns. Furthermore, computer science has been fundamental in transforming other industries, for example, car ownership, media consumption, and banking, in interesting ways. Advances in smartphones, the Global Positioning System, and human-computer interaction have contributed to the success of shortterm car-use services, such as Zipcar; advances in telecommunications networks and file compression have made Internet video streaming a viable alternative to the video store; and computer and information security have encouraged confidence in online banking. • Because sustainability efforts are complex, multidisciplinary problems, universities will need new ways to teach scientists and engineers to resolve these problems. Computer science has historically adapted to changes in curriculum and changes in the overall technological environment by shifting teaching techniques very The Internet is an example in which computer science has incorporated open-information systems, shared standards, and a complex understanding of intellectual property. Although there have been questions and debates about appropriate infrastructure, standards, and intellectual property, especially as more of the Internet has been commercialized, there is still copious knowledge that can be gleaned from the computer science community on building interdisciplinary, complex systems.

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/13415. rapidly. These educational tools, developed within the computer science discipline, can help develop the next wave of scientists and engineers. This session resulted in a wide-ranging discussion from the participants at the workshop. Several key points raised are outlined below: • Within the information technology industry, significant innovation has been accomplished at small businesses or start-ups, which then are often acquired by large corporations. This suggests that small amounts of money could fund highly innovative projects in sustainability, given the proper organizational structure and incentive. • Although sustainability can be viewed in many ways as a technical problem, it will not be solved through technological solutions alone. Some people conjecture that in addition to major scientific and technical breakthroughs to meet sustainability challenges, large-scale social change will be needed, perhaps even on the scale of the U.S. civil rights movement. Computer scientists can contribute tools that encourage individual participation in addressing sustainability challenges. • Small businesses often require specialized information that can be hard to acquire. Computational techniques and technologies can help by providing ways to collect, aggregate, distribute, and analyze data, as well as techniques for communication and coordination as appropriate. • There are trade-offs in discussing solutions. For example, raising temperatures in server rooms may reduce cooling loads but lead to higher failure rates. These trade-offs and failure rates have to be fully understood so that the best trade-offs can be made. • Domain scientists (such as ecologists, transportation specialists, civil and power engineers) need to share information and knowledge with people doing innovation, including computer scientists. The first step for computer science might simply be finding a better way to present these data, which would help policy makers. Decision makers need to understand the data more clearly before they can form policy. An example was given of a case in which a number of local coffee shops were interested in purchasing biodegradable products. Today, biodegradable cups are more expensive and are only affordable if purchased in very large quantities; IT can link companies willing to purchase and share large shipments. Also, not all biodegradable cups are biodegradable to the same extent, an information gap that could be solved with more usable data. However, computer scientists typically have little knowledge about the chemical makeup of products, and so there is also a need for coordination across multiple disciplines and industries.

Estrin, University of California, Los AngelesChair, Committee on Computing Research for Environmental and Societal Sustainability Session 1: Expanding Science and Engineering with Novel CS/IT Methods: “The Need to Turn Numbers into Knowledge” Committee respondent: What are some example areas of efforts in sustainability and related research where the interface of disciplinary and interdisciplinary research with new methods in computer and information science can generate new innovations and knowledge? One example is the smart grid, which provides a physical and information technology medium where new levels of efficient and clean energy and information management are possible, and where new levels of data security are needed. Discussion topics range from grid management to the introduction of smart management and charging systems for low-carbon electric vehicles. Another example is ecological resilience and ecosystem function, which is the monitoring and modeling of ecological change and of the interactions related to ecological robustness and requires new tools for temporal and spatial resolution, new methods to explore the dynamics of connectivity in ecological systems, and teasing out the ranges of anthropogenic impacts.

Session 2: Understanding, Tracking, and Managing Uncertainty Throughout the Science-to-Policy Pipeline Committee respondent: Explicit representation of uncertainty is rare in the science-to-policy pipeline. Data products resulting from fusing information from multiple instruments are often treated as exact when input to models. Outputs from predictive and simulation models are often treated as exact when input to policy making. Policy optimization for management (e.g., reserve design, fishing quotas, habitat conservation plans) often is not robust to uncertainty in the problem formulation or the objectives. Uncertainty about future decision making and imperfect implementation of policies injects additional uncertainty into planning for the future. • What are the sources of uncertainty that should be explicitly captured? • What methods are suitable for explicitly representing uncertainty? • Is the technological state of the art sufficient to model the many different flavors of uncertainty present in large-scale sustainability problems? If not, what characterizes the types of uncertainty that are insufficiently modeled? • What methods are suitable for assessing uncertainty in each stage of the pipeline? What shortcomings need to be addressed? • Is the state of the art in human factors, interfaces, and CSCW (computer-supported cooperative work) sufficient to support the large-scale systems, models, and data sets that are necessary to tackle large-scale sustainability problems? If not, what needs are unmet? • What are the appropriate techniques for working with uncertain data in data fusion, data assimilation, predictive modeling, simulation modeling, and policy optimization? • Is a pipeline architecture sufficient, or do we need a fully coupled architecture in which policy questions can reach all the way back to guide data collection and data fusion? • How can explicit uncertainty representations be integrated into scientific workflow tools? • Are there alternatives to explicit uncertainty representations that can improve the robustness of management policies to all of these sources of uncertainty?

In designing and developing smarter systems, an important question is how to embed interfaces that work. The human-system interaction literature is replete with counterexamples and numerous failed cognitive models, serving as cautionary tales. Complicating matters, human-system interaction issues arise both with regard to individuals in homes and offices and for administrators of larger systems or facilities. Further, interactions occur at different scales—on the one hand in a day-to-day time frame for users and on the other in ways that allow incorporation of feedback from the system either to the system itself or to decision makers thinking about larger-scale resource management considerations, for example. • How can data and information be presented at the appropriate granularity and timescale to be most effective? What system, application, and user factors bear on the human-system interaction design choices? • Describe the potential impacts of the various contexts and tradeoff decisions that might need to be made, including the impact of context (e.g., stakeholders, and so on); the impact of large versus small groups versus individuals; the impact of income; the impact of use by or for cities versus businesses versus individuals; the role of middleware, the supply chain, and so on. • How do human factors affecting energy use drive the use and design of technology? How can this be accounted for? When are power, networking, products, and so on really needed? Discuss human choice and its impact on consumption, disposal, reuse, and so on. “Greening Through IT” “Residential Energy Measurement and Disaggregated Data” “Sustainable Interaction Design” ""Appendix A: Summary of a Workshop on Innovation in Computing and Information Technology for Sustainability.""

A broad and growing literature describes the deep and multidisciplinary nature of the sustainability challenges faced by the United States and the world. Despite the profound technical challenges involved, sustainability is not, at its root, a technical problem, nor will merely technical solutions be sufficient. Instead, deep economic, political, and cultural adjustments will ultimately be required, along with a major, long-term commitment in each sphere to deploy the requisite technical solutions at scale. Nevertheless, technological advances and enablers have a clear role in supporting such change, and information technology (IT) is a natural bridge between technical and social solutions because it can offer improved communication and transparency for fostering the necessary economic, political, and cultural adjustments. Moreover, IT is at the heart of nearly every large-scale socioeconomic system-including systems for finance, manufacturing, and the generation and distribution of energy-and so sustainability-focused changes in those systems are inextricably linked with advances in IT. The focus of is ""greening through IT,"" the application of computing to promote sustainability broadly. The aim of this report is twofold: to shine a spotlight on areas where IT innovation and computer science (CS) research can help, and to urge the computing research community to bring its approaches and methodologies to bear on these pressing global challenges. focuses on addressing medium- and long-term challenges in a way that would have significant, measurable impact. The findings and recommended principles of the Committee on Computing Research for Environmental and Societal Sustainability concern four areas: (1) the relevance of IT and CS to sustainability; (2) the value of the CS approach to problem solving, particularly as it pertains to sustainability challenges; (3) key CS research areas; and (4) strategy and pragmatic approaches for CS research on sustainability. 1 Roles and Opportunities for Information Technology in Meeting Sustainability Challenges 2 Elements of a Computer Science Research Agenda for Sustainability 3 Programmatic and Institutional Opportunities to Enhance Computer Science Research for Sustainability Appendix A: Summary of a Workshop on Innovation in Computing and Information Technology for Sustainability Appendix B: Biographies of Committee Members and Staff You're looking at OpenBook, NAP.edu's online reading room since 1999.

Below is the uncorrected machine-read text of this chapter, intended to provide our own search engines and external engines with highly rich, chapter-representative searchable text of each book. Because it is UNCORRECTED material, please consider the following text as a useful but insufficient proxy for the authoritative book pages. 10 The benchmarking process consists of five phases. These phases are as follows: planning, analysis, integration, action, and maturity. Exhibit 5 illustrates each phase of the benchmarking process. These specific phases and the 12 adapted steps that constitute the phases are described in more detail in the following sections. 4.1 Planning The critical steps involved in planning are as follows: â¢ Identify function to benchmark; â¢ Identify best-in-class organizations in that function; â¢ Select performance measures; and â¢ Identify data collection methods. Each of these steps is described in more detail below. Identify Function to Benchmark A key first step in planning a benchmarking study is to identify the function to benchmark. This begins by establishing one or more measures of output to be benchmarked, which could be a product or commodity, an amount of economic output, quantities of commodities shipped, or activity units such as vehicle miles traveled. By identifying a specific output of interest, the benchmarking sponsor (i.e., organization conducting the study) can more easily determine the function responsible for that output. Knowledge of the responsible functional unit guides the comparison of different departments, organizations, or industries on a âone-to-oneâ basis as opposed to attempting to interpret how data from one functional level translates to another. Furthermore, targeting the functions responsible for a given output allows the sponsor to col- lect the appropriate data regarding specific processes and supporting practices that contribute to the desired output. Given that processes are driven by day-to-day practices, benchmarking studies typi- cally focus on identifying the components and operational steps involved in an individual work process. Through a series of deductive steps, the work process studied is the process deemed responsible, at least in part, for the exemplary performance (i.e., desired outcome) of the organization. A work process involves repeated steps that are performed within a par- ticular sequence translating input into output to generate value for the consumer. The way in which this work process is performed or the method used (âthe howâ of a process) is often referred to as a practice. A benchmarking study helps to clarify the practices used to perform C h a p t e r 4 Steps in Benchmarking Process Steps in Benchmarking process 11 the work process in order to answer the question, âhow is this work process conducted?â See Exhibit 6. In the planning phase of the benchmarking study, the sponsor should also outline questions to clarify such as, âhow is success of this work process measured?â which refers to the performance metrics used by the organization and âwhat resources and behaviors, including the people, tech- nology, and other assets, enable the conduct of this work process?â which are referred to as the âinputsâ or âenablers.â To answer these questions, sponsors target the process owner for partici- pation in the benchmarking study. The process owner is the employee or group of employees who implement the steps involved in a particular work process. To understand the systematic steps involved in a process, benchmarking sponsors should plan to conduct process mapping. Organizations often use management tools such as Demingâs concept of Total Quality Management or the Baldrige Criteria for Excellence to guide process mapping. The result of process mapping is typically a workflow diagram that helps to clarify the prac- tices or steps involved in a process or series of parallel processes. The following are the steps that constitute the development of a process mapping flowchart: Determine the boundariesâThis refers to where the process begins and ends and which other processes feed into the process. 1. Identify function to benchmark. 2. Identify best-in-class organizations in that function. 3. Select performance measures. 4. Identify data collection 5. Collect data internally & externally. 6. Measure and compare organizationsâ performance 7. Identify best practices to close gap. 8. Communicate findings and obtain buy-in. 9. Develop action plan. 10. Implement actions and monitor progress. 11. Close performance gap 12. Integrate practices into processes. Analysis Planning Integration Action Maturity Adapted from Camp, R. C. (1989). Benchmarking: The Search for Industry Best Practices That Lead to Superior Performance, ASQ Quality Press, 4â6. Exhibit 5. Typical benchmarking process. 12 handbook on applying environmental Benchmarking in Freight transportation List the stepsâThe developer must determine the desired level of specificity in the flowchart. If a benchmarking sponsor is seeking to mimic the process to achieve a specific outcome, typically, the process mapping will detail every decision point and finite action. Each process mapping step or task should begin with a verb to illustrate an action to be taken. Sequence the stepsâOnce the steps have been documented, the developer typically moves the steps into their proper location in the process flowchart and includes arrows or lines to show the relationship and sequence between steps in the process. Draw appropriate symbolsâEach different type of step has its own symbol. For example, ovals are often used to represent the start or end of a process but boxes and rectangles are used for tasks or activities performed as part of the process. Arrows are used to show the direction of the process flow. Multiple arrows leading out of a box/rectangle typically represent a decision point, which is represented by a diamond. Exhibit 7 shows an example of how a process mapping flowchart should be constructed. Use a system model approachâThe process mapping flowcharts should be created using a system model approach where the interrelationships among activities, practices, and processes are highlighted. A complete flowchart would illustrate how a series of processes or parallel pro- cesses work together to achieve an outcome. Thus, the final chart may include multiple flowcharts like the one presented in Exhibit 7, all constructed in âswimmer lanesâ to illustrate timelines and sequencing. Contextual factors that should be included in the flowchart are the input (people, machines, technology, and other materials), output (desired outcome or results), control (rules followed by the best-in-class partners), and feedback (information obtained via data collection). Check for completenessâThis includes ensuring all of the information (such as dates and titles) in the chart is accurate. Often, follow-up interviews with key stakeholders or the process owners can help verify the contents of the process mapping flowchart.

Relationships among practices, processes, and outcomes.8 8Based on concepts described in The Basics of Benchmarking by Robert Damelio. Steps in Benchmarking process 13 Finalize the flowchartâThis final development step may include collecting additional data to determine not only whether the process steps have been accurately documented but also whether or not the process is being conducted in the proper way. The flowchart developer should docu- ment any recommended deviations so process improvements can be noted. It is important that the data collector conducting the benchmarking study be intimately familiar with the practices, processes, outcomes, and related enablers within his/her own organization. This information is needed to guide the type of data collected, help define the questions that need to be asked of the benchmarking partner, and determine how the processes might be transferable to the sponsor organization. Process mapping can be an important tool to examine business operations that affect the environmental performance of a company. For example, a business might want to map its process for vehicle maintenance to improve the operation and emissions performance of in-use vehicles. A railroad might want to map the process by which trains and railcars are handled in a classification yard to reduce locomotive idling. A shipper might want to map the process for how freight transportation is procured and routed to assess whether its environmental footprint can be reduced by using transportation options that are less energy intensive. A receiver could map out how freight is scheduled and handled at its loading dock to determine if there are opportunities to reduce truck idling. A trucking company might want to map procedures for Source: Ahoy, C. (1999), Facilities News. Exhibit 7.

PrioritiesâFocus on the most important key performance indicators, operating metrics, and attendant environmental and business impacts. Although a benchmarking sponsor may be interested in studying the processes that drive a number of successful outcomes, it is important that the sponsor prioritize which ones are most important. The sponsor needs to focus its interests in order to conduct a thorough study of a particular outcome. This focus allows the organization to effectively prepare itself in terms of structure, culture, and employee engagement for transformation that will likely occur as a result of adopting new practices and processes that will help achieve a similar desired outcome. Focus- ing on multiple areas of interest can distract the organization in its study by straining resources, confusing data collection, and segregating the organization in terms of the changes its employees will be willing to accept and implement. Thus, it is important that sponsor organizations identify priorities in terms of which operating metrics and environmental/ business impacts are of most importance to target first. The following factors should be considered and weighted in defin- ing priorities relative to environmental benchmarking: 1. Which outcomes will have the greatest positive environ- mental impact? 2. Which outcomes and processes will be the most cost- effective to replicate? 3. Which processes will be most efficient to implement (i.e., which outcomes will be achieved in the shortest time- frame)? 4. Which outcomes and processes will require the greatest transformation when adopted by the sponsor organization? In answering these questions, benchmarking sponsors typically find it most advantageous to begin by studying the outcomes and processes that will attain the greatest impact with the least amount of resource allocation and transforma- tion by the organization. In other words, it is recommended that sponsors initially select priorities that will be easily pal- atable to the organization and demonstrate a clear payoff in the conduct of the benchmarking study. Logistics managers often refer to setting âSMARTâ goals (i.e., those that are spe- cific, measureable, attainable, with resources available for implementation and that are time-bound). Identify Best-in-Class Organizations in that Function An important component of designing a benchmarking study is the selection of organizations to be used for pur- poses of comparison. This is a particularly important issue in freight transportation, because there are many features that can influence performance, including the weight of cargo, the Logistics Center of Excellence Benchmarking Study A leading energy companyâs logistics center of excellence benchmarked itself against its logistics peers and developed a carbon measurement and mitigation program based on this information. Peer firms selected for comparison included Dell Inc., Toyota Motor Corporation, Caterpillar Inc., and Siemens AG. In this context, peer firms were leading manufacturers of industrial and other types of equipment that faced similar logistics challenges. The elements considered in this benchmarking exercise included the commitments of these firms to fuel efficiency and emissions reductions, key performance indicators (KPIs), current environmental performance, and future targets for logistics activities. Among the peer organizations, both Dell and Toyota had made substantial improvements to their logistics operations. Strategies employed included reducing the use of packaging, increasing the loading of containers, and reducing emissions per ton- kilometer by changing the port of entry to reduce truck miles traveled. The logistics center of excellence used the information obtained from the benchmarking study to implement a carbon measurement program. Mitigation programs were put into place to shift freight to less polluting modes, including a wind turbine supply chain optimization program that shifted the port of entry for parts. In a single year, the supply chain optimization program reduced GHG emissions by 1,000 tons and reduced logistics costs by $5.4 million. Steps in Benchmarking process 15 geography over which it is moved, the type of service provided, and the level of congestion of the transportation facility. The choice of entities to benchmark against can be driven by a variety of cri- teria, including a desire to compare against a similar type of operation, the location of innovation, or the availability of willing partners. The benchmarking literature suggests a number of different types of benchmarking and targets for comparison. In general, benchmarking studies can be classified according to the type of partner that one wishes to benchmark against, the nature and objective of the study, and the purpose of the partnership. A benchmarking study can combine several of these different categories. Exhibit 8 describes these different types of benchmarking studies in detail. Although benchmarking is often defined as an outward-looking exercise, some firms may have business units that operate independently from each other. In those instances, internal benchmark- ing can be done. Comparing oneself against direct competitors (competitive benchmarking) is per- haps the most common conception of benchmarking; however, the desire of firms to protect trade secrets may limit exchange of information among competitors in some cases. Many proponents of benchmarking argue that firms need to go beyond the group of direct competitors to have access to a larger universe of leading companies and innovative practices. Industry benchmarking draws comparisons to competitors in the same industry who may not be direct competitors, like truck- load and less-than-truckload (LTL) carriers. Functional benchmarking examines business func- tions between dissimilar industries. For instance, the logistics function between a manufacturer and a retailer could be compared. Generic benchmarking compares similar processes in significantly different types of firms or organizations. For instance, a vehicle maintenance process in a trucking company could be benchmarked against similar maintenance procedures used by the military. The nature of the object of study may also vary. Firms may engage in both process bench- marking and product benchmarking. Strategic benchmarking may look at higher level orga- nizational and management practices. Future benchmarking is forward looking and seeks to ascertain new technologies and breakthroughs that may eventually become benchmarks. Lastly, the purpose of a benchmarking partnership may be collaborative or competitive. Classification Type Meaning Type of Partner Internal Comparing best practices within an organization â for instance, a large firm with multiple subsidiaries could have these entities compare their performance Competitive Comparing best practices with direct competitors â for instance a large national truckload carrier benchmarking against another large national truckload carrier Industry Comparing best practices within the same industry including non-competitors â for instance comparing a truckload carrier to an LTL carrier Functional Comparing the same functional units in companies that may not be direct competitors â for instance comparing the logistics function of Ford and Wal- Mart Generic Comparing generic processes between organizations that may be in unrelated industries â for instance comparing the generic vehicle maintenance process between a trucking company and the military Nature of the Object of Study Process Used to compare operations and work practices Product Used to compare products or services Strategic Used to compare organizational structures and management practices with a more general and longer term focus on understanding what makes leading companies great Future A type of benchmarking that is forwarding looking and seeks to identify industry breakthroughs that will eventually become industry standards and benchmarks Purpose of Partnership Competitive Goal of the comparison is to surpass the best in the industry Collaborative Goal of comparison is to foster a learning environment & share knowledge Exhibit 8. Typology of benchmarking studies. 16 handbook on applying environmental Benchmarking in Freight transportation Select Performance Measures Performance measures are used to gauge the results of implementing practices. In a bench- marking study, metrics and measures identified in reports such as corporate sustainability reports (CSRs) may be used; however, as part of planning for a benchmarking study, performance mea- sures may have to be developed. In fact, the current performance measures used by other orga- nizations may indicate what should be benchmarked. In other words, if a partner organization presents specific metrics that speak of best-in-class performance in a particular environmen- tal area, it may be the processes performed within that function that the sponsor organization chooses to benchmark. However, caution should be taken when using the measures presented by another organization. Without knowing all the variables that were incorporated into their com- putation and the way in which the partner organization operationalizes a concept, there can easily be confusion over what the numbers mean. For example, a metric such as ânumber of preventable environmental accidentsâ may suggest an organization is performing well; however, there may be variability in what is deemed âpreventableâ and what is meant by âaccidents.â Metrics may be in the form of qualitative or quantitative outcomes. Typically, in environmen- tal benchmarking, metrics are quantitative and include absolute, relative, and indexed metrics. Absolute metrics would include total quantities of an organizationâs output, such as total num- ber of hours of idling or total tons of CO2 emissions. Indexed metrics would measure the per- centage of improvement from a baseline (e.g., percent reduction of emissions from 2005 levels). Clean Cargo Working Group: Choice of Performance Metrics The Clean Cargo Working Group (CCWG) is a business-to-business initiative of more than 30 shippers, carriers, and logistics providers that was formed to measure and reduce the environmental impacts of global goods transportation. The groupâs efforts to date have focused primarily on the ocean transport of containerized freight. In developing its metrics, CCWG has tried to balance feasibility (i.e., what data carriers are reasonably able to provide) with materiality (i.e., the data that shippers would like to have). At the same time, CCWG strives to align its metrics and methodologies with leading external standards. For example, CCWG recently revised its metrics for waste, water, and chemicals to align more closely with those of the Clean Shipping Index, an environmental performance measurement system that originated in Sweden and is now widely used throughout Europe. The CCWG metric for CO2 emissions is grams of CO2 per nominal TEU-km. The use of the term ânominalâ in the metric means that the maximum container capacity of the vessel is used (i.e., the vessel is assumed to always be full). To enable this calculation, carriers must provide CCWG with vessel-specific data on fuel consumption by fuel type, distance sailed, and cargo capacity. The carrier must also specify the number of refrigerated containers (âreefersâ) a vessel can accommodate. This information is important because a container ship uses fuel to provide electricity to the cooling units of refrigerated containers. This information allows CCWG to calculate two CO2 emissions factors for each vessel, one for refrigerated containers and one for âdryâ containers. CCWG also asks carriers to identify the trade lane in which a vessel operates. This allows CCWG to assess the average environmental performance of the set (or âstringâ) of vessels that a carrier devoted to a particular trade lane. Comparisons can then be made among the carriers servicing a given trade lane, and an average can be calculated for all carriers servicing a trade lane. The averages are used to benchmark carrier performance in specific trade lanes. In addition, shippers can use the lane-specific emissions factors to produce a more accurate estimate of the CO2 emissions associated with the ocean transport of their shipments. A carrier receives a score for each trade lane based on how its performance stacks up against the average among carriers working in that lane. A carrierâs overall score for CO2 emissions is based on its individual trade lane scores. Steps in Benchmarking process 17 Relative metrics would include metrics such as emissions per mile, emissions per ton-mile or miles per gallon. An important component to interpreting and applying the metrics used across organizations is to know the standards/scales and measurement systems used by the benchmark- ing partner (the studied organization) in order to make the proper conversions and application to the sponsor organization. The following provides an example of how the terms key performance indicators, metrics, and measures would be used in a benchmarking context. A carrier might want to examine a key performance indicator (KPI) such as fuel efficiency. Key performance indica- tors are usually related to an organizationâs critical success factors and business goals. For freight carriers, fuel efficiency would be an important KPI. Fuel use is one of the most impor- tant operating costs and the most important source of CO2 emissions from operations. For the fuel efficiency KPI, one could specify a metric that would be the criteria used to deter- mine if something was fuel efficient. For example, the metric could specify that fuel efficiency be measured in terms of miles per gallon. One could also specify a measure that would be the format and period used to report the performance metric. For example, one could measure the average miles per gallon of refrigerated long-haul tractor trailers for the month. Identify Data Collection Methods A comprehensive benchmarking study should include a detailed data collection plan. This plan describes existing data and records the sponsor intends to obtain, original data to be col- lected, and the timeline, methods, and contacts involved in collecting the data. Sponsor organiza- tions should thoroughly research data that is publicly available on benchmarking partners prior to requesting data from the organizations. By reviewing existing data first, the benchmarking sponsor will have a better sense of what is available, what is still needed, and who the process owners are in the organization. This a priori research helps to reduce the demands on the bench- marking partners and ensures that the sponsors are well prepared and can streamline data col- lection in terms of time and resource requirements. Although it is helpful to identify the metrics used by partner organizations in order to make noteworthy comparisons, the focus of the benchmarking study should be on identify- ing the effective practices that allow an organization to meet specific targets and become an industry leader. Thus, it is recommended that multiple data collection methods and sources be used to collect data. The purpose of this is to ensure information collected is comprehen- sive and deemed accurate because it is verifiable across various sources. Some of the most common means of data collection used in benchmarking are interviews, surveys, and site visits. The means of data collection should not be based solely on convenience but rather on the purpose of the data collection and type of data desired. For example, if depth of data is critical to answering questions such as identifying detailed decision points and steps involved in process mapping, then one-on-one interviews with process owners would be most ben- eficial. However, if the goal of the data collection is to engage multiple stakeholders and subject matter experts at the beginning of a benchmarking study and to develop a large list of practices that relate to specific processes, the sponsor might wish to use focus groups. Focus groups can engage multiple persons at once and leverage the interaction among participants to help generate data. For the instances in which the goal of data collection is to measure the frequency of a practice and create a large representative sample, paper or electronic sur- veys are typically used. Exhibit 9 provides an overview of different types of data collection methods that may be used and the advantages and disadvantages of each, as well as resource considerations. The exhibit also includes sources that specify the means by which the specific data collection method could take place. 18 handbook on applying environmental Benchmarking in Freight transportation Methods Existing Data Review Survey Interview Focus Group Site Visit Definition Analysis and interpretation of information that exists in house or in public domain Questions sent to sample from partner organization (multiple choice; open-ended; forced choice; scaled) A one-on-one meeting with a partner conducted either face to face or via telephone Multiple participants with similar profiles (job title, rank) who are convened to respond to questions from a facilitator An on-premise meeting at the partnerâs facility; combines interview with observation When to Use Before engaging partner organization Need to gather same info from multiple sources; need representative sample to verify data To gather data at a detailed level; to probe stakeholders on particular topics of interest Means for gathering data from multiple sources at once; can be used to reach consensus when there are discrepancies in opinion If observing practices would be valuable (e.g., production line); may be used to help identify enablers Advantage Being prepared/ focused in data collection Permits extensive data gathering; analysis performed by computer; easy to gather large sample and amount of data; phone interviews are inexpensive and shorter, easier to complete than interviews Provides flexibility by allowing for probes/follow-up; allows interviewee to ask questions from a live person; helps to obtain buy-in from key stakeholders Can encourage creative thinking and brainstorming; interaction of participants may reveal new concepts or ideas; can collect data from multiple partner organizations, which can be mutually beneficial for partners and facilitator Can observe to verify practices, processes, enablers, and metrics Disadvantage Finding the appropriate information can be time- consuming Response rates may be low (tough to engage participants); may have confusion about terminology; creative ideas will not be captured; difficult to probe for depth; may be difficult to reach participants via phone for phone surveys; phone surveys are time- consuming because have to call multiple persons Can be time- consuming; interviewees may be reluctant to dedicate 1.0 to 1.5 hours (the typical length of an interview); may need to redirect interviewee to keep him/her on topic Can be time- consuming; focus group members may be reluctant to dedicate the time necessary; may need to redirect focus group members to keep them on topic Requires travel and coordinating schedules (may impact multiple persons at site); typically requires more time than other methods Example Sources Internet; financial reports, sustainability reports; journal (trade, peer- reviewed); news magazine articles Web-based; paper-pencil; e- mailed; phone In person; phone- facilitated (use Internet meeting software, e.g., WebEx, LiveMeeting) At client site or conference facility near client In person Exhibit 9.

(Continued). 4.2 Analysis The analysis phase includes the initiation of data collection and an assessment of findings. To adequately analyze how practices and processes from partner organizations may be used to enhance the sponsor organizationâs behaviors, it is essential to collect data within the bench- marking sponsor organization to know what processes and enablers currently exist, as well as data within the target partner organizations. It is important to understand not only what best practices are being implemented within the partner organization(s), but also where the greatest performance gaps exist between the partner and sponsor organizations and which practices and processes will be most effective in addressing that discrepancy in performance. The following steps are involved in the analysis phase: 1. Collect data internally and externally; 2. Measure and compare current performance âgapâ; and 3. Identify best practices to close the gap. Each of these steps is described in the following sections. Collect Data Internally and Externally As mentioned, it is important that the data collector of the benchmarking study first be well educated on the needs, practices, processes, metrics, and enablers used within his/her own organiza- tion. Detailed knowledge provides context to the study and will help determine the receptivity of the organization to new processes and practices. This information is best gained by speaking with the process owners internally prior to collecting data externally from benchmarking partners. Once the data collector is well versed in the practices within his/her organization, the data collector should then proceed to research information that is available in the public domain. It is both frustrating to a partner and inefficient to ask questions that could have been easily answered 20 handbook on applying environmental Benchmarking in Freight transportation by publicly available data. For environmental benchmarking studies, sustainability reports and company websites often provide a wealth of information. The text box below describes how UPS reports key measures of its environmental performance in its sustainability report. Once the data collector is ready to begin collecting data from the partner organizations, he/she should develop structured protocols that outline key questions for discussion. These protocols should outline the questions of interest that will inform the process mapping and help identify the variables that contribute to the translation of processes into outcomes. The protocols should be structured according to purpose (e.g., open ended is typically best for focus groups while mul- tiple/forced choice are often used in surveys). Furthermore, in addition to collecting data from the benchmarking partner organizations, it may be important to collect data from organizations with which the partner organizations work closely. This can help to verify the processes and outcomes identified and gain a perspective on the enablers and other contextual factors that impact their business. One of the key challenges with collecting data from partner organizations is identify- ing the appropriate participants who will be most knowledge- able about the practices and processes being benchmarked. Ideally, the participants should be the process owners. How- ever, it may be beneficial to initiate data collection by hosting an on-site or phone-facilitated (if geographically dispersed) focus group with senior leadership that serves as an initial data collection of the high-level activities involved in a particular process and to communicate that there is buy-in from the top for the study being conducted. Participants are more willing to provide information if they know the study is being supported by their senior management. These broad focus groups may then be followed by more in-depth interviews, surveys, site visits, or some combination of methods. To encourage participation, it is also beneficial to offer the partner organization something of value in return for its participation. For example, offering to provide to each par- ticipant a summary of benchmarking results across partner organizations is often an effective way to encourage partici- pation. It is important that consent to release information is obtained from all partners and the data collector should be clear about the intent and use of the data collected. Further- more, prior to sharing any data, clearances for confidential information should be obtained from the partner organiza- tion. If there is any question regarding the appropriateness of data or release of information, this should be discussed with legal counsel at the partner organization and the spon- sor organization to ensure the sponsor organization does not violate any ethics codes or confidentiality requirements. Measure and Compare Performance Gap Since ideally the data collector should have thoroughly researched practices and metrics internal to the sponsor orga- nization, an understanding of the current performance of the sponsor organization should already exist prior to data collec- tion. After data are collected, the performance of the partner organizations should be clearer. As discussed in the planning UPS Sustainability Report UPS is widely recognized as a leader in the drive to reduce the environmental impacts of freight transportation. The company rigorously measures and manages dozens of factors that affect fuel efficiency, ranging from which vehicles it uses to how it maintains, routes, loads, and drives those vehicles. In its 2010 Sustainability Report, UPS provided an extensive amount of data on multiple facets of its environmental performance, including water consumption, aircraft emissions, energy consumption, environmental penalties, and reportable spills. Much of this data was reported using metrics that would allow internal or external benchmarking. Such metrics include â¢ CO2 emissions per 1,000 packages, â¢ Energy consumption per 1,000 packages, â¢ Aircraft emissions per available ton-mile, â¢ Water consumption per 1,000 packages, and â¢ Penalties as a percent of all environmental inspections. UPS offers its customers the ability to offset the CO2 emissions generated by the transport of their packages within the United States. Rather than use generic GHG emissions factors to calculate the CO2 emissions associated with its customersâ shipping activities, the company developed a methodology for allocating its total CO2 emissions across its network according to freight flows. Steps in Benchmarking process 21 section on metrics, conversion formulas may be required to establish proportional metrics that can easily be used to make comparisons across organizations. It is important to understand how metrics and measures are defined and to make appro- priate adjustments to facilitate comparisons between organizations. For instance, a trucking company benchmarking emissions per mile would need to ensure that the same definition of miles traveled is used (e.g., revenue miles, total miles). The treatment of owner-operators and leased equipment would need to be comparable across organizations to ensure the usefulness of the data developed. In a similar fashion, a railroad benchmarking fuel consumption per ton-mile would need to ensure that standardized definitions for ton-miles are used (e.g., gross-ton miles, trailing ton-miles). A full understanding of how practices and metrics are used by the partner organizations is necessary to appropriately analyze performance data and make comparisons. Comparative analysis should be used to analyze the performance gaps and indicate where and why gaps exist, as well as the magnitude of the gaps between the partner and sponsor orga- nizations. The analysis conducted to assess the gaps may be a combination of qualitative and quantitative analysis, depending on the type of data collected. The focus of analysis is typically on the differences between practices used in partner and sponsor organizations, especially when external operations by partner organizations are better. In analyzing performance gaps, it is important to understand the inputs or enablers that may contribute to how the practices and processes are performed. These contextual factors may indi- cate whether practices can be wholly adopted by the sponsor organization or must be modified with only partial benefits being recognized. For example, if a partner organization has an entire information technology department that is dedicated to the use of specific software but the spon- sor organization does not, it may be necessary to spend funds training staff on the basic compo- nents of that software or another less costly software application. The software may have reduced capabilities if establishing an entire department is not feasible given resource constraints in the sponsor organization. More discussion on types of enablers is provided in the previous section on planning in which Exhibit 9 provided an illustration of how enablers relate to practices and processes. Exhibit 10 shows a sample map of enabling factors that influence truck fuel economy. There are three types of performance gaps: negative gap, operations at parity, and positive gap. Negative gaps suggest that practices of partner organizations are more sophisticated and produc- tive than those of the sponsor organization while positive gaps indicate areas where the sponsor Source: White Paper on Fuel Economy, Kenworth Truck Company Exhibit 10. Fishbone chart of fuel economy enablers. 22 handbook on applying environmental Benchmarking in Freight transportation organization is advanced in performance of specific practices beyond the partner organizations. Parity, also referred to as a âneutral gap,â indicates practices for which there are no notable per- formance differences between the sponsor and partner organizations. Sponsor organizations make the mistake of solely focusing their efforts and action plans on the negative gaps, but all gaps provide useful information that the sponsor organization should integrate to make effective changes. The distinction between positive, neutral, and negative should be used to prioritize the order with which practice and process improvements are addressed rather than being used to disregard specific processes. For example negative gaps should be categorized as practices and processes that need immediate focus. Less substantial negative gaps and neutral gaps can be given a âraise-the-barâ status where the focus is on setting higher goals and standards to continue what works well. Some neutral and some positive gaps may need to be on a monitor-and-revisit status because, in some cases, it may be diffi- cult to explain why certain positive gaps exist. If the sponsor organization is unable to articulate what they are doing that is allowing them to perform so well in a given area, then the sponsor organization needs to monitor those areas. The sponsor organization should recognize that the positive gap could quickly change to a negative direction if the organization does not know what factors are allowing for positive performance and is ignorant of how to replicate those factors. For negative gaps, it is important to understand the contextual factors and enablers that may account, in part, for those gaps. In some cases, there may be a tradeoff between making process improvements to reduce the performance gap and avoiding other losses that could result from those process improve- ments. For example, a large California utility chose to adopt wind generators to produce energy with the goal of mak- ing environmental improvements that were consistent with some of its counterparts. In adopting this new system, the company quickly discovered that the wind generators were potentially harmful to bird populations, thereby, minimiz- ing one environmental hazard at the expense of another. In sum, it is critical that sponsor organizations not only iden- tify where negative performance gaps exist but also weigh the costs and benefits of addressing those gaps. Identify Best Practices to Close the Gap There are a wide range of strategies that can be used to reduce air emissions and other environmental impacts associated with freight transportation. These include new vehicle technologies, improvements in infrastructure, and operational improve- ments. Vehicle technology strategies can include purchasing new equipment, retrofitting existing equipment, and employ- ing alternative fuels. Operational strategies include reduc- ing equipment idling, shifting freight to less polluting modes, improved training for equipment operators, and improved methods for loading cargo. Infrastructure strategies include electrifying cargo handling equipment and installing equip- ment to provide shore power. There is no definitive list of best practices that is applicable to all organizations. Each organiza- tion must assess which strategies it can employ effectively given the specific markets in which it operates, its business model, and the resources it has available. The effectiveness of a specific SmartWay Transport Partnership The EPA SmartWay Transport Partnership provides information on best practices for saving fuel and reducing emissions for truck carriers, rail carriers, and shippers. The partnership publishes information on best practices and certifies the effectiveness of some vehicle technologies. The partnership provides information on a wide range of technological and operational strategies. For example, some of the strategies promoted by the partnership for truck carriers include â¢ Wide-based tires, â¢ Weight reduction, â¢ Low-viscosity lubricants, â¢ Speed reduction, â¢ Driver training, â¢ Idle reduction, â¢ Automatic tire inflation systems, â¢ Improved freight logistics, â¢ Improved aerodynamics, â¢ Hybrid power trains, and â¢ Longer combination vehicles. Steps in Benchmarking process 23 practice may depend on numerous other related organizational attributes and enablers. As such, it is advisable not to generalize that a specific practice is best in all contexts. Project Future Performance Levels It is important for sponsor organizations to project future performance levels based on whether the adoption or modification of practices is expected to widen, narrow, or have minimal impact on the performance gap identified. In projecting future performance levels, the sponsor organization must understand how practices will be received internally, the adaptations and resources required to adopt new practices, anticipated changes in market demands, and emerging environmental fac- tors. Making these projections requires estimating the direction and magnitude of performance changes expected within the sponsor organization, as well as changes likely to occur over time in the industry and within partner organizations. To represent the change from the current perfor- mance gap to the projected performance gap, it is beneficial to create a âzâ chart. A z chart simply shows how performance levels from the sponsor organization relative to the industry will likely change over time. The three components of a z chart include the trends, the benchmark gap as it currently exists, and future trends. Researchers determine the reasons for the gap, both current and projected, by distinguishing between tactical and strategic actions required to close the gap. 4.3 Integration The integration phase of the benchmarking study refers to the activity of establishing operational targets or goals for organizational transformation. It is recommended that sponsor organizations chart a very specific course and set of steps that will be adopted, including the timeline for adoption, as part of determining when and how new practices will be incorporated. The two primary steps to inte- gration are communicating benchmarking findings to gain acceptance and developing action plans. Communicate Benchmark Findings to Gain Acceptance This step is one of the most critical to successful integration of new practices. To gain accep- tance and implement change, it is important that all employees understand the rationale for changes, have specific knowledge of how the changes should be implemented, and are given a voice in the process. Thus, acceptance must be obtained from the operational up to the manage- ment levels. Support from the top is key to employees adopting new practices. The best way for management to demonstrate to employees that their acceptance of the new strategies is genuine is by providing open and honest answers to employee questions and by demonstrating that man- agement is willing to change its behaviors to welcome the new initiatives. For example, if man- agement expresses to employees that they intend to adopt a blame-free culture when it comes to discussing environmental accidents, then management must demonstrate avoidance of punitive actions when mistakes are reported. Likewise, offering line staff a voice helps them to believe that their contributions to the overall outcome are valuable, thus, those staff are more likely to make the necessary changes to achieve the desired outcome. It is important to keep in mind that the employees are ultimately the people who will implement the new strategies and practices. It is recommended that sponsor organizations develop a detailed communications plan. This plan should identify the following: â¢ Audience to whom the message will be sent; â¢ Content of the message; â¢ Purpose of the message; â¢ Medium by which the message will be delivered (e.g., divisionwide meetings, electronic memo); â¢ Timing of the message; and â¢ Criteria used to determine receptivity to the message. 24 handbook on applying environmental Benchmarking in Freight transportation One of the most effective ways to communicate benchmarking findings and encourage accep- tance of them is by demonstrating the impact that the practices and processes have had for the partner organizations researched. It is much easier to obtain buy-in to the benchmarking find- ings if the purpose for conducting the benchmarking study is presented to employees in the planning phase prior to the initiation of the study. This helps to reduce skepticism and prepare employees for upcoming changes by showing employees that changes will be rooted in compre- hensive research. Furthermore, sponsor organizations should begin communications by articu- lating the positive gaps and the factors that have contributed to those gaps. Negative gaps should then be presented within the context of positive performance to show how some of the activities that have resulted in positive performance may be translated into the practices for which imme- diate improvement is needed. This approach also encourages employees to see how their positive performance is appreciated and can instill a strong sense of ownership for the neutral or negative gaps that exist. Additionally, providing validation through case studies to support the success of specific strategies can help to enhance and convince process owners. Finally, sponsor organiza- tions are encouraged to develop an internal assessment such as an employee survey to determine the degree to which employees are aware of the new strategies and intend to implement new practices. The assessment itself is often a successful communications tool in that it further demonstrates the value of employee initiative to successfully implementing the strategy. Establish Functional Goals Management needs to establish long-term targets and business plans that will support new strategies. These tar- gets should be functional goals that have clear timelines, specific milestones, and measurable results. These goals should be based on new strategies from benchmarking findings, a thorough review of data on employee perspec- tives concerning the benchmarking findings, and an outline of factors to consider in the implementation of practices. These goals should then be clearly communicated through- out the organization and used in the communication approach discussed. Develop Action Plan The process of developing an action plan begins with the construction of operating principle statements. These oper- ating principle statements are integrated into performance goals. The sponsor organization should then outline specific strategies and tactical decisions that help to implement new practices from benchmarking findings by initiating a series of projects. The performance targets established for those projects should become an essential part of the organizationâs daily business and corporate goals. An important component of action plans is the identi- fication of the factors that may serve as facilitators or bar- riers to successful implementation of the benchmarking practices. The sponsor organization can then leverage this information to determine which factors should be maxi- Con-way Enterprise Sustainability Action Plan In 2008, Con-way launched an enterprisewide sustainability initiative with a formal action plan across all business units. The goal of the initiative was to make informed business decisions about sustainability that would have a positive effect on the company, its operations, employees, and customers while reducing the companyâs carbon footprint. During the first year, the company benchmarked current operations and researched methods and best practices for advancing sustainability. Con-way has established a framework for a sustainability evaluation for every functional process in its shared services organization. All of Con-wayâs operating companiesâCon-way Freight, Con-way Truckload, and Menlo Worldwide Logisticsâare members of the SmartWay Transport Partnership, and both Con-way Freight and Con-way Truckload have won SmartWay Excellence Awards. The company has extensively tested fuel-saving technologies and has implemented many of them, including speed governors, single-wide tires, weight reduction, and idling monitoring. Con-way Freight, the companyâs less-than-truckload subsidiary, has reduced miles driven and air emissions from its fleet through multiple network redesigns In 2009, Con-way implemented new recycling and waste reduction practices, launched a major re-lamping project at its freight terminals to save electricity, piloted solar electric generating installations, and instituted use of âgreenâ suppliers. Steps in Benchmarking process 25 mized and which require additional intervention to mitigate them. An action plan should also include the impact the benchmarking practice is anticipated to have, the timeframe for implementing the new practice, the timeframe for a change in output to be recognized, resources needed for implementation, the extent to which the effect of the practice is expected to be positive, and the degree of effort and management control required to implement the practice. 4.4 Action Process team/process owners who actually perform the work should be engaged in the action planning process to help determine the best way to encourage implementation of work pro- cesses. Although the action plan establishes the foundation for what steps and resources will be required to implement practices, this phase refers to the process of taking those steps and acquiring necessary resources. This phase includes translating the benchmarking findings into language employees will understand. While it may not be difficult to translate a best practice into the specific steps involved in the practice and the roles and responsibilities of those per- forming it, it is important to keep in mind the number of different factors (barriers and facili- tators) that may impact how well practices are implemented. Sponsor organizations should engage in a comprehensive analysis as part of the action phase. This analysis includes articulat- ing ways that acceptance of practices can be obtained from multiple parties. This phase also includes anticipating the possible objections employees may have toward implementing the new practices and the assistance (e.g., consultant) the sponsor organization will need to imple- ment the practice. Furthermore, the location and timing of implementation should be well articulated so employees at all levels of the organization are âon the same pageâ regarding when and how to implement the benchmarking practices. To identify potential stumbling blocks to implementation, the sponsor organization should consider pilot-testing practices prior to full implementation. Another key element of this phase is the frequent measurement of performance and change in outcomes to ensure the practices are being implemented true to their intent. To help track implementation, the sponsor organization should maintain a continuous reporting system that allows progress toward the benchmarking findings to be shared across the organization. Implement Specific Actions and Monitor Progress To monitor progress regarding specific actions, it is important to look at both task and behav- ioral changes. Although implementing the tasks properly is essential to achieving the desired outcome, it is also important to obtain attitudinal support from employees to ensure that tasks are performed at the level they should be and with the integrity intended. Recalibrate Benchmarks One of the primary reasons that benchmarking should be continuous is that the timeliness of the practices identified may be affected as behaviors, attitudes, and marketplace demand shifts. It is important that sponsor organizations do not continue to target outdated benchmarking findings. If the sponsor organization maintains an ongoing benchmarking approach, practices that have lost their value can easily be spotted and benchmarks can be recalibrated if needed. By recalibrating benchmarks when needed, the sponsor organization stays on the leading edge of changes in the industry and the organization can be in âready modeâ to quickly anticipate and adapt to necessary changes. 26 handbook on applying environmental Benchmarking in Freight transportation 4.5 Maturity This phase in the benchmarking process refers to the point at which benchmarking becomes institutionalized within the sponsor organization and is viewed as a critical component of the management process. Maturity also refers to the phase in which change is beginning to be real- ized and desired outcomes begin to manifest themselves. The two key steps to maturity include closing the performance gap and integrating practices into processes. Close Performance Gap By applying best practices, negative performance gaps are eliminated. A litmus test for whether effective strides have been made in achieving desired outcomes (e.g., reducing environmental impacts, instituting efficient practices) is if the sponsor organization is being recognized through requests for participation in other benchmarking studies or through the receipt of industry awards. The sponsor organization can communicate its success by creating a system for sharing knowledge gained with others in the industry. Vocalizing success allows the sponsor organiza- tion to acknowledge the leadership position the organization has obtained in the industry and encourages employees to continue to improve performance. Practices Fully Integrated into Process In order for the sponsor organization to become a leader in the industry, best practices iden- tified via benchmarking must be fully incorporated into business processes and desired results realized. Once practices have been successfully implemented, the organization may seek to con- duct benchmarking and make comparative assessment of other operational areas within the company. As part of institutionalizing benchmarking, those that use the results can become educated on the process for conducting benchmarking and thus, use those steps to continuously assess processes internally and make practice improvements. Thus, maturity is achieved when benchmarking is conducted at all levels within the organization and not solely by trained facilita- tors. Ultimately, by fully integrating practices into processes, the organization demonstrates the value of benchmarking to its employees and benchmarking becomes a part of essential business conduct. The case study that follows illustrates how the Canadian National Railway Company (CN) has applied the benchmarking concept to reduce GHG emissions. CNâs GHG Benchmarking Program The Canadian National Railway Company (CN) is Canadaâs largest railway and has extensive trackage in the central United States. CN has implemented a program to benchmark their carbon emissions. CN participates in the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) and uses this program to support their benchmarking program. The following is a brief description of each step of the benchmarking process and how they implemented it at CN. The major phases of a benchmarking process include planning, analysis, integration, and maturity. Each of these steps, and their subcomponents, are described in detail. Planning In the planning phase, corporations select the function to benchmark, establish performance measures, and develop data collection methods. Steps in Benchmarking process 27 Identify function to benchmarkâAs a participant in the CDP, CN has selected GHG emissions as one of its environmental benchmarks. In the CDP methodology, GHG reporting is measured in Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 tiers, which are defined to include direct (Scope 1) and indirect (Scope 2, Scope 3) emission sources. Scope 1 includes GHGs directly emitted from the corporationâs goods movement activities. For CN, the primary source is locomotive emissions through fuel consumption. Also included are GHG emissions from non-locomotive transportation sources, including the CN intermodal trucking fleet and marine shipping fleet. Scope 2 includes indirect emissions associated with corporation activities. CN chose to include electricity consumption in this tier, as reported by utility invoices. This represents emissions from power plant fuel consumption to provide electricity for powering CNâs buildings, supply yards, and other facilities. As of 2011, CN extended its quantitative measurements to include Scope 3 emissions, which include emissions from business travel including air, rail, and road travel. Identify best-in-class organizationsâThe CDP allows companies to compare themselves against their peers. CN can compare itself against other Class I railroads and others in the transportation industry in general. The CDP reporting protocol allows a company to identify the top performer in its industry and see the magnitude of emissions from that performer. In addition, the public report allows any registered member to access the top performerâs submitted survey, which includes emission sources, goals, and strategies to achieve those goals. With this information, CN can set realistic benchmarks according to the achievements of its peers. Within CNâs peer group of seven North American Class I railroads, four of the companies report GHG emissions to the CDP. Select performance measuresâCN has defined two performance measures for reducing GHG emissions and set reduction targets for these measures. Both measures relate directly to Scope 1 emissions through goods movement, the first specifically targeting locomotives and the second encompassing all goods movement modes. Target 1: Carbon intensity of locomotive activities, which account for more than 85 percent of total GHG emissions. This intensity is measured in kg of CO2-e per gross ton-mile (GTM) of rail movement. Between 2008 and 2011, this performance measure has dropped from 12.8 to 11.9 kg CO2-e per GTM. Target 2: Fuel consumption from all goods movement modes. This performance measure is more expansive than the first and includes locomotives, the intermodal trucking fleet, and the marine vessel fleet. Fuel consumption is normalized to cargo volumes and is measured in GTM per gallon of fuel consumed. Identify data collection methodsâThe Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions are directly related to the amount of fuel or electricity purchased and consumed by CNâs operations. Because the company uses an enterprisewide business management package to track expenses, Scope 1 and 2 emissions are calculated with a high degree of precision. CN estimates that Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions are accurate to within a 1 percent precision. Scope 3 emissions are related to activities outside the direct financial control of the organization. For the 2011 submission, CN includes employee business travel as contributors 28 handbook on applying environmental Benchmarking in Freight transportation to Scope 3. These data were compiled directly by the transportation service providers. Fuel consumption data is determined from two data sources: invoice statements, which show the amount of fuel purchased, and storage tank measurements, which show the amount of fuel on reserve in individual project sites. In combination, these measurements allow the company to determine the amount of fuel consumed (not just purchased) within a year. In order to develop ton-mile metrics, CN collects mileage and traffic data to determine the total gross ton-miles of shipments. Although these measurements are not needed to report total GHG emissions to the CDP, they are needed to evaluate progress against the companyâs selected performance measures. Data for Scope 2 emissions are measured from electric utility invoices, provided through the same enterprise management system as the Scope 1 data. The invoices provide data on electricity purchases, which are converted to megawatt-hours (MWh) of consumption using utility rate price rates. Analysis In the analysis phase of the benchmarking process, CN calculates the total annual GHG emissions, measures progress against internal performance measure goals, and identifies strategies in order to achieve the emission targets. Collect data internally and externallyâBecause the majority of CN data collection methods rely exclusively on internal, quantitative data sources, the process of collecting and aggregating fuel consumption information is straightforward. However, the Scope 3 data, included as of the 2011 report, relies on external sources for collection. For locomotives, on a monthly basis, the corporation compiles the available fuel purchasing data and reconciles this data with purchase invoices and storage tank inventory measurements. Traffic data is compiled on an ongoing basis. For non-locomotive sources, CN assembles data in several ways. Shipping fleet data is compiled on an annual basis and reconciled with purchase records from CNâs shipping department and supply management department. Trucking data on fuel consumption is compiled on a monthly basis primarily from operatorsâ fuel charge cards. Mileage data is self-reported by operators using a mobile electronic system based on Blackberry cell phones. This data is audited on an annual basis. Compared to data on locomotive fuel, consumption from these sources is not as accurate. For the CDP reporting, the fuel consumption data from the prior step are combined with certified emission factors from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to determine the overall Scope 1 GHG emissions. Electricity consumption measurements are paired with provincial or state emission factors to determine Scope 2 emissions. Measure and Compare PerformanceâThese results are used to track progress against internal goals. CN compares the fuel consumption and emission intensity results internally against goals set for the two performance metrics defined above. Emission results are also shared externally through the CDP for comparison against other peer companies in the rail industry. To aid in comparisons, the CDP calculates two scoring metrics for each submission: the Carbon Disclosure Rating scores the extent and detail of information provided in a companyâs CDP response; the Carbon Performance Rating scores a company on the activities, actions, and strategies used to mitigate or adapt to climate change Steps in Benchmarking process 29 (it is not intended as a comprehensive metric of a companyâs GHG footprint and is based solely on responses in the CDP questionnaire). In order to compare the companyâs environmental performance against its peers, CN can reference the Carbon Disclosure Rating and Carbon Performance Rating of other companies in its industry. However, these scores are not necessarily related to CNâs performance metrics of carbon intensity and fuel efficiency. To access more meaningful comparison metrics, CN can download the original reporting submissions from each company, which includes the same quantitative data as supplied by CN for CDP certification. Using these submissions, CN can compare its quantitative efficiency performance against that of its peers. Identify best practices to close gapâCN has sought to reduce GHG emissions from company operations by purchasing energy-efficient equipment, making logistical improvements, and implementing employee training. They have also sought to increase energy efficiency from buildings and equipment and initiated an energy efficiency plan that has sought to optimize data centers, consolidate computer servers, and initiate an employee telecommuting program. In industrial settings, CN has identified several strategies, including more efficient air compressors, yard lighting, and HVAC systems. One unique strategy that applies to rail operations in a northern climate is the development of efficient âswitch heatersâ that keep track switches (locations where trains can move from one track to another) operational in the winter. Integration In the integration phase of benchmarking, a company applies the goals and strategies previously identified in order to obtain buy-in throughout the organization. The two primary steps to integration are communicating benchmarking findings to gain acceptance and developing action plans. Action In the action phase of the benchmarking process, the strategies and action plans are implemented throughout the organization in order to achieve emission reduction goals. Action plans require that the teams responsible for meeting the performance metric benchmarks work directly with the teams responsible for implementing specific reduction strategies. Maturity When entering the maturity phase, a benchmarking program has been institutionalized within the sponsor organization and is viewed as a critical component to the management process. Since launching the CDP process, CN has achieved several internal goals and benchmark milestones. The company has made progress toward its performance measures, exceeding targets in some areas. The CDP process has allowed CN to integrate environmental stewardship throughout the company. The CDP surveys were originally completed by staff in the Investor Relations Department, because investors were the stakeholder group initially pushing for action. In recent years, the CDP process has been integrated into a new Sustainability Department, which implements and coordinates environmental initiatives throughout the company.

Closing the Loop on the Plastics Dilemma: Proceedings of a Workshop–in Brief. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25647. Closing the Loop on the Plastics Dilemma Plastics are used in various industries to produce lightweight, corrosion-resistant, durable materials, but many of the characteristics that make them valuable also make them environmentally unfriendly. Although some plastics can be recycled, the vast majority are simply discarded. The rapid proliferation of plastics in the environment has led to an urgent need to reimagine how plastics are created, used, and managed. The workshop , held in Washington, DC, on May 9–10, 2019, provided a venue for discussing opportunities to reduce the adverse environmental effects of plastics. Chemists, chemical engineers, and participants in related fields engaged in a rich discussion of approaches to improve plastics recycling and to promote the connection of product design with the end stages of the plastics life cycle. This brief proceedings summarizes the presentations and discussions that took place during the workshop. The workshop videos, presentations, and poster abstracts are available online. Eric Beckman, Bevier Professor of Engineering at the University of Pittsburgh, began the workshop with an overview of the current global plastic-waste problem, recycling challenges, and potential solutions. Beckman stated that synthetic polymers have fueled a remarkably successful industry thanks to their desirable physical properties and low production cost. Plastic production has risen by an average of 8.5% per year since 1950, a higher rate of sustained growth than in any other industry. About 350 million metric tons are produced globally today (). Six resins make up more than 90% of current plastics production: polyethylene, polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride, polystyrene, polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and polyurethane. Beckman emphasized that demand for polymer-based products and packaging is likely to continue to grow as improving standards of living put these products within reach for more of the world’s population. Although recycling technologies and adoption have improved over the last several decades, recycling rates remain low, Beckman stated. Globally, about 15% of plastic waste is recycled, a slightly greater percentage is incinerated, and the rest is discarded. However, Beckman stressed that those statistics belie the scope of the problem. Fibers, notably polyester fibers, are not typically included in the discussion. That is problematic because textile production is resource-intensive, people are buying more clothes and keeping them for shorter times, and textile-recycling rates are abysmal. Another important issue is that the production and use of polymer materials are shifting from North America and Europe to Asia, where many countries lack the infrastructure for efficient waste management and recycling. Beckman continued that the low recycling rates have led to a dramatic buildup of plastic waste in the environment, some of which will persist for hundreds of years. About 10 million tons of synthetic polymer material enters the ocean each year; it is estimated that by 2050 the mass of polymers in the ocean will outweigh the mass of fish (). As plastics break down into smaller and smaller particles, polymers and associated additives find their way into ecosystems and organisms. In addition to the ecologic consequences, the proliferation of plastic in the environment raises important questions about potential effects on human health, many of which remain unanswered ().

National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2020. Closing the Loop on the Plastics Dilemma: Proceedings of a Workshop–in Brief. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25647. Beckman discussed various reasons for the recycling of only a small fraction of plastic waste. One is an emphasis on customization—the design of materials and products for particular applications or customers—which often inhibits collection, separation, and reuse of the materials. Contamination of recyclable polymers with other substances is another issue. A third is complexity: products, such as electronic products and thermosets, are often made with multiple polymers, additives, colors, and other materials, and this makes recycling challenging or impossible. Asked about rubbers or elastomers, Beckman noted that although these present a problem, one favorable aspect is that tires, a major source of rubber waste, are relatively easy to collect. He said that even when polymer recycling is feasible, materials are often converted into substances of lower value. In addition to the technical challenges of recycling synthetic polymers, Beckman stated, the recycling industry faces economic challenges given the low cost of virgin materials used in making new polymers. Another complicating problem is that the world’s recycling systems are in a state of upheaval. Although China and India used to import millions of tons of recyclable plastic material from the United States and Europe each year, they are ending that practice and forcing former exporters to develop new ways to handle their plastic waste. That development has led to increasing efforts to prevent waste at its source through bans on some plastics. Previewing some of the topics that would be addressed by other workshop speakers, Beckman raised an array of potential solutions. One is to disseminate current technology for waste collection, sorting, and cleaning and to increase demand for recycled materials. Prompted by a question from the audience, Beckman acknowledged that, if technologic solutions for handling complex mixtures were available, mining landfills for recyclable polymers, as has been proposed for some metals, might eventually become practical. Chemical recycling—converting polymers to monomers—is another potential way to improve recycling capabilities and appears to be practical for some polymers, such as PET and polystyrene. Polyolefins, however, present a difficult challenge for chemical recycling. Beckman closed by outlining new approaches for designing tomorrow’s polymers, namely, to consider designing for at least one of the following characteristics: simplicity, standardization, recoverability, upgrading, disassembly or reassembly, efficient collection and separation, or degradation at the appropriate time, place, and rate and to the appropriate end products. He noted that designing for degradability is particularly relevant for applications, such as shoes or brake pads, in which normal use makes dissipation into the environment unavoidable. He added, however, that many degradable materials will not degrade under some conditions, such as anaerobic conditions found in landfills, so it will be important to ensure that such materials find their way into industrial composters. Other approaches could focus on building a second life into a material or product from the beginning. He emphasized that life-cycle assessment should be applied to verify that any chosen approach truly constitutes an improvement. Brian Riise, a project manager at the REMADE Institute, provided an overview of methods for recycling plastics mechanically. Although recycling rates are low—and dropping—mechanical recycling and chemical recycling offer promise as a way to “close the loop” by recovering materials and thereby reducing the need to produce new materials. Riise stated that mechanical recycling is particularly attractive because it uses only 10–20% of the energy required to make virgin plastics. He listed several requirements for mechanical recycling. ""Closing the Loop on the Plastics Dilemma: Proceedings of a Workshop - in Brief."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2020. Closing the Loop on the Plastics Dilemma: Proceedings of a Workshop–in Brief. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25647. Purity is key for producing high-quality recycled material, Riise stated. The recycled material must behave like virgin polymers when processed, have a suitable appearance, and be free of problematic additives, such as brominated flame retardants. For that to occur, plastics must be cleaned, separated from non-plastic materials, and sorted according to polymer type. Plastic–plastic separation is critical and can require several steps in a precise sequence. Various technologies—optical, density, and electrostatic sorters—have been developed to separate plastics; their use depends on the types of materials and mixtures that need to be sorted. Once the material stream is sorted sufficiently to achieve the target level of purity, the flakes are typically compounded and formed into pellets that can be used in place of (or mixed with) virgin material. Although some buyers of recycled materials can use plastic flakes, Riise noted that pellets are generally preferred. Depending on the intended use of the material, additional processing might be necessary to remove volatile compounds, water, and odors or to incorporate additives for desired properties, such as flexibility, stability, color, or impact strength. Riise stated, however, that using additives to adjust material properties can be problematic in that additives can be expensive, and there can be unintended consequences, for example, improving some properties might hurt other properties. Various tests to measure the composition and mechanical properties are used to ensure product quality. Riise listed several key challenges to mechanical recycling, such as stringent separation requirements to produce materials that have sufficient purity, degradation of plastics during processing and use, and difficulties in managing complex streams and removing colorants, additives, residues, and odors. Approaches to those challenges include improvement in mechanical separations, cleaning technologies, and analytic techniques; the use of additives; dilution of virgin plastics with recycled materials; and the use of recycled materials in the most appropriate applications. Although technical limitations and economic challenges remain, Riise concluded that mechanical methods can effectively recycle plastics from complex streams and bring us closer to a circular economy. Spectroscopic Methods for Improving Sorting of Plastics André Bénard, an associate professor at Michigan State University, discussed opportunities for improving mechanical recycling with spectroscopy. He stated that over the last 15 years spectroscopy has emerged as a valuable tool for identifying materials in a mixed-waste stream. An array of spectroscopic technologies are available for assessing various material properties, such as near- and mid-infrared spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy, and hyperspectral imaging. Bénard discussed how those are increasingly used in material-recovery centers in combination with sensitive detectors, image analysis, machine learning, and robotic technologies. Bénard stated that fast x-ray fluorescence (XRF) and coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy (CARS) are the latest spectroscopic technologies to be adopted for sorting waste streams at material-recovery centers. XRF, an older technology, is being combined with high-speed computation for sorting materials precisely; it is used primarily for metals but can also be used for plastics. CARS and single ultrafast pulse excitation for remote coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy () are sophisticated Raman spectroscopy techniques that can rapidly detect and sort plastics moving along a conveyer belt. By enabling fast, accurate, and automated sorting, these technologies hold great potential for increasing the efficiency of plastics recycling, Bénard concluded. Megan Robertson, an associate professor at the University of Houston, discussed an alternative approach to separation of plastics—development of methods for recycling them together by making it possible to combine different polymers into a blended product (). Robertson stated that most polymers are immiscible and mixing them creates a phase-separated mixture that has poor properties. She outlined how some of the principles used to design surfactants for oil–water mixtures could be useful for designing compatibilizers, additives that enable blending of polymers. Robertson noted that effective compatibilizers will stabilize the interface between immiscible polymers and thus enhance interfacial adhesion or strength, and she described several compatibilizer designs that have demonstrated success (; ). She continued that compatibilizers can be designed to have different architectures and to use diverse interactions (for example, van der Waals, dipole interactions, and hydrogen bonding). They can be synthesized and added to a mixture or formed in situ during the blending process. Although compatibilizers are available for particular polymer mixtures, they have not been widely adopted for recycling plastics, Robertson said. One reason is cost. However, research has demonstrated that fine-tuning of the architecture and molecular-weight distribution of a compatibilizer can maximize its efficiency and reduce the necessary concentration and thus the cost of its use (). Because most compatibilizers are optimized for specific combinations of polymers and specific conditions, other key challenges are related to handling of variable mixtures of many polymers, materials that have undergone thermal degradation, and materials that contain additives. The “holy grail” of compatibilization is the ability to combine all types of plastic waste to create a marketable output. Robertson suggested, however, that it might be more realistic to consider compatibilizer development as complementary with sorting systems that can group plastics into mixable streams. Nonetheless, researchers are exploring promising avenues toward potential “universal compatibilizers,” including ones that use nanoparticles, reactive (in situ) compatibilization, or several types of compatibilizers simultaneously. ""Closing the Loop on the Plastics Dilemma: Proceedings of a Workshop - in Brief."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2020. Closing the Loop on the Plastics Dilemma: Proceedings of a Workshop–in Brief. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25647. Tim Patten, deputy director of the Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems Division of the National Science Foundation, moderated an open discussion that touched on key research needs and current and future challenges in the mechanical-recycling landscape. The session began with a reflection from industry. Jill Martin, a fellow with the Dow Chemical Company, stated that achieving a circular economy requires planning for a product or material to have multiple lives. One has to consider what happens at the end of the life—Is the plastic recycled into the same market with the same uses, or is it converted to its building blocks to create a new product with different uses? Martin emphasized that life-cycle thinking is critical for finding solutions to the plastics problem. She noted that Dow uses life-cycle assessment to consider how well different solutions meet short- and long-term goals for decreasing greenhouse-gas emissions or lowering energy and water use, as well as such business considerations as economic feasibility and scale. Martin stated that Dow invests in compatibilizer research. It is vital to consider how compatibilizers will be used—at what stage and by which party they will be added to the process and where their use will create value. She added that industry investments in compatibilizers and other advances are not intended to solve the whole problem but rather to provide “catalytic capital” that can enable long-term change in the systems and infrastructure for creating a circular economy. Recycling offers substantial economic opportunity, Martin said. The recycling industry in North America generated $100 billion in value in 2018. She emphasized that building on the opportunity will require focusing on innovations and identifying the key players who can transform ideas into reality on a large scale. She concluded that it will be crucial for the plastics industry to build partnerships with converters, brand owners, and waste-management companies that can create the infrastructure necessary to solve the plastic-waste crisis. Prompted by a question from Patten, panelists identified the following key advances as important for improving mechanical recycling: Riise identified cost-efficient methods for sorting black plastics as a critical need. Although methods exist, he noted that they are more expensive than today’s dominant technologies. Robertson highlighted the need to develop compatibilizers that can blend more diverse mixtures or to make waste streams more homogeneous so they are easier to compatibilize. Bénard pointed to the need to transfer technologies from other fields. There is an opportunity to take advantage of technologies, such as density separation methods used in mining and various spectroscopic tools, for sorting recyclables. Beckman and Martin focused on designing for simplicity and recyclability. Designing new materials—and revisiting the design of old ones—with a focus on simplicity and recyclability rather than function and cost could substantially reduce the complexity of recycling. A key challenge that Martin identified is to develop materials that perform well in multiple applications. A workshop participant raised a question about the composition and quality of recycled material. If recycling rates increase dramatically, a greater and greater proportion of material being recycled will have already been recycled, and this potentially would complicate the recycling process. Riise replied that the degree to which that is a problem depends on what products are created from recycled materials and their corresponding lifespans; chemical recycling methods or improvements in mechanical processing to stabilize recycled materials could also help. Robertson added that this issue also suggests a need for better analytic techniques to characterize material inputs, such as a “molecular barcode” reader, which Beckman theorized could identify the origin and properties of plastics as they enter the recycling pipeline. Beckman added that recycling practices might be affected by new business models that emphasize sharing and reuse of products rather than permanent ownership. The development of degradable materials presents other challenges and opportunities. Riise noted that a material designed to degrade cannot be recycled; furthermore, these materials can undermine recycling systems unless waste streams are kept separate. That issue is one illustration of the broader tension between solutions that might be “best” when considered in a vacuum and solutions that are useful in the context of today’s infrastructure, he added. Beckman raised one potential solution: to be strategic about which items are made of degradable materials. For example, cigarette butts and fishing gear are notorious for being difficult to collect or recycle and, because of how they are used, often dissipate into the environment. Items that are likely to dissipate anyway, he noted, might be prime candidates for a shift to degradable materials.

Closing the Loop on the Plastics Dilemma: Proceedings of a Workshop–in Brief. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25647. A workshop participant raised a question about sorting capabilities. It is useful to have a baseline to understand the efficiency of existing sorting technologies. However, Riise and Beckman pointed out that those data are often proprietary and therefore difficult to obtain. Martin, however, said that separating paper from rigid plastic, glass, and metal is highly efficient, whereas separating flexible packaging from paper is difficult. Beckman and Riise agreed that there are trade-offs between throughput, purity, and cost; 99% efficiency of the sorting processes might be possible but might require a large capital investment. Attendees discussed the role of consumers in sorting recyclables. Beckman noted that designing for recyclability is not only about designing the polymers; consumers’ perspective also needs to be considered. It is important for consumers to understand easily what can be recycled so that they can act accordingly. Riise pointed out that many current systems use a single-stream approach, so sorting before curbside collection would not make a difference unless the processing infrastructure were also changed. Finally, participants discussed the difficulty of weighing the many trade-offs involved from among various solutions. Although life-cycle assessment is an important tool, Beckman noted, it is difficult to compare existing materials or systems with those envisioned but not yet created. In addition, many speakers agreed that there is a lack of tools for informing decisions in the face of competing considerations—for example, human health or ecosystem effects vs carbon emissions vs functional properties of materials. The second workshop session opened with an overview of chemical and biologic recycling by Jeannette Garcia, global lead for Quantum Applications in Quantum Chemistry and Science at IBM Research. Garcia explained that current recycling methods fall into four categories: primary recycling or reuse (recycling products for the same use), secondary or mechanical recycling (recycling products for uses other than their original use), tertiary or chemical recycling (recovering petrochemical components of plastics via a chemical process), and quaternary recycling or energy recovery (incinerating plastics to recover energy in the form of heat). The discrepancy between the large volume of plastic waste generated annually (more than 300 million tons globally) and the proportion of that waste that is recycled (about 9% in the United States) underscores both the magnitude of the challenge and the untapped opportunity to recover energy and materials (). Garcia compared mechanical and chemical recycling processes (). The goal of mechanical recycling is to convert waste materials to clean polymeric materials for reuse. A disadvantage of mechanical recycling is that it typically changes the molecular or mechanical properties of the materials, for example, by altering molecular weight or elongation properties through random scission and cross-linking. Chemical recycling, however, aims to have the polymers revert to their monomers so that there is no “end of life,” and release into the environment or into landfills is avoided. Researchers are pursuing various approaches to recycling of plastics chemically and biologically, Garcia said. Examples are chemical strategies to “attack” the functional group or repeating unit of a polymer (, ), enzymatic approaches to transform a polymer into useful building blocks (), thermolytic techniques to convert polyolefins into liquid fuels (), chemical methods for depolymerizing polyolefins (), and the use of living organisms to degrade materials (). Garcia concluded by noting that researchers are also actively pursuing innovative strategies to design new polymers that have built-in mechanisms to facilitate chemical recycling (; ; ). ""Closing the Loop on the Plastics Dilemma: Proceedings of a Workshop - in Brief."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2020. Closing the Loop on the Plastics Dilemma: Proceedings of a Workshop–in Brief. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25647. Paul Dauenhauer, an associate professor at the University of Minnesota, continued the conversation by discussing the reaction-engineering fundamentals of thermal recycling of polymers. The thermolytic process of reducing polymers into smaller units that can be reassembled into new polymers involves two chemistries—melt-phase chemistry and secondary gas-phase chemistry. To develop a pyrolysis reactor that can generate the desired compounds, three length scales—reactor scale (about 1 m), particle scale (about 1 mm), and atomic scale (about 1 angstrom)—and three phases need to be considered. Dauenhauer noted that the particle scale is complicated immensely by phase change and that it is desirable to understand the chemistry that occurs when a material melts. It is also important to understand aerosol generation; aerosols are problematic because they can short-circuit the chemistry and can deposit in downstream unit operations. Experiments with diffuse reflectance in situ spectroscopy of particles () and pulse-heated analysis of solid reactions () have shed light on the foundational chemical and physical processes involved in the pyrolysis of polymers. Dauenhauer emphasized the importance of the new techniques because one cannot describe a reactor fundamentally unless one understands what is happening on the particle and molecular scales. To inform reactor design, Dauenhauer highlighted the value of a building-up approach to pyrolysis modeling by first integrating reaction models into particle models that are then integrated into reactor models. He closed, however, with a warning that the systems are extremely complex and that one needs to review methods carefully to understand what the data mean and whether they are relevant to a particular system. Putting fundamental principles into practice, Jennifer Le Roy, research and development lead at BioCellection, Inc., described how her company is working to scale thermal oxidative depolymerization processes for converting plastic waste into new products. BioCellection recycles mixed polyethylene feedstock into short-chain dicarboxylic acids, such as adipic, succinic, and azelaic acids—virgin-grade chemical intermediates that have sizable markets. Their process can use different polyethylene sources, does not require that materials be cleaned before processing, and uses feedstocks that the company is being paid to take. Although many of the process details are confidential, Le Roy shared that the company continues to perform research and development to satisfy customer demands and reduce costs while it moves to scale up manufacturing capabilities with support from industry partners that assist with product validation. Susannah Scott, Distinguished Professor of Chemical Engineering at the University of California, Santa Barbara, switched topics and discussed catalytic depolymerization. She focused on identifying transition-metal catalysts that could be used for polymer disassembly. Although there are many well-known transition-metal catalysts that transform small molecules or create polymers, polymer disassembly is a novel use that is based on the principle of microscopic reversibility. Scott stated that an important barrier is that there is no universal catalyst that can be used for every polymer disassembly; a catalyst needs to be paired with a polymer on the basis of the chemistry involved. She continued that kinetics and thermodynamics present other barriers. Because plastics have been designed to be thermodynamically stable, conditions must be adjusted to make depolymerization favorable. Scott noted that if depolymerization is strongly unfavorable thermodynamically, using a catalyst will not help. Even creating thermodynamically favorable conditions can require high temperatures and a large expenditure of energy. Scott highlighted experiments that demonstrate potential opportunities to overcome the barriers. One approach is to reverse the polymerization by using a reaction pathway different from the one used to polymerize the material (; ). The key is to convert the polymer not to its building blocks but to commercially useful products, such as oligomers or different polymers—in other words, change the chemistry to improve the thermodynamics. For mixed plastics, researchers have experimented with sequential catalytic reactions by adjusting temperatures or by using multiple solvents to depolymerize particular polymers selectively (). Scott noted, however, that the examples ""Closing the Loop on the Plastics Dilemma: Proceedings of a Workshop - in Brief."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2020. Closing the Loop on the Plastics Dilemma: Proceedings of a Workshop–in Brief. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25647. provided are not suitable for large-scale processes; there is no cost-competitive catalytic route today for chemical recycling. That is, recovered monomers are generally not competitive with fossil-derived ones. She concluded by stating that future technologies must have low energy and solvent requirements, easy separations, robust catalysts, and value-added targets. Delving deeper into a specific catalytic depolymerization process, Robert Allen, senior manager of chemistry and materials at IBM Almaden Research Center, described the development of a glycolytic process for depolymerizing PET by using trimethylamine as a catalyst. About 150 billion pounds of PET is manufactured each year, and only a small fraction is recovered and reused. Mechanical recycling methods are available for PET, but they require high temperatures, low or no contamination, and non-colored materials. Although chemical recycling methods have potential and various approaches are being pursued, economic feasibility has presented a substantial barrier. Allen’s team at IBM created the VolCat process, which could offer a cost-effective means of recycling PET chemically. VolCat is a simple, fast, highly selective process that uses a gentle, volatile, low-cost catalyst that is completely recovered and recycled. The process is highly tolerant of contamination and produces high-grade bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate that has good transparency and color and is well suited for reuse (). Downstream processing is simple and effective and generates essentially no process waste. VolCat depolymerization can even be used for selective digestion of polyester in a cotton–polyester blend and thus offers a potential route to textile recycling. With further optimization and scaling, Allen said that VolCat can help PET to become a renewable resource instead of an environmental scourge. Richard Gross, professor and Constellation Chair at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, discussed opportunities for biocatalytic depolymerization of plastics. Biocatalysis is promising because it offers mild and selective processes that can target a specific polymer substrate in mixed-waste streams. Scientists also have the benefit of powerful tools to re-engineer enzymes to improve reaction rates and conditions. Because enzymes degrade water-insoluble polymers at their surfaces and constantly create new surfaces, enzyme degradation can be enhanced by increasing a polymer’s surface area. Furthermore, because crystalline regions are more difficult for enzymes to access, plastic substrates should be pretreated to reduce material crystallinity. Gross stated that nature provides useful leads in the selection of candidate enzymes. One approach is to investigate the microbial communities that form around plastic waste, which appear to be evolving in ways that degrade the plastics. The enzyme activity can be improved by using rational and directed evolutionary approaches. Gross noted that although microorganisms themselves could be used to degrade plastics, expressing an enzyme and then applying it directly to a plastic is generally more efficient in producing usable products. Otherwise, the microorganism can use a substantial fraction of the degradation products for its own maintenance of metabolism and reproduction instead of converting plastics to degradation products for reuse. Gross highlighted research on cutinase, a powerful natural hydrolase that breaks down the outer layer of leaves and has been shown to degrade PET (). He noted that the cutinase family has broad potential for breaking down various polymers and that leaf and branch compost cutinase has shown particular promise since researchers stabilized the enzyme via glycosylation (). His group is exploring how fungal enzymes that break down lignin might be applied to plastics that have structural features that resemble those of lignin. Gross emphasized that as further work uncovers a wider array of effective polymer-degrading biocatalysts, there will be an opportunity to identify synergies between these catalysts to accelerate enzyme-catalyzed polymer degradation. He also stressed that it will be critical to use a combination of chemical and enzymatic catalyst systems in which, for example, chemical catalysis will break large chains into smaller fragments that are then best converted to recyclable products via enzymatic processes. He added that new approaches to materials design could complement this multifaceted effort. ""Closing the Loop on the Plastics Dilemma: Proceedings of a Workshop - in Brief."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2020. Closing the Loop on the Plastics Dilemma: Proceedings of a Workshop–in Brief. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25647. Eric Boyd, an associate professor at Montana State University, continued the conversation on biologic depolymerization by describing his efforts in “bioprospecting.” He focuses on identifying enzymes that have the potential to degrade PET (PETases). He noted that PET needs to be heated to above 70°C to decrease its crystallinity and thus enhance its enzymatic degradation. Given those requirements, the enzymes need to be heat-stable. Boyd said that one approach is to bioengineer an enzyme to be thermotolerant. However, his approach is to probe natural systems for a thermophilic PETase homolog or PET-degrading organism, and his preferred site for this bioprospecting is Yellowstone National Park, which has exceptionally dynamic, extensive, and chemically diverse hydrothermal features. Using metagenomic techniques and protein clustering, Boyd can identify potential candidates to investigate from among the microorganisms that inhabit the extreme ecosystems. He stated that he has identified a catalytic triad—three residues that are conserved among all the esterases that have PETase activity—that can be used to narrow the list of candidates for investigation. Once the most promising candidates are identified, the genes can be isolated and expressed, the enzymes purified, and their activity assessed. Boyd provided data on two particularly promising candidates from his research. Next steps, he concluded, are more metagenomics analyses to identify additional PETase activity, further development of screening assays for PETase activity, and investigation of the possibilities of modifying enzyme structure to improve PETase activity or engineering a thermophile to have PETase activity. Kathryn Beers, a group leader in the Materials Science and Engineering Division of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, moderated the panel discussion with the speakers and audience. Beers asked the speakers to name the most important advance that would propel chemical and biologic recycling forward. Boyd and Allen emphasized the need for different funding mechanisms, especially ones that would support cross-disciplinary collaboration. Several speakers discussed the need to pursue synergies among mechanical, chemical, and biologic recycling methods; to integrate life-cycle assessment and technoeconomic analyses into the process; to create academic–industry partnerships; and to encourage a greater availability of industry data that would help to inform priorities and speed efforts. Allen called for a better understanding of the scientific fundamentals, and Gross added that standard materials are needed so that results can be better compared across laboratories. Garcia noted the need for data collection over a plastic’s entire life cycle, and Dauenhauer and Le Roy highlighted the need to provide thorough data on total reaction outputs. Several participants touched on some broader issues in the context of the overall plastics-recycling ecosystem and asked whether the focus should be on designing new plastics without being constrained by the current chemical industry. Gross emphasized the need for parallel efforts to address the current plastic-waste problem within the chemical industry and to design better materials for future collection, reuse, and recycling. Scott argued that designing all plastics to be biodegradable is clearly not a feasible approach in light of the world’s population’s simply discarding plastics into the environment. The key, she said, is to redesign products so that recovery, disassembly, and repurposing are much more efficient. Gross added that building in triggers to enhance chemical recycling at the end of a product’s life should be pursued. A participant asked whether the focus should be on compostable plastics. Beckman noted that one problem is that composting generates greenhouse gases. Gross argued that the ideal is an enzymatic process that creates chemicals, not a microbial process that generates biomass. Another participant asked whether the focus should instead be on reuse. Garcia stated that although reuse makes sense, the material is eventually going to become waste and a combination of all the various approaches will be needed. Finally, a participant asked whether the problem is related to technology or to consumers. Scott stressed that the plastics already in the environment pose a technologic problem and that if consumers continue to demand cheap, convenient single-use plastics, redesigning plastics for the future will be difficult. The third workshop session focused on redesigning today’s plastics to be more environmentally sustainable. Gregg Beckham, senior research fellow at National Renewable Energy Laboratory, moderated the session. David Hodge, an associate professor at Montana State University, highlighted opportunities to use renewable sources of carbon instead of fossil-based carbon as a primary feedstock for polymers. Examples of renewable sources of carbon are plant biomass, algae, and direct carbon dioxide capture. Hodge stated that food crops—such as cereal grains, sugarcane, and sugar beets—have traditionally provided the biomass raw materials. The goal, however, is to move to lignocellulose biomass, such as agricultural residues or dedicated energy crops. Biobased feedstocks offer some key advantages, Hodge said. They have high oxygen content and can be integrated into biocatalytic approaches that use aqueous conditions at moderate temperatures. Hodge continued, saying that biobased chemicals have numerous potential applications—opportunities for direct replacement, functional replacement, and novel products that offer new properties that provide improved performance for consumers or for degradability or recyclability. Researchers and companies are actively pursuing various applications (; ). Hodge stated that technologies for biomass deconstruction and conversion could potentially be used to enhance chemical recycling capabilities. Plant cell walls, which are composed of various polymers, are recalcitrant to deconstruction— ""Closing the Loop on the Plastics Dilemma: Proceedings of a Workshop - in Brief."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2020. Closing the Loop on the Plastics Dilemma: Proceedings of a Workshop–in Brief. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25647. lignin prevents access to the carbohydrate fraction, and cellulose embedded in crystalline microfibrils resists depolymerization (). For decades, researchers have pursued methods to overcome those barriers with thermal, chemical, and biologic approaches. The techniques that have been developed for extracting the components of biomass feedstocks could be used for biocatalytic or hybrid approaches to break down polymers in post-consumer plastics (). Questions remain as to how cost-effective and scalable the approaches might be and whether they could be applied to more complex products, such as thermoplastics, thermosets, and composite materials. Geoffrey Coates, Tisch University Professor in the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology of Cornell University, continued the discussion on sustainable plastics by emphasizing what is required in the pursuit of an ideal plastic. It should be derived from renewable sources, facilitate decomposition or recycling, have properties equal to or better than those of current plastics, and be cost-equivalent or less expensive than current plastics. Furthermore, the synthetic methods for producing them should use less energy and raw materials. Coates described how carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide can be used as building blocks to create new biodegradable polymers. The molecules are inexpensive, are readily available, and introduce hydrolyzable linkages into polymer backbones that facilitate decomposition. The biggest challenge, however, is that a huge thermodynamic barrier must be overcome. Researchers have been working for decades to find ways to overcome that hurdle by using catalysts and reactive molecules, such as epoxides, to drive carbon dioxide polymerization. Coates and his research team have successfully used that approach with various catalysts to make various materials (; ). Further experimentation and business development have yielded several applications that offer opportunities for scale-up and commercial applications, such as the use of foams in vehicles. A major focus of his work is in the design of polymers for degradability or recyclability. Coates described a process for creating a polymer from carbon dioxide and limonene (a natural product of tangerines) that can be used to make containers that are easily depolymerized to the starting materials (). A similar process can be used to create polycyclohexene carbonate that can be depolymerized to a small molecule that can be converted to the polymer (). Coates stated that another promising avenue uses succinate anhydrides to create non-toxic materials that are more heat-tolerant than the materials derived by using carbon dioxide (). Nature has provided inspiration for using carbon monoxide as a building block for polymers, Coates said. Poly(ß-hydroxybutyrate) is a polymer made by bacteria for energy storage that has potential commercial applications, such as in milk jugs and detergent bottles that would be compostable. The problem is that fermentation processes to make the polymer are not ideal from a cost perspective or a carbon-footprint perspective. However, Coates and his research team have developed a promising approach that uses carbon monoxide, an epoxide, and a bimetallic cobalt catalyst to create poly(ß-hydroxybutyrate) (). Coates concluded by saying that the bimetallic cobalt catalysts suggests new approaches for synthesizing acrylic and succinic acids, high-value commodity products. Eugene Chen, John K. Stille Endowed Chair and Millennial Professor of Polymer Science and Sustainability at Colorado State University, discussed his work to create materials that are infinitely recyclable and compared the linear and circular economies (). He contrasted incineration and mechanical, biologic, and chemical recycling. In his view, chemical recycling methods are the most promising for creating the circular economy. Key challenges, however, include minimizing energy inputs for depolymerization, maximizing depolymerization selectivity, and balancing recyclability and performance. ""Closing the Loop on the Plastics Dilemma: Proceedings of a Workshop - in Brief."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2020. Closing the Loop on the Plastics Dilemma: Proceedings of a Workshop–in Brief. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25647. As noted by other speakers, thermodynamics is a fundamental consideration: temperature, enthalpy, and entropy are key determinants of polymerization potential. Chen described experiments that elucidate thermodynamic, kinetic, and process conditions required for the synthesis of a class of polymers that has a low ceiling temperature and can be quantitatively depolymerized into pure monomers that can then be repolymerized (). Chen’s team ultimately created a high-molecular-weight polymer under mild conditions and room temperature that had thermal stability and high crystallinity and that could easily be depolymerized in the presence of a simple Lewis acid catalyst, such as ZnCl. The recovered pure monomer could then be repolymerized to virgin-quality material (). Others have had similar success with different pathways (). The ability to compete with today’s plastics will be crucial for the success of the new materials; cost and performance will be critical. With respect to research methods, Chen noted that computationally assisted design is useful for investigating infinitely recyclable plastic systems—both to develop new materials and to improve chemical recycling methods. Linda Broadbelt, Sarah Rebecca Roland Professor and associate dean for research in the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science of Northwestern University, discussed how computational modeling and data science can be used to advance chemical recycling strategies and polymer design. She stated that those techniques are being used to study complex reaction systems, to design copolymer architectures, and to identify “bioprivileged” molecules. Broadbelt described three types of models that have different levels of complexity. models do not differentiate reaction products and use an overall rate coefficient. models are more complex; they differentiate reaction products but still lump rate coefficients. models are the most complex; they distinguish reaction intermediates and products and incorporate estimated or experimentally derived reaction coefficients for elementary steps. She discussed how such approaches have been applied to model the degradation of various polymers and mixtures (; ). Ab initio molecular simulations, another approach, can yield insights into enzymatic behavior and even predict kinetic parameters, Broadbelt said. She and colleagues applied that approach to predict enzymes that could decompose polymers that are not their native substrates. They then complemented the simulation with machine-learning methods to rank the catalytic potential of enzymes for substrates other than their native ones. Broadbelt described a third approach—using data science to identify bioprivileged molecules. She and colleagues started by creating a candidate list of CHO molecules and developed a reactivity index as a proxy for a full reaction network. They used data science to compare reactivity indexes of candidate molecules and benchmark molecules to narrow the list from over 29,000 to about 4,600, to which the researchers applied a reaction-network generation approach to provide an overall ranking (). Although data science provides valuable tools for accelerating discovery, Broadbelt cautioned that it does not supplant the need for atomistic information and kinetic modeling. Rather, modeling, data science, and machine learning can be complementary; models, for example, can provide training and validation data to artificial neural networks. Bioprivileged molecules are ones derived from nature that can be used to create diverse chemical products (). ""Closing the Loop on the Plastics Dilemma: Proceedings of a Workshop - in Brief."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2020. Closing the Loop on the Plastics Dilemma: Proceedings of a Workshop–in Brief. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25647. Participants highlighted some of the trade-offs and challenges involved in designing plastics for a circular economy. Much of the focus is on designing for production and recycling capabilities, but a participant stated that the middle piece—use—is also important. For example, plastics used for food applications typically need to withstand high-temperature sterilization processes, and a plastic designed to be susceptible to thermal depolymerization would not be suitable for such an application. Coates agreed that performance and recycling capabilities are often in conflict because materials that are designed to degrade easily might not have the robust physical properties required for many applications. Chen stated, however, that researchers have made metastable polymers that are “kinetically trapped” and have triggers—activated by such external stimuli as catalysts, thermal energy, and light—that can control and facilitate depolymerization. Chen noted that computationally assisted design can aid in the development of such materials, and Broadbelt added that modeling can also help in evaluating the effect of weathering on recyclability. Susannah Scott asked about the challenges of designing polymers that have multiple ends of life and the difficulties that can arise when plastics intended for one process (such as mechanical recycling) end up in another process (such as chemical recycling). That question, said Chen, emphasizes the need for a systematic change in polymer coding and collection. A workshop participant added that designing plastics for recyclability is complicated given their many uses; multiple metrics for design will be required to make recyclability feasible. Regarding multiple lives, a workshop participant noted that something that was considered a waste in the past might not be one forever; the goal is that one day it will be a feedstock for another process. Finally, Richard Gross questioned the innovative process for creating new materials. Coates, Chen, and other participants noted the need to balance fundamental discovery of new materials with research that focuses on sustainability and scalability from the outset. Chen cautioned against inhibiting innovation—something that is not commercially viable today might be viable in the future with further scientific advances. In response to a participant’s question, Broadbelt, Coates, Hodge, and Chen discussed the importance of updating training and education systems to incorporate sustainability techniques while maintaining fundamental and applied learning. Speakers and participants agreed that it is essential to equip the next generation of scientists and engineers to tackle the plastics challenge effectively. During the workshop, life-cycle assessment (LCA) in the context of plastic production and waste management was discussed. Presentations were made by Ming Xu, an associate professor at the University of Michigan, and Michael Wang, Distinguished Fellow and senior scientist at Argonne National Laboratory. Xu began by providing an overview of LCA (). LCA is a technique used to evaluate a product’s environmental footprint and takes into account its full life cycle, from extraction and processing of the raw materials to manufacture, distribution, and use of the product to its recycling or disposal. LCA can be used to inform comparisons among products, processes, or end-of-life pathways; to identify the key points in the life cycle that have the biggest environmental effects; to avoid “burden-shifting” from one process to another; and to guide technologic innovation, policy, and consumer decision-making. Xu noted that the publication of LCAs of plastics has increased dramatically since 2005. Three main applications are in comparison of biobased plastics with other materials, identification of “hot spots” for improvement, and life-cycle cost analysis. Xu described the steps of an LCA. One has to define first the goal and scope of the assessment, such as determination of the environmental effects that need to be compared. One then prepares an inventory analysis in which technical inputs and outputs, resource and energy consumption, and emissions associated with all the various processes are estimated. ""Closing the Loop on the Plastics Dilemma: Proceedings of a Workshop - in Brief."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2020. Closing the Loop on the Plastics Dilemma: Proceedings of a Workshop–in Brief. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/25647. Next, one conducts the life-cycle impact assessment in which the environmental effects of all the factors in the inventory are quantified and aggregated into three categories: effects on human health, effects on ecosystem health, and effects on resource depletion. The final step is interpretation, in which the assessor communicates what was and was not included in the analysis so that people can make a fair comparison. Xu noted that the selection of factors to include in the assessment has an important influence on the results and how they should be interpreted. Wang offered examples of how one LCA tool, the GREET model developed by Argonne National Laboratory, has been used to analyze alternative means of producing plastics and managing plastic waste. The first case study compared fossil-based PET with bio-derived PET or recycled PET bottles (). Researchers were able to pinpoint the major sources of greenhouse-gas emissions and determine which pathways result in significant emission reductions. They concluded that bio-derived and recycled PET substantially reduce fossil-fuel consumption and greenhouse-gas emissions. The biogenic carbon credit assigned to biomass-derived components of PET bottles was a key driver of the emission reduction estimated for bio-derived PET. Furthermore, the production of terephthalic acid as a precursor in the pathway of the bio-derived PET was a major contributor of emission. The second study that Wang discussed compared fuels derived from pyrolysis of non-recycled plastics with conventionally produced petroleum fuels. It was particularly important to account for all the co-products that are created when plastic is pyrolyzed; Wang noted that different LCA methods account for co-products in different ways, which can yield different bottom-line results and confuse the public. The study concluded that plastic-derived fuels generate somewhat less greenhouse gases than petroleum fuels but are far less water-intensive and fossil-fuel–intensive. Given that the United States produced 29 million tons of non-recyclable plastics in 2013, adoption of this technology could yield some 6 billion gallons of diesel fuel per year—roughly 10% of the US diesel-fuel market—and substantially reduce landfill inputs. In Wang’s view, the findings suggest that plastic-to-fuel technology offers an alternative waste-management strategy and a promising way to extend the value of plastics. Xu described other LCA studies focused on plastics. One of the earliest plastic LCAs compared plastic and paper products and found that plastic products resulted in lower energy consumption and air emissions (). A more recent study of baby-food packaging found that plastic pots had a lower environmental footprint than glass jars (). Xu stated that many LCA studies focus on greenhouse-gas emissions associated with various polymer types. A recent study, for example, estimated that upcycling carbon dioxide into polymers reduces greenhouse-gas emissions by 11–20%, and that use of bio-derived plastics reduces emissions by 20–50% compared with fossil-fuel–derived plastics (). Other studies examine different effects, such as ozone depletion, acidification, and ecotoxicity; by these measures, bio-derived products are not always better than products based on fossil fuels (). Xu said that researchers have used LCA to identify priorities for improvements in the manufacturing process () and to assess different end-of-life options. A study that compared plastic-film disposal, incineration, and recycling found that recycling of a mixed-waste stream has the greatest environmental benefit (); the researchers also conducted a sensitivity analysis to determine which parameters were most important with respect to life-cycle effects. Xu emphasized that such analyses reveal areas with the greatest potential for improvement, which can be addressed by both technical innovation and policy incentives. Wang and Xu highlighted several challenges regarding the application and interpretation of LCA. Other workshop participants raised additional considerations during open discussion sessions. Xu identified data as a key challenge. Compiling data from such disparate sources as laboratory tests, questionnaires and surveys, onsite investigation, and the scientific literature is expensive and time-consuming. Xu emphasized that data are vital for generating a life-cycle inventory and are typically captured in a matrix that can include thousands of columns and rows. Where data are unavailable, researchers typically turn to industry averages or proxies. Xu stated that researchers are actively pursuing ways to acquire data more efficiently, improve the reliability of proxies, and generate new data from existing data by using data science. However, Xu and Wang both noted that the only way to validate the assumptions included in such processes is to acquire more data from primary sources, and this takes time and money. Noting that the traditional LCA framework assumes that a given product will have a single function, Wang pointed to a lack of both data and analytic tools to quantify all the tradeoffs involved in a truly circular economy in which a given product or material has multiple uses or multiple lifetimes. Because different uses and design goals have different sustainability implications, LCA tools will need to be expanded to account for the effects generated (or avoided) in a circular economy. In response to a participant’s question, Xu discussed the opportunities and potential pitfalls related to using LCAs to analyze the effects of emerging designs or processes that have not yet been deployed. Researchers often make “reasonable” estimations that are based on available information, but the availability of information—even laboratory-scale information—varies case by case. Another approach is to use data-driven computational approaches, but these are themselves emerging. In either case, he said, it is important to estimate the reliability of the data and of the assumptions that are being made.

Closing the Loop on the Plastics Dilemma: Proceedings of a Workshop–in Brief MyNAP members save 10% online. or to save! Plastics are used in various industries to produce lightweight, corrosion-resistant, durable materials, but many of the characteristics that make them valuable also make them environmentally unfriendly. Although some plastics can be recycled, the vast majority are simply discarded. The rapid proliferation of plastics in the environment has led to an urgent need to reimagine how plastics are created, used, and managed. The workshop Closing the Loop on the Plastics Dilemma, held in Washington, DC, on May 9-10, 2019, provided a venue for discussing opportunities to reduce the adverse environmental effects of plastics. Chemists, chemical engineers, and participants in related fields engaged in a rich discussion of approaches to improve plastics recycling and to promote the connection of product design with the end stages of the plastics life cycle. This brief proceedings summarizes the presentations and discussions that took place during the workshop.

cb73c449-98d3-4d56-b66d-7f0963a59b64,"Retrofitting towards energy-efficient homes in European cold climates: a review   ,     , –() Existing buildings represent a significant energy saving potential in Europe, and retrofitting the building stock is essential to reach European targets. Retrofitting measures should reduce the energy consumption as well as improve the indoor climate while still being cost-effective. This can be challenging in European cold climates. This paper discusses energy performance requirements and challenges in the retrofitting process. It also presents an overview of the retrofitting status and relevant energy saving retrofitting measures with their potential for residential buildings. Measures to lower the building’s energy demand and electrical energy consumption and measures to control and monitor the energy use are discussed. Some research directions for the future of building energy usage are suggested. The literature indicates that significant energy savings can be achieved from retrofitting the building envelope. Relatively few research papers have been devoted to the energy saving potential of building control systems for existing residential buildings. However, these savings seem low compared to those that can be achieved through energy conservation. The actual savings from retrofitting the envelope, HVAC-systems and control systems are case specific and should be assessed for reference buildings of each housing typology.

Transitioning Toward Sustainability: Advancing the Scientific Foundation: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/23533. 2 Decision Sciences, Demography, and Integrated Assessment Modeling , professor of management science and engineering at Stanford University, discussed the progression of integrated assessment modeling (IAM) since 2000 and future research needs in the field. Dr. Weyant defined an integrated assessment as an analysis of two or more major earth system components and at least one natural and one human component. These assessments are not always models but often cover as much of a global earth system as possible. Integrative assessments can capture uncertainties and emergent behavior of systems that would otherwise “fall through the cracks” in interdisciplinary research performed in silos or subcomponents. During Dr. Weyant’s role in the 2000 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) climate assessment, a number of gaps were identified that related to understanding the linkages and feedbacks in the global climate system. Dr. Weyant noted that without a fuller systemic understanding of linkages and related data, many of the integrated assessments in the early 2000s, specifically simplistic cost-benefit models, were only practical at local levels and lost their relevance at the global scale. Recently, modelers and analysts improved the relevance of integrated assessments by incorporating more governance, land, water, and food capabilities; developing shared social-economic pathway scenarios to system modeling; and gathering diverse actors to advance regional integrated assessment initiatives. Examples include the MIT Global Integrated Systems Model (IGSM); and the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research’s (PIK’s) Integrated Assessment Modelling framework (PIAM); both of which are described further on. Dr. Weyant indicated, however, there is a need to continue addressing gaps in understanding various systemic linkages, feedbacks, and uncertainties. He suggested that further analysis is needed of subsystems that exist and operate within larger systems to adequately understand higher-level interactions and feedbacks. Such a method was applied to the IPCC’s on sustainable development and international equity in 2001, which tried to model decisions made in climate policy. A birds-eye view of how climate policy fits within larger frames of sustainable development and international equity was applied instead of a dissected analysis of individual decisions and actors (). The climate-policy system may not have direct control of movement and activity in other systems such as “Environmental and Socio-economic Impacts” and “Equity and Sustainable Development Policy,” but what Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). 1995.

The efforts of integrative assessment models to identify higher-level connections and feedbacks, however, have been met with criticism regarding mistaken attribution or oversimplification. Dr. Weyant addressed these critiques by referencing the models Dynamic Integrated Climate-Economy (DICE), Policy Analysis of the Greenhouse Effect (PAGE), and Climate Framework for Uncertainty, Negotiation, and Distribution (FUND) that quantify the social cost of carbon. These models, while integrating across human and physical earth systems, only use a few factors—economy and population for human systems and carbon cycle for physical earth systems—to identify a correlation between global mean temperature with global damages. These models also establish a single fixed social price on carbon, even though additional factors may influence the relationship (). Dr. Weyant emphasized that such a simplistic approach to integrated assessment is not embodied in all IAMs, particularly for the task of quantifying the cost of carbon that can range from as little as $37 per ton of CO to as large as $1,000, depending on the factors assessed (). Europe, for example, developed more complex IAMs for the cost of carbon by attempting to add input assumptions representative of different components of the earth system to capture more detailed costs and benefits, such as aggregate gross domestic product (GDP), GDP per capita, and gross climate outcomes. The added complexities to these IAMs enable them to assess systems more holistically and to develop sustainability indicators that cover a diverse ground of human capital, economic, and environmental impacts and drivers, including land use, ecosystems, net primary productivity, water and heat stress, electric generation and capacity, and cost effectiveness. PBL’s Integrated Model to Assess the Global Environment (IMAGE) exemplifies diverse Statistical models used by the EPA to estimate the social cost of carbon—DICE (Dynamic Integrated Climate-Economy), PAGE (Policy Analysis of the Greenhouse Effect), and FUND (Climate Framework for Uncertainty, Negotiation, and Distribution).

The wide range of sectors and systems represented in this model allow for tracing pathways for actions, decisions, and activities across food, water, land, technology, and population sectors. Despite progress made in integrating human and physical earth systems in assessments, Dr. Weyant noted a lack of social indicators for things such as equity, connectedness, culture, and health in the six “complex” IAMs presented—IGSM, GCAM, PIK, MESSAGE, PBL IMAGE, and MERGE., , , , Integration could allow these assessments to factor in social indicators and costs, but only if the scientific community increases its flexibility and willingness to gather such information, as some important drivers for these models are inputs, not outputs. Other areas of need for IAMs include research on ocean acidification, irrigation potentials and aquifer net positions, black carbon, and subsurface carbon sinks. During the brief question-and-answer session, Dr. Weyant was asked to describe if and how IAMs contribute to the policy landscape and practical work. He said many models could support decision making if downscaled to a regional context where policymakers act. These downscaled models, however, may leave out interactions and Stehfest, E., et al. 2014. Integrated Assessment of Global Environmental Change with IMAGE 3.0.

For example, regional models may not adequately predict global water and crop shortage trends that constrain or enable trade and agriculture in a specified region. Due to limitations of regional models, he noted that decision makers could use their results as a baseline of potential outcomes. , Max McGraw Professor of Sustainable Enterprise and director of the Erb Institute for Global Sustainable Enterprise at the University of Michigan, discussed the progress made in developing models to support decision making for sustainability and additional efforts still needed to address remaining challenges. He opened his discussion by pointing to the increasing prevalence of research in decision sciences and the emergence of studies that provide relevant context to sustainability. One study by Baba Shiv et al. (1999) on emotion versus cognition argued that if processing resources become limited and individuals feel cognitively taxed by the decision, then individuals often instinctively choose options that appeal to them on an emotional level. This has direct application to individuals facing large sustainability decisions. Shiv, B., and A. Fedorikhin. 1999. Heart and mind in conflict: The interplay of affect and cognition in consumer decision making. 26:278–292. ""2 Decision Sciences, Demography, and Integrated Assessment Modeling."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2016. Transitioning Toward Sustainability: Advancing the Scientific Foundation: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/23533. A study devised by Dr. Arvai and others on trade-offs compared consumer preferences at gas stations when prompted with information about a singular attribute of the gasoline versus information on multiple attributes. When provided with only information on the location of oil extraction, the majority of Canadian participants chose gasoline from the oil sands of Canada first, followed by American oil second, Saudi Arabian third, Venezuelan fourth, and Nigerian fifth. Using the decision science technique of swing weighting, however, Dr. Arvai and his team found that Canadian preferences changed when provided with additional attributes such as origin, cost per liter, greenhouse gas emissions, overall environmental impact, and human rights score of the country of origin (). On average, Canadians preference for Canadian tar sand oil dropped from first to fourth, U.S. oil from second to first, Saudi Arabian oil from third to second, Venezuelan oil from fourth to third, and Nigerian oil stayed at fifth. A complete lack of calibration between values important to individuals and the decisions they made persisted in different variations of the study with the rate never eclipsing 50 percent. Dr. Arvai called for framing these questions of preference in a manner that does not incite individuals to make decisions based on an emotional appeal, but instead in the larger context of intergenerational well-being. Another example of prevalent research in decision sciences with relevant context to sustainability is the increasingly popular decision science concept of “nudging,” which provides an option to encourage individuals to make rational decisions based on their values as opposed to emotional decisions. Proponents of nudging suggest that if one can identify the instinctive patterns of biased preferences, then one can reconfigure the world to help individuals make choices internally consistent with their values. Though such nudge studies have been highly successful, they suggest that individuals realize their internally consistent preferences in decision making without much effort, which does not completely align with the complexities associated with sustainability decision making. Using the concept of nudging to guide society in the right direction in making sustainability decisions may not make significant progress on some of the largest sustainability challenges. Daniel Kahneman’s book recognizes the need for more active cognition by advising individuals to slow down in high-stake decisions. Dr. Arvai counter argues Kahneman’s speed argument for high-quality decision making by noting that individuals will simply make bad decisions more slowly due to the difficulty of weighing preferences and trade-offs.

Additionally, he said a missing essential element is imposing a structure that can decompose complex decision problems into cognitively manageable parts to help move society toward internally consistent choices that would lead to intergenerational well-being. Dr. Arvai also discussed new efforts to address needs and opportunities related to sustainability and reiterated the importance of structure (). Firstly, collaboration with communities and individuals may improve understanding, identification, and characterization of the decision problems and opportunities they face. In addition, identification of appropriate objectives and performance measures may be essential to decision making. In the sustainability context, dialogue often focuses on making more sustainable decisions without defining what “more sustainable” means. Regarding indicators, from a decision-making standpoint, some measurement challenges remain—a multitude of metrics for sustainability can be devised, yet an individual decision maker may only handle about five to seven at any one time. Thus, paring down the indicators most useful for decision making and developing a list of creative and substantially different alternatives may facilitate decision making. Confronting trade-offs directly is also a needed element in addressing sustainability decision making and finding pathways for individuals, whether sustainability decision makers or stakeholders, to make tough trade-off decisions. Further, an adaptive management and iterative decision-making process where individuals make decisions and then implement, evaluate, learn from, and remake those decisions can highly benefit sustainability decision making. As an example, he pointed to a research project with Michigan State University focused on decision making for an energy transition in the context of sustainability that developed a number of decision support tools to move individuals toward preferences more internally consistent with their values and sustainability goals. Dr. Arvai concluded his discussion by pointing to the need for further work in behavioral science dealing specifically with sustainability. There is also a need to scale up from purely behavior studies to prescriptive studies on how to move individuals to make decisions internally consistent with their values and objectives. , founding director of the Wittgenstein Centre for Demography and Global Human Capital (a new collaboration between the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA), the Austrian Academy of Sciences and the WU-Vienna University of Economics and Business), examined global population trends in the context of sustainability. He discussed how human numbers and demographic differential vulnerability relate to sustainability challenges, as well as what well-being indicators and demography metrics offer for sustainability science. He began with a brief analysis of world population outlooks commenting that population metrics had varying degrees of uncertainty largely due to rapid fertility rate declines in Africa (). He also presented Bessette, D., J. Arvai, and V. Campbell-Arvai. 2014. Decision support framework for developing regional energy strategies. 48:1401–1408.

Transitioning Toward Sustainability: Advancing the Scientific Foundation: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/23533. population outlooks based on level of education (). Recent research at the IIASA predominantly focused on producing what Dr. Lutz termed “the human core of the shared socioeconomic pathways,” which includes population numbers, age structures, gender distributions, and educational attainment levels. Regarding heterogeneity of the human population, education may be considered the single most important source of observable population heterogeneity after age and sex. In the context of population dynamics, the changing educational composition of the population directly influences changes in population growth and age distribution. Additionally, education is largely considered a crucial determinant of individual empowerment and human capital—driving socioeconomic development in public health, economic growth, quality of institutions, and democracy. As such, this type of analysis may provide important insights as related to sustainability. Dr. Lutz elaborated on education as a demographic dimension by describing the education-cognition effect, where such variables as health, fertility, and other forms of behavior have an established functional causality to cognition and education. At the individual level, education increases cognitive skills, which may lead to less risky behavior by extending the planning horizon to enable a person to better plan ahead and learn from past damage at the individual and social level. Education can also positively affect health and physical well-being by acting as a growth enhancement. Better-educated societies typically tend to have a higher GDP, which may also decrease vulnerability. In one series of studies, IIASA asked the question, “What is more important for infant mortality, the mother’s income or education?” The mother’s education consistently proved the most important factor at the individual, household, and national levels. Pamuk, E. R., R. Fuchs, and W. Lutz. 2011. Comparing relative effects of education and economic resources on infant mortality in developing countries. 37(4):637-664. ""2 Decision Sciences, Demography, and Integrated Assessment Modeling."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2016. Transitioning Toward Sustainability: Advancing the Scientific Foundation: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/23533. In the context of human capital, demographers focus on the quantity of formal education for data measurement. They also consider informal education, though it is more difficult to measure. “Education stocks” typically measured in mean years of school or full distribution of highest educational attainment largely determines human capital. A population pyramid study for Singapore in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s observed a process of demographic metabolism and intergenerational change where the educated population increased as the country transformed from developing to developed. Another study conducted by Dr. Lutz and others at IIASA calculated projections of population growth based on education’s relationship to fertility (). In Kenya, highly educated populations had an average of two children compared with more than six children in uneducated populations. Dr. Lutz addressed the issue of the human population’s adaptive capacity to climate change. A recently completed 5-year project that forecasted society’s adaptive capacity to climate change illustrates that society’s capacity to innovate and develop green technologies and mitigation strategies is a function of education in society. Dr. Lutz and others pointed to a clear differential vulnerability in adaptive capacity to climate change where climate change does not affect the entire population, but rather affects livelihoods, health, and migration possibilities and depends on the individual’s empowerment. Similar results were summarized for vulnerability to natural disasters, where research established education as a key determinant. Thus, generally empowering the population to adequately respond to climate change challenges may be more effective than only developing concrete climate change infrastructure. Such data may also indicate that, in addition to universal primary education, near universal secondary education may also improve sustainable development. Lutz, W., and S. KC. 2011.

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/23533. In identifying other indicators relating to human well-being, he said that being alive is a basic prerequisite often missed by sustainability indicators and metrics. However, Dr. Lutz argued that mere survival may not sufficiently achieve sustainability and pointed to empowered life years as a possible alternative measure. Empowered life years could encompass healthy life expectancy (how many years an individual can expect to be alive and in good health), or literate life expectancy, poverty life expectancy, happy life expectancy, or any combination of these factors. A possible sustainability metric based on demographic indicators would measure empowered life expectancy and account for whether it declined over time in any subpopulation or not. The question-and-answer session raised the issue of conflict and sustainability and if any studies examined the relationship between levels of education and conflict within the boundaries of a country. Dr. Lutz referenced a body of research that related empowerment and the education of a population to political outcomes and processes—indicating there is a relationship between demography and democracy. He also mentioned global migration and how the choice to migrate may be essential in terms of sustainability and that migration should be incorporated into integrative modeling. It was noted that as an extremely complex and multifaceted issue, migration may not have a single solution, particularly with respect to global environmental change. , professor, Department of Global Health and Department of Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences at the University of Washington, discussed drivers of indicators and metrics as they relate to frameworks for evaluating health systems and climate change. Many health indicators focus on children and often integrate many health issues, such as nutrition, vaccination of children, and childhood mortality. In 2015 the World Health Organization (WHO) released an operational framework composed of ten components related to building climate-resilient health systems ().

Transitioning Toward Sustainability: Advancing the Scientific Foundation: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/23533. One challenge Dr. Ebi noted for developing metrics around climate-informed health programs is the need to better account for information provided by models of climate systems. For example, the public health sector creates metrics around heat-related mortality, but those metrics do not take into account short-term forecasts about climate change. This would help public health officials to better set up early warning systems and make action plans for periods of decades or longer. Indicators and metrics are needed to better understand what has been learned about climate programs and assess other ways to learn those lessons. Related to this learning process is the incorporation of theory of change, which is “a comprehensive description and illustration of how and why a desired change is expected to happen in a particular context. It is focused on mapping out or ‘filling in’ what has been described as the ‘missing middle’ between what a program or change initiative does (its activities or interventions) and how these lead to desired goals being achieved.” Dr. Ebi noted that many organizations have adopted this approach for development projects and that there will be upcoming opportunities to review their work to assess successes and failures. In conclusion, Dr. Ebi said that there are many potential indicators related to sustainability in the literature and being used in practice, but that there needs to ""2 Decision Sciences, Demography, and Integrated Assessment Modeling."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2016. Transitioning Toward Sustainability: Advancing the Scientific Foundation: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/23533. be a systematic way of integrating them all. There is also the need for an institutional and political climate that encourages the development of indicators that aim to be broader than single issue-based foundations. , associate professor at McGill University, discussed models that support decisions related to sustainability, gaps and critical barriers to models, and new efforts needed to address opportunities related to sustainability. Dr. Bennett framed the discussion around sustainability development goals, and identified successes in an integrated assessment model as moving the needle closer to achieving those goals (). One of the first applications of integrated assessment models was to understand environmental and economic impacts of acid rain on biological systems. From there, they were further developed for the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to integrate climate and economics into an understanding of global systems. They were also developed for the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, which integrated ecological feedback into biogeophysical models. This integration was accomplished with output from biogeophysical models used by the IPCC as input into models with ecological feedback incorporated, such as InVEST or other ecosystem service models. Ongoing work with these models focuses on incorporating the needs and consideration of stakeholders and decision makers. The Madingley Model from Microsoft Research’s Computational Science Laboratory in Cambridge is the first General Ecosystem Model, which attempts to simulate all life on Earth. The model couples key biological processes underpinning life cycles and behaviors of all of the planet’s organisms. Dr. Bennett said integrated assessment models have become increasingly more robust and rigorous; however, successful models may result from increasing parameterization until desired outputs are achieved. The millennium assessment models were different, i.e., more robust, because they were more integrated and contained more feedbacks (e.g., climate, economics, ecology). Remaining gaps include large scale models with limited focus that are not useful for decision making. For example, there is generally a single focus on the effect of a single intervention, such as food security with limited integration of energy systems. Ecology is often missing from models, and social systems are entirely nonevident except for economics. Feedbacks are rare and are limited in action within models, especially ecological feedbacks. There is limited model validation, so accuracy is unknown. Dr. Bennett said her research group ran InVEST on data for more than 190 counties with 12 different ecosystem services; however, there were only three services they could model using InVEST. There was also no correlation between the InVEST model output and actual data. This lack of correlation could be from inaccurate on-the-ground measurements or errors within the model. No amount of reparametrizing could correlate the model with data from the field. This raises questions about whether these models should be used for decision making when there is so much uncertainty and no means yet of addressing that uncertainty or risk. Dr. Bennett discussed new efforts needed to further move toward well-being. Codesign and coproduction are key areas for development, which engages users not only at the end of the process but also as contributors to the development of scenarios and models. Dr. Bennett shared an example of a project that engaged shareholders in developing scenarios. The project focused on communities in a mostly agricultural region southeast of Montreal, Canada interested in land-use planning and designing better networks among forest patches to improve ecosystem services. Dr. Bennett’s group engaged mayors and land-use planners to develop a scientifically and theoretically interesting project around ecosystems services that provided land-use planners with useable information. The project further focused on land use and cover, which are parameters planners can manipulate to increase biodiversity. These parameters were tied to a set of 12 ecosystem services in the region. The relationships among land use, ecosystem services, and biodiversity were evaluated for the past, from the year1900 on, for the present, and into the future. Stakeholders were engaged to develop future land-use scenarios, and models were built around those scenarios. Different ecosystem services would be expected from different landscapes determined by land-use decisions (). Land-use planners wanted to optimize ecosystem services, represented by different petals on a diagram, by adjusting where forest patches were located on the landscape. Another key area for future efforts is in better thinking about futures, as in scenarios for modeling future outcomes. Dr. Bennett discussed Seeds of a Good Anthropocene, which is a project focusing on finding pockets ""2 Decision Sciences, Demography, and Integrated Assessment Modeling."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2016. Transitioning Toward Sustainability: Advancing the Scientific Foundation: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/23533. of a better future that already exist today and using them to understand how, where, and why transitions occur. There are many utopian visions in classic literature and in modeled scenarios in scientific literature, but there is never an explanation of the transition needed to arrive at the scenario. Other key topics that are part of utopian narratives that need to be incorporated into integrative assessment models include cultural diversity, resilience, political economy, and urban centers. They collected 350 “seeds” from all around the world, which she described as not just good-news stories but examples that can lead to real transitions to sustainability and be used to rethink the future in entirely new ways. , professor of sociology and environmental science and policy and assistant vice president for environmental research at Michigan State University, presented on informing sustainability science through advances in environmental decision making. The National Research Council (NRC) report and the United Nations Millennium Ecosystem Assessment led to a body of scholarship on the relationships between human well-being and the environment. The focus on inclusive human well-being and the environment ""2 Decision Sciences, Demography, and Integrated Assessment Modeling."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2016. Transitioning Toward Sustainability: Advancing the Scientific Foundation: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/23533. allows researchers and policy makers to focus on a select number of indicators that are broad, have normative consensus, and for which relatively good data exist. A more select list of indicators helps to avoid a cacophony of hundreds of indicators and can supplement standard economic measures, such as gross domestic product per capita. There is an increasing amount of empirical research on the factors that influence well-being. Measures of resources, for example, are used as inputs along with contextual information to determine the factors that shape resource use. Another example is the relationships among carbon dioxide emissions, measures of stress on the environment, and measures of well-being. These relationships can be used to identify countries that seem to be doing very well in terms of well-being and examine the factors that led to success in those countries. For example, one factor is governmental institutions, which could develop strategies that would help move other countries toward better human well-being while maintaining minimal impacts. Dr. Dietz said that further work is need in several areas, including on whether the environment and other species are the only means to human well-being, what other ethical theories or values justify endpoints, how varying ethical theories are reconciled, and what other theories can shape research on how resources, institutions, and people influence endpoints. The identification of measurement properties about endpoints is also needed, as ""2 Decision Sciences, Demography, and Integrated Assessment Modeling."" National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2016. Transitioning Toward Sustainability: Advancing the Scientific Foundation: Proceedings of a Workshop. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/23533. well as an examination into how variables (indicators) that society conjectures drive endpoints. Lastly, the issue of discounting or substitutability of resources remains an outstanding challenge to address. Dr. Dietz said that ethical theories are a key area of investigation and that it has been empirically shown that peoples’ values and concern with the biosphere (including other species) is correlated with, but also distinct from, altruism directed toward other people. An examination of whether major changes in the biosphere, such as Glacier National Park without glaciers or Joshua Tree National Park without trees, matter intrinsically to society is an example of how new ethical theories need to be brought into natural resource decision making. Key lessons have been learned in this research area. There is widespread acknowledgment that there is global environmental change of coupled human ecology and natural systems and not just climate change. Such systems are complex and evolving, and researchers have to be cautious about how subsystems are isolated for studying or modeling. Interdisciplinary work is essential, and social networks are fundamental to learning about and responding to change. Sustainability is about linking the conservation community with the development community, but in considering development and well-being, it is also important to consider what other 21st century issues may affect human well-being and the environment, such as globalization, the Internet of Things, robotics, artificial intelligence, and bio- and nanotechnology; however, 19th and 20th century challenges also still exist—poverty, violence, and discrimination. These issues need to be integrated to determine how they affect each other in addition to well-being. For example, what response would be needed if developments in robotics and artificial intelligence over the next 50 years substantially reduced the demand for labor? What effect would that scenario have on poverty and human well-being, and how would that fit into the current thinking about sustainability? This leads to another key lesson learned, Dr. Dietz said, which is that uncertainty pervades. At best, uncertainty can be characterized as quantifiable risks, but typically it is characterized as meta-uncertainty. Meta-uncertainty is uncertainty about how to characterize a system, including how other subsystems influence the overall system. Methods are being developed and approaches framed to understand and deal with this uncertainty, which is a form of adaptive risk management. Institutions and networks that learn in the face of such uncertainty are needed to further develop this idea of adaptive risk management. Dr. Dietz said that there has been a lot learned about values and their influence on decision making. Researchers are beginning to learn how to link scientific analysis to public deliberation about values. Acknowledging values and learning how to incorporate values into research are important. There is an iterative communication process between the public and those conducting scientific analysis, which links public deliberation with the analysis. A 2008 NRC report on public participation concluded that “when done well, public participation improves the quality and legitimacy of decisions and builds the capacity of all involved to engage in the policy process.” Improvement in this context means that the quality of decisions or assessments is better. There is a challenge, Dr. Dietz said, when conducting an analysis in figuring out how to engage multiple standpoints, acknowledge different types of expertise, and take advantage of social learning on networks. Individuals who engage in an analysis may have several different types of expertise. Scientific expertise is at the center of this, but there are multiple types of scientific expertise: Scientific expertise about substance: expert knowledge about the systems and processes that will be affected by decisions. Scientific expertise about process and decision making: expert knowledge about individual and collective decision making, including valuation. Community expertise: knowledge based on life experience and living in systems that will be affected—“traditional ecological knowledge.” Political expertise: knowledge about conflicts, assumptions, trust, and informal institutional arrangements based on engagement in policy systems.

Value expertise: everyone has legitimacy regarding values, but good processes and research may help articulate values and reduce value conflict. Sustainability is about decisions and making trade-offs under uncertainty. There are many different theories on how to conduct trade-offs and address uncertainty, but there needs to be more work on learning how to integrate theories and determine which ones function best in which context. In general, more work is needed in being more attentive to context—context matters. There needs to be more consideration of individuals as being embedded in communities, which are embedded in nations. There is a tradition of place-based studies, but there is also a need to incorporate the individual and a need for the individual to be integrated into large macrocomparative (across nations, time, and/or institutions) analyses. Datasets are needed that provide comparable data on representative samples of individuals across large numbers of context and different nations. Such data would help to understand contextual- and individual-level effects. An example of how this can be accomplished is with the World Fertility Survey, where comparable surveys were conducted in a large number of countries. These surveys examined how women’s education affected fertility, as well as how the national context affected women’s education on fertility. More data are needed, though, as is the need to build more of a community of new scholars and practitioners. See http://ghdx.healthdata.org/series/world-fertility-survey-wfs.

In 1999 the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine released a landmark report, Our Common Journey: A Transition toward Sustainability, which attempted to “reinvigorate the essential strategic connections between scientific research, technological development, and societies’ efforts to achieve environmentally sustainable improvements in human well-being.”1 The report emphasized the need for place-based and systems approaches to sustainability, proposed a research strategy for using scientific and technical knowledge to better inform the field, and highlighted a number of priorities for actions that could contribute to a sustainable future. The past 15 years have brought significant advances in observational and predictive capabilities for a range of natural and social systems, as well as development of other tools and approaches useful for sustainability planning. In addition, other frameworks for environmental decision making, such as those that focus on climate adaptation or resilience, have become increasingly prominent. A careful consideration of how these other approaches might intersect with sustainability is warranted, particularly in that they may affect similar resources or rely on similar underlying scientific data and models. To further the discussion on these outstanding issues, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine convened a workshop on January 14–15, 2016. Participants discussed progress in sustainability science during the last 15 years, potential opportunities for advancing the research and use of scientific knowledge to support a transition toward sustainability, and challenges specifically related to establishing indicators and observations to support sustainability research and practice. This report summarizes the presentations and discussions from the workshop. 2 Decision Sciences, Demography, and Integrated Assessment Modeling Appendix C: Biographies of Planning Committee, Speakers, and Staff You're looking at OpenBook, NAP.edu's online reading room since 1999.

National Research Council. 2013. . Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/18264. 6 Policies for Reducing GHG Emissions from and Petroleum Use by Light-Duty Vehicles To reach the twin goals addressed in this study, significant changes in policy will be needed to induce a move toward vehicle-fuel systems whose petroleum demand and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are very different from those of today. The modeling and results from suggest a range of possible policy and technology pathways by which these goals might be met. This chapter reviews policy options, including those analyzed in (for example, vehicle fuel economy and GHG standards and renewable fuel standards), that may offer promise. Each policy is described and assessed based on evidence about its use, effectiveness, and any shortcomings. Policy suggestions based on these assessments are provided in . The policies needed to reach the goals for reductions in petroleum use and GHG emissions will have to differ dramatically from those of the past and could incur a high up-front cost. However, as the modeling results in illustrate, these costs may be more than recouped in later years. Policies are needed that can promote major changes in direction in the extensive private investments associated with vehicle manufacturing, fuel production and related infrastructure—changes that in turn will affect the market decisions made by consumers and businesses which ultimately shape such investments. The extent to which the resulting transition to a low-petroleum light-duty vehicle (LDV) system with low net GHG emissions will require displacing the incumbent internal combustion, liquid fueled vehicle technology is not known. However, major changes clearly will be needed in the use of natural resources and in the impacts of GHG emissions associated with supplying LDV fuels. Given the inherent uncertainties, an adaptive policy framework is needed that will be responsive to markets, technologies, and progress toward achieving the goals. 6.1 POLICIES INFLUENCING AUTOMOTIVE ENERGY USE AND GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS Several arenas of policy are relevant as means of influencing automotive energy use and GHG emissions: land-use, transportation, energy, environmental protection, and technology. These arenas are interrelated and the relationships are sometimes implicit. Failure to recognize the interrelationships between policy arenas could result in poor coordination or even contradictions among policy signals. Some of the relationships have been made explicit as policy makers have realized, for example, the interactions between land-use planning and transportation planning. The challenge of achieving deep reductions in petroleum use and GHG emissions requires an even greater degree of coordination among the policy arenas influencing the LDV sector. shows on a normalized scale the total nationwide levels of several key LDV-related impacts that have been a subject of public policy. From 1970 through 2005, light-duty vehicle miles traveled (VMT) increased by 160 percent. Over the same period, gains in fuel efficiency held LDV petroleum demand and CO emissions to a 74 percent increase. Modest absolute declines were achieved for traffic fatalities. The greatest improvement was seen in vehicle conventional air pollution, which achieved an absolute reduction of 65 percent by 2005 relative to its 1970 level. Land-use policies are perhaps the deepest foundation of the automotive system, helping, along with geography, to shape transportation patterns through the ages. U.S. land-use governance remains highly localized, and many levels of administration are involved in the planning, permitting, and ""6 Policies for Reducing GHG Emissions from and Petroleum Use by Light-Duty Vehicles."" National Research Council. 2013. . Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/18264. FIGURE 6.1 Trends in impacts of U.S. light-duty vehicles. SOURCE: DOT, DOE, and EPA statistics. zoning of land use. Higher levels of government traditionally show substantial deference to local prerogatives. Academic understanding of the links between land use and transportation has translated only slowly into policies that might restrain travel demand growth tied to land use. Researchers have identified five land-use features, the “five Ds,” influencing demand for automobile travel: population ensity, land-use iversity, neighborhood esign, major estination accessibility, and transit stop istance from departure and arrival points of transit stops (TRB 2009, p. 52). Although only recently considered in the context of transportation-related petroleum demand and GHG emissions, programs that support or constrain the expansion of croplands and managed forests used for sourcing biofuel feedstocks or for carbon sequestration through afforestation and grassland restoration are another important aspect of land-use policy. Determining the optimal use of land with respect to climate protection raises issues that may require rethinking of such policies (Righelato and Spracklen, 2007; Wise et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2008). Transportation policies center on the provision and operation of the infrastructure needed for mobility. For the automobile, they have focused on building, maintaining, and supporting roadways. In urban areas, transportation policy also supports mass transit, as well as sidewalks and bike paths, and so affects the availability and affordability of alternatives to auto travel. There is a clear emphasis in the U.S. Department of Transportation’s (DOT’s) official mission statement on ensuring speed of conveyance as well as safety and efficiency. With the automobile being by far the dominant mode of transportation for most Americans, facilitating auto travel has been a major part of DOT’s mission. Much of the necessary investment for highways and major roads is accomplished through a federal-state partnership approach, while most local roads are handled by municipalities with varying degrees of state involvement. A key financial reason for the success of automobiles is that the vehicles themselves are purchased by individual consumers, who also pay for operating costs, notably fuel. That leaves to government the provision and maintenance of infrastructure. This contrasts with public transit modes, which require a public or public-private partnership to acquire and operate the vehicles and their supporting infrastructure. Consumers ultimately pay for all aspects of any transport system, with taxes or other user fees supporting the publicly provided elements. U.S. energy policies have roots in natural resource policy. Most pertinent to the auto sector are policies that have facilitated the development of petroleum resources over the years and those related to ensuring access to overseas supplies and securing them vis-à-vis geopolitical considerations. On the domestic front, policies supporting the economic development of oil and gas resources confronted environmental considerations and the need to balance competing players’ demands for use of lands and offshore locations. Thus, the U.S. Department of the Interior long has been involved in petroleum-related activity. The Energy Research and Development Administration was created in 1974, and its successor, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) was formed in 1977, following the 1970s petroleum crisis. In recognition of the importance of petroleum for military operations and as a critical resource for the entire economy, efforts to secure and expand the supply of petroleum have long been and continue to be a key part of U.S. energy policy. ""6 Policies for Reducing GHG Emissions from and Petroleum Use by Light-Duty Vehicles."" National Research Council. 2013. . Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/18264. The 1973-1974 energy crisis prompted the development of policies to encourage energy conservation and promote alternatives to petroleum. The LDV fleet became a key target, and vehicle efficiency standards known as the Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE, standards, were enacted as part of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 (P.L. 94-163). A “gas-guzzler” tax followed in 1978 with passage of the Energy Tax Act (ETA; P.L. 95-618). The 1970s also saw the development of policies to support alternatives to petroleum ranging from synthetic fossil fuels to biofuels. The ETA also introduced an excise tax exemption for gasohol, which subsequently was extended and transformed into a tax credit for ethanol, the volumetric ethanol excise tax credit (VEETC), which until recently stood at $0.45 per gallon of ethanol. A tariff was imposed on imported ethanol to foster domestic biofuel production. Both the tax credit and the tariff expired at the end of 2011. The CAFE credits program for alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) was created by the Alternative Motor Fuels Act of 1988 (P.L. 100-94). It provided credit incentives for the manufacture of vehicles that used alcohol or natural gas fuels, either exclusively or as an alternative to gasoline or diesel fuel. This program induced automakers to sell a large number of dual-fuel vehicles capable of running on E85. However, for a variety of reasons including limited availability of E85 retail outlets, the program has not fostered significant use of alternative fuels (DOT-DOE-EPA, 2002). The Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPAct; P.L. 102-486) established an expanded set of incentives and programs to promote alternative fuels and AFVs. They include mandates for AFV use in the federal fleet and certain state and utility fleets, and authorization for federal support of voluntary AFV deployment programs, which were subsequently implemented by DOE through the Clean Cities program. Among the most recent developments in U.S. energy policy with respect to the LDV sector is the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) instituted as part of the 2005 EPAct (P.L. 109-58). The RFS put in place for the first time a nationwide mandate for use of a fuel other than petroleum. The 2005 EPAct also included expanded incentives for the production and commercialization of a range of AFV technologies. It included tax incentives for AFVs and infrastructure for alternative fuels that are not drop-in fuels. Incentives were provided on a graduated scale to encourage the production of different AFVs (DOE-EERE, 2011a; TIAP, 2012). Metrics related to technical fuel efficiency were used to determine the level of incentives. The incentives were limited to the first 60,000 qualifying vehicles produced by any one automaker. Tax credits initially were for hybrid-electric, battery-electric, and fuel-cell electric vehicles and for qualified diesel and natural gas LDVs. Numerous modifications have occurred over the years and Congress allowed the tax credits for hybrid electric vehicles, and diesel and natural gas vehicles to expire at the end of 2010. Tax credits for battery-electric motorcycles, three-wheeled electric vehicles, and low-speed neighborhood-electric vehicles expired at the end of 2011, as did a credit for converting conventional gasoline and diesel vehicles to plug-in hybrid or all-electric propulsion systems. Currently, under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Tax Act and the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, the United States uses a program that extends a federal tax credit of up to $7,500 to buyers of qualified plugin hybrid and battery-electric LDVs. The credit is applicable in the year of the vehicle’s purchase. Subsequent legislation limits the credit to the first 200,000 eligible vehicles from each qualified automaker. When that threshold is reached, the tax credit for subsequent vehicles sold is reduced in stages, disappearing completely after six calendar quarters. Fuel-cell electric vehicles remain eligible for a federal tax credit of $4,000-$8,000, depending on their fuel economy ratings, but it is scheduled to expire in 2014. In December 2007, the Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA; P.L. 110-140) expanded the RFS to target 35 billion gallons of ethanol-equivalent biofuels plus 1 billion gallons of biomass-based diesel by 2022, with life-cycle GHG emissions stipulations designed to foster cellulosic and other advanced biofuels. The same legislation raised the combined light-duty fleet CAFE standard to a 35 mpg level by 2020 while authorizing other structural reforms in the standards. The EISA also established a loan guarantee program for construction of manufacturing facilities for advanced-vehicle batteries and battery systems and requires a phase-out of the dual-fuel vehicle CAFE credit program by 2020. Because automobiles and their supporting infrastructure impact the environment in numerous ways, many aspects of environmental policy come into play. However, it is control of the direct emissions from motor vehicles that is most relevant. The history of Los Angeles smog, the pioneering work of Arie Haagen-Smit in linking smog to tailpipe pollution, and the subsequent development of emissions regulations first in California and then federally with the broad authority established by the Clean Air Act (CAA 1970) all are elements of one of the iconic stories of U.S. environmental policy (Mondt, 2000; CARB, 2011). At the beginning of this process in the 1960s, air pollution science was in its infancy and controls were rudimentary. As development continued, progressively tighter standards were set for restricting tailpipe emissions, prescribing fuel formulations, and limiting fuel evaporation from vehicles and fuel pumps. The most stringent regulations for combustion-based vehicles, such as California’s partial zero emission vehicle A fuel consisting of a blend of gasoline and ethanol. This tax credit is described in greater detail at , accessed February 6, 2012. ""6 Policies for Reducing GHG Emissions from and Petroleum Use by Light-Duty Vehicles."" National Research Council. 2013. . Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/18264. standard, cut emissions per vehicle-mile by over two orders of magnitude, reducing an LDV’s direct conventional air pollution impacts to nearly negligible levels. Quantitatively, the CAA policies addressing emissions have been by far the most effective areas of policy, resulting in a substantial absolute reduction of conventional pollution from LDVs even in the face of rising VMT (see ). The CAA’s overarching requirement for healthy air, embodied in the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), is what ultimately anchors the policy. The law obligates the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to pursue fact-based assessments of air pollutants’ impacts on public health and welfare and to promulgate NAAQS solely on that basis. Economic considerations can enter in only when EPA develops the regulations that determine how the NAAQS will be met. The Supreme Court (2007) interpreted the CAA’s definition of air pollutants to include greenhouse gases and said that they could be subject to regulation if found to endanger public health or welfare. The EPA subsequently made such an “endangerment” finding (2009), setting in motion a regulatory process that started with GHG emissions standards for motor vehicles and is being extended to other sources. A large number of policy measures have the potential to influence technical innovation in LDVs and fuels. The federal department involved most actively in directly promoting new automotive technology has been the DOE. Its role primarily has been one of funding basic science and engineering research related to vehicles and fuels and pursuing demonstration and deployment programs that might foster market adoption of the technologies developed. Many National Research Council (NRC) studies reviewed this research, development, demonstration, and deployment approach while suggesting refinements and highlighting the challenges and obstacles involved. Examples of such energy technology policy programs include the Advanced Battery Consortium, the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles, the hydrogen-oriented FreedomCAR program, and the present US Drive program that emphasizes electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids. From the 1970s forward, parallel efforts have been aimed at developing renewable fuels. 6.1.6 Decision Making Through the Matrix of Policy Arenas Based on methods of technology assessment and economic analysis as discussed below in this chapter, policy measures are established through a matrix of policy arenas such as those outlined above. The preceding overview of the different arenas of public policy that influence the LDV sector—transportation, land use, environmental protection, energy, and technology—underscores the complexity of the challenge from a practical policy-making perspective. A national decision to reach goals such as those given in this committee’s statement of task will likely need to involve all of these different policy arenas and the associated diversity of congressional committees, federal agencies, and stakeholder interests, along with an analogous range of interests at state and local levels of government. Reaching a national decision to achieve the goals will be a complicated undertaking that requires an adaptive policy framework as discussed below in this chapter. 6.2 WAYS TO INFLUENCE PETROLEUM USE AND GHG EMISSIONS EFFECTS IN THE LDV SECTOR Policies that affect petroleum use, GHG emissions, or both ultimately exert their influence through a few key parameters: Vehicle energy intensity—typically, the energy required to move the average vehicle of the on-road LDV fleet 1 mile; Petroleum share of the energy used to power LDV fleets (when energy security and dependence on petroleum is the issue) or net GHG emissions balance of the fuel system (when climate disruption is the issue); the latter is often described as the average well-to-wheels GHG emissions of the energy used to power the vehicle fleet; and Volume of travel—typically, the VMT by the on-road LDV fleet. It sometimes is argued that system efficiency constitutes an independent fourth parameter, but that is not the case. Policies that affect system efficiency influence GHG emissions or petroleum use only through one or more of the three parameters listed above. A common analytic framework for transportation energy and climate-change analysis involves factoring emissions based on the three key parameters, which interact multiplicatively. Addressing all three (vehicle energy intensity, petroleum share of energy use in LDVs, and travel activity) is important because a policy that focuses only on a single parameter is likely to require it to be pushed to extraordinary lengths. Whether the policies target one or more of the parameters, they operate by influencing market actors whose decisions determine the values of the parameters, which in turn determine LDV petroleum use and GHG emissions. Policies that For advantages and disadvantages of the use of well-to-wheels approaches to regulating GHG emissions related to fuels, see below. However, in view of the interest in policies promoting system efficiency, they are discussed below in this chapter. For example, the average on-road fleet fuel economy would have to exceed 180 mpg if vehicle energy intensity were the only parameter targeted for reducing LDV petroleum use; see footnote 2 in Chapter 2. ""6 Policies for Reducing GHG Emissions from and Petroleum Use by Light-Duty Vehicles."" National Research Council. 2013. . Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/18264. target one parameter may influence others. A well-known example is the difference in impact on vehicle GHG emissions and energy use produced by motor fuel taxes versus efficiency standards. Motor fuel taxes stimulate demand for more fuel-efficient vehicles. They also raise the variable cost of driving, which in turn reduces VMT. In contrast, fuel economy standards require the sale of more fuel-efficient vehicles, the cost of driving, thereby VMT. CAFE is effective at pushing new technology into the fleet but is unlikely to affect the size of vehicles that consumers purchase (at least with the current footprint-based system). Taxes discourage people from driving more and encourage consumers to purchase smaller vehicles. The benefits of CAFE and taxes are largely independent of one another. Both policies have been found to reduce LDV fuel use overall, but the by which each policy reduces total LDV petroleum use or GHG emissions differs. Finally, the cost of reducing emissions by changing any single parameter is likely to rise as the magnitude of required change increases or the time over which the required change is to be accomplished decreases. Policies such as carbon pricing that affect more than a single parameter are generally considered by economists to be most cost-effective. Vehicle energy intensity, petroleum share of the fuel market, and travel demand each is an outcome of market decisions. Thus, the market actors whose decisions affect each of the parameters (and whose decisions on one parameter can affect their decisions on another) have to be examined in assessing policy options. In general, the ultimate actor is the consumer—the owner or other end user of LDVs who purchases vehicles and fuel and, through tax dollars, user fees, and bundled transactions, also pays for roads and other parts of the transportation infrastructure. Through factors including their choices of where to live, work, and shop, consumers determine the urban-regional forms and broader built environment that automotive transportation shapes and serves. The markets that influence LDV petroleum use and GHG emissions involve cash flow from consumers or other end users to the suppliers of transportation-related products and services, most notably, the automobile industry and the motor fuels industry. In most cases, policies designed to influence decisions about motor vehicle purchase and use are directed at these entities rather than at the consumer. For example, motor vehicle fuel economy standards are imposed on vehicle manufacturers, not vehicle purchasers. The penalties for not meeting such standards are directly imposed on these firms and, along with the costs of meeting the standards, may be wholly or in part passed onto consumers. It is therefore left to vehicle manufacturers and fuel producers not only to develop and produce the products required to meet the regulations to which they are subject but also to generate the economic signals that induce the purchase of their products in the required quantities by consumers. 6.3 POLICIES AIMED AT REDUCING VEHICLE ENERGY INTENSITY The ultimate aim of policies to reduce vehicle energy intensity is to lower the average actual on-road fuel consumption of the total LDV fleet. There are two broad approaches available for achieving this. The first is to reduce the average fuel consumption of the typical new vehicle, in all size classes, largely through incorporating technologies that reduce fuel consumption. The second is reduce or eliminate the heaviest and thus least efficient vehicles in the LDV fleet by encouraging the purchase and use of lighter vehicles, which can lead to reduced performance or utility (e.g., reduced load-carrying ability or acceleration). Individual policies can emphasize one of these two approaches, can encourage one while discouraging the other, or can be neutral. 6.3.1 Vehicle Energy Efficiency and GHG Emissions Standards Several countries have enacted standards that mandate the level of energy efficiency or the level of CO emissions that the average newly produced vehicle must achieve by a certain date. Anderson et al. (2011), Eads (2011), and An et al. (2007) describe the vehicle efficiency and GHG emissions standards programs that are in place or under development around the world. The CAFE standards have been in effect the longest, have been studied extensively, and are most pertinent to the committee’s task. The initial CAFE standards were enacted as part of the 1975 Energy Policy and Conservation Act (see for historical and projected LDV vehicle fuel economy). Although the U.S. standards are considered to be regulatory rather than economic, they are enforced through economic penalties. Manufacturers whose annual factory sales of vehicles do not meet the CAFE standards for each of their fleets (domestic and imported cars and domestic and imported trucks) must pay a civil penalty. For the 2011 model year, Although the complex interactions and transactions that determine the provision of transportation infrastructure, associated land-use patterns, and related services are difficult to characterize as a distinct “market,” they also involve a set of actors whose decisions can be viewed through an economic lens. There are exceptions. As is discussed below, “feebates”—subsidies for more fuel-efficient vehicles and taxes on less fuel-efficient ones—cause resources to flow directly between the government and consumers. The same thing is true of direct tax credits. “Factory sales” are sales by the manufacturer to the dealer. Therefore, the number of vehicles of a certain model year actually reaching the con- ""6 Policies for Reducing GHG Emissions from and Petroleum Use by Light-Duty Vehicles.""

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/18264. the penalty was $5.50 for each tenth of a mile per gallon that the manufacturer’s average fuel economy fell short of the standard, multiplied by the total volume of vehicles in the affected fleet (EPA, 2009). As of July 2011, NHTSA had collected a total of $795 million in civil penalties over the life of the CAFE program (NHTSA, 2011). 6.3.2.1 The Lag Between the Fuel Economy of New Vehicles and That of the On-Road Fleet There is a significant difference between the fuel economy of the average new vehicle and that of the average on-road vehicle. The average LDV’s lifetime has been increasing and, according to R.L. Polk, is now about 10.8 years (R.L. Polk and Company, 2011). Vehicles are driven less as they age, and so it takes about 15 years for the age- and travel-weighted average fuel economy of the on-road fleet to reach 90 percent of the average level of new vehicles in a given year, based on the most recently published vehicle survivability statistics (NHTSA, 2006). The CAFE standards apply only to the new-car fleet, and rarely has an effort been made to impact the pace of fleet turnover. In 2007, new legislation set a fuel economy target of 35 mpg (2.9 gal/100 mi) for the combined LDV fleet of cars and trucks, to be achieved by model year 2020. The legislation authorized NHTSA to set standards on the basis of vehicle attributes. The agency settled on vehicle “footprint,” defined as the track width times the wheelbase, as a basis for all LDV standards, building on the similar approach adopted in the 2006 CAFE reform rule for light trucks. Therefore, CAFE standards now vary with the size mix of an automaker’s fleet (). Pursuant to the Obama Administration’s agreement with automakers and other parties to develop a single national program for CAFE standards in coordination with federal and California LDV GHG emissions standards, a more ambitious target date was set, requiring that a 35.5 mpg CAFE-equivalent (counting non-fuel-economy-related GHG emissions) new fleet average be met by model year 2016 (EPA and NHTSA, 2010). This target implies an annual rate of improvement in average new LDV fleet fuel economy of 5 percent. In November 2011, NHTSA and EPA jointly published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to further strengthen CAFE standards and GHG emissions standards for LDVs for the model year (MY) 2017-MY2025 period. The agencies proposed an increase in the standards to a MY2025 target of 54.5 mpg, with GHG emissions reductions (CO equivalent) corresponding to a fleet average of 163 g/mi (EPA and NHTSA, 2011). In fuel economy terms, the agencies project LDV fleet average compliance levels of 40.9 mpg (2.4 gal/100 mi) in 2021 and 49.6 mpg (2.0 gal/100 mi) in 2025. The agreement would provide CAFE credits for the production of vehicles employing certain advanced technologies. The initial 5-year phase, for MY2017-MY2021, provides for a slower rate of increase for light trucks, averaging 2.9 percent per year, compared to a 4.1 percent increase in passenger car standards for the same period. The program also provides for a comprehensive mid-term evaluation prior to finalization of the MY2022-MY2025 standards. Although subject to revision under the mid-term review, the rates of increase proposed for the second phase of the program, covering MY2022-MY2025, are 4.7 percent per year for light trucks and 4.2 percent per year for passenger cars. The projected average annual rate of fuel economy increase for the recently finalized and currently proposed CAFE regulations is 3.6 percent per year over the 2010-2025 period, rising from an achieved MY2010 compliance level of 29.3 mpg (NHTSA, 2012) According to the “footprint” formula now used in computing CAFE, in model year 2016 a compact car such as the Honda Fit, with a model footprint of 40 square feet, would have a fuel economy target of 41.4 mpg (2.42 gal/100 mi), while a full size car, such as the Chrysler 300, with a model footprint of 53 square feet, would have a fuel economy target of 32.8 mpg (3.05 gal/100 mi). A large pickup truck such as the Chevrolet Silverado, with a model footprint of 67 square feet, would have a fuel economy target of 24.7 mpg (4.05 gal/100 mi). These two rulemakings reflect a significant change in the way CAFE standards are developed and issued. Previously, the task had been solely the responsibility of NHTSA, in consultation with other agencies such as the EPA. The standards applied only to the fuel economy of new vehicles. However, NHTSA and the EPA issued the final MY2010-MY2016 standards jointly, and the MY2017-MY2025 standards are being developed and proposed by both agencies in order to address the fuel economy of vehicles and the GHGs they emit. NHTSA’s authority for issuing fuel economy standards remains the 1975 Energy Policy and Conservation Act, sumer differs somewhat from that model year’s factory sales. Manufacturers can carry forward or backward excess CAFE credits for 3 model years in order to offset any shortfalls to a given fleet. Manufacturers cannot transfer credits between fleets or between manufacturers. Penalties are assessed for a given model year and fleet if any shortfall in CAFE during that model year is not offset by these credits (NHTSA, 2012). The most notable exception was the “Cash for Clunkers” program adopted by the Obama Administration in 2009. This is discussed in more detail below. This legislation was the Energy Independence and Security Act. ""6 Policies for Reducing GHG Emissions from and Petroleum Use by Light-Duty Vehicles."" National Research Council. 2013. . Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/18264. as amended by the 2007 EISA. EPA’s authority for GHG emissions standards is the CAA. The factors NHTSA may consider in developing fuel economy standards are not precisely the same as the factors that EPA may use in developing GHG emissions standards, and so the promulgation of a rule covering both fuel economy and GHG emissions requires a considerable amount of interagency coordination to ensure a consistent set of requirements. An additional level of coordination is involved because the state of California, subject to EPA waiver of the CAA preemption provision, has authority to set its own motor vehicle emissions standards. California has agreed to harmonize its standards with the EPA and NHTSA under the single national program terms. 6.3.3 Subsidies for More Fuel-Efficient Vehicles and Fees on Less Fuel-Efficient Vehicles Another policy for encouraging the production and sale of vehicles that are more fuel-efficient and/or emit less CO is to use subsidies, taxes, or both, based on fuel use, CO emissions, or a combination. In the United States, a gas guzzler tax was established by the Energy Tax Act of 1978. Phased in over 1981-1985, this program now involves a graduated level of taxation on passenger cars having a fuel economy below 22.5 mpg (regulatory level, as used for CAFE standards). The gas guzzler tax is proportional to the increase in fuel consumption rate above that of a 22.5 mpg car and the current maximum is $7,700 on cars rated at less than 12.5 mpg. The gas guzzler tax does not apply to light trucks and for at least the past two decades has applied to only a small fraction of vehicles, typically high-performance sports and luxury cars. In its early years, the gas guzzler tax was effective in helping to motivate fuel economy improvements in the least efficient cars in the fleet (Khazzoom, 1994; DeCicco and Gordon, 1995). Japan, many countries in Western Europe, and a few others have had graduated vehicle taxation schedules based on fuel consumption, engine displacement, or some other metric defined for tax purposes. Some of these programs have been recast in recent years to be based on vehicle CO emissions rate. When subsidies for efficient vehicles are added to a vehicle taxation program, it becomes what is referred to as a “feebate” program. Such a program was under discussion as part of the response to the 1973 energy crisis (Difiglio, 1976), but only the gas guzzler tax portion was implemented. Over the years, feebate programs were proposed in a number of states but were never enacted. In 1991, the Canadian Province of Ontario enacted a tax for fuel conservation that levied modest graduated taxes on inefficient vehicles and provided subsidies for a subset of efficient vehicles. In recent years, France has pursued a feebate-type program, known as the “bonus-malus” system, applied at the time of purchase of a vehicle (Bastard, 2010). The amount charged (“malus”) or rebated (“bonus”) depends on the vehicle’s CO type approval test emissions figure. Originally, the amounts ranged from a bonus payment of €1,000 for cars rated under 100 g/km to a fee of €2,600 for cars rated above 250 g/km. A bonus payment of €5,000 applied for vehicles with a CO emissions value below 60 g/km. The incentive provided by these bonus-malus values has been estimated to be broadly equivalent to €150/metric ton of CO (Bastard, 2010). According to Bastard (2010), “the system demonstrated high effectiveness: in 2008, CO emissions from new vehicles in France fell by 9 g/km compared to 2007, falling from 149 g/km to 140 g/km, most of the decrease resulting from the bonus-malus system.” The decrease resulted from three separate impacts: (1) a downsizing in the segment mix, (2) a downsizing in power, and (3) a move to diesel in certain segments. The measure was intended to be revenue neutral, but has turned out to have a net cost for the French state, as the shift in the market to smaller vehicles was higher than anticipated. Bastard estimates that the net budgetary cost was approximately €200 million in 2008 and €500 million in 2009. 6.3.4 Motor Fuel Taxes as an Incentive to Purchase More Fuel-Efficient Vehicles A third type of policy to incentivize the purchase of more fuel-efficient vehicles is motor fuel taxes. Nearly every country levies taxes on motor fuel, but the level of tax varies widely. shows the variance in motor fuel taxes for several major developed countries, in 1990 and in 2010. Fuel prices impact both vehicle purchase decisions with respect to fuel economy and how much vehicles are driven. The sum of these impacts is measured by the elasticity of demand for fuel—defined as the percentage change in fuel purchased divided by the percentage change in fuel price. This elasticity has been estimated by many studies, which generally differentiate between short-term (2 years or less) and long-term (more than 2 years) elasticity. Short-term elasticity generally is interpreted as reflecting changes in VMT. Long-term elasticity is interpreted as reflecting changes in the fuel economy of vehicles purchased and the long-term VMT changes generated by changes in where people live and work. In January 2008 the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) reviewed the literature on fuel price elasticity and concluded: Estimates of the long-run elasticity of demand for gasoline indicate that a sustained increase of 10 percent in price eventually would reduce gasoline consumption by about 4 percent. That effect is as much as seven times larger than the See for a gas guzzler tax program overview and lists of vehicles subject to the tax. This is similar to the “as tested” CAFE standard. Bastard (2010), p. 25. The tax and subsidy values have been adjusted in an effort to make the system more nearly revenue-neutral.

TABLE 6.1 Gasoline and Diesel Prices, Tax, and Percent Tax in 1990 and 2010 SOURCE: Data from Davis et al. (2011), Figures 10.2 and 10.3. estimated short-run response, but it would not be fully realized unless prices remained high long enough for the entire stock of passenger vehicles to be replaced by new vehicles purchased under the effect of higher gasoline prices—or about 15 years … consumers also might adjust to higher gasoline prices by moving or by changing jobs to reduce their commutes—actions they might take if the savings in transportation costs were sufficiently compelling. Those long-term effects would be in addition to consumption savings from short-run behavioral adjustments attributable to higher fuel prices. CBO (2008) A 2009 study titled Moving Cooler: An Analysis of Transportation Strategies for Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions (Collaborative Strategies Group, 2009) modeled how much lower LDV fleet GHG emissions would be in 2050 (relative to 2005) if fuel prices or carbon taxes were used to boost U.S. motor fuel prices to West European levels. The elasticities used in the analysis were comparable to those cited in the 2008 CBO study. The reduction as a result of the improved fuel economy portion of the fuel price impact was 19 percent. The reduction as a result of the VMT impact portion was 8 percent (Collaborative Strategies Group, 2009 pp. B-15 and D-11). Fuel taxes can also differ by fuel type, thereby influencing the choice of engine used to power a vehicle. In Europe, most vehicle models are available in both gasoline and diesel versions. The diesel versions cost more but deliver better fuel economy. France, in particular, taxes diesel at a much lower rate than gasoline—in 2010, the tax on diesel was $3.01/gal whereas the tax on gasoline was $4.16/gal. That differential has been credited with being an important factor in causing a rise in the diesel share of new automobiles in France from 2 percent in 1973 to 74 percent in 2007. Fuel economy improvements reduce motor fuel tax revenues, all else equal, because under current law the amount of tax per gallon of fuel is constant. Inflation also erodes the real value of fuel tax revenues. Finally, substitution of hydrogen or electric vehicles for conventional vehicles would further diminish tax revenues unless those fuels were brought within the purview of the tax law. One solution would be to tax all forms of energy used by vehicles and index the motor fuel tax to inflation and also to the average energy efficiency of all vehicles on the road. For example, if total vehicle miles of travel per unit of energy increased by 3 percent from one year to the next, the tax in the following year would be increased by 3 percent. Such an indexed highway user fee on energy would maintain a constant tax rate per vehicle mile of travel while encouraging car buyers to purchase energy-efficient vehicles. A major impediment to investment in new alternative technologies, even when petroleum prices are high, is uncertainty about the future price path. Investors and consumers are less likely to invest in fuel-efficient technologies that require substantial up-front costs when they are uncertain about the payoffs from those investments. Prices of crude oil have been volatile in the past (). In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the private and public sectors invested heavily in alternative fuels and AFVs, but many of the alternatives became uneconomic when prices of crude oil fell in the mid-1980s and remained low until the early 1990s. One policy to stabilize the prices of petroleum-based fuels at a level that will help ensure a transition to more energy efficiency is through the use of a tax or surcharge on the price of oil that is applied only when oil prices fall below a specified target price. This surcharge would then be inversely related to the price of oil. For example, if the target price of oil with existing taxes is $90/bbl, and the price falls to $85/bbl over a specified period, the surtax would be $5/bbl, ensuring that the market price remains at $90/bbl. If the market price fell below $85/bbl, the surtax would increase, and if the market price rose above $90, then the surtax would be zero. The setting of the target price would be a policy choice made by Congress and the President and implemented in ways similar to other taxes on oil sales with the goal of stabilizing prices of petroleum-based fuels above a minimum price.

FIGURE 6.2 Actual average annual world oil prices from 1980 to 2010 and projected annual world oil prices from 2010 to 2035 under three different scenarios (in 2010 dollars per barrel). SOURCE: (EIA, 2012). Such a price floor or fuel price stabilization policy could be implemented on crude-oil sales in the United States as suggested above, or it could apply only to imported crude oil (Hubbard and Navarro, 2010). Borenstein (2008) shows how the concept of the oil price floor could be tied only to gasoline or other specific fuels that are derived from crude oil. Revenues from any such surcharge would vary over time. They could be earmarked for use in current and proposed subsidies for alternative vehicles and AFVs, or used more broadly for tax or deficit reduction. 6.3.6 Policies to Change the Size and Weight Composition of the LDV Fleet The average on-road fuel economy of the LDV fleet can also be changed by altering the fleet’s composition. One example of the impact that such a change can have is the decline in U.S. on-road fleet average fuel economy due to the increase of trucks in the fleet mix between MY1980 and MY2004. Policies could be designed to encourage or discourage such a shift. An example of a policy change that discourages a shift in fleet mix is the 2007 legislation updating the CAFE program. Before then, CAFE standards were set for and had to be met by each of four fleets (U.S. cars, imported cars, U.S. trucks, and imported trucks) of each manufacturer selling vehicles in the United States. This approach permitted manufacturers to “downsize” or “upsize” their fleets as part of their CAFE fulfillment strategy and helped lead to the proliferation of trucks and SUVs in the fleet mix. The reform rule of 2006 restructured light-duty truck standards, basing them on a vehicle attribute, for which NHTSA selected footprint as discussed above. The EISA 2007 legislation authorized similar restructuring for all LDVs, and footprint-based standards have subsequently been promulgated for passenger cars and light trucks. Although the exact effect depends on the shape of the curve that maps vehicle footprint to regulatory targets for fuel economy, a general intent of this structure is that similarly sized vehicles would be required to achieve a similar increase in fuel economy. The regulatory curves are flattened at the extremes, to avoid standards that are too stringent for the smallest vehicles or standards that are too weak for the largest vehicles. Designing and estimating the effects of such standards involve complex evaluations of many factors that influence vehicle design and engineering, customers’ preferences, and automakers’ product strategies. The analysis given in the EPA and NHTSA rulemaking studies concludes that the adopted footprint-based standards appropriately balance the many considerations that the agencies were required to weigh and does not provide any motivation for automakers to change their fleet mixes for CAFE purposes. Some have argued, though, that the chosen footprint curves inhibit downsizing as a cost-effective compliance strategy and may create an incentive to upsize the LDV fleet in a way that reduces fuel savings and GHG emissions reductions attributable to the standards (Whitefoot and Skerlos, 2012). Other policies, such as the “Cash for Clunkers” program undertaken in 2009, have been designed to encourage consumers to dispose of lower-efficiency vehicles (which were then rendered inoperable) and replace them with higher-efficiency new vehicles, providing a stimulus to new-car sales. While the program was operating, it encouraged the purchase of fuel-efficient vehicles (Yacobucci and Canis, 2010). Because the program was temporary, most observers believe that it operated primarily to shift vehicle purchases in time rather than achieve any long-term impact on fleet composition. In a report published in October 2009, estimated that of the nearly 690,000 new vehicles sold during the period the program was operating, only 125,000 of the sales were incremental (, 2009). 6.3.7 Assessment of Vehicle Fuel Economy Improvement Strategies The various policies described above each have demonstrated a potential to reduce the LDV fleet’s average fuel consumption. It is generally agreed that the U.S. CAFE standards have been effective in stimulating the production and sale of more fuel-efficient vehicles (NRC, 2002). According to the EPA, the composite average LDV new-vehicle fuel economy (laboratory rated at 55 percent city driving and 45 percent highway driving) increased from 15.3 mpg (6.5 gal/100 mi) in MY1975 to 28.6 mpg (3.5 gal/100 mi) in MY2011, the latest year for which data have been published (EPA, 2010). Most of this increase occurred between In 1980, “trucks” accounted for 16.5 percent of LDV production; by 2004 the truck share had reached 52.0 percent (EPA, 2010, Table 1, p. 7). ""6 Policies for Reducing GHG Emissions from and Petroleum Use by Light-Duty Vehicles."" National Research Council. 2013. . Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/18264. MY1978 and MY1988. The political acceptability and track record of the CAFE program have established it as a leading option among policies for meeting LDV petroleum use and GHG reduction goals. However, as discussed elsewhere in this chapter, a strict CAFE standard alone is not sufficient for meeting ambitious petroleum and GHG reduction goals because it fails to address issues of consumer motivation, travel demand, and other factors that shape the on-road fuel consumption of the LDV fleet. Although there is less experience with their use, subsidies and taxes based on projected vehicle fuel consumption and imposed at the time of vehicle acquisition (feebates) could supplement (or, in principle, even substitute for) CAFE standards. So also could higher fuel taxes. Both types of policies have been shown to be effective in encouraging the purchase (or lease) of more fuel-efficient vehicles. However, the reluctance in the United States to raise taxes of any kind, consumers’ undervaluation of fuel economy, and the level to which taxes would have to be raised to achieve results comparable to those seen with fuel economy standards, especially if supplemented by feebates, make their use problematic. 6.4 POLICIES TO REDUCE PETROLEUM USE IN OR GHG EMISSIONS IMPACTS OF FUEL The second major factor influencing the LDV sector is petroleum’s share of fuel use or the overall GHG emissions impact of supplying and using the fuel. Although numerous policies intended to reduce petroleum use by LDVs have been pursued over the years (e.g., the Energy Security Act of 1992 [96 P.L. 294], the Alternative Motor Fuels Act of 1988 [100 P.L. 494), the EPAct of 1992 and 2005 [109 P.L. 58], and the EISA of 2007 [110 P.L. 140] (DOE-EERE, 2011b), to date they have had little impact on the overwhelming dominance of petroleum-derived gasoline and diesel fuel. Nevertheless, many policy makers still show considerable interest in pursuing similar strategies for encouraging or mandating the use of biofuels, natural gas, hydrogen, electricity, or other non-petroleum fuels to power LDVs. Regulations, subsidies, various forms of tax incentives, and loan guarantees are now being used both in the United States and other countries to encourage the use of non-petroleum-based fuels and fuels that are expected to emit fewer GHGs. Fuel taxes and price floors on petroleum-based fuels also would discourage petroleum use. Although the goals of reducing petroleum use and GHG emissions commonly are treated together (as in the case of the statement of task for this study; see ), the scientific, economic, and technical issues associated with these two goals are not identical. Each goal has its distinctive challenges associated with the design of fuels policies. Implementing any such policies requires appropriate metrics and the ability to track and measure effects throughout the fuel supply, distribution, and end-use systems that the policies seek to influence. Measuring and tracking petroleum reduction require that the feedstocks used for producing fuel be quantified and reported. Given a legal definition of what qualifies as “non-petroleum” (e.g., as specified by AMFA [1988] and subsequent energy legislation), determination of the extent of petroleum reduction is conceptually straightforward. However, determining various fuels’ net GHG emissions impacts is difficult, for several reasons: At least some of the GHG emissions or CO uptake occurs upstream from the use of any fuel. For example, battery electric vehicles do not have tailpipe emissions, but the production of electricity to fuel the batteries may emit GHGs. The quantification of net CO uptake, sequestration, and related emissions is uncertain in some cases. For example, the storage of carbon in soil by perennial bioenergy feedstocks depends on prior land condition and is difficult to estimate with high certainty. A significant portion of the GHG emissions impacts of all alternative fuels occurs outside the LDV sector. For example, the GHG emissions from electricity generation for powering battery electric vehicles or for producing hydrogen to power hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles occur in the power generation or hydrogen production sector. Therefore, the GHG emissions must be tracked in multiple sectors beyond the LDV sector. Biofuel-induced land-use changes and nitrous oxide flux from nitrogen fertilization could affect the net GHG emissions effects. Yet, the quantification of those net GHG emissions effects could be difficult. 6.4.1 Tax Incentives for Fuels and Their Infrastructure During the energy crisis in the 1970s, policies were developed to support alternatives to petroleum ranging from synthetic fossil fuels to biofuels. The Energy Tax Act of 1978 (P.L. 95-618) introduced an excise tax exemption for gasohol. The exemption subsequently was extended and transformed into a tax credit for ethanol called the VEETC, a $0.45/gal tax credit. Congress also approved a tariff on imported ethanol to foster domestic biofuel production. Both the VTEEC and the tariff expired at the end of 2011. The EPAct of 2005 also established a tax credit of up to $30,000 for the cost of fueling equipment for alternative fuels including hydrogen, natural gas, propane, electricity, E85, and diesel fuel blends containing at least 20 percent biodiesel. Residential fueling equipment was eligible for a credit of up to $1,000. The tax credits for hydrogen run through 2014; they expired at the end of 2011 for all other fueling equipment (DOE-EERE, 2011a). California and a number of other states have policies for subsidizing a variety of alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) and related infrastructure. ""6 Policies for Reducing GHG Emissions from and Petroleum Use by Light-Duty Vehicles."" National Research Council. 2013. . Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/18264. Traditional fuel regulations, as authorized under the original language of the CAA’s Section 211, addressed fuel composition and its physical and chemical properties. These fuel-performance standards were based in principle on measurable fuel properties. Fuel suppliers could certify their products through laboratory testing or analytic methods based on physiochemical characteristics. Regulators could readily verify that standards were met by directly sampling fuel products, although this was rarely done. Because fuel additives and formulation requirements may not be finally incorporated into a consumer fuel until they are blended in at a distribution terminal, tanker truck, or even a fuel pump, the regulated entity may vary in fuel standards (40 CFR 80.2, Definitions). The point of regulation is the point of finished fuel product distribution, which is where most fuel properties are determined. Compliance with the complex model for gasoline emissions was a departure from this standard. There are a large number of fuel parameter combinations that could meet the requirements for compliance, and compliance was referenced to the base fuel of each individual fuel supplier. Compliance was determined before the fuel left the production facility. Once the fuel was distributed and comingled with other fuels that complied at production, it was no longer possible to determine compliance at the final point of distribution. As energy policy considerations came into play, regulations were designed to stipulate the use of certain fuels derived from specified non-petroleum feedstocks. Thus, fuel regulations developed for energy policy take the form of a legal requirement to supply a certain amount of a fuel manufactured from particular resources. Others take the form of a requirement to supply a minimum percentage of a group of fuels derived from desired sources or to supply a mix of fuels that on average meet requirements for being derived from desired sources. Such is the case for the amended Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS2) in the EISA. An approach generalized to require a mix of unspecified fuels that meet specified average net GHG emissions over their life cycle is known as a Low-Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS), and such a standard has been established in California. RFS2 was intended to move the United States “toward greater energy independence and security” and to “increase the production of clean renewable fuels” (110 P.L. 140). RFS2 is actually a collection of mandates for fuel providers to supply categories of renewable fuels defined by their feedstock type and life-cycle GHG emissions (). The volume mandate for the “renewable fuel” category has been met by corn-grain ethanol and is expected to be met up to 2022 (NRC, 2011). Production capacity is available for meeting the volume mandate for biomass-based diesel. However, commercial production of cellulosic biofuels has fallen far short of the volume for that category mandated by EISA. Indeed no compliance-tracking renewable identification numbers (RINs) had been generated for cellulosic biofuels as of April 2012 (EPA, 2012a). EISA gives EPA the right to waive or defer enforcement of RFS2 under a variety of circumstances. For example, RFS2 can be waived if sufficient biofuels are not likely to be produced for blending or if its enforcement has been deemed to cause economic dislocation (NRC, 2011). For example, the governors of nine states, 26 members of the U.S. Senate, and 156 members of the U.S. House of Representatives petitioned EPA to grant the RFS waiver, citing the effects of the 2012 drought on U.S. food and feed prices as the reason for potential economic dislocation. The EPA has been exercising its discretion to reduce the level of cellulosic biofuels required in RFS2. Specifically, the EPA reduced the mandate for cellulosic biofuels by 93 percent in 2010 (from 100 million to 6.5 million gallons), by 97 percent in 2011 (from 250 million to 6.6 million gallons), and by 98 percent for 2012 (from 500 million to 10.5 million gallons) (EPA, 2012b). When there is a waiver, blenders are permitted to buy RINs from EPA instead of actually purchasing cellulosic biofuels. There also is a clause that allows blenders to buy RINs from EPA even if cellulosic biofuels are available but substantially more expensive than petroleum-based fuels (Thompson et al., 2010; NRC, 2011). Although the intent was to protect consumers from high prices relative to gasoline, the clause effectively eliminates a guaranteed demand for cellulosic biofuels. The potential waiver and clause regarding the purchase of RINs reduce the incentive for the major fuel producers to develop and deploy technology for producing cellulosic biofuels, particularly when large financial investments and risks are involved. But without the waiver, blenders are required to purchase fuel that is not being made; their only option is to buy RINs. The cost of cellulosic fuels has not come down as some had hoped. The combination of high cost, the potential waiver, and the clause described above have undermined the effectiveness of RFS2 in driving an increase in cellulosic biofuels. Code of Federal Regulations, Title 40, Part 80, “Regulation of Fuels and Fuel Additives,” Definitions section; available at . “The Renewable Identification Number (RIN) system was developed by the EPA to ensure compliance with RFS2 mandates. A RIN is a 38-character numeric code that corresponds to a volume of renewable fuel produced in or imported to the United States. RINs are generated by the producer or importer of the renewable fuel. RINs must remain with the renewable fuel as the renewable fuel moves through the distribution system and as ownership changes. Once the renewable fuel is blended into motor vehicle fuel, the RIN is no longer required to remain with the renewable fuel. Instead, the RIN may be separated from the renewable fuel and then can be used for compliance, held for future compliance, or traded” (McPhail et al., 2011, p. 5).

BOX 6.2 Life-Cycle Assessment for Greenhouse Gas Emissions Life-cycle assessment (LCA) is a tool available for the accounting of net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions effects of different fuel pathways. However, the use of LCA to determine policy compliance is a marked departure from traditional approaches to fuels regulation, which prior to the RFS had always been based on physiochemical fuel properties. Standards based on a fuel’s physiochemical properties are enforceable through measurement or measurement-based analytic methods that allow verifiable assurance of fuel providers’ compliance. However, fuel property standards are not adequate for regulating the GHG emissions associated with both production and use of a fuel. Fuel property standards cannot account for upstream emissions associated with any fuel. Therefore, LCA is used to assess the GHG emissions impacts of fuels. However, GHG emissions occur in multiple sectors in geographically dispersed locations and over multiple periods of time. For example, for biofuels, CO uptake by biomass and sequestration in soil or GHG emissions from indirect land-use changes occur remotely from locations of fuel use in the transportation sector. Thus, accounting for life-cycle emissions is more complicated and uncertain than it is for direct emissions (NRC, 2011). Some members of the committee believe that a problem with using LCA in policy regulation is a misplaced burden of proof (DeCicco, 2012) because some of the CO sequestration and emissions occur outside the LDV sector and are not under the control of fuel producers, fuel retailers, or fuel users. Others believe that it is appropriate to hold fuel providers responsible for the upstream emissions of their products. The parties that are responsible for the direct and indirect emissions from all the different parts of the biofuel supply chain have not been clearly established. If the United States is to limit the GHG emissions impacts of LDVs and their associated fuel supply systems (as opposed to their direct tailpipe emissions only), then policies are needed to address the GHG emissions from other sectors upstream from fuel use. Although GHG emissions from the transportation sector could be reduced in the United States by RFS2, the policy may not contribute to reducing global GHG emissions. RFS2 requires EPA to determine whether the four types of renewable fuel meet their respective GHG thresholds. Although the intent was to ensure that biofuels have lower GHG emissions impacts compared to petroleum-based fuels, whether the policy will actually contribute to a reduction in GHG emissions is uncertain. The NRC report Renewable Fuel Standard: Potential Economic and Environmental Effects of U.S. Biofuel Policy concluded that “RFS2 may be an ineffective policy for reducing GHG emissions because the effect of biofuels on GHG emissions depends on how the biofuels are produced and what land-use or land-cover changes occur in the process” (NRC, 2011; p. 2-4). The same physical fuel can have widely different life-cycle GHG emissions depending on numerous factors, including the feedstock used (e.g., corn stover or switchgrass), the management practices used to produce the feedstock (e.g., nitrogen fertilization during biomass growth), the energy source used in the biorefinery (e.g., coal or renewable electricity), and whether any indirect land-use changes were incurred as a result of feedstock production. For example, the use of crop or forest residues for feedstock is less likely to cause indirect land-use changes than is the use of planted crops. Moreover, indirect land-use changes as a result of bioenergy feedstock production and the associated GHG impacts are difficult to ascertain. Because GHG sources and sinks are dispersed across sectors (agricultural, forestry, and industrial) and international borders, some committee members believe that policies that target them at the location where they occur are likely to be much more effective than RFS2 in reducing GHG emissions impacts. RFS2 includes a GHG accounting system that can account for upstream emissions. This system requires an elaborate tracking mechanism and a combination of real-world measurement and estimation of GHG emissions at each source and sink along the supply chain to verify overall claimed benefits from the production and transport of the biomass through conversion and distribution of the final products. A regulatory effort to encourage the use of alternative fuels, with the specific intent of lowering GHG emissions, is California’s LCFS. On January 18, 2007, California’s then-governor issued Executive Order S-1-07 that called for a reduction of at least 10 percent in the carbon intensity of California’s transportation fuels by 2020. The California Air Resources Board developed regulations to implement the order, approving them in April 2009. After delays due to litigation the regulations were promulgated on June 4, 2012, under an April 2012 court order permitting the promulgation to occur pending the results of an appeal that was still underway at the time of this writing. The LCFS uses life-cycle assessment (LCA) rather than direct measurement of fuel properties to determine compliance. It applies to essentially all transportation fuel used in the state. Regulated parties are defined broadly as fuel producers and importers and some owners of alternative fuels or alternative fuel sources. The regulation defines a ""6 Policies for Reducing GHG Emissions from and Petroleum Use by Light-Duty Vehicles."" National Research Council. 2013. . Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/18264. carbon intensity (CI) metric based on LCA. Fuel suppliers are required to progressively lower the average CI of the fuel they supply. The targeted GHG-emission reduction is 10 percent in 2020 compared to the average baseline of transportation fuels in 2010. The LCFS assigns a CI to different types of biofuel (e.g., corn-grain ethanol produced via different pathways with different types of energy input gets different scores) and a CI for land-use change and other indirect GHG effects. However, the actual GHG effects from land-use change and other indirect effects could span a wide range (Mullins et al., 2010; Plevin et al., 2010). Given the large uncertainties, the extent to which LCFS actually contributes to reducing net GHG emissions is unclear. One committee member considers that the uncertainties in LCA are such that one cannot have confidence in the efficacy of an LCFS or other policies using LCA to ensure reductions of GHG emissions from fuels. As is the case with RFS2, fuel providers are held accountable for upstream GHG emissions and GHG emissions from indirect effects. They do not control these effects but can mitigate them by their choice of the source of their fuel supply. LCFS allows fuel providers to petition for individualized CI score. LCFS proponents view such provisions as beneficial for fostering innovation in low-emission fuel production. For example, some ethanol producers could sequester their CO emissions, account for them, and seek credit for these reductions under the LCFS. Similarly, oil companies practicing enhanced oil recovery could seek credits for the portion of the injected CO that remains in the water phase of the oil well and the portion that is dissolved in the unrecovered oil. Since 1970, increases in U.S. LDV vehicle miles traveled have more than offset improvements in LDV on-road fleet fuel economy (see ). As a result, LDV petroleum use and CO emissions have increased over the period. With VMT being such a driver of increased petroleum use and CO emissions, it is natural that attention has been devoted to finding ways of reducing its rate of growth—or even its absolute total. This section reviews the principal policies that have been examined and what is known about their likely impact. 6.5.1 Historical and Projected Future Growth in LDV VMT Between 1970 and 2005, VMT in the U.S. LDV fleet grew by an average annual rate of 2.8 percent. This rate of growth is not expected to continue. Indeed, the average annual rate of VMT growth from LDVs projected by the Energy Information Administration’s (EIA) (EIA, 2011) for the period 2010 to 2035 is only about 60 percent of the average rate experienced between 1970 and 2007, the peak year prior to the recent economic recession. But VMT is still projected to grow. Indeed, if the 1.49 percent annual growth rate of VMT over the last 5 years of EIA’s projection period is assumed to be realized as well during the 2035-2050 period, VMT in 2050 will be 5.0 trillion—an 85 percent increase relative to its 2010 level. 6.5.2 Reducing the Rate of Growth of VMT by Increasing Urban Residential Density The relationships among household location, workplace location, trip-making activity, and LDV travel have been subjects of research and policy debate for many years. These relationships have been difficult to establish for many reasons, including the problem of controlling for variables such as self-selection bias as households locate in places that best suit their travel needs, preferences, and capabilities. However, there is general agreement that higher urban density is associated with less driving. The important issues are (1) the magnitude of this relationship and (2) the extent to which VMT might be altered by changes in urban density. An NRC study analyzed in great detail the impact of compact development (another term for increased urban density) on motorized travel, energy use, and CO emissions. The principal findings of the 2009 study can be summarized as follows: Developing more compactly, that is, at higher residential and employment densities, is likely to reduce VMT. Doubling residential density across an individual metropolitan area might lower household VMT by about 5 to 12 percent, and perhaps by as much as 25 percent, if coupled with higher employment concentrations, significant public transit improvements, mixed uses, and other supportive demand management measures (NRC, 2009, pp. 2-6). The 2009 analysis suggests that reductions in national VMT resulting from compact, mixed-use development Carbon intensity as defined in the LCFS is equivalent to life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions. In 2012, California was enjoined from enforcing the Low Carbon Fuel Standard because of a December 29, 2011, decision by the Federal Eastern District Court of California in the case of . The state is appealing the decision to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which lifted the lower court’s injunction on April 23 and thereby allowed the state to proceed with LCFS implementation pending appeal (CARB, 2012). This is the number used in the business-as-usual and reference cases and in most of the policy simulations in this report. The 2009 committee commented on its second conclusion as follows: “Doubling residential density alone without also increasing other variables, such as the amount of mixed uses and the quality and accessibility of transit, will not bring about a significant change in travel” (NRC, 2009, p. 89). ""6 Policies for Reducing GHG Emissions from and Petroleum Use by Light-Duty Vehicles."" National Research Council. 2013. . Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/18264. might range from less than 1 percent to 11 percent. The high estimate would require 75 percent of new development to be built at double the density of existing development, a significant departure from the declining densities recorded in most urban areas over the past 30 years. The study emphasizes that increasing densities and mixing land uses may be more achievable in some metropolitan areas than others. Metropolitan areas differ a great deal in their geographic characteristics, land area, historical growth patterns, economic conditions, and local zoning and land-use controls. Policies that affect land use are local in the United States and in some areas in the past have led to decreasing density as urban areas have expanded. In others, strong regional authority with a commitment to more compact land use has increased density through land-use policy. The present committee concluded that the likely changes in VMT as a result of changes in residential density would be small in the aggregate. 6.5.3 Reducing the Rate of Growth of VMT Through the Use of Pricing Strategies Many strategies in addition to those encouraging increased residential density have been suggested as having the potential to reduce the rate of growth of VMT. The 2009 study (Collaborative Strategies Group, LLC. 2009) mentioned above examined a number of pricing strategies, including congestion pricing, intercity tolls, pay as you drive (PAYD) insurance, a VMT tax, and a gas or carbon tax. Each of these pricing measures produced a reduction of 1 percent or greater in 2050 urban VMT under all levels of policy intensity studied—extended current practice, aggressive implementation, and maximum implementation. Indeed, the VMT impact of a fee per mile traveled at maximum implementation was estimated to reduce 2050 urban VMT by about 8 percent. 6.5.4 Reducing the Rate of Growth of VMT Through Other Policies (Collaborative Strategies Group, LLC. 2009) also examined a range of additional policies deemed to have the potential to reduce the future rate of VMT growth. As in the case with pricing strategies, each of these other policies was evaluated at three levels of implementation. Three of the non-pricing strategies were estimated to have a 1 percent or greater impact on 2050 urban VMT with expanded current practice; four had a 1 percent or greater impact with practice more aggressive than current practice; and five had an impact of 1 percent or greater with maximum implementation. Although some of these strategies may be additive, many are not. Also, some strategies (such as the transit strategies, pedestrian strategies, and certain of the employer-based commute strategies) may already be reflected in the density-based VMT impacts reported earlier in this chapter. Indeed, the 25 percent reduction in VMT cited in NRC (2009) as a possible upper bound due to higher density was generated by a combination of VMT-related policies, not merely increased density. 6.5.5 Summary of the Impact of Policies to Reduce the Rate of Growth of VMT Policies designed to reduce the rate of growth of VMT are likely to have limited impact compared with policies targeting vehicle efficiency and new energy sources. Even the extreme reorganization of national economic activity needed to produce the higher level of urban density examined in NRC (2009) would yield only an 11 percent reduction in VMT. And it should be remembered that the various VMT-related policies are not additive. Nevertheless, this limited VMT impact should not lead to the inference that such policies might not be valuable for other reasons. 6.5.6 Policies to Improve the Efficiency of Operation of the LDV Transport Network As noted above, there has been considerable recent interest in the extent to which policies designed to improve the operating efficiency of the LDV transport network might also serve to reduce GHG emissions or petroleum use. Examples of such policies are eco-driving programs; ramp metering; variable message signs; active traffic, integrated corridor, incident, road weather, and signal control management; traveler information; and vehicle infrastructure integration. Many of these policies focus on reducing congestion to help even out vehicle speeds and reduce time spent stopped in traffic. Others provide drivers with the knowledge and information needed to learn to drive their existing vehicles using less fuel. There is no dispute that drivers can, if they are careful and attentive, significantly improve the fuel economy they experience on the road. There also is no dispute that congested conditions waste fuel as well as drivers’ time. The question is how widespread the use of eco-driving or the implementation of technologies that have a potential to reduce congestion (e.g., vehicle-to-vehicle communications, also known as telematics) become and how great the aggregate impact of such policies and technologies might be at the national level. The challenge in developing such estimates is somewhat similar to the challenge of estimating the impact of increased urban density on VMT growth. In both cases, examples showing major potential, and sometimes actual, improvements in specific local situations can be cited. But how generalizable are these local results either to other localities “Maximum implementation” is a $0.12/mi fee, representing the increment needed to represent Western European motor fuel tax levels. It was derived based on an additional tax of approximately $4/gal on an approximate average on-road 33 mpg. ""6 Policies for Reducing GHG Emissions from and Petroleum Use by Light-Duty Vehicles."" National Research Council. 2013. . Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/18264. or, more importantly, to the national level? And are there factors that can be expected to offset these improvements to some degree over time? Little research has been done to address these issues. Indeed, the only estimate of the possible national impact over time that the committee is aware of appears in the report discussed above. That report counts as “benefits” only the fuel savings and associated GHG emissions reductions resulting from the various measures to improve the operational efficiency of the road transport network. It subtracts from these benefits an amount that reflects the VMT increase projected to result from reduced congestion. also takes into account the rate and extent of deployment of these strategies (Collaborative Strategies Group, 2009). Even at maximum deployment, the only strategy that reduces GHG emissions and fuel consumption by more than 0.5 percent as of 2050 is ecodriving, which yields a 4 percent reduction in GHG in that year. acknowledges that these estimates are rather rough and might be greater if deployment of the strategies occurs sooner, of development is more widespread, or if the strategies themselves are more effective than they now appear to be. Clearly, there is much need for additional research on this topic. Identification, development, and commercialization of technologies that yield vehicles that are more efficient than current vehicles, AFVs, fuels from non-petroleum resources, fuel production systems with reduced GHG emissions, and, in some cases, even the means of reducing the rate of VMT growth often stem from research undertaken years before the technologies appear in the market. This section examines the different stages of the innovation process to address the questions about the role of government in this process. There is no universally agreed-upon taxonomy for the stages of the innovation process, but one common framework divides the process into four stages (NSF, 2007): , or “systematic study directed toward fuller knowledge or understanding.” Research may be basic or applied. Basic research is directed toward the “fundamental aspects of phenomena and of observable facts without specific applications toward processes or products in mind.” Applied research is directed toward “determining the means by which a recognized and specific need may be met” (NSF, 2007; p. 1). , which takes the knowledge produced in research and systematically applies it toward the production of useful materials, devices, and systems or methods to meet specific requirements, often culminating in prototypes. , which tests the feasibility of the developed technology at an appropriate scale to identify all significant impediments to commercial success. , in which the technology becomes widely used. The need for government intervention is most widely accepted for the first two of these four stages: research and development (R&D). R&D builds the nation’s intellectual capability to address energy problems. Even in the presence of strong intellectual property protection, private businesses generally cannot capture all of the benefits generated by their R&D investments, especially any investments that they might make in basic research. Because of this “spillover effect,” private investment in R&D falls short of the socially optimal amount, thereby justifying public support. There is an even stronger case to be made for publicly funded R&D to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to displace petroleum use. The production and use of petroleum-derived energy generate negative environmental externalities and impose national security costs, neither of which is fully reflected in market prices. These social concerns compound the insufficient motivation for private firms to invest in R&D aimed at achieving these particular objectives. Although this committee is not in a position to recommend specific levels of government R&D spending to advance vehicle and fuel technology, one insight from its analysis is that maintaining a diverse R&D portfolio is appropriate given the nature of the challenge. The committee’s scenarios demonstrate that several pathways involving combinations of advanced vehicle and fuel technologies have the potential to achieve the goals of an 80 percent reduction in petroleum use and GHG emissions from LDVs. R&D critical to success for many key vehicle and fuel innovations includes: Estimates given in (Collaborative Strategies Group, 2009) cover all road vehicle traffic, not merely LDVs. Other benefits that are not counted by include time savings that may result from these measures. This “induced driving” effect is used by opponents of building more roads to argue that doing so only causes more driving. Using Federal Highway Administration models, estimates that a systemwide average reduction in delay of 1 hr/1000 VMT in the absence of induced demand results in a systemwide increase in VMT of 2.13 percent. This increase in VMT results in a proportionate increase in fuel consumption and GHG emissions. This increase will be less in the short run than in the long run. adjusts GHG emissions from increased VMT in the initial year of strategy deployment by (2.13 percent × 0.5), ramping this increase to the full 2.13 percent after 10 years (Collaborative Strategies Group, 2009, p. B-88). Some of these strategies might be somewhat additive, but it does not appear reasonable to claim that they are totally additive. Even if they were, the impact of the policies other than ecodriving would total only 1.4 percent (Collaborative Strategies Group, 2009, p. D-12). ""6 Policies for Reducing GHG Emissions from and Petroleum Use by Light-Duty Vehicles."" National Research Council. 2013. . Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/18264. Low-cost, conductive, chemically stable plate materials for fuel cells; New, durable, low-cost membrane materials for the fuel cell stack and batteries; New catalyst structures that increase and maintain the effective surface area of chemically active materials and reduce the use of precious metals; New processing techniques for catalyst substrates, impregnation, and integration with layered materials; Reduced cost of carbon fiber and alternatives to polyacrolyonitrile as feedstock; Advanced hydrogen production technologies with low net GHG emissions. These two lists may not be exhaustive over the time horizon examined; rather, they represent options already included in DOE’s R&D portfolio. All of the fuel options entail combinations of new energy resources or carbon capture and storage technologies sufficient to deliver biofuels or other synthetic fuels, electricity, hydrogen, or combinations thereof with low net GHG emissions impacts. It is unclear which pathway is most likely to succeed, because each depends on technology success, cost reduction, consumer acceptance, and public policies. Once a technology moves beyond research and development, the case for government support becomes more controversial. Consider the case of federal funding of demonstration projects. Suppose that R&D has yielded a new way of producing a fuel for LDVs. The R&D process may have shown that the technology works in a laboratory, but it does not demonstrate system integration in a production setting that might be scaled to a commercial level. Before private industry will invest the large sums required to construct large numbers of commercial-scale plants employing such technology, someone must construct a first-of-a-kind commercial-scale plant. Prior to that, there may be a need to test and refine the workability of the technology in a production-like setting through the construction and operation of a pilot plant at less-than-commercial scale. Industry also may be unwilling to shoulder those costs. The cost of producing fuel in a first-of-a-kind commercial-scale plant likely will not be as low as it might become, because the first-of-a-kind commercial-scale plant will not have the benefit of the “learning-by-doing” that can lower construction and operating costs. But without this step, full-scale commercialization will not occur. If the technology is protected by strong patents or can be kept secret, and if the price that the firm constructing a first-of-a-kind commercial-scale plant can expect to receive for output from the plant reflects nearly all of the benefits that the technology creates, a private firm may run the risk of constructing this demonstration plant on its own. But if the developer of the technology cannot protect it from being easily appropriated by others, or if a significant share of the benefits cannot be captured in the price that the output of the plant will sell for, a private firm is not likely to be willing to take this step. In such cases, the first-of-a-kind commercial-scale plant may not be built without some form of government financial assistance. However, if the eventual business case for the technology relative to competing options (including potential progress in an incumbent technology) is weak, then even a government-financed first-of-a-kind demonstration may not lead to the scale-up to multiple or larger plants needed for commercial success. (However, some of the government policies discussed above in this chapter, such as a carbon tax or a price floor on oil, could improve the business case for certain alternative technologies.) Vehicles pose a different demonstration issue. Manufacturers commonly create demonstration fleets to generate information on the in-use performance of vehicles using new powertrain systems. Examples of demonstration fleets include the General Motors EV1 and Equinox hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, Honda FCX Clarity, Audi A3 E-tron, and the Mini E. In these cases, only a limited number of vehicles have been produced. They were made available only to screened applicants, and ownership of the vehicle remains with the manufacturer. Circumstances may dictate that government must directly participate in the demonstration project. In the case of the DOE’s National Fuel Cell Vehicle Learning Demonstration Project, the primary goal was to validate vehicle and infrastructure systems using hydrogen as a transportation fuel for LDVs under real-world conditions using multiple sites, varying climates, and a variety of sources for hydrogen. Specific objectives included validating hydrogen vehicles with more than a 250-mile range, 2,000-hour fuel cell durability, and hydrogen production costs of $3 per gallon of gasoline equivalent. The project was structured around a highly collaborative relationship with four industry teams—Chevron/Hyundai-Kia, Daimler/BP, Ford/BP, and GM/Shell—with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) collecting and analyzing the data and publishing results. A A pilot facility is a form of demonstration that integrates technologies developed in the laboratory into a production system. The pilot demonstration is a step toward commercial design. This description is taken from Wipke et al. (2010). ""6 Policies for Reducing GHG Emissions from and Petroleum Use by Light-Duty Vehicles."" National Research Council. 2013. . Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/18264. total of 140 fuel cell vehicles, covering both Generation 1 and Generation 2 technology, were deployed over the course of the project. Twenty refueling stations, utilizing four different types of refueling technology, were deployed. The geographic regions covered were the San Francisco to Sacramento region, the Los Angeles metro area, the Detroit metro area, the Washington, D.C., to New York region, and the Orlando metro area. The project established specific goals for many of the technical and operating questions and periodically reported progress toward meeting these goals. A detailed summary of the project’s results through 2009, identifying which goals had been met and which goals still needed to be met, was published in 2010. Some teams ended their participation in 2009, but some continued at least through most of 2011. At an update made available in early 2012, NREL reported that through the third quarter of 2011, vehicles assigned to the project had accumulated a total of 154,000 operating hours and had traveled a total of 3.6 million vehicle-miles (NREL, 2012). What seems to have made this demonstration project successful was its careful design that involved the coordination of a simultaneous demonstration of vehicles and fueling infrastructure, its focus on measurable goals that were critical to the eventual success of hydrogen-electric vehicles, mandatory reporting of detailed performance data including safety to establish expected baselines for commercialization, and its use of paired teams of vehicle manufacturer and fuel manufacturer, with the government playing a facilitating and coordinating role. The next step after demonstration is deployment—the roll out of a fully demonstrated technology with all of the technical and economic aspects as fully defined as possible. This is likely to be particularly challenging in the case of vehicles using non-liquid fuels, such as grid-connected-electric, natural gas, or hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, Even after successful completion of the demonstration phase, potential vehicle purchasers would need to be convinced that the technology is reliable and that the form of energy it requires will be available, while energy suppliers and vehicle manufacturers would need to be convinced that the vehicle/fuel system would be purchased by consumers in increasing volumes within timeframes relevant to major private investment planning. Cost reduction through learning-by-doing and by increasing sales volumes to achieve economy of scale likely would be necessary to ensure availability of a range of vehicle makes and models to consumers. Refueling infrastructure also would have to be widely enough available to sustain an expanding market. The analysis in illustrates that the timing of deployment is critical if the 2050 petroleum use and GHG reduction goals are to be achieved. Because of the long lifetime of the LDV fleet, vehicles incorporating the sorts of technologies described in would have to be in the market in substantial quantities by about 2035. If these vehicles require a new fuel infrastructure, enough of it would have to be in place even prior to this date to quell vehicle owners’ anxieties about fuel availability. The analyses suggest that transitions in energy resource and supply sectors or to alternative fuels, AFVs, or any combinations would have to be forced more rapidly than would occur through private market forces alone if the goals are to be achieved by 2050. Therefore, financial inducement from either private or public resources will be required. The condition for private investment in deployment is that the technology is so promising that the potential investor would prefer it over other opportunities. Because of the long timeframe and uncertain outcome, potential private investors will require a high rate of return on that investment and will limit the amount they will invest to a level that does not endanger their long-term financial viability. The analyses in suggest that deployment of alternative LDV and fuel technologies will in some cases be too large, last too long, and be too uncertain for a private entity to support financially. Further, the modeling shows that a substantial part of the return on the investment will accrue to society at large rather than to the private investor. Policy-driven deployment is likely to be necessary to encourage and support a new technology through the early phases of market introduction, particularly if the success of the investment depends heavily on societal benefits. For AFV systems, publicly funded deployment encouraged by public policy might be especially important for addressing two major barriers: The scale-related cost problem associated with the fact that new vehicle-fuel systems lack sufficient economies of scale during the early stages of commercialization, and The coordination of commercial deployment of AFVs with the fueling infrastructure for those vehicles. Nevertheless, given the uncertainties involved, technology-specific deployment programs may not be needed. If such programs are needed, several general principles should be followed: The deployment effort should be undergirded by and based on a long-term, substantial market signal to focus and drive reducing petroleum use and GHG emissions. An example would be a carbon tax or an equivalent means of setting costs for carbon GHG emissions. The cost of deployment would have to be known and the amount be acceptable. The time period over which any public investment is provided would have to be limited, and a technical ""6 Policies for Reducing GHG Emissions from and Petroleum Use by Light-Duty Vehicles."" National Research Council. 2013. . Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/18264.            agency would be used to develop metrics to assess progress and guide adjustments by policy makers based on the achieved results, including building on effective activities and terminating activities that are ineffective or are overcome by events. A condition of public investment needs to be the presence of one or more legally committed private partners obligated to make a substantial investment so as to have a stake in the success of the technology deployment. The government has tools in addition to direct investment that it can use to ease the investment hurdle for private capital. These could include loan guarantees to lower the rate of interest paid by the investor for the necessary private capital and direct loans to the investor at less than market rates. The government can also use mandates. Government mandates that set goals that are truly technology neutral tend to be attractive because they allow industry rather than the government to select the most promising means to meet the requirement. However, loan guarantees, loans and below-market interest rates, and mandates all share the disadvantage that they tend to hide the true cost of the government support. A strongly mitigating factor against government involvement in technology-specific deployment is that there is little or no successful experience to guide the selection of policies and tactics for such actions for vehicles and fuel technologies. One relevant precedent is the successful reduction of air pollutants from LDVs. The government’s effort there was generally directed at the outcome rather than a particular achievement path. The route to achieving the 2050 goals is not clear, and so the government’s approach to pursue these goals has to be flexible and adaptive. The government must be able to assess candidate activities, select only those with a high chance of success, accept some risk because success is not guaranteed in every case, and be robust enough to survive when approaches initially chosen fail. The government needs to make unbiased and prompt assessments of progress and act swiftly to modify ineffective efforts and terminate those that are failing. Fostering public understanding of the rationale underpinning various policy decisions, regulatory actions, and vehicle and fuel technologies designed to achieve the nation’s GHG and petroleum reduction goals for the LDV fleet is critical to achieving public support of same. It has been demonstrated that proper dissemination of information that increases consumers’ awareness of and knowledge about a particular policy or program—alone or in concert with incentives—can have a more permanent impact on consumers’ behavior than do incentive programs alone (Hopper and Nielsen, 1991; Iyer and Kashhyap, 2007). Regarding the adoption of hybrid vehicles, it has been demonstrated that consumers today have little knowledge of the technology and limited knowledge of the potential benefits of the technology (e.g., roominess, power, and quiet operation) beyond the financial and environmental benefits (Ozaki and Sevastyanova, 2011). In addition, financial and other incentives unsupported by effective public information programs do little to increase the number of people performing the behavior being incentivized and typically have the most influence on those already disposed to accept the policies and goals being promulgated, whereas public information programs have the potential of helping consumers form positive opinions about the recommended goals and policies—especially those who held no opinion, and even those who were opposed to such goals and policies, before being exposed to the information campaign (Allen et al., 1993; Ditter et al., 2005). Overcoming the lack of knowledge about the need to achieve the recommended goals also is critical. Although some number of consumers will respond solely to policies providing financial benefit for modifying their driving habits to lower VMT and/or facilitate their purchase of low-emitting and AFVs, it will be decades, if ever, before such vehicles demonstrate performance and cost-of-ownership characteristics that make them clearly competitive with conventional vehicles. In their 2004 study of the impact of energy-efficiency audits on the adoption by industry of efficiency technologies such as energy-efficient lighting, heating, and cooling systems, Anderson and Newell (2004, p. 2) found that “access to more accurate performance information can reduce the uncertainty and risk associated with adopting technologies that are new, or that receive differing reviews from equipment vendors, utilities, or consultants.” The Washington State Department of Transportation, which has a long history of successful public transit and VMT reduction programs, has found that public education “is a vital element” in its transportation demand management projects (McBryan et al., 2000). As discussed throughout this report, many uncertainties surround advanced LDV, fuel, and energy supply technologies. Today’s knowledge of the feasibility, scalability, costs, and benefits associated with the options analyzed in this report is insufficient to craft policies framed around any specific vehicle-fuel systems. Analysis performed today can be suggestive but is never dispositive about what technologies will succeed in the future. Neither can the market responses of the diverse actors whose decisions determine both technology adoption and the real-world impacts of its use be predicted with much certainty. As Dwight D. Eisenhower remarked, “Plans are nothing; planning is everything.” Policy makers face a need to design measures that can be modified as new information becomes available while main- ""6 Policies for Reducing GHG Emissions from and Petroleum Use by Light-Duty Vehicles.""

Although it addresses a different issue, a RAND (RAND Europe, 1997, p. 2) study summarizes this sensibility by saying that “a realistic approach to the formulation of policy should explicitly confront the fact that policy will be adjusted as the world changes and as new information becomes available.” An example of such an adaptive policy is provided in (see Section 5.6, “Adapting Policy to Changes in Technology”). In that example, a mid-course change in policy was made as a result of an unanticipated improvement in one vehicle technology or fuel type, and the study goals were met. In considering what such an adaptive policy framework might look like, it is important that it not be trivialized to a mere exhortation that “policy makers should adapt.” Policy makers adapt all the time. Although the criticism, “America lacks an energy policy,” is often heard, the country in fact has as energy policy that has developed over time, including evolving measures to address transportation energy use. Congress and successive administrations have adapted laws, regulations, and other programs to new conditions and new information, satisfying different needs and interests to different degrees (perhaps leaving some unsatisfied). Vehicle efficiency standards have been modified over the years depending on the public priority placed on petroleum conservation and more recently coordinated with CAA-authorized GHG emissions standards in response to climate concerns. The track record of the existing approach to transportation energy policy is decidedly mixed. CAFE standards have helped to limit growth in oil demand and GHG emissions, but at uneven rates over the years. Whatever learning may have been achieved, in the United States alternative fuel and vehicle technologies have had little impact on the sector’s petroleum dependence and no measurable benefit on its net GHG emissions intensity (which may in fact have worsened). Corn ethanol has displaced a portion of petroleum gasoline, but there is no evidence for the beginning of a broader transition to non-petroleum resources beyond the levels mandated by the RFS. If changes in energy use and GHG emissions of the magnitude given in this committee’s task statement are to be achieved, the country will need a policy framework that is much more effective in moving the LDV-fuel system toward specified goals. Although a formal adaptive paradigm has not been used for transportation and energy policy to date, some guidance can be obtained from other contexts where it has been used. Insights can also be found in the history of public policies that have resulted in varying degrees of progress on the impacts of LDVs. One issue for which discussions of adaptive policy have been published is that of climate adaptation, i.e., measures for handling the impacts of climate change rather than mitigating its causes. This body of work builds on prior thinking about adaptive frameworks for natural resource and ecological systems management. Swanson and Bhadwal (2009) characterize adaptive policies as those that not only anticipate the range of conditions that lie ahead, but also have an up-front design that is robust in the face of unanticipated situations. Aspects of such design include integrated and forward-looking analysis, policy development deliberations that involve multiple stakeholders, and the definition of key performance indicators that are then monitored in order to trigger automatic adjustments in parameters of the policy. Adaptive policies ideally are able to navigate toward successful outcomes even while encountering developments (including lack of hoped-for outcomes) that cannot be anticipated in advance. An example of such an adaptive framework for the transport-sector GHG emissions is the proposal contained in a 2009 consensus report by the U. S. Climate Action Partnership (USCAP), a group of 31 corporations and public-interest groups. The USCAP proposal states (2009, p. 23): Congress should require EPA, in collaboration with the Department of Transportation (DOT) and other federal and state and local agencies, to carry out a periodic in-depth assessment of current and projected progress in transportation sector GHG emissions reductions… . This assessment should examine the contributions to emissions reductions attributable to improvements in vehicle efficiency and GHG performance of transportation fuels, increased efficiency in utilizing the transportation infrastructure, as well as changes in consumer demand and use of transportation systems, and any other GHG-related transportation policies enacted by Congress. On the basis of such assessments EPA, DOT and other agencies with authorities and responsibilities for elements of the transportation sector should be required to promulgate updated programs and rules—including revisions to any authorized market incentives, performance standards, and other policies and measures—as needed to ensure that the transportation sector is making a reasonably commensurate contribution to the achievement of national GHG emissions targets. Committee members hold a range of views on the merits of the USCAP proposal. This committee presents its own proposal for an adaptive framework in . Allen, J., D. Davis, and M. Soskin. 1993.

Transitions to Alternative Vehicles and Fuels MyNAP members save 10% online. or to save! For a century, almost all light-duty vehicles (LDVs) have been powered by internal combustion engines operating on petroleum fuels. Energy security concerns about petroleum imports and the effect of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions on global climate are driving interest in alternatives. assesses the potential for reducing petroleum consumption and GHG emissions by 80 percent across the U.S. LDV fleet by 2050, relative to 2005. This report examines the current capability and estimated future performance and costs for each vehicle type and non-petroleum-based fuel technology as options that could significantly contribute to these goals. By analyzing scenarios that combine various fuel and vehicle pathways, the report also identifies barriers to implementation of these technologies and suggests policies to achieve the desired reductions. Several scenarios are promising, but strong, and effective policies such as research and development, subsidies, energy taxes, or regulations will be necessary to overcome barriers, such as cost and consumer choice. 2 Alternative Vehicle Technologies: Status, Potential, and Barriers 5 Modeling the Transition to Alternative Vehicles and Fuels 6 Policies for Reducing GHG Emissions from and Petroleum Use by Light-Duty Vehicles Appendix D: Reports on Transportation Greenhouse Gas Emissions Projections to 2050 Appendix E: Glossary, Conversion Factors, and Acronyms and Abbreviations You're looking at OpenBook, NAP.edu's online reading room since 1999.

You must ""lose"" 3500 calories through diet or exercise to lose 1 pound. It would take a reduction of 17,500 calories to lose 5 pounds. it's unknown but you do lose a lot of weight! trust me my mom did it and she burnt soo much calories and lost so much weight in one week! i mean she is 50 years old, so if she can lose that much weight then younger people can lose more weight faster than her! (: Our bodies are very efficient at burning calories, and it takes excessive exercise to lose weight. If you want to lose weight, lower the amount of calories you consume. If you eat 500 calories less each day how much weight will you loose in a week? You wont lost any weight in order to lose weight you have to burn the calories you consumed plus more. There are 3500 calories per pound. In order to lose weight you would have to lose the 500 calories you consumed each day, and considering the fact you eat 500 calories per day you would have to times 500 by 7 and that equals 3500 calories In order to lose a pound in a week you would have to burn 7000 calories per week. If you burn 1000 calories a day how much weight will you lose in a month? It depends how many calories you consume. If you eat 800 calories a day, then burning 1000 calories a day will mean you've lost 200 calories a day.

This depends on your metabolism, and how much weight you want to lose, or not lose. No matter what the height of the person desiring to lose weight, the number of calories to burn off 1 pound is the same. One pound equals about 3500 calories. If you lose 1000 calories a day for a week how much weight will you lose? 2 pounds if you do not increase your activity level. For every 3500 calories you will lose one pound. How many calories per day should a woman of 24 weighing 145 pounds and with a length of 5.6 feet consume per day in order to maintain her weight and how much to lose weight? Hi, as long as you work of double as what you ate then you lose weight.so if you eat 200 calories but work of 400 you lost all the weight of what you ate. If you lose weight by exercise will you have loose excess skin? Loose skin has nothing to do with how you lose your weight, but a lot to do with how much you've lost and how fast you've lost it. How much weight can you lose by eating soups all day? It's more about calories in vs. calories out. If you are eating light soups and the total calorie count is less than the amount of calories that you burn, then you will lose weight. If you burn 125 calories a day much weight will you lose? It depends on how much you weigh, and how many calories are in your body in the first place. How much weight are you losing if you burn 14000 calories a week? If you are eating 1500 calories a day you will lose 1 lb. if you are eating 1200 calories you will lose 1.6 lbs. It won't help you lose weight, only to make your diet healthier. Exercise does that. Raw celery is negative calories and can help you lose weight. The amount of fat lost when one burns calories is hard to determine but one is assured of losing weight when he or she loses calories. How much weight can you lose eating 2000 calories a day? It will mostly depend on how fast your body is processing the calories, and how much exercise you are partaking in. How much weight can you lose in a week eating 1500 calories a day? It all depends on how much exercise you are putting in and how many calories you are burning. The amount of weight you can lose in one week depends on the amount of exercise you do and the amount of calories you consume during the week. It is possible to lose a lot of weight quickly, but this is not the safest way to lose weight as you will be depriving your body of much needed nutrients.

I am 149 pound how many calories i should burn a day How many calories should a 17 yr old girl have daily to lose weight? I understand that in order to GAIN a pound it requires 3500 calories of unspent energy in the body. Therefore, to LOSE a pound you'll need to burn off 3500 calories, or 500 calories a day to lose a pound in a week. I wouldn't focus on calorie consumption as much as I would on burning an extra 500 calories a day. How many calories should you burn a day to lose 12 lb a month? How many calories to consume each day to lose weight for a 5'0 and 120 pound female? I would say about 2 calories a day would DEFINITELY make you lose major poundage! If you burn 100 calories per day will you lose weight weight? 100 calories a day is not much, but is still enought to lose weight. At this rate you'd lose about a pound of fat every 35 days, since a pound of fat is about 3500 calories. How many calories a day do most people cut to see weight loss? It takes a reduction of 3500 calories to lose a pound. So, many people cut 500 to 1000 calories a day to lose 1-2 pounds at week. On average you burn 10 calories per pound that you weigh per day. Example: A person that weighs 130 pounds burn 1300 calories per day just existing. If you are looking to lose weight 3500 calories = 1 pound of fat. So take you weight multiply it by 10 and subtract that number from 3500 and you get how many calories you have to burn per day to lose 1 pound per day. Example: A per that weighs 130 pounds burns 1300 calories per day, subtract that from 3500 so he/she has to burn 2200 calories per day to lose 1 pound of weight per day. How many calories should you decrease each day to lose a pound a week?

And intense physical activity is not possible without some calorie intake, that makes it even more difficult. A person doesn't typically gain a pound in a day, so there is no reason to think they should be able to lose a pound in a day. How many pounds can you lose in a month without exercising each day? The average person spends 2,000 calories every day just to maintain bodily function. in order to lose weight without exercising, they would have to cut out calories.

b0808184-ae5e-4ce9-a142-b83375b79c9f,"New position aims to strengthen MIT’s sustainability New position aims to strengthen MIT’s sustainability Julie Newman appointed to lead the Institute’s programs in sustainable energy, water and other resources. Julie Newman Photo: Dominick Reuter Julie Newman, MIT’s first director of sustainability, brings to her new post a portfolio as one of the nation’s most experienced leaders on sustainability in higher education.Newman, who assumed her role in mid-August, came to MIT from a similar position at Yale University, where she led a sustainability initiative for the last nine years. MIT Executive Vice President and Treasurer Israel Ruiz initiated the creation of the new post — and simultaneously created an Office of Sustainability to serve as a catalyst for advancing sustainable approaches and practices across campus, and beyond.“Julie brings an unparalleled level of energy and enthusiasm to the work of integrating sustainable processes into all aspects of the Institute,” Ruiz says. “Her presence on campus brings us one step closer to realizing our vision of the campus as a living laboratory where we test new ideas. Julie will be key to advancing MIT’s work with both the city of Cambridge and the city of Boston.” Starting in 1997, Newman spent seven years establishing an office of sustainability at the University of New Hampshire — “one of the first offices of sustainability in the country,” she says. After receiving her doctorate in natural resources and environmental studies from UNH in 2004, she moved to Yale, as founding director of its Office of Sustainability.  To begin the process, Newman has engaged in a “listening tour,” involving MIT students, faculty, staff and administrators, to learn and understand “how MIT functions as an institution, what their vision of a sustainable MIT is, and how best to catalyze the innovation and development of solutions to the complex challenges that are raised from building a sustainable campus.”“What I get excited about in this field, and thus this position, is the opportunity to work as a catalyst to ensure the integration of sustainability principles across all the operational units of the Institute,” Newman says. She will examine “what the underlying goals are, ranging from capital construction to small-project renovations, energy systems, transportation systems, operations and maintenance, waste management, recycling, water management, procurement and land management.” Her analysis will also examine novel opportunities of financing, organizing and planning such projects.Newman aims to position MIT’s campus “as a living and learning laboratory for sustainability. When successful, our campus sustainability work will make direct and meaningful contributions to the core teaching and research mission of the Institute.” The opportunities, she says, “may range from testing new technologies currently being developed in labs on campus to studying the organizational behavior that enables a sustainable campus.” To begin her new role at MIT, Newman will start by “assessing where the strengths, weaknesses and opportunities are now.” That will include work with many of MIT’s department directors and staff to assess current best practices and identify areas for additional leadership. Newman will work closely with Richard Amster and John DiFava of MIT Facilities to ensure that all new construction, renovation and maintenance projects make the best use of lessons learned from past projects — such as the success of Building E62 at the MIT Sloan School of Management, which has exceeded its initial targets for efficiency. She will also work with Bill VanSchalkwyk, managing director of environment, health and safety (EHS) programs, to ensure integration of sustainable practices in EHS activities.Newman will also help build upon MIT’s past sustainability accomplishments: For more than 10 years, MIT has taken steps to reduce its energy and environmental impact while actively contributing to local, regional and global initiatives. For example, Building E62 consumes 45 percent less energy than some comparable buildings. MIT has retrofitted more than 90 percent of its existing buildings for energy efficiency, and supported alternative modes of commuting so that 80 percent of MIT staff and students do not drive to campus alone — a figure that is significantly above the state average. MIT is also a founding member of the Cambridge Community Compact for a Sustainable Future, an innovative, community-based partnership on sustainability with the city of Cambridge, Harvard University and other local organizations. In June, MIT and NSTAR successfully concluded the first phase of MIT Efficiency Forward, renewing the program through 2015. The Institute is also actively engaged in the Boston Green Ribbon Commission, an organization dedicated to developing shared strategies for fighting climate change. In addition, MIT works closely with the city of Cambridge on a range of sustainability initiatives, including sponsorship of Hubway and electric vehicle charging stations. Faculty members and graduate students are partnering with the city on topics such as solar mapping, infrared imaging, wind and solar analyses and climate preparedness. Currently, MIT is working with the city to explore “ecodistricts” — a new model of public-private partnership that emphasizes deployment of district-scale best practices on sustainability — and the proposed implementation of a building energy-use disclosure ordinance.  John Sterman, the Jay W. Forrester Professor of Management at MIT Sloan and a longtime member of MIT’s Campus Energy Task Force, says that the creation of this new position “will help us accelerate the progress we’ve been making to become more efficient, and to promote sustainability more broadly.” He applauds the selection of Newman, calling her “knowledgeable, experienced and energetic.”While MIT has already done much to improve energy-efficiency, Sterman says, such efforts “haven’t been as fully integrated and coordinated” as they could be, so “there is still a lot of low-hanging fruit.” The creation of this new role, reporting to the Office of the Executive Vice President and Treasurer, “is no less than the issue deserves,” Sterman adds. “The integrated approach this position enables will not only improve campus sustainability, it will also enhance our ability to achieve our educational and research mission.” Harvey Michaels, a research scientist and lecturer in the Department of Urban Studies and Planning who teaches a class on sustainability, adds, “It says that the decisions being made on campus policy and development are going to be made with sustainability having a top-level place.”“It’s going to take a community to make this work,” Newman emphasizes, so finding ways to engage students, staff and faculty in these efforts will be crucial. “People are poised and wanting to do more, but they are seeking direction and guidance on how to do so. Moreover, we have the opportunity at MIT to draw upon the unique expertise of our faculty, staff and students to create scalable solutions to complex sustainability challenges.”“It’s critical that MIT, being who we are, certainly should be setting a good example,” says Leon Glicksman, a professor of building technology and mechanical engineering who currently co-chairs MIT’s Campus Energy Task Force with Ruiz. He points to the success of , which has made significant cuts in the campus use of electricity, as an example. “MIT was the first large institution that started a program like that,” Glicksman says, “and it’s now being duplicated by others. But there are a lot more opportunities along those lines.”Newman’s arrival should go a long way toward making that happen, Glicksman says. “She’s certainly a leader in that field. I really am excited about having her here.” Joining Newman in the Office of Sustainability are deputy director Steven Lanou, who previously led sustainability programs in MIT’s Environment, Health and Safety Headquarters Office, and sustainability projects coordinator Susy Jones. Using CRISPR technology, researchers are tracking the lineage of individual cancer cells as they proliferate and metastasize in real-time.

490a3c76-47ab-4b0e-a543-6fffd4150a2e,"      Hi Fitday. I read some of your posts and there are some very knowledgeable posters on this forum Would like some help. I started trying to lose weight 1.5 months ago but I'm stalling. Not sure if it's because I'm checking it every day and the fluctuations are making me edgy - would like some objective critique to my approach please Baseline weight: 154lb. Food: 2000kcal. BMR: 1600kcal. Exercise: 750kcal (1hr running at 6miles/hr per day). TEE: 3000kcal. So I started doing this in July - initially I couldn't sustain the 6miles/hr for 1hr per day, so I started at the same speed and improved my fitness, until late July, when I was able to clock 1hr flat at 6miles per hour. Now I break it down to 2x 30min exercise sessions. So when I was able to hit the 750kcal exercise target in late July, I noticed my weight started peeling off. I'm down to 144 pounds now, so I dropped 10 pounds in total? However, since then I seem to be stuck on around 144 pounds for a week or more now. I'm not sure whether it is just the fluid retention fluctuations because I check in everyday and it's stressing me out But scales aside, I lost half my beer gut, shaved off my double chin, half of my chubby cheeks, and can fit a size smaller. So I am sure I've definitely lost weight, I'm just concerned if the weight doesn't keep going down will I keep progressing? My target weight is 57kg, now I'm 65 (from 70).   First, congrats on losing the weight you have already lost....for your starting weight 10+lbs is nothing to sneeze at. I have a question for you...how did you determine your goal weight? 57kg is about 125lb...what is your age/height/sex? I would suggest getting your body fat measured and confirming the weight you are shooting for is healthy and realistic. I don't know if you have taken this into account, but the same running you are doing now is burning fewer calories than when you started. 1. You are propelling less weight down the road and 2. You body has become more efficient...especially since you are doing the same exercise repeatedly. Also, as you have lost weight your BMR is lower. This all means that the same caloric intake that allowed weight loss in the beginning is now all you need to sustain. Another possible cause of the plateau is that you have lost some muscle mass along the way...which will also decrease your BMR. My suggestions...for what they are worth... 1. If you have not already, Get your body fat composition measured to determine a good, healthy goal weight. I have used 'Bodpod' but there are plenty of options. 2. Add in some weight training. Maintaining your lean muscle mass while losing weight is key to keeping that BMR working for you. The bigger the muscles, the more calories they burn. 3. Mix in some different exercise. Doing the same thing trains the body to be super efficient...great for performance but not so much if the goal is to burn calories. As a bonus, changing up your activities reduces the risk of injuries. For me, switching up my exercise is much more fun than doing the same thing everyday and has made it a lot easier to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Good Luck!   I don't understand what 'TEE:3000kcal' means? If your BMR is 1600 and your exercise is 750 kcal then you are burning 2350 kcal daily. You state your food is 2000 kcal so you are burning (deficit) is only 350 kcal/day. Since 1 pound of body weight equates to apprx. 3500 kcal you will only be losing about .7 pounds/week (350 x 7days= 2450kcal/week, 2450/3500= .7). This is hard to see on a daily basis (sometimes even on a weekly basis) depending on your waste/water retention. You can speed this up by eating less calories. If you are okay with this rate then just continue. There could be some other factors at play that you may want to look at. As Clarkslp said your body has become more efficient, Our bodies adapt quickly to become efficient at performing what we have asked. That is why you need to look into some different forms of exercise or even just incorporating HIIT (High Intensity Interval Training) into your running. HIIT consists of a short period of High intensity (think of sprinting) followed by a period of lower intensity activity (like walking or jogging). A High/Low ratio of 1:2 has been shown to be the most effective. I personally do 20 seconds and 40 seconds (1:2). I am also a big proponent of weight training, and the effect it can have on reshaping your body. With out weight training all that running can actually decrease your muscle mass and thus decrease your BMR. Weight training forces your body to better use your fat stores instead of burning off the desireable muscle. Weight training can help you look better and be more fit at a higher weight. Now lets talk about nutrition and your macros. I find that my protein intake needs to be apprx. 30% of my calories for me to lose the best. Protein is the only macro that can repair and build muscle. If you aren't getting enough your body will lose muscle mass. A general rule is .5 to 1.0 gram per pound of (not total) body weight. Congratulations on your success so far.   Keep running, it works. I would suggest the intervals twice a week. I am not as fast as you. I do about 11:30 mile pace, but I run hard for a minute and walk for a minute most of the time. I am doing a pretty strict 1800/day diet. I only think I've gone over that two days since April 12, and even then, not by a lot. The weight is falling off of me (300 lbs. to 222 lbs in just over 4 months). I am coaching cross country and that makes it easy for me to run. Those guys and girls come out thin and they all show off how loose their jeans have become at the end of the season and I watch them eat 4000-5000 calories a day. They run long distances (5-10 miles) 5 days a week and do the intervals twice a week. Of course, they do them much more intensely than I do, but after three months of cross country there's not a muffin top, or a hint of cellulite on any of them. I'd bet the body fat numbers are ridiculously low. Heck, we're one of the worst teams in our area. I think what you're doing will work. Stick with it, add the intervals, maybe. One thing is you're probably getting more solid. You slim down a lot running, but your body needs muscle to run so what you've got becomes muscle. Once again, using our runners as examples, they're all amazed how they end up with six pack abs and super defined muscles and legs after just three months of cross country. Frankly, they're a little conceited about it. - - - - - - Copyright © 2018 MH Sub I, LLC dba Internet Brands. All rights reserved.
