Learn more about our process Neck pain plagues a significant amount of Americans, and the causes aren’t always entirely clear. If you often find yourself waking up with a sore neck, chances are your pillow could be partly to blame. The job of your pillow is to hold your neck and head at the right height to prevent unnecessary strain. A pillow that’s too high or too low, or which fails to support the neck itself, can cause pressure to build up as the neck tries to compensate for the lack of support. While your sleep setup might not be the original root of your neck pain, it can play an important role in making it better or worse. We’ll break down the reasons you could be experiencing neck pain and how your pillow can help. Ultimately, the best pillow for neck pain is the one that works for you. However, we’ll also share our top picks for pillows that stand out for their ability to reduce neck pain.

Thanks to its reversible design, one side of the pillow has a medium soft feel and the other side is medium firm. This allows sleepers to flip between two distinct surfaces, making the pillow ideal for people whose firmness levels tend to fluctuate. The foam is ventilated with small holes to allow air circulation, which prevents the material from absorbing too much body heat and allows the pillow to remain fairly cool.

The lower-loft design is best suited to stomach sleepers, while side and back sleepers will probably find the medium- or high-loft pillows more comfortable. The Muse Pillow also boasts a sophisticated, layered design. The top layer consists of shredded memory foam, while the bottom layer is made of solid memory foam. These materials contour closely to the head and neck to alleviate aches, pains, and pressure points. Unlike many competing memory foam pillows, the Muse Pillow shouldn’t sleep too warm for most people. This can be attributed to the cooling fabric used to construct the cover, which dissipates body heat to keep you cool. The cover can be removed and machine washed whenever cleaning is needed. All three loft options for the Muse Pillow share the same sticker price. The company also ships for free anywhere in the contiguous U.S. Customers also receive a three-year warranty with their pillow purchase.  90% Shredded Gel Memory Foam, 10% Shredded Comfort Foam The Sweet Night Original Pillow is a shredded memory foam pillow sold at a very attractive price-point.

The neck is responsible for bearing the entire weight of the head, and it’s not surprising that this delicate part of the body is highly susceptible to injury. The 2018 study found that neck pain is rising in importance as a leading cause of disability among the American population. Most sources estimate that between 25 and 30 percent of people suffer from neck pain every year. While many episodes of neck pain resolve naturally, for some it can become a chronic condition with adverse consequences for their quality of life. Neck pain can be caused by a number of factors. It may stem from an injury or a chronic condition such as , or it may arise from daily habits such as poor posture or too many hours of sitting at a computer. While symptoms vary, neck pain sufferers often experience: Neck pain, especially during repetitive activities or long periods of sitting upright If you have severe pain or additional symptoms, or if you’re not sure what’s causing your neck pain, it’s a good idea to visit a doctor to rule out underlying conditions. Regular exercise and a healthy body weight are thought to have a on chronic neck pain. The notes that neck pain often goes hand-in-hand with high stress levels and obesity. The eight hours you spend in bed every night is a critical time for those who suffer from neck pain. The positions you adopt as you sleep can either relax your neck or put it under additional strain. As part of your sleep setup, a supportive pillow should promote proper neck and spine alignment. Not only can an unsupportive pillow exacerbate your neck pain, but that the wrong pillow can lead to discomfort during the night. This leads to nighttime awakenings, creating a vicious circle that makes it difficult to get the rest you need to recover from neck pain. Your pillow is unlikely to be the sole source for your neck pain. However, choosing the right pillow and adopting a healthy sleeping position can help ease pressure on the neck. You should replace your pillow when it’s no longer able to provide the proper support. For neck pain sufferers, choosing the right pillow can be a key step toward living pain-free. The right pillow will depend on your individual needs. We’ll walk you through the most important considerations, including how to choose the best material, shape, and thickness for your individual sleeping style. What to Consider When Purchasing a Pillow for Neck Pain Most people don’t give much thought to their pillow, beyond choosing a pillow that’s nice and squishy for immediate comfort. This means that when we do realize our pillow may be contributing to our neck pain, we may not know how to go about . Shoppers in this position may be susceptible to misleading marketing and end up choosing a pillow that’s ill-suited for their needs. To help you get started, we’ve made a list of the most important factors. Focusing on these factors and having a basic understanding of how pillows work can help you find the pillow that works best for you. : The loft determines the angle of your head in relation to your spine. A pillow that’s too high or too low can force your neck to bend at an unnatural angle, causing strain and discomfort over time. That’s why sleep experts recommend choosing a pillow loft that keeps your head and neck aligned with your spine. When choosing your pillow, don’t forget to consider the width of your shoulders and size of your head. If you’re not sure of your ideal loft, you may wish to purchase a pillow with an adjustable loft. In addition to being the right height under your head, a pillow should also adequately support your neck. This is most often seen in cervical pillows, which contour to the neck instead of leaving a space where the neck is unsupported. The pillow firmness will determine where your head comes to rest, so it’s important to give this aspect careful consideration. The right pillow firmness for you will depend on how heavy your head is, how high the pillow is, what position you tend to sleep in, and the firmness of your mattress. Pillows that are too firm may cause pressure points, for example in the ears when side sleeping. On the other hand, pillows that are too soft may sag under your head and fail to provide proper support. : A good pillow provides pressure relief by taking strain off the neck and contouring to reduce pressure points. For the best pressure relief, choose a pillow that’s the appropriate shape and size for your sleeping position, and the appropriate firmness to alleviate pressure at contact points. Today’s manufacturers offer a varied assortment of ergonomic pillows that provide enhanced support by adapting to the shape of your head and neck. Some people also choose to add another pillow to their setup, one popular choice being a small roll under the neck in addition to the main pillow. Pillow shape is a matter of personal preference, but if you can’t find relief from your neck pain, one solution may be to try a cervical pillow. Investing in a good pillow is crucial to your overall health and your neck health in particular. Pillow prices vary widely depending on their materials and design. When shopping for a pillow, keep in in mind that certain types of pillows will last you for years, while others may need to be replaced after a year or two as their materials wear out and lose their loft or conforming abilities. Within broad categories such as memory foam or feather pillows, the quality of the individual pillow plays a significant role in determining its longevity and comfort. Some pillows can be washed occasionally and properly dried to fluff them up and increase their lifespan. The best pillow for neck and shoulder pain is firm enough to hold the head at a healthy angle, but soft enough to alleviate pressure points. Most sleepers find success with either a memory foam, latex, buckwheat, or feather pillow, as these materials offer the best balance of support and pressure relief. Memory foam molds in response to heat and pressure, contouring to form a supportive cradle around the head and neck. are hypoallergenic, cheap, and widely available, either in solid or shredded form. However, they have a limited lifespan, and the material’s slow response to pressure may be frustrating for some combination sleepers. The material is also prone to trapping heat. Buckwheat hulls naturally interlock and hold their shape, making them a great choice for head and neck support. As a natural material, buckwheat is naturally breathable, resistant to allergens, durable, and environmentally friendly. On the downside, buckwheat pillows tend to command a high price-point, and they may take some getting used to as they aren’t as soft as other traditional pillow types and do make some noise as you change positions. Good quality feather pillows are soft and offer excellent conforming. They’re also often customizable, allowing owners to adjust the loft by taking out feathers or adding more. Unfortunately, feather pillows tend to lose their loft as the feathers get compressed over time. Many people also find that the feathers may become displaced under the weight of their head, affecting the support they provide. Natural latex has a buoyant feel that holds the neck in place while minimizing pressure points. Many latex pillows feature pincore holes for improved temperature regulation. The major downside to latex is that latex pillows usually come in one solid piece, so users can’t adjust them into a customized shape. While many people turn to latex as a natural and sustainable option, organic and other certifications tend to raise the price tag. Made from the inner feathers of ducks and geese, down is exceedingly soft and lightweight, and pillows made with this fill material can be reshaped to suit the user’s preference. Due to its high price tag and ability to provoke allergies in some people, many sleepers opt for down alternative, made from polyester fibers. Unfortunately, both down and down alternative pillows easily lose their shape and tend to be too soft to adequately support the neck. Most polyfoam pillows offer some contouring and boast a quicker response to pressure than memory foam, although like memory foam they will trap heat. Polyfoam pillows are lightweight, affordable, and hypoallergenic. However, they develop permanent indentations over time and will need to be replaced more often than other pillow types. What is the Best Pillow Positioning for Neck Pain? Sleep experts recommend either back or side sleeping if you suffer from neck pain. Sleeping on your stomach causes your head to bend at a sharp angle and arches your spine, which puts unwanted pressure on your neck. Strict stomach sleepers should choose a pillow with a low loft to minimize pressure. For best results, back and side sleepers should ensure that their head, neck, and top of the spine form a straight line. Sleeping with a pillow that’s too high or too low can cause aches and pains. Likewise, sleeping with your head rolled to one side or the other is also likely to cause neck pain. For side sleepers to avoid neck pain, it’s important to keep the head in line with the spine. The with neck pain should have a loft that equals the distance between the ears and the edge of the shoulders. This means that people with bigger shoulders usually need a higher loft. Since the neck sits naturally higher than the head, cervical pillows have an elevated area under the neck that helps support the neck and encourage proper alignment. Usually, pillows for back sleepers should have a medium loft that raises the head just enough to sit in line with the neck. But back sleepers face a similar problem to side sleepers in that most pillows don’t support the higher curve of the neck. Those who have trouble finding a properly supportive pillow may find it more comfortable to use a small rounded pillow under the neck for added support in addition to the main pillow. In addition to choosing the right pillow, you can reduce neck pain through lifestyle changes like adopting proper posture, taking stretching breaks, and generally being more active. People who suffer from neck pain should avoid shoulder bags, slouching, and long periods of sitting at the computer. Your body’s overall position is influenced not only by your pillow, but also your . Plusher mattresses allow your body to sink down further, meaning you’ll need a lower-loft pillow. The opposite holds true for firmer mattresses, which will require a higher pillow to maintain proper alignment of the neck and spine. From daily habits to more serious regimens, there are plenty of exercises you can do to relax your neck muscles and relieve strain on the neck, shoulders, and upper back. A certified massage therapist or chiropractor may also be able to help. Always consult a health professional before starting any kind of treatment. Many neck pain sufferers receive instant relief from a hot or cold compress, or from taking a warm shower. This may not cure your neck problems, but it can be a helpful short term solution. Frequently Asked Questions About Pillows for Neck Pain Your pillow likely isn’t the only reason for your neck pain, but it can definitely exacerbate the issue. We spend so much time on our pillows that a strained position can cause significant pain the next day. Using a supportive pillow is crucial if you want to give your neck a chance to recover overnight. What is the most important consideration when choosing a pillow for neck pain? The most important consideration when choosing a pillow for neck pain is that it keeps your head, neck, and spine in a straight line. Pillows can go about this different ways, but many neck pain sufferers find that the best pillows for neck pain incorporate features that contour to support the neck. Any pillow that fails to keep your neck at a neutral angle compared to your head and spine is inadequate for those who suffer from neck pain. Since everyone has a different body and sleeping style, there’s no one type of pillow that could be considered the worst for neck pain. However, most people find that excessively soft or flat pillows, such as those made from polyfill or down, fail to provide the needed support to prevent neck pain. Depending on your sleeping style, you may find that tucking a rounded pillow under your neck can help ease the strain. This is especially true when sleeping on your back, as the neck sits so much higher than the head in this position. A rounded pillow supports just the neck, leaving your head free to relax on the flatter main pillow instead of forcing it to bend at an awkward angle.

Patients frequently feel discomfort regardless of which sleep position they employ. Some also feel numbness, tingling, and muscle spasms. While any of the conditions listed above could contribute to shoulder pain-related sleep problems, Dr. Gobezie notes three specific conditions are the most common culprits: , an inflammation of the bursa sacs that cushion bones around joints in the body.

Finding a new pillow to reduce shoulder pain might seem like a straightforward task, but there are several factors to consider based on your body type, normal sleep position(s), firmness and thickness preferences, and level of pain. Below, we’ll list some of the most important variables to take into account when choosing a pillow and discuss the most common pillow types based on fill material. What to Consider When Purchasing a Pillow for Shoulder Pain If you take pillow manufacturers at their word, then every pillow on the market today will reduce shoulder pain and deliver nightlong comfort regardless of your needs or preferences. However, very few pillows are designed to specifically target and alleviate shoulder pain. Furthermore, a pillow that is not soft, firm, thick, or thin enough can cause added discomfort based on your body type, head size, shoulder dimensions, and sleep position. Before buying a pillow for shoulder pain, check the following specs – and reach out to the manufacturer if you can’t track down any of these details. : Loft, or thickness, affects how supportive the pillow feels. typically need more loft to ensure even spinal alignment, which reduces pressure around the shoulders, lower back, and hips. Back and stomach sleepers often prefer less loft because this allows their head to lie evenly with the rest of their body and lowers their potential for neck and shoulder pain. : A supportive pillow will keep your head upright while cradling the neck, while a less supportive pillow will sink beneath the weight of your head. Some sleepers prefer the latter but many people with chronic shoulder pain need a pillow that will support the head and cushion the neck and shoulders. The ideal firmness level for any given sleeper depends largely on personal preference. Some feel more comfortable on a softer, plusher pillow, while others prefer a pillow that feels firmer and more supportive. Since support is often crucial for pain relief, those with shoulder pain may want to consider a firmer pillow – though excessive firmness can also lead to added aches and pressure points. The best pillows for pressure relief support the head and neck without sinking too deeply. If your head is on the smaller side and your wingspan is somewhat narrow, then a softer pillow provides adequate pressure relief, but those with larger heads and wider shoulders will probably find that a firmer pillow reduces more pressure instead. Some specialty pillows for people with neck pain have irregular shapes that differ from the rectangular cut of traditional pillows. These include wedge pillows that keep the head and neck inclined, and body pillows you can embrace for an added bolster around the neck and shoulders. You should be able to find a high-quality pillow that alleviates at least some of your shoulder pain for less than $100. These include wedge pillows, body pillows, and other models with irregular shapes. For a specialized pillow with multiple components, expect to pay a bit more. The materials used to construct a pillow can tell you a lot about its expected longevity and supportive qualities. In the next section, we’ll take a closer look at the most popular fill materials for pillows sold today. The best pillow materials include memory foam, buckwheat hulls, latex, and other fills that provide sufficient support to keep the head and neck upright and aligned with the spine. If a pillow sinks too much or loses shape quickly, the potential for more shoulder pain increases. Viscoelastic polyurethane foam – for short – is engineered to soften when exposed to body heat and return to its former shape when the heat is removed. By contouring close to the body, memory foam can alleviate pain and pressure around the neck and shoulders. Solid memory foam is used to construct many wedge and specialty pillows for neck pain, including a few of our top picks listed above. Shredded memory foam does not provide the same level of support, but many models with this fill offer adjustable loft. Buckwheat pillows are filled with hulls, the hard outer casings of buckwheat kernels. They tend to be quite firm but also highly supportive, so your head and neck won’t sink too deeply into the surface. Buckwheat pillows also offer adjustable loft. By adding or removing the hulls, you can make the pillow more comfortable for different sleep positions. Latex is a naturally resilient material derived from the sappy extract of rubber trees. It provides gentle contouring and won’t conform as closely as memory foam, but latex is also highly durable and won’t flatten as easily. refers to the soft inner plumage of ducks and geese located beneath their outer feathers. It is exceptionally soft and light, so resting your head and neck on a down pillow can alleviate tension and pressure to some degree. At the same time, down is not particularly supportive and won’t be suitable for sleepers who want more firmness from their pillow. Made from polyester microfibers, down alternative is a very soft and light material designed to mimic authentic down. Down alternative is hypoallergenic, making it suitable for people with down allergies, and these pillows tend to be much cheaper than their authentic counterparts. However, they don’t offer many advantages over regular down for sleepers with shoulder pain. The outer feathers of ducks and geese are slightly more supportive than down, but they still provide minimal levels of support. Unless you prefer a softer pillow, a feather-filled model may not keep your head and neck upright. Like memory foam pillows, polyfoam pillows may contain solid or shredded fill. Polyfoam doesn’t contour too closely and feels somewhat responsive foam, so these pillows may be a good alternative to memory foam models if you find the latter too adaptive. What Is the Best Pillow Positioning for Shoulder Pain? If you experience chronic shoulder pain, it’s entirely possible that no sleep position will feel totally comfortable. However, certain angles and pillow configurations may reduce some types of shoulder pain better than others, depending on specific condition and symptoms. Four useful pillow positioning arrangements are outlined below: A good rule of thumb for side sleepers with pain in one shoulder is to avoid lying on the affected side. With the sore shoulder upright, place one pillow under that shoulder’s armpit, another between the legs, and cuddle with a third pressed against your stomach. With a fourth pillow beneath your head, this configuration should promote even spinal alignment and help alleviate your shoulder pain. Since back sleeping promotes even spinal alignment without putting added pressure on either shoulder, this is often the best position for people with shoulder pain. If you notice soreness or stiffness in one or both shoulders, try placing a pillow in the armpit beneath the shoulder(s). Often the chosen pillow position for pregnant women, a pillow between the knees can improve spinal alignment for side sleepers by reducing pressure in the lower back and hips. Side sleepers with broad shoulders often experience uneven alignment because their hips and lower back don’t receive the same level of cushioning. A thin pillow placed under the back and hips can even out the spine and alleviate pain throughout the body – including the shoulders. Stomach sleeping is generally associated with more aches and pains than back or side sleeping. Neck and shoulder pain from craning the neck to avoid lying face-down on the pillow is a common issue for stomach sleepers. For this reason, we don’t recommend stomach sleeping for people with shoulder pain. In addition to using a pillow that offers adequate support, sleepers with shoulder pain can try one or more of the following strategies in order to find relief. As with pillows, a mattress can help reduce shoulder pain or exacerbate your discomfort – and again, this usually comes down to support level. A mattress that feels too soft and sinks excessively can worsen shoulder pain. Generally, side sleepers feel more comfortable on softer mattresses because they cushion the shoulders and hips while supporting the lower back, leading to better spinal alignment. The back position already promotes proper alignment on its own, so these sleepers need more firmness and support to prevent excessive sinkage beneath the shoulders. Physical therapy and stretching are commonly prescribed to medical patients with shoulder pain. The nature of these treatments largely depend on the nature of your injury and severity of symptoms, so please consult your doctor or another credentialed medical provider for more information. Slouching while sitting can greatly exacerbate shoulder pain. According to the , certain exercises can not only improve posture but also reduce pain in the process. These include “rolling the shoulders up and back, then letting them relax down, tucking chin down slightly, and sitting up from the hips.” You can also try standing against a wall by resting your head, lower back, and hips against the surface with your shoulder blades down and close together. Frequently Asked Questions About Pillows for Shoulder Pain Absolutely. If a pillow does not provide enough support for the head and neck, then you’re more likely to feel new or worsening shoulder pain. A less durable pillow that flattens or loses shape over time can mean more pain, as well. The best pillow for shoulder pain should properly support the head and neck, promote spinal alignment, and stabilize the affected shoulder(s). What is the most important consideration when choosing a pillow for shoulder pain? The most important factors when choosing a pillow for shoulder pain include loft (or thickness), firmness, shape, and fill material. Since everyone has different pillow preferences, we suggest trying different models to see which ones alleviate pain. As you’re starting out, consider pillows that offer sleep trials with free or mostly free returns. You’ll be able to test out these models without financially committing to them at first. What is the worst pillow type for shoulder pain? Down, down alternative, and feather pillows are generally considered the worst pillows for shoulder pain because they provide the least support and tend to flatten during the night. A mattress topper is a thin layer of cushioning material that rests on top of the mattress surface. Toppers are intended to change the firmness of the mattress – either softer or firmer – so using one can definitely reduce shoulder pain if your mattress sinks too much or feels excessively stiff. However, make sure the pillow you’re using also suits your needs; otherwise the topper on its own may not provide much pain relief. What Is the Best Pillow Positioning for Shoulder Pain?

There are four parts of the spine to support, he explains: cervical (neck), thoracic (ribs), lumbar (low back), and pelvis. Ultimately, you want to pay attention to what positions provoke and ease pain, and in what specific areas. For instance, if laying in bed provides some relief, but you have poor posture at work, Dinney says a pillow for your desk might do better than one under your neck while in bed.

Well, that dream can soon become a reality, especially for those who sleep on their back. But, it all starts with the perfect pillow. If you’re a back sleeper, then you might have that prevents you from getting your best night's sleep. And chances are it’s because of your pillow (especially if you've had the same one for several years). Lucky for you, the perfect pillow for back sleepers isn't too hard to find. For starters, it should promote ""spinal alignment, rather than arching the neck too far upward or allowing the head to sink too deeply,"" according to the When choosing the best pillow for sleeping on your back, it’s also important to consider the firmness, neck support level, spinal alignment, shape, and temperature. With all that in mind, take a look at this list of the seven best pillows for back sleepers that'll help you have your best sleep of the year (and maybe even the new decade?). Soon enough, you'll say goodbye to neck and back pain, and good morning to your best self: A pillow that supports your neck is a must-have for back sleepers. The D-Core Cervical Support pillow does just that and more, increasing your chances for a better night’s sleep. For starters, the unique D-shaped center holds your head in place, helping to align the spine, while the extra firm curve underneath alleviates the neck from discomfort.  But word to the wise: Reviewers say the firmness may be hard to get used to, so try alternating between the D-Core pillow and your current one at first. ""Okay... I NEVER would have thought about a pillow with a hole in it... BUT if you have neck issues, this pillow is OUTSTANDING... I used to constantly shift around, never was able to get comfortable, always woke up with a neck ache and sometimes a headache.. I got this pillow and I sleep so much better."" If an extra-firm option isn’t right for you, this memory foam pillow will meet you in the middle (and can anyone really say no to memory foam?!). Right in between soft and firm, this pillow has the perfect amount of support and comfort for back sleepers who need a li'l extra love on the neck and shoulders.  Best part: This pillow is infused with a temperature-regulating gel, providing you with a fresh and cool night’s sleep.

""I like that it doesn't seem to get too hot on warm nights and it doesn't freeze on cold ones. It really helps me sleep—I fall asleep when I use this pillow much easier than when I don't. It lets your head sink in more than a normal pillow but not so much that you sink right through... It really helps to limit neck pain which is an issue I have always suffered with most pillows unless I choose to lay in just the right way."" Reviewers are raving about how comfortable this TEMPUR- Neck pillow is. Made from the classic Tempur material, this pillow is suitable for all types of sleepers who just want to have a relaxed night of sleep, without pain the next morning. Plus, the curve of this pillow is suitable for any body type and provides long-lasting support and comfort to the neck and shoulders. ""I have a chronic neck and shoulder problem due to years of overuse... in athletics & coaching. This pillow gives me instant relief and allows me to sleep very well at night. I mostly sleep on my back due to having to use a CPAP Machine and this contour pillow has made that much easier than it was before I started using it."" Can’t get your pillow to keep its shape? That's not a problem with this luxury bamboo pillow. It's made of shredded memory foam that helps keep its shape for longer than your average pillow. If that’s not impressive enough, the outer layer is also made of a hypoallergenic bamboo that helps keep you cool at night and is also odor resistant.  If you suffer from pressure in your neck, this pillow promises to hold your head perfectly in place throughout the night, providing a relaxed and supported sleep. Reviewers love this eco-friendly pillow and say it’s soft and comfortable.   ""I have neck issues and have tried so many pillows over the years, I can't even count. This pillow is absolute perfection! Since the memory foam is in pieces, you can pull some out to customize. I expected that I would need to remove some, but didn't need to. I just push on it a bit to form it and now sleep better than I have in years!"" If you sleep with a partner, they might thank you for purchasing this wedge pillow. According to the retailer, the wedge shape of this pillow actually helps those who snore while sleeping on their back, ensuring a quieter sleep for all.  Plus, the elevated angle of this pillow is also meant to relieve acid reflux, trouble breathing, and reduce back or neck pain while helping to align the spine. And it's not just for sleeping: This pillow can go all around the house with you, from laying in bed while watching television to propping up a laptop while working from home. ""Bought the 7"" wedge as a test run to before committing to an adjustable bed base. Wanted to see if we'd be comfortable sleeping at an incline. The pillows have been a tremendous help with reducing snoring and GERD [gastroesophageal reflux disease] attacks. The outer case is of bamboo fiber, which is very soft to the touch... We found this perfect for back sleeping."" Yep, this pillow works just like a water bed—and looks like way too much fun. Not to mention, the benefits of a water pillow are perfect for back sleepers. According to the website, back sleepers experience pain because of a pillow’s thickness, forcing the head to sit higher than the spine. With this pillow, you can adjust the firmness to your liking, simply by adding water in the sealed pouch to make the pillow more firm, or pouring out water for a plush feel. A clinical study of the water pillow conducted by the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine even suggests that it is comfortable, improves quality of sleep, and reduces neck pain.   ""This is the third Mediflow water-based pillow that I've had. I bought the first one in the mid-'90s when they were fairly new and the chiropractor I had at the time recommended it. I've been so sold on these pillows since that first one that this one I just purchased is my third. The first two each lasted approximately 10 years. And I haven’t used any other pillow since. It is the only pillow that I've had that allows me a good night’s sleep without waking up in the morning with neck or shoulder pain."" Wonder what it’s like to sleep on a cloud? Known as ""the world’s most adjustable pillow,"" this one allows you to take comfort into your own hands by customizing the firmness to your liking. Made from medium-firm memory foam and microfiber, the stretchy, lightweight fill also allows you to shape the pillow for any sleep position. All you have to do is unzip the inner liner, and add or take out however much filling works for you.  Consider this the perfect solution for back sleepers who want fully-customizable back support and comfort.  ""Even by my own admission I am the world's fussiest pillow seeker. I've tried solid memory foam, down type, foam, you name it I've tried it. So when I said that I was going to order the Shredded Memory Foam by Coop Home Goods my wife said, 'Here we go again! Where are you going to store this one? Or is it going back a day after it arrives?' Well...I have to admit that I thought she was probably exactly correct. But the reviews were so so good... I had to give it a try. It arrived and I've used it for about 2 weeks now. I've got to tell you that it's BY FAR the most comfortable pillow that I have ever owned.""

For women who sleep on their side, a bit higher pillow is recommended.

An additional rolled towel or a roll-shaped pillow is recommended to place under the neck which makes it aligned with head.

If you are a side sleeper you may consider getting a good body pillow that provides all these comforts in just one pillow. Sleeping on the belly is not recommended due to the possibility of stressing the neck easily. When you sleep on your stomach your head gets turned and an arch in made at the back which often creates tension in your neck. You may thus experience a sore and stiff neck when you wake up early morning. In addition to this, changing your sleeping positions gets difficult when you sleep on your stomach. If you find it hard to change this sleep habit you may consider using a flat pillow under your head. Alternatively, you can also place a pillow under your forehead which makes a distance between your nose and mattress. Your head and neck remain in a neutral position while doing this.

This includes injuries from exercising, playing sports, and lifting heavy objects. These activities may strain the muscles and ligaments in the back. In addition to accidents and injuries, back pain can be caused by a ruptured, damaged, or herniated disk. Disks are part of the spine that sit between and cushion each vertebrae. Damage to a disk can also lead to nerve pain and muscle weakness. Underlying issues including arthritis, osteoporosis, and fibromyalgia can contribute to back pain.  Back pain is common during pregnancy, as the additional weight puts pressure on the lower back. Back pain can also be exacerbated by poor posture. There are several types of back pain, and understanding the severity and location of the pain can help when it comes to finding relief. It is important to work with a medical professional to determine the underlying cause of back pain. Being able to describe the type of back pain you are experiencing is important. Back pain can be considered acute or chronic: Acute back pain typically has a sudden onset, and is often caused by an injury. This type of back pain heals as the underlying cause is resolved. This may involve a torn muscle or ligament, or damage to the tissue. Tissue damage generally takes three months to heal, so acute back pain often lasts three months or less. That said, acute back pain can turn into chronic back pain if the body does not properly heal. Chronic back pain lasts longer than three to six months. It persists even after an injury heals. In these circumstances, the nervous system continues sending pain signals to the brain. Chronic back pain can also be the result of an underlying condition. Arthritis, osteoporosis, and fibromyalgia can all cause chronic back pain. Whether back pain is chronic or acute, it can manifest in different areas of the back. The location of back pain can often point to the underlying cause. Low back pain is the type of back pain. It manifests in the lumbar region, specifically vertebrae L1 through L5. These five vertebrae, and the disks, ligaments, tendons, and muscles connected to them, help support the upper body. As a result, this area is at risk of injury when exercising or lifting heavy objects improperly. Weight gain and pregnancy can also strain the lower back. Using a pillow under the lumbar region can reduce pressure on the spine and help alleviate lower back pain. Mid-back pain occurs between the lumbar region and the bottom of the rib cage. This type of back pain is less likely to be caused by heavy lifting. Mid-back pain can be connected to more serious health issues like tumors or underlying conditions. Posture can play a role in worsening or preventing mid-back pain. : Upper back pain occurs in the , or the 12 vertebrae between the rib cage and neck. This type of back pain includes the shoulders, and is often affected by posture. Trauma or injury can also cause upper back pain. Serious conditions, including osteoporosis, arthritis, tumors, and narrowing of the spine can all lead to upper back pain. Like other types of back pain, upper back pain can also be a result of damage to the vertebrae, disks, muscles, or ligaments. Pillow choice is especially important for those with upper back pain, as the right pillow will support the upper back, shoulders, and neck.

What to Consider When Purchasing a Pillow for Back Pain The following considerations affect the performance and quality of a pillow, and should be kept in mind by all shoppers. There are plenty of choices on the market, and it is not uncommon for companies to overstate certain features to entice shoppers. This can be distracting. Focusing on what is most important, namely the amount of support and comfort a pillow provides, will help shoppers narrow down their options. These factors can help shoppers filter out unnecessary marketing jargon and exaggerations and find the best pillow for them. When evaluating the following elements, back pain sufferers should also consider their sleeping position, head and shoulder size, and type of back pain. : Loft refers to the height of the pillow, which is one of the most important considerations when choosing a pillow for back pain.

Back sleepers tend to choose a medium loft pillow that cradles the head and neck, while side sleepers may opt for a medium to high loft to fill the gap between the neck and shoulders. Support measures how well the spine is kept in alignment. The spine extends into the neck, so the pillow must be supportive enough to reduce pressure on the neck and shoulders. Some materials are more supportive than others, as they retain shape throughout the night and resist falling flat. The firmness of a pillow is measured on a scale of soft to firm. The best pillow firmness for back pain depends on sleeping position and weight, among other factors. The pillow should balance comfort and support. Stomach sleepers often prefer a soft pillow, while back and side sleepers may opt for a medium to firm pillow. Firmness and comfort are subjective, so shoppers should keep their personal preferences in mind. : How well the pillow conforms to the shape of the head and neck determines how much pressure relief it provides. Back pain can be worsened by undue pressure on the neck and shoulders. This is often caused by a pillow that is too firm, or one that puts the head and neck and an uncomfortable angle. A pillow that relieves pressure will cradle the head and neck and reduce tension. Pillows can also be used underneath the lumbar region to relieve pressure in the lower back.

Learn more about our process When you’re traveling, sleeping en route may seem like the perfect way to arrive at your destination refreshed and ready to go. Unfortunately, aches and pains may be the unforeseen consequences of a convenient snooze. Different pressure points may develop when you sleep upright than when you lie down. Many individuals also slump over or bend their necks when sleeping in a sitting position, putting their spines out of alignment. Travel pillows can be one of the best solutions to get some sleep on the go while limiting the discomfort often associated with sleeping upright. These pillows are typically smaller than bed pillows and tuck behind or around the neck, filling the space between the neck and the headrest while keeping the neck from bending too far. There are many different types of travel pillows on the market to fit virtually any traveler’s needs and preferences. Below, we’ll detail the most important factors to consider when selecting a travel pillow and share some of our favorite picks.

It features a quilted cover and comes with a breathable, bamboo pillow case. The 12” size pictured here is ideal as a travel pillow and for some beds, but the 28” version is probably more practical for a bedroom. While this unique pillow works great for side sleepers, stomach and back sleepers probably want to opt for a more traditional pillow. The Cube comes at a lower-than average price point, despite the high-quality memory foam inside. Pillow Cube offers a 30-day return policy.  Fill: 100% polyester fibers Lining: 95% polyester, 5% cotton People whose heads tend to tilt when they sleep sitting up Use this SleepFoundation.org link for the most current discount on the Infinity Sleep pillows The Infinity Pillow stands out thanks to its unique design.

In addition to serving as a traditional pillow for your head, the Infinity Pillow can also serve as a lumbar cushion during long flights or nights on uncomfortable hotel beds. The fill is composed of polyester fibers that offer a down-like softness while still maintaining good loft and support. The cover is made from a durable blend of nylon and rayon from bamboo that resists tearing to prevent the fill from escaping and also sleeps quite cool. The pillow’s compact size and moldable composition allow it to fit in most travel bags. While one size is available, you can choose from six different colors. When the pillow needs to be cleaned, Infinity Sleep recommends machine washing and air drying. The price-point for the Infinity Pillow is very reasonable compared to other travel size models. Shipping is also free of charge for all U.S. orders. Travel pillows come in a variety of sizes, shapes, and styles, but they share one common purpose: to make traveling more comfortable. Most travel pillows fit behind or around the neck to provide extra support. Many travelers doze off on their journeys, but sleeping upright can be problematic. The head is likely to tilt or slump over, potentially straining the neck. A supportive travel pillow can help keep the spine well aligned to reduce unnecessary pressure on the neck. While travel pillows are designed specifically for travel, they are more versatile than the name would imply. Many owners also choose to use their travel pillows at home. A travel pillow can also help support the neck as you watch TV or work on your computer. Some shapes of travel pillows may also be suitable for tucking under or between the knees while you lie in bed. All travel pillows aim to make your travels more comfortable, but there are still many differences between models. Understanding the factors that differentiate one travel pillow from another can help you select the best travel pillow for your needs, preferences, and planned uses. Below, we’ll detail some of the top criteria customers should use to assess a travel pillow. Each factor has implications for the pillow’s comfort and convenience, but individual shoppers will prioritize some features more than others based on their unique needs and preferences. While some travel pillow manufacturers may imply that their pillow is suitable for all travelers, the ideal option for you is going to depend on your personal travel needs. For travelers, the size of the pillow is important to take into account for packing. Small or compressible pillows tend to be easier to pack. However, some individuals prefer larger pillows for extra cushioning. Many people immediately picture the classic u-shaped travel pillow that wraps around the neck, but travel pillows come in several different shapes. The shape can affect the pillow’s performance, versatility, and ease of packing. We’ll discuss the most common pillow shapes in more detail below. Travel pillow manufacturers typically engineer their products with portability in mind. Many travel pillows come with a carrying bag to keep the pillow clean and contained. Pillows and their bags also frequently have cords so that they can be easily affixed to the outside of a suitcase for convenient access. Even the heaviest travel pillows probably won’t seem particularly weighty when you first purchase them. However, when you’re lugging your bags from destination to destination, that extra weight may seem more impactful. Considering the weight of the travel pillow before making your purchase can help shave off a few valuable ounces off the total weight of your luggage. While this might seem insignificant to some, avid travelers and backpackers frequently pay attention to any additional weight. Firmness level can affect the comfort and supportiveness of a travel pillow. Unfortunately, most manufacturers do not indicate the firmness of their travel pillows, so customers are left to guess. The construction of the pillow can give you some hints. Inflatable pillows are typically firm when fully inflated, but they can be filled with less air for a softer feel. Memory foam and polyfoam pillows generally balance softness and support. Fiber-filled and microbead pillows usually have a softer, cushier feel. Both inflatable and non-inflatable pillows have distinct potential benefits. Inflatable pillows can be deflated so that they take up very little room in your luggage. The inflatablity also lets travelers adjust the air level to modify the feel of the pillow. Non-inflatable pillows come in a wider array of materials, which may make it easier for shoppers to find options that are comfortable for them. However, they are usually bulkier. Like most sleep products, travel pillows vary widely in price based on their construction, materials, and quality. Budget-friendly options start at around $10, while luxury options can cost over $100. Either option may be suitable, but lower-quality pillows may not last as long or provide as much support. Material quality is often directly tied to a pillow’s performance, price, and durability. High-quality materials typically provide more support and last longer, but customers usually pay a higher price upfront. Lower-quality options tend to be more affordable, but they may break down more quickly under the rigors of travel. Ultimately, either option could be a better value depending on your needs and goals. The climates of airplanes and cars can be quite inconsistent, making strong temperature regulation that much more important. Many travel pillows have special , like breathable, moisture-wicking fabrics, to help keep the pillow from trapping excessive heat. However, some pillows use memory foam, which is typically more prone to heat retention. Because travel pillows are so versatile, virtually anyone may benefit from using one. They are particularly popular with travelers, campers, and backpackers, but most people could find an opportunity to use one even if they don’t leave their homes. During long flights, sleeping may be one of the best ways to pass the time. Unfortunately, slumping over in your seat could also put a strain on your neck and leave you with aches and pains. Frequent fliers often look for a travel pillow with exceptional neck support to keep their neck relatively straight even if they fall asleep. A lightweight, compact design may simplify packing, but it isn’t always essential since many air travelers strap their pillow to the outside of their suitcases. Car headrests are usually engineered for safety in case of accidents, so they aren’t always comfortable. Using a travel pillow can add support and cushioning on a long road trip. Passengers’ travel pillow choices for riding in a car may vary more based on their personal preferences. Campers often use travel pillows to rest their heads on at night. Because of this, they generally look for an hourglass or a rectangular travel pillow with enough cushioning to comfortably cradle their head and neck. Weight and size may also be worth considering, especially if there is a hike to the campsite. Like campers, backpackers frequently use travel pillows at night. Because of this, they’ll typically select a small rectangular or hourglass pillow that balances softness and support. The size and weight of the travel pillow tend to be high priorities for backpackers since they’ll be carrying it around with them. A rectangular or hourglass pillow can be a wonderful solution for kids’ sleepovers. They’re less bulky than conventional , and they’re usually easier to clean. Since kids will need a pillow to sleep on, a travel pillow should be both cushioning and supportive. In this section, we’ll detail popular styles and materials of travel pillows. While these are some of the most common options, you may also find other selections that do not fall into an existing category. As the name implies, u-shaped travel pillows are shaped like the letter u. This is the most common type of travel pillow on the market. It goes around the neck, supporting the back and sides of the neck to promote better spinal alignment. Its combination of cushioning and support makes this design popular, but the shape often makes them more difficult to pack and store. Wrap style pillows work like a scarf, wrapping closely around the neck while built-in support helps prevent the head from tilting excessively. Since they’re less bulky than most u-shaped pillows, they are also usually quite compact and lightweight. The j-shaped travel pillow is relatively new. It traditionally goes across the front of the body and loops over one shoulder, allowing the traveler to prop up their head to rest. However, their unique shape often makes them bulkier to pack. Most travel pillows are built for neck support, but the hourglass pillow is more versatile. While you can tuck it under your neck on a plane, you might also use it beneath your back or knees while you’re at home. The main potential drawback is that it doesn’t provide the multi-directional neck support of many travel pillows, so you may still inadvertently tilt your head. Rectangular travel pillows look more like the traditional bed pillow that you’re familiar with, but there are some key differences. They are built for travel, so they are usually compact and lightweight. A rectangular travel pillow may be a good option for campers, , and backpackers, but they usually aren’t ideal for plane or car travel since your head may still tilt to the side. Inflatable pillows typically inflate with just a few puffs of air and deflate even more quickly. This makes them exceptionally easy to pack and store, and it allows the user to adjust the firmness. travel pillows adjust to the individual’s shape to support their neck. While memory foam is popular for its exceptional contouring and cushioning, it is also more prone to heat retention than some materials. Like memory foam, polyfoam molds to the traveler’s body. Its open cell structure makes polyfoam more breathable than most memory foam, but lower-density polyfoams also tend to be less durable. Once deflated, inflatable pillows can usually fit in a small space for easy packing. The traveler can empty or fill the air chamber to change the feel of the pillow. Inflatable pillows are usually some of the most budget-friendly travel pillows on the market. Non-inflatable pillows use a wider variety of materials, so many people can find an option they feel is more comfortable than an inflatable pillow. There’s a wide range of different shapes, styles, and lofts for non-inflatable pillows, giving customers more options to fit their preferences. Over time, air may seep out of some inflatable pillows. If the air chamber is torn or punctured, an inflatable pillow will no longer provide much, if any, cushioning. While many non-inflatable travel pillows are designed to fit in a small space, they’re still often bulkier than a deflated inflatable pillow. Many non-inflatable pillows have a higher price tag than their inflatable counterparts. What style of travel pillow is best for specific types of travel? The best type of travel pillow will depend on the type of travel as well as how you intend to use the pillow. Backpackers and campers who plan to use their travel pillow for sleeping while lying down will typically prefer a rectangular or an hourglass pillow. Travelers looking for a pillow to support their neck while they sleep upright on a plane or in a car may want to go with a u-shaped, wrap, or j-shaped pillow. Travel pillows can vary from under $10 to over $100. This price is determined largely by their quality, materials, and construction. Most travel pillow manufacturers provide cleaning instructions. It’s always best to follow the manufacturer’s instructions in order to preserve the life expectancy of your pillow. Many travel pillows have removable, machine-washable covers. Their interiors usually aren’t machine-washable, but they can often be spot cleaned. You can buy travel pillows through manufacturer websites, at department stores, and online marketplaces. Travel pillows are popular and widely available, so you should be able to find one at most stores that sell home goods, travel accessories, and/or sleep products. The life expectancy of your travel pillow will vary based on its quality and how well you care for it. A high-quality, well-maintained travel pillow could last for several years. However, the wear and tear of travel may shorten a pillow’s lifespan, particularly for models that do not stow away in luggage. Some travel pillows are adjustable to an extent. Inflatable pillows can be adjusted by filling or emptying the air chambers, thus altering their firmness. Many travel pillows also have adjustable neck closures.

Shoppers today have a lot to consider in terms of composition and fill, thickness, durability, temperature regulation, and pain relief. You should also take personal factors into account when searching for a new pillow. For example, a side sleeper who weighs less than 130 pounds will probably need a completely different pillow than a stomach sleeper who weighs more than 230 pounds. People with neck and shoulder pain may need a pillow with an orthopedic shape, while heavy snorers often require a high-loft pillow to keep their heads upright. This guide includes a complete rundown on pillow types and important criteria for pillow buyers. First, check out our top picks for pillows sold today. The selections listed below are based on experiences from verified pillow owners and our own in-house testing. Best Memory Foam Pillow: Sleepers of all position preferences (side, back, stomach, combination) Choice of three firmness levels to suit all types of sleepers Use this SleepFoundation.org link for the most current discount on Brooklinen pillows Brooklinen offers the Down Alternative Pillow for people who enjoy the soft cushion of a down pillow, but don’t want to sleep on actual down. Whether you are vegan and avoiding animal products or dealing with allergies that make you sensitive to down, this pillow is a good option for the down feel without the feathers. The Brooklinen Down Alternative Pillow is made in the US and sold at value prices compared to similar pillows. Brooklinen also offers discounts to customers purchasing 3 or more pillows. This pillow is constructed with a 100 percent cotton sateen shell over a polyfill interior. The Brooklinen Down Alternative Pillow is also available in three firmness levels, which provide plenty of options for various types of sleepers. “Plush” is the softest option. Recommended for stomach sleepers wanting to maintain spinal alignment, the Plush option prevents neck strain by allowing sleepers to sink in deeply. It’s one of the best pillows for stomach sleepers with neck pain. The “Mid-Plush” option is a medium-soft pillow. This firmness option is ideal for back sleepers who want their head slightly elevated, but not too much. Finally, the “Firm” pillow is the firmest version of the Brooklinen Down Alternative Pillow. This option works best for side sleepers wanting to keep their head level so they maintain spinal alignment. For pillows, Brooklinen allows free returns and exchanges up to one year after purchase. Innovative pillow-in-pillow design balances support and softness Gusset design helps keep fill material in place, preventing clumping Use this SleepFoundation.org link for the most current discount on Casper pillows The Casper Original Pillow is a down alternative pillow filled with polyester microfiber. It mimics the soft feel of down, but doesn’t contain animal products. The pillow shares a similar construction with many down pillows in that it has a softer outer pillow surrounding a firmer core. Although polyester microfiber feels similar to down, it doesn’t contain any feathers, making it suitable for those who avoid animal products. Casper doesn’t claim their Original pillow is hypoallergenic, but it is likely a good choice for people who experience allergy issues with down. This pillow comes in one firmness level, which is medium-soft. Its firmness and loft make the pillow most suitable for side and back sleepers. Stomach sleepers might find that the Casper Original Pillow elevates their head too high, which can lead to neck discomfort. The Casper Original Pillow is constructed with a gusset, or a 2-inch panel that circles the outer edge of the pillow. This gusset increases the pillow’s loft and adds structure. Due to the gusset and other aspects of the pillow’s construction, sleepers will find that the contents of the Casper Original Pillow stay put and do not shift throughout the night. Although some down and down alternative pillows can become lumpy over time, lumpiness shouldn’t be a problem with this pillow. Casper offers a 100-night sleep trial and 1-year limited warranty on their Original Pillow.  Shredded memory foam and kapok tree fiber blend High-loft design supports and contours to the neck, reducing pressure and improving spinal alignment Generous 5-year warranty and 120-night money-back guarantee Use this SleepFoundation.org link for the most current discount on Layla pillows The Layla Kapok Pillow combines shredded memory foam fill with kapok fibers. The kapok fibers are sustainably harvested from the seed pods of the kapok tree, which grows in Indonesia. These two materials come together to provide a mix of cushioning and support. The pillow also features an innovative cover that is woven with copper fibers that are designed to draw heat away from your face and neck to prevent uncomfortable heat build-up over the course of the night. Copper is also naturally antimicrobial. The cover also has a zippered opening so that users can remove the cover for washing. This opening also allows for loft adjustments. The pillow arrives overstuffed, which may be perfect for larger side sleepers, but those who sleep on their backs or stomachs will want to remove some fill to achieve the appropriate loft level for proper spinal alignment. This customization enables the pillow to suit a wide range of sleepers. Layla backs the pillow with a 120-night sleep trial and a 5-year warranty.  TEMPUR memory foam with TEMPUR-Breeze Gel coating Two layers of TEMPUR-Breeze gel keep the pillow cool Highly conforming feel of memory foam, without the excessive heat Medium firmness and moderate loft provide versatility Use this SleepFoundation.org link for the most current discount on Tempur-Pedic pillows The Tempur-Pedic TEMPUR-Cloud Dual Breeze is made of a single layer of TEMPUR material, which is a type of memory foam. Since memory foam tends to trap heat, there’s a layer of TEMPUR-Breeze Gel surrounding it, to promote cooling. This pillow comes with the traditional memory foam feel associated with Tempur-Pedic mattresses. Sleepers can expect a highly conforming pillow that “hugs” the body. The feel of the TEMPUR-Cloud Dual Breeze differs greatly from the feel associated with down and down alternative pillows. The TEMPUR-Cloud Dual Breeze comes in one firmness level, which is medium. This firmness level makes the pillow most suitable for side and back sleepers. Most stomach sleepers tend to prefer a thinner pillow. The cover of the TEMPUR-Cloud Dual Breeze is removable and washable. Made of 100 percent cotton, the cover adds to the pillow’s breathability. Although the cover can be washed, the pillow’s inner contents cannot be washed. Tempur-Pedic doesn’t have a sleep trial and does not allow pillow returns. They do offer free shipping and a 5-year warranty on the TEMPUR-Cloud Dual Breeze Pillow, however. Memory foam provides pressure relief and contouring Use this SleepFoundation.org link for the most current discount on SleepEasy pillows The EasySleeper Pillow from SleepEasy helps side and back sleepers achieve proper spinal alignment, which in turn helps alleviate neck pain. The pillow is made from memory foam, which provides contouring and pressure relief. Using an ergonomic design, the pillow features contoured cut-outs to adequately support the head and neck whether you prefer to sleep on your back or your side. The cover includes a full length zipper, which allows you to easily remove the cover for machine washing. SleepEasy sells the pillow either alone as a single pillow, as a partner pack (two pillows), or as a family pack (four pillows). The pillow comes in one standard size. SleepEasy ships internationally and offers a 30-day return policy for products in their original condition.  Cross-cut gel-infused memory foam and microfiber People of all sleep position preferences (side, back, stomach, combination) Removable fill allows for customization of loft and density Gusset and shredded memory foam help to improve airflow Use this SleepFoundation.org link for the most current discount on Coop Home Goods pillows The Coop Home Goods Eden Pillow is filled with cross-cut pieces of memory foam and microfiber. This construction, along with gel infused into the memory foam, enables the pillow to sleep cooler than many other memory foam pillows. A gusset, which is a panel around the perimeter of the Eden, also promotes airflow through the pillow. The gusset adds structure to the pillow, which helps the pillow evenly support weight. The Eden Pillow is hypoallergenic, making it a good choice for allergy sufferers. The pillow doesn’t contain down, and it has been certified by CertiPUR-US and GREENGUARD. Coop Home Goods also notes that the Eden is dust mite resistant. One attractive feature of the Eden is its versatility when it comes to different types of sleepers. Sleepers can add or remove fill to adjust the pillow’s loft and density to fit their needs. This option makes the Eden a strong choice for sleepers of all position preferences. The Eden’s cover and liner are both unzippable, allowing customers to access the innermost part of the pillow. The pillow also comes with an extra half bag of fill. This construction allows customers to adjust the pillow’s fill levels. Both the removable cover and inner pillow may be machine washed. Coop Home Goods offers a 100-night sleep trial and 5-year warranty on the Eden Pillow. Ergonomic design features sleeping surfaces tailored to every sleep position Use this SleepFoundation.org link for the most current discount on SpineAlign pillows The innovative SpineAlign Pillow is designed to alleviate aches, stiffness, and tension around the neck. Its ergonomic, asymmetrical design features two side chambers containing adaptive polyfoam. The thinner side chamber is designed for people who stand at 5 feet 6 inches or shorter, while the thicker side chamber is geared toward taller people. Both of these components feature raised edges for neck support and a grooved center to cradle the head, which can be beneficial for side sleepers. The pillow also includes a center chamber that sits lower than either side. Back sleepers can rest comfortably on this middle section. If you need to adjust how supportive the pillow feels, each chamber can be accessed using a zipper; simply reach into the chamber and manipulate the foam to make it feel thicker or flatter. The SpineAlign website features a helpful tutorial video that explains how to sleep on and adjust the pillow. Shipping is free throughout the contiguous U.S., and customers in Alaska and Hawaii will incur minimal delivery charges. The SpineAlign Pillow comes with a 60-night sleep trial. Those who wish to return their pillow must wait until at least 30 nights have elapsed if they wish to receive a full refund. The pillow also comes with a five-year warranty. Custom design tailored to the sleeper’s height, weight, sleep position, and desired feel Pillow fill and cover are both made-to-order based on survey results Use this SleepFoundation.org link for the most current discount on Pluto pillows The Pluto Pillow is a customizable pillow designed specifically for your needs and preferences. Every customer completes a detailed survey that includes questions about height, weight, sleep position, optimal loft, and desired feel. A pillow is then crafted based on your specific feedback. Compositions will vary, but all pillows contain at least one piece of solid adaptive polyfoam that is CertiPUR-US certified, meaning it does not contain any hazardous materials. The cover is also made to order, and may be quilted or smooth depending on your survey answers. Material composition of the cover also varies. According to Pluto, more than 25 different variations are available for the pillow. You can also choose between standard and king sizes. You can’t view the pillow’s specs before purchasing, but Pluto offers a 100-night trial to let you decide whether or not to keep it. The trial requires a two-week break-in period, but after that full refunds are issued for all returns. Additionally, the Pluto Pillow is backed by a one-year warranty. Shipping is free for all orders in the contiguous U.S. Firmer waterfowl-feather core provides structured support Softer white goose down exterior layers offers a plush feel and soft contouring Use this SleepFoundation.org link for the most current discount on Luxe Pillow pillows The Luxe Pillow is constructed with down and feathers. It contains a firmer, structured core of small-game waterfowl feathers. Surrounding the core are two chambers of soft, white goose down. This construction provides a mixture of support and plushness. Generally, down and feather pillows aren’t recommended for people with allergies. However, the Luxe Pillow is certified hypoallergenic. The down and feathers they use undergo extensive washing, so they are less likely to bother people with allergies. Also, the Luxe Pillow comes with a high-quality pillow protector. Pillow protectors help keep pillows in good shape. They also tend to help protect sleepers from inhaling allergens that might develop in the pillow over time, such as dust mites. The Luxe Pillow comes in one firmness level, which is medium. The loft and medium firmness of the Luxe make it a strong option for side and back sleepers. Stomach sleepers might find that this pillow is too thick or firm for their liking, however. Stomach sleepers often prefer softer, less lofted pillows that allow them to maintain spinal alignment. The Luxe Pillow comes with free shipping and a 100-night sleep trial during which customers may return the product at no cost.  Polyester (Outer Chambers), Sterilized Natural Feathers (Inner Chamber) Individuals looking for fully machine-washable pillows Hybrid down and polyester design balances plushness and support Three-chamber construction keeps fill evenly distributed Use this SleepFoundation.org link for the most current discount on Standard Textile pillows The Chamber Down Pillow by Standard Textile, also known as the Chamberloft pillow, is constructed with two outer chambers filled with hypoallergenic polyester surrounding an inner chamber filled with sterilized feathers.

For more personalized pillow guides, check out the following pages: There is no single perfect pillow for everyone. To find your ideal pillow, you must consider your sleep position preferences, as well as many aspects of pillows you’re considering. This section guides you through the various pillow qualities to evaluate while pillow shopping. Once you know what to look for, you can feel confident that you’re truly buying the pillow because it fits your needs. Marketing hype shouldn’t drive your decision-making as you shop for the perfect pillow. Companies may claim that their pillow feels like sleeping on a cloud, works well for all sleepers, and stays cool all night. Instead of being swayed by advertising, it’s best to evaluate the facts. You should consider many factors when pillow shopping. First, your personal sleep position preference heavily influences which pillows best fit your body. Of course, many shoppers are limited by a budget. Keep these factors at the forefront of your mind while examining your pillow options. Also, learn each pillow’s loft and firmness level to determine if it’s a good option for you. Identify the materials each pillow is made of, if it has cooling properties, and if it will relieve pressure in your neck and shoulders. In this section, we provide more information about the factors to consider when pillow shopping.  Your preferred sleep position majorly affects which pillows you find comfortable. Stomach sleepers tend to like softer, flatter pillows, since thick pillows can prop the head too high, causing neck pain. Side sleepers generally prefer thicker pillows, which keep the head up and the spine aligned. Back sleepers likely prefer medium pillows, though they are the most flexible group.  “Loft” refers to a pillow’s height or thickness, specifically when the pillow is sitting flat with nothing on top of it. People with different sleep position preferences generally prefer pillows with different lofts. Loft and firmness level combine to determine a pillow’s height once weight is put on it.  Just like mattresses, pillows come in different firmness levels. Firmness affects how a pillow feels, as well as how high it holds your head. For example, a pillow with a high loft might not hold your head up as high as you’d expect if it is extremely soft and sinks under weight.  Pillows are available at nearly every price point, ranging from under $10 to upwards of $1,000. Most pillows are sold for under $200, however. The price of a pillow is generally determined by the pillow’s materials and construction. Price loosely correlates with quality, though there are plenty of decent pillows available at affordable prices.  Like mattresses, pillows can be pressure-relieving or create pressure points. Since pressure points lead to discomfort or even neck pain, pressure relief is an important pillow quality for many sleepers. Pillow materials, loft, and firmness level combined with a person’s preferred sleeping position determines how well a pillow performs in terms of pressure relief.  There is no single pillow cover or fill material that stands out as being the highest quality. Varying qualities exist within each material type. Customers can research types of down, polyfill, memory foam, etc. to better understand what determines quality within each material type.  Like mattresses, some pillows sleep cooler than others. Down alternatives tend to sleep cooler than down, and buckwheat hulls are known for sleeping exceptionally cool. Memory foam pillows can trap heat, but most contain cooling gel or another cooling material to counteract that tendency. Pillows are constructed with a variety of materials. Understanding what these materials are and how they generally perform will help you determine which pillows best fit your needs.  Polyfoam, or polyurethane foam, is a type of foam used in both mattresses and pillows. Although polyfoam can vary widely in terms of both quality and firmness, it’s generally lower cost than memory foam. When used as pillow fill, polyfoam is often shredded or cut into small pieces.  Memory foam pillows often provide a soft, conforming feel. Since  tends to trap heat, manufacturers often infuse it with a cooling agent or construct the pillow in a way that encourages airflow. Some memory foam pillows are constructed of full blocks of memory foam, while others contain shredded or cut memory foam.  Perhaps the most traditional pillow fill, down is the soft, fluffy feather found beneath the outer, harder feathers of many birds. Most down pillows contain goose down, and some contain down mixed with feathers. Down is known for its durability, but it may bother some people with allergies or asthma.  Any pillow that was created to feel like down, but does not contain down, is considered a down alternative pillow. Down alternative pillows offer options for vegans and people with allergies who like the feel of down. They are most commonly filled with a polyester microfiber filling.  Latex pillows are pressure relieving and extremely durable. They tend to have a high loft and be more dense, so they’re better for side and back sleepers than stomach sleepers. Latex pillows can be made of one piece of latex or shredded latex fill. Latex feels similar to foam, but is more cooling, especially when aerated.  Generally, the term “feather pillow” is used to refer to pillows that contain both feathers and down. Since feathers are harder than down, 100% feather pillows are less common. Feather pillows are soft, breathable, and a good option for people who sleep hot and want a lower loft.  Buckwheat pillows are filled with buckwheat hulls, the small outer casings of buckwheat grain kernels. These pillows closely conform to the body, and some people liken their feel to that of a bean bag. Many buckwheat pillows are vegan and organic, making them appealing to eco-conscious shoppers.  Wool is a less common fill material that is growing in popularity as customers search for natural pillow options. Most wool pillows are hypoallergenic, organic, and on the luxury end of the price spectrum. Wool is naturally temperature neutral and not extremely conforming.  Water pillows typically contain water along with another fill material, such as memory foam or polyfill. Most water pillows require customers to fill the pillow with water themselves. This system allows for adjustable firmness levels. Water pillows are known for being supportive and cooling. Pillow covers also come in a variety of materials. Most pillow covers are made of cotton, polyester, or a cotton-poly blend. Some are made of other materials, such as bamboo-derived fabric or satin. Cotton covers tend to be more breathable than polyester. Different cover materials feel different to the touch, but the feel is less important since most customers use pillow cases over their pillows. A pillow’s “loft” refers to its height when it is lying flat with nothing sitting on top of it. Pillows are generally divided into low, medium, and high lofts. A low loft pillow measures 3 inches or less in height. A medium loft pillow measures between 3 and 5 inches thick. A high loft pillow measures over 5 inches in height. Unfortunately, these measurements haven’t been universally adopted across pillow companies. Some companies might call their pillow “low loft” or “high loft” when it is in fact medium or average in height. Check actual pillow measurements rather than descriptions whenever possible. Though some companies provide an exact measurement of their pillow’s loft, many do not. Different people prefer pillows of different lofts. Your sleep position preference, head size, body weight, and mattress firmness are all factors that influence which pillow loft is ideal for you.  Stomach sleepers generally require low loft pillows. Medium and high loft pillows can push a stomach sleeper’s head up too high, putting strain on the neck. Back sleepers tend to prefer low or medium loft pillows. Finally, side sleepers tend to require high loft pillows. A high loft pillow can promote spinal alignment by keeping the sleeper’s head as high as their neck and shoulders.  Your head size also helps determine the ideal pillow loft for you. Larger heads tend to sink more deeply into pillows. Therefore, people with larger heads tend to prefer high loft pillows. Similarly, people with smaller heads tend to prefer lower loft pillows. Your body weight also influences your ideal pillow loft. The more a person weighs, the higher loft they should seek out. Lightweight sleepers tend to prefer pillows with lower lofts. Of course, other factors such as preferred sleep position and pillow firmness play a role. Body weight alone shouldn’t be used to choose which pillow to purchase.   can make pillows feel softer. Likewise,  can make pillows feel firmer. For this reason, mattress firmness should be taken into account when choosing a pillow’s firmness and loft. Pillows come in a variety of sizes to fit beds of different sizes and people of different body weights and sleeping habits. Pillow size can be as important as firmness and loft when it comes to finding the pillow that best fits you. Standard pillows measure 20 inches wide by 26 inches long. Standard pillows are the smallest, and therefore the least expensive, pillows on the market today. They are also the most commonly sold pillows. Super Standard pillows measure 20 inches wide by 28 inches long. Like standard pillows, they are usually used one per twin or full bed, and two per larger bed. Standard pillows provide 2 more inches of length for sleepers who need it due to head size, body weight, or propensity to move during the night.  Queen pillows measure 20 inches wide by 30 inches long, 2 inches longer than Super Standard pillows. Queen pillows give extra room to sleepers who tend to toss and turn throughout the night or find themselves slipping off of smaller pillows. King pillows measure 20 inches wide by 36 inches long. King pillows are much larger than most pillows, measuring 10 inches longer than standard pillows and 6 inches longer than queen pillows. King pillows work well with king beds and larger sleepers.  Body pillow dimensions vary, though 48 or 54 inches wide by 20 inches long are common sizes. Body pillows are meant to be hugged. Side sleepers and pregnant women tend to most enjoy them.  Pillows cost anywhere from under $10 to over $1,000. That said, most quality pillows fall in the $50 to $200 range. Materials and construction greatly impact the price of a pillow. Certain materials such as down, wool, and latex tend to cost more than polyfill and memory foam. Certified organic materials generally cost more than those that aren’t organic. Most pillows are washable, but customers should closely read the manufacturer’s instructions before washing. Some pillows may only be hand washed or dry cleaned, while others can be machine washed and dried. Some pillows have removable and washable covers but inner cores that would be ruined by washing. Materials and construction determine if and how a pillow may be washed. Most pillows need to be replaced every few years at the least. Materials such as latex and down are known to last longer, while pillows made with memory foam or polyfill need replacing more often. Generally, a pillow needs replacing when it’s showing signs of wear. If a pillow has become lumpy, developed a smell, flattened, or become less comfortable, it should be replaced. Sometimes people require new pillows after purchasing a new mattress because the old pillows aren’t ideal for the firmness level of the new bed. Latex, down, buckwheat, wool, and water pillows tend to be the best for hot sleepers. All of these pillows generally remain temperature neutral naturally. Memory foam and polyfoam pillows trap the most heat. Cooling infusions can help counteract this tendency. Also, shredded foam pillows don’t trap heat as much as one-piece foam pillows do. Some, but not all, pillows are adjustable. Some polyfill, shredded memory foam, and buckwheat pillows have zippable covers and come with additional fill, so sleepers can make the pillows more or less dense to their liking. Water pillows are known for their adjustability and become firmer as more water is added. Many pillows are not adjustable, however, so shoppers should carefully look for this feature if it’s one they want.  There are many hypoallergenic pillows available for allergy and asthma sufferers. Since dust mites, mold, and mildew are what generally bother , pillows that do not retain moisture are the best for allergy sufferers. Polyfill and down alternative pillows are often hypoallergenic. Latex can also be an excellent pillow fill choice, unless the sleeper is also allergic to latex.

As you research options for the best pillows for back and side sleepers, here’s what to consider. Loft is a description of a pillow’s height and is directly related to the type of fill. Back and side sleepers should look for medium to high loft to ensure they have enough cushioning. If you sleep on your side, a suggests that a pillow height of 10 centimeters, or around 4 inches, may be comfiest for you. Keep in mind that fill material plays a role in loft. If you tend to move between back and side sleeping, a pillow with adjustable loft can be a good option. This is largely a personal preference, but back and side sleepers should look for medium firmness to ensure the right amount of contouring and support. Some kinds of pillow fill naturally compress, and you’ll need to fluff them routinely to maintain their shape. If you’re not interested in that kind of maintenance, pillows made with solid foam or latex are a good option. Look for high-quality materials in the pillow’s cover and type of fill. While you’ll end up paying more for better materials, it’s often a sign of more durability and longevity. While a company’s pillow description will likely sound great, take time to browse reviews for a sense of what customers have to say about a particular pillow’s performance. Pillows come in a surprising range of sizes, but the most common are standard and king. A standard pillow measures 20 inches by 26 inches, while a king is 20 inches by 36 inches. Other pillow sizes include queen, travel, and child pillows. While many people choose pillows for aesthetics in the bedroom, they have an important job. A standard-sized pillow that offers the right density tends to be sufficient for most people, regardless of sleeping position. If you’re a combination sleeper, moving from your back to side during the night, a king pillow can offer more room to accommodate you. Just remember to pick a pillow with the right firmness and support if you’ll actually be using it to sleep and not just as a decoration. A pillow is just one part of the equation when it comes to sleeping soundly. The right mattress will go a long way in maintaining a comfortable sleep environment if you switch from your back to your side during the night. And if you’re not in the market for a new mattress, a can be a good alternative. Additionally, consider adding a small pillow behind your knees while you’re on your back, and between your knees when on your side. This will help maintain the natural curvature of your spine and keep your hip joints from collapsing. Remember to keep your arms and hands below your face and neck when on your side, and try to avoid ducking your chin.

This gives the pillow a medium soft feel overall, without compromising on support. Overall, the pillow’s medium soft feel and average loft work best for back sleepers and some side sleepers. Instead of relying on gel infusions, the Casper Memory Foam Pillow boosts airflow by perforating all three layers of foam and cutting air channels into the outside layers. The pillow has a breathable jersey knit cover made of a polyester-spandex blend, with a 2-inch gusset. The cover is removable and machine-washable. Unlike many of its competitors, Casper extends its 100-night sleep trial to its bedding and pillows, not just its mattresses.

It’s also known as viscoelastic foam, a moniker that accurately describes the way the material softens and contours in response to heat and pressure, gradually regaining its shape once heat and pressure are lifted. Memory foam is popular in pillows because it molds to the head and neck, providing a supportive surface that can be shaped to the user’s liking. This close-conforming material is unrivaled in its ability to alleviate pressure points. In this section, we’ll delve deeper into the pros and cons of memory foam and cover some of the most important aspects to look for when purchasing a memory foam pillow. What to Consider When Purchasing a Memory Foam Pillow The market is flooded with manufacturers who tinker with their memory foam to give it different qualities, such as using gel infusions to achieve better temperature neutrality. Some proprietary foams do succeed in their aims, but it can be very difficult to tell before trying the pillow out for yourself. Before you shop for a memory foam pillow, it’s important to understand the basics behind how they are constructed and what kind of options exist. Focusing on the following factors can help you see past the marketing hype to choose the best memory foam pillow for you. Memory foam pillows come in two types: one-piece and shredded. One-piece memory foam pillows are made of a single solid block of memory foam. This can either be in the shape of a traditional pillow, or in a tailored shape that mimics the curves of the head and neck. One-piece memory foam pillows conform very closely and have a slower response to pressure. They tend to go back to their original shape when you take your head off the pillow. Shredded memory foam pillows can either contain 100 percent memory foam or be blended with other materials such as latex or fiberfill. The advantage of using shredded memory foam is that users can add or remove filling to adjust the pillow loft to their liking, as well as customize the shape of the pillow to a certain extent. Shredded memory foam generally allows more room for airflow compared to a one-piece memory foam pillow. Here are some other factors to consider when buying your pillow: Your sleeping position is one of the main things that will dictate what type of pillow you should choose. One-piece memory foam pillows tend to be higher and better-suited to side sleepers, while stomach sleepers often prefer shredded memory foam pillows with most of the loft taken out. Memory foam pillows have an average price-point, with shredded memory foam pillows running at a slightly higher price-point than one-piece pillows. Some companies offer free pillows along with a mattress purchase, which can be a good option if the pillow matches your needs. Memory foam offers exceptional pressure relief, and both one-piece and shredded memory foam pillows conform closely to prevent pressure build-up in the head and neck. Because of its conforming abilities, memory foam is often used in specialized orthopedic pillows to help people with neck pain or other problems. Memory foam eventually loses its ability to bounce back to its original shape, which in turn affects its pressure-relieving capabilities. A pillow with higher-quality foam will last longer than an inferior one – a difference that is often reflected in the price. The ideal firmness level for your pillow depends on your sleep position, body type, and personal preference. Most memory foam pillows are medium soft to medium. One-piece memory foam pillows offer just one firmness level, but many shredded memory foam pillows allow users to customize the firmness level somewhat by adding or removing the filling. A pillow with the right loft, or height, will help keep your head and back aligned and prevent neck pain. One-piece memory foam pillows usually have a medium to high loft, while shredded memory foam pillows can have the loft adjusted to virtually any height. While not as customizable as shredded memory foam pillows, some solid-foam pillows have removable inserts for users to choose between two or more settings. Heat build-up in your pillow can make you uncomfortably warm and disrupt your sleep. Memory foam is notorious for heat retention, although today’s manufacturers use many techniques to get around this. Of course, shredded memory foam naturally allows more room for airflow, so all other things being equal, a shredded pillow will sleep cooler than a one-piece pillow. What Are the Pros and Cons of a Memory Foam Pillow? Memory foam has unsurpassed contouring abilities that make it one of the best pillow materials for pressure relief and support. However, memory foam has some drawbacks as well, the most notable of which is its tendency to trap heat. The material also has a slow response to pressure that some people like, but that can be restrictive when changing positions. Close-conforming pressure relief: Memory foam softens in response to heat and pressure, molding itself to fit the shape of your body and prevent pressure build-up. Support: Because memory foam remains fairly firm in the areas that are not immediately adjacent to the head and neck, the material forms a supportive cradle that promotes healthy spinal alignment and reduces neck pain and headaches. Price: While not the cheapest pillows out there, memory foam pillows offer a luxurious feel at a much lower price than natural or organic products. Noise: Memory foam absorbs movement and produces little to no noise, minimizing sleep disruptions to you and your partner. Customizability: The viscous nature of memory foam means manufacturers can mold it into virtually any shape, which is why it’s commonly used in orthopedic pillows. Availability: Memory foam pillows are a popular product that you’re sure to find virtually anywhere pillows are sold. Hypoallergenic: Memory foam mattresses are generally resistant to dust mites and bacteria, making them a good choice for allergy sufferers as long as you’re not allergic to the foam itself. Sleeps hot: Memory foam is notorious for trapping heat, leading many sleepers to find it uncomfortably warm. Slow response to pressure: Memory foam is not very responsive, which may lead some people to feel “stuck” when trying to shift sleeping positions. Durability: Memory foam pillows usually last three years at most, since the material eventually loses its ability to regain its shape. Off-gassing: Like all synthetic foams, memory foam releases some initial “off-gassing” odors when it is first unpacked. Here are some of the major ways in which one-piece and shredded memory foam pillows differ: Both one-piece and shredded memory foam pillows can be customized to a certain extent. Shredded memory foam pillows frequently have a zipper that allows users to open the pillow and add or remove filling to adjust the loft. It’s a good idea to hang on to the filling in case you ever want to make the pillow higher. Although not customizable to the same extent as shredded memory foam pillows, one-piece pillows sometimes have removable inserts that give users several choices of loft. Shredded memory foam pillows have a significant advantage over one-piece pillows in that they can be molded to virtually any shape. This is highly convenient for people who like to use their pillow in different positions. Memory foam pillows weigh more than fiberfill or down equivalents, with many weighing 5 pounds or more. By design, shredded memory foam weighs less than the equivalent volume in solid foam. Shredded memory foam pillows generally maintain a more neutral temperature, since the design leaves room for airflow between the pieces. That said, some one-piece memory foam pillows feature ventilation or cut-out channels that allow air to flow freely and carry heat away. One-piece memory foam pillows are low-maintenance and don’t need to be fluffed. Shredded memory foam pillows can become lumpy if not regularly fluffed, but the advantage of shredded pillows is that many of them can be machine-washed. One-piece memory foam pillows are usually firmer and keep their shape better than shredded memory foam pillows, which may need to be readjusted every time you switch positions. Memory foam pillows are generally best suited to side sleepers, back sleepers, and anyone who suffers from neck pain or who prefers a pillow with a higher loft. While your will partly depend on your body type and personal preference, here are some general considerations for choosing a memory foam pillow according to sleep position and other factors. Many sleepers successfully reduce neck pain with a cervical memory foam pillow. Thanks to the moldability of memory foam, these pillows are able to cradle the natural curves of the neck and head to provide the needed support. need a higher, firmer pillow that supports the head and eases pressure on the shoulders. Memory foam pillows fit the bill, especially firmer one-piece memory foam pillows, and can often be further customized according to individual preferences. Back sleepers do best with a moderately lofty pillow that keeps the spine at a natural angle. The ability of memory foam to compress in response to pressure makes it a perfect candidate for many , as it allows the sleeper’s head to sink in just far enough to be at a comfortable height with respect to the body. Most memory foam pillows are quite high, and shredded memory foam pillows can be stuffed to the brim to make them even higher. This makes them ideal for people who like a pillow with a high loft. Memory foam is known for trapping heat, so it’s not the best choice for those who naturally run warm or who live in hot climates. If you sleep hot but you like the feel of memory foam, there is the option of using a shredded memory foam pillow or a one-piece pillow with ventilation or cut-out air channels. These techniques help improve airflow and reduce heat retention. Some pillows have and draw heat away from the sleeper using gel, graphite, or copper infusions, or keep a cool-to-the-touch surface with phase-change material. usually require a flatter pillow to keep the neck aligned with the spine, so although some shredded memory foam pillows are suitable, this isn’t generally the best material. That said, stomach sleepers use their pillows in different ways, so the ideal loft will change from person to person. Some stomach sleepers may be satisfied with the adjustability of a shredded memory foam pillow that allows them to form a pillow with a lower loft. Memory foam pillows typically come in the following sizes, although the exact dimensions may vary by manufacturer: Standard (20” x 26”): Standard pillows are the smallest and most commonly used size, and can be used on any size bed. Super Standard (20” x 28”): Super standard pillows are relatively rare. With a length halfway between the size of a standard and a queen pillow, they may be suitable for any mattress up to a queen. Queen (20” x 30”): Queen size pillows are commonly available as an alternative to standard pillows. They give a little more playing room to people who move around during the night, or who like to sleep with their pillow folded or scrunched up. King (20” x 36”): In addition to providing plenty of room while sleeping, king pillows are also one of the most comfortable sizes to lean against while sitting up in bed. Most online bedding companies offer king size pillows. Body Pillow (54” x 20” OR 48” x 20”): Body pillows are long and skinny, meant to be cuddled against. These are most frequently used by side sleepers, who tuck them between the legs to keep the hips aligned and reduce strain on the lumbar area. Body pillows may also be an invaluable sleep tool for pregnant women, and can be a comfortable backrest when sitting. Frequently Asked Questions About Memory Foam Pillows Decent memory foam pillows usually start around $50 and can go up to $150 or more. Prices vary depending on size, foam density and quality, cooling features, and other features such as special shapes or high-quality covers. Compared with other types of pillows, memory foam pillows are similar to latex pillows, cheaper than buckwheat or down pillows, and more expensive than polyester or down alternative pillows. Some shredded memory foam pillows can be machine-washed, but most one-piece pillows are spot-clean only. It’s important to note that memory foam can get moldy if not allowed to dry properly, so go easy on the spot-cleaning and try not to get the pillow too wet. Many memory foam pillows have removable covers that can be machine-washed. Memory foam pillows are commonly available online as well as in many brick-and-mortar stores. The average lifespan of a memory foam pillow is 2-3 years, which is longer than down alternative pillows but not as long as down, latex, or buckwheat pillows. Even the best memory foam pillows eventually lose their integrity. One-piece pillows start to develop permanent indentations, and shredded memory foam pillows become lumpy. While higher-density memory foam tends to be more durable than lower-density memory foam, the downside is that higher-density memory foam also traps more heat. Regular cleaning and fluffing can help prolong the longevity of a shredded memory foam pillow. Since one-piece pillows are prone to developing mildew when wet, the best you can do is keep them as clean as possible and wash the pillowcase regularly. Most shredded memory foam pillows offer users the opportunity to adjust the loft by adding or removing filler, and some one-piece pillows have removable inserts. Shredded memory foam pillows can also be scrunched into different shapes if the shape of the cover allows. Many pillows come with gussets meant to help keep the contents in place. Yes, memory foam is a synthetic material that will release some off-gassing odors. These are the result of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) being released into the air. While they are considered harmless, people who are sensitive to smell may find off-gassing odors bothersome, especially with the material so close to their face. If this sounds like you, try to look for a pillow that’s certified by a third-party organization for low emissions, and let the pillow air out in a well-ventilated space for a few days or even a few weeks before using it.

86c44ee6-33d1-4b6d-8586-bfacdae63a7d,"What is Military Neck & How To Fix It Naturally With Best Pillows and Exercises? The military neck is a specific medical condition that relates directly to the health of your cervical spine. In this specialized condition, straightening of the cervical curve or spine has been seen which sometimes results in pain and other disorders. Doctors suggest that a normal curve of a cervical spine is of ‘C shaped’ which is termed as lordosis. However, the normal curve as seen in an X-ray report can be distorted based on several factors. ‘Loss of Lordosis’, is one specific condition that is related to diseases like degeneration of disc or chronic arthritis. As per the observations from senior orthopedic surgeons, it has been noted that the ‘loss of lordosis’ (commonly referred to as a military neck) is caused as a result of a total alteration of the spine structure in a human body. This is generally seen in people who work with poor neck posture for a prolonged period of time. Sometimes, the extreme condition is also referred to as cervical kyphosis or hypolordosis as it relates to the straightening of the cervical curve or military neck. Studies reveal that this is the main cause of getting the military neck. It is important to know that, the military neck is not a painful condition in all cases. While in many cases straightened neck is seen without pain (or very little pain); it can cause immense discomfort as well as pain to many other patients. The problem is generally caused due to pulling of the spine and muscle spasms like in case of whiplash injury or accident. It is therefore important to note that for patients suffering from military neck, the cervical spine should be restored in its original condition as soon as possible so that they do not suffer from chronic painful conditions. Various treatment options are available due to advances in medical sciences and doctors have jotted down the necessary impact of such a correction procedure. These remain to be: Allowing and helping the patient to take care of normal chores as such Bringing back life and support for patients who had been immobile for quite some years in the past Symptoms of the military neck (also called as straight neck syndrome) can be multifarious. Patients suffering from such chronic conditions can experience severe pain concerning the upper and lower back area. Some patients can even complain of nausea and terrible headache/migraines as well. While some patients experience severe military neck pain, it has been observed that such a typical risky medical condition can also give rise to severe immobility. In order to take care of or fix such chronic military neck symptoms, it is recommended to go through an X-Ray. X-Ray plate-based image can help you to diagnose the intensity of the curve and your doctor can actually plan out for a structured process of treatment after careful examination. Orthopedic surgeons when consulted, agree to the fact that a military neck X-ray is just a preliminary step to ensure that you suffer from the military neck. If the treatment plan is not planned carefully at a time, this severe condition can give rise to the following symptoms: Based on such symptoms, it is clear that a structured process of treatment is essentially required for patients suffering from the loss of curve problems in the cervical region. Although for few patients military neck surgery may be suggested, it is a fact that for many others surgery might not be the only option available. Correction of the cervical spine in favor of a surgery based treatment is only suggested when the doctor feels it is the last option. Otherwise, proper diagnosis along with initial treatment stages can help cure the problem to a much extent. Below are some of the best treatment methods that can be utilized to naturally help you fix the straight neck problem. Tips for Correcting The Straight Neck Problem Naturally It is quite evident that correcting the cervical curve for a patient suffering from a military neck, can be a boon in disguise as it helps the patient to return to a normal course of life.

During the initial phase, a military neck treatment can be therapy based. This can include as well. Giving physical support to the patient is very much required so that it can enable the patient to participate in normal activities as well. Studies reveal that military neck exercises are of great help for patients and can act as one of the best ways to correct the curve fast in the most natural way. Therefore in order to get immediate relief from military neck or straight neck condition a patient should get in touch with the physical therapist. A physiotherapist can guide you all the way to perform best cervical spine exercises that can heal your no-curve in the neck or straight neck problem fast without any risk. A medical neck traction device in addition to military neck wrap is also sometimes recommended in order to get temporary relief from straight neck conditions. Using a reliable under your neck can well support the entire back including the cervical spine and discs to get it restored naturally in a few weeks. Remember that, medical traction devices or support systems are particularly useful in promoting the normal cervical curve. Although it allows a perfect biomechanical advantage to the patients, for certain patient’s condition remains to be precarious and they need to undergo spinal surgery if required. Maintaining a good posture, especially while working on a computer is most essential so that you can help heal your straight neck curve faster. Wearing is especially recommended for this.

It has been noted that such surgeries are very often complicated which can give rise to other side effects. It is desirable for the patient to gather useful information about the doctor performing the surgery on the person. Credentials of the doctor are mostly very important in order to give the patient a better quality of life in the long run. Pre-surgery or post-surgery care regime needs to be incorporated in case the patients expect a speedy recovery. In most of the cases, doctors suggest regular physio-therapies of the neck as well as shoulder based exercises. Walking on the flat ground needs to be followed after a few days, the surgery is performed on the patient to get faster recovery. A qualified orthopedic or neurosurgeon can be of much help as they can take care of an immediate treatment regime as well. However, treating the military neck problem by using the best military neck pillow is one of the best treatment procedure which should not be ruled out. Studies showed that the military neck is many times caused due to an unsupportive pillow that does not provide proper support to the cervical region while sleeping or resting. Using at a time or using a too high pillow for your neck can also result in straight neck syndrome. Buying the best supportive pillow for your military neck is, therefore, an ultimate solution to cure the problem effectively. This will not only help in treating the condition naturally but also ensure that you sleep comfortably at the end of the day without affecting your cervical region further. A military neck pillow can be classified into two main types: These types of pillow are generally meant for providing support and comfort to the military neck with pain. The pain caused can be due to bad posture problems or muscle spasms. Neck rolls for the straight neck can be used 2-3 times in a day to provide relaxation to the stiffed neck muscles and straight curvature of the cervical spine.

These pillows are well designed for your neck region to provide additional support to your neck and shoulders while sleeping. Not only it promotes good sleeping posture but also it ensures that your head is properly aligned by preventing it from moving too far or forward from the pillow. Based on the severity of military neck pain, a specific type of pillow should be chosen to ensure that you get maximum relief from inflammation and spasms. People with very little pain can buy an inflatable pillow that comes with both the qualities.

In order to protect your back, good posture is important while sleeping. Little scientific research exists on which mattress is best for back pain or for maintaining a healthy back. The mattress that's right for you lets you wake up feeling rested and free of pain or soreness. Unless you have a condition that may require a certain type of mattress, you should choose a mattress that provides support for the natural curves of your spine and is comfortable. The best mattress is one that allows you to sleep soundly and without pain. If you sleep with a partner, you should have enough space to move into a comfortable sleeping position. Consider replacing your mattress every 9 to 10 years. If you have a back problem, ask your healthcare provider or physical therapist to recommend the type of mattress that would be best for you.

If you sleep on your side, a firm pillow between your knees will prevent your upper leg from pulling your spine out of alignment and reduce stress on your hips and lower back. Pull your knees up slightly toward your chest. The pillow for your head should keep your spine straight. A rolled towel or small pillow under your waist may also help support your spine. Insert pillows into gaps between your body and the mattress. When turning in bed, remember not to twist or bend at the waist but to move your entire body as one unit. Keep your belly pulled in and tightened, and bend your knees toward the chest when you roll. Keep your ears, shoulders, and hips aligned when turning as well as when sleeping.  ",119,best pillow neck pain,-0.044894956052303314,32

Learn more about our process In the past few years there’s been a huge increase in different types of pillows on the market, giving consumers more options than the classic down or fiber pillow. One increasingly popular pillow style is the latex pillow. Often made from shredded latex, these pillows offer the plushness of a traditional polyfill or down alternative pillow with additional firmness and flexibility. To help choose the perfect latex pillow, read on to learn more about our picks for the best options in several categories. We’ve completed intensive product research to determine our ratings, and have some helpful advice to help you compare options. Best Overall– Best Value – Best for Neck Pain – Best for Side Sleepers – Best Adjustable – Every type of sleeper, including those who switch positions during the night Those who want an eco-friendly, hypoallergenic pillow Use this SleepFoundation.org link for the most current discount on the PlushBeds pillows The Plushbeds Organic Shredded Latex Pillow is a great all-around option in terms of construction, comfort, and performance. Made from 100% Global Organic Latex Standard (GOLS) certified shredded Dunlop latex, it offers the feeling of a traditional down or polyfill pillow without the flattening, bunching, or clumping common with those fills. Wrapped in 100% organic cotton, the PlushBeds shredded latex pillow is made without any harsh chemicals or dyes, making it an ideal choice when you want a healthy place to rest your head. Latex is naturally resistant to allergens, including mold dust mites, and bacteria. Although the pillow cannot be machine washed, it can be spot cleaned. The filling is easily fluffed and adjusted to your comfort. The shredded latex bounces back quickly when compressed, helping the pillow stay plump and fluffy. If you tend to sleep warm, the pillow will stay fairly cool, thanks to the breathability of the latex and the added airflow created by the shredded material. Although you’re likely to find the Organic Shredded Latex Pillow supportive regardless of your sleeping position, side and back sleepers tend to find latex pillows most comfortable in general. Stomach sleepers may find the pillow too firm for their liking; a pillow with a lower loft that allows for better spinal alignment may be a better choice. The Organic Shredded Latex Pillow does not allow you to remove filling for customization, either. PlushBeds offers the Organic Shredded Latex Pillow in three sizes: standard, queen, and king. The company does not accept returns on pillows, but does offer a three-year warranty on materials and workmanship and free shipping on all orders. Combination sleepers who change positions throughout the night One-piece offers a close-conforming feel and solid support Use this SleepFoundation.org link for the most current discount on the Brooklyn Bedding pillows Brooklyn Bedding’s Talalay Latex Pillow is made from eco-friendly Talalay latex formed into a medium-firm, solid pillow form. Unlike our other recommendations, which are primarily shredded latex, the Brooklyn Bedding pillow’s filling is one piece. This produces a more dense, close-conforming feel. Brooklyn Bedding also offers the pillow in both high and low loft options. The high option is best suited for side sleepers, while the low option is more comfortable for stomach sleepers. Back sleepers can choose either loft based on their preferences. The Talalay latex pillow is somewhat firm and very responsive and supportive. It’s covered in a removable and machine washable organic cotton cover that’s soft and stays cool. Even though the pillow conforms closely to your head and neck while you sleep, the breathable latex remains fairly cool and you won’t overheat. As with other latex pillows, the Brooklyn Bedding pillow is hypoallergenic. Brooklyn Bedding offers free shipping and returns to the lower 48 states. You can try your new pillow for 30 nights, and return or exchange it within 30 days if you are not happy with it. The pillow also comes with a 3-year warranty covering defects in materials and workmanship. Shoppers concerned about the environment and choosing ethically sourced products Premium materials – ethically sourced Talalay latex and organic New Zealand wool Excellent shape retention for a supportive, consistent feel Use this SleepFoundation.org link for the most current discount on the Birch pillows Filled with GREENGUARD Gold and GOLS certified latex and free from any synthetic dyes or harsh chemicals, the Birch Organic Pillow also uses ethically and sustainably sourced organic wool from New Zealand. The latex and wool filling is covered with soft, 100% organic cotton. In addition to offering a sustainable, cruelty-free option, the Birch Organic Pillow also sleeps cool and comfortable. Wool naturally helps maintain temperature neutrality, wicking away moisture while ensuring adequate airflow. The cotton cover is also designed to support airflow, preventing overheating while you sleep. The filling is supportive, without being too firm, and supports all sleep positions. That said, back sleepers tend to especially appreciate the Birch pillow’s firmness, which supports proper spinal alignment. The Birch Organic Pillow retains its shape over time, thanks in large part to the wool used in the filling. Wool is naturally durable and retains its shape longer than many other fibers. The latex is more responsive and bouncy than other foams, but some of the firmest of the options we tested. The pillow is not adjustable, and should not be machine-washed. It can, however, be fluffed in the dryer. Birch Organic Pillows are made in the U.S, and ship free. They come with a 100-night risk-free sleep trial and a one-year limited warranty. The company offers queen and king size pillows. Use this SleepFoundation.org link for the most current discount on the PureTree pillows People who experience frequent neck pain often need pillows that provide a balance of cushioning and support. For this reason, latex pillows tend to be popular among these sleepers. The PureTree Shredded Latex Pillow is particularly helpful in this regard because its loft is adjustable. The fill consists of shredded Talalay latex, and owners can add or remove as much as they need to achieve their desired thickness – which may change on a night-to-night basis, depending on the severity of their neck pain. The latex has received a GOLS organic certification, and the cover is produced from GOTS-certified organic cotton. In addition to being sustainably sourced, these materials are exceptionally breathable and well-suited to people who normally sleep hot. Natural latex is also resistant to allergens and bacteria. The pillow can be washed and dried in your household machines for quick and easy care. Standard/queen and king sizes are available, and pillow weights range from 4.5 to 5.5 pounds. This pillow’s sticker price is very reasonable compared to other natural latex pillows – especially those with adjustable loft. PureTree offers a sleep trial that allows you to test out the pillow for 30 nights, as well as a three-year warranty against structural defects.  Shredded 100% American Talalay latex and down alternative People who prefer pillows with adjustable thickness Talalay latex and down-alternative combine for a plush, supportive feel Use this SleepFoundation.org link for the most current discount on the Saatva pillows The Saatva Pillow is a good option for people who experience aches, pains, and pressure points in their neck. The pillow is constructed with a core of shredded, American-made Talalay latex encased in a smaller, removable pillow padded with soft microdenier fibers. These fibers have the same consistency as down or down alternative to provide extra cushioning. You can keep the smaller pillow intact for maximum thickness if you sleep on your back, or remove it to decrease the loft for more comfortable side sleeping. After testing the pillow, we found it was best suited to sleepers who weigh 230 pounds or less. The outer cover is composed of breathable organic cotton that helps the pillow sleep cool. Latex is a naturally durable material, so the pillow should perform for several years without drastically flattening. Although the pillow has a medium soft feel, the shredded fill does not conform as closely as memory foam and you may notice some responsiveness when you lay down your head – a common characteristic of Talalay latex. The latex is washed five times during the production process, reducing the potential for triggering latex allergy symptoms. Compared to other latex pillows, the Saatva Pillow is very reasonably priced, and all customers in the contiguous U.S. qualify for free ground shipping. Saatva accepts gently used returns within 45 days of the original purchase, though the company asks that you wash the pillow before shipping it. The pillow is also backed by a one-year warranty.  85% shredded Talalay latex, 15% poly-silk fibers Side sleepers who need extra neck and shoulder support Shoppers who want to customize the loft and firmness of their pillows Anyone who wants a latex pillow with a traditional pillow feeling Fill can be added or removed to adjust loft and firmness Use this SleepFoundation.org link for the most current discount on the Sleep Artisan pillows More people prefer to sleep on their sides than any other position, and the Sleep Artisan Luxury Side Sleep Pillow is designed specifically for them. The pillow is curved along one side, creating a “nook” that allows for targeted support for the shoulders and neck. Back sleepers also find the Luxury Side Sleeper pillow comfortable, as it provides support for spinal alignment, helping you wake up refreshed and pain-free. The Sleep Artisan Luxury Side Sleeper pillow is filled with shredded Talalay latex and a proprietary silk polyfill blend. This creates a feel that’s similar to a down or down alternative pillow, while still maintaining the support and responsiveness you expect from latex. The pillow arrives with a  6-inch loft that compresses when you rest your head, but the side can be unzipped to remove filling to your preference. This pillow is only available in one size, 28 inches by 17 inches. The filling is naturally hypoallergenic, antimicrobial, and resistant to dust mites. You can remove all of the filling and wash the cover, but the filling should not be washed. The California-made pillows do not ship free, but come with a 60-day trial period and a 3-year warranty covering defects in materials and workmanship. Both versions are optimized for airflow and cooling Use this SleepFoundation.org link for the most current discount on the Latex for Less pillows The Latex for Less Pillow offers more versatility than many of its competitors. You can choose from two different fills. The shredded latex pillow offers a lofty, fluffy feel and gentle cushioning, while the solid latex pillow conforms to the head and neck for more responsive support and pressure relief. Both versions of the pillow are encased in covers made of breathable cotton. The shredded latex also regulates temperature well, as does the solid latex thanks to small ventilation holes that promote steady airflow. As a result, the pillow is an excellent choice for people who tend to sleep hot. The pillow is available in three sizes. Standard models have a 4-inch loft, while queen and king size pillows have 5-inch lofts. These thickness options are best suited to side and back sleepers because they provide ample cushioning without interfering with spinal alignment. The latex is GOLS-certified, so the pillow should also appeal to shoppers who prefer to purchase sustainably made products. The cover cannot be removed, so spot cleaning is needed if stains occur. Compared to other latex pillows, this model’s sticker price is quite reasonable, and there is no cost difference between the two fill options. Shipping is free for all orders in the contiguous U.S. Latex for Less does not offer a sleep trial for the pillow, and returns are not accepted. People who prefer pillows with adjustable loft levels Shredded latex and microfiber fill balances plushness and support Use this SleepFoundation.org link for the most current discount on the Nest Bedding pillows The Easy Breather Natural Pillow from Nest Bedding is another top pick that offers adjustable loft. The fill consists of blended shredded latex and down alternative microfibers that make the pillow feel very plush and fluffy. To change the thickness, simply unzip the cover and add or remove as much fill as you need to achieve the desired loft. This level of customization allows most people to rest comfortably on the pillow regardless of their preferred sleep position. The cover is derived from a stretchy, breathable blend of organic cotton and polyester backing. The fill also retains minimal body heat for added cooling and temperature control, making the pillow well-suited to hot sleepers. Nest Bedding offers the pillow in standard, queen, and king sizes. A fourth option, the “side sleeper” size, is contoured to create optimal head and neck support for people who primarily use this position. Depending on which size you choose, the pillow weighs between 4.5 to 6.5 pounds. The Easy Breather Natural Pillow has a relatively low sticker price compared to similarly constructed models. Shipping is also free for orders in the contiguous U.S. If you are not satisfied with the pillow, you may return it or exchange it for another model within 30 days of placing the original order. When you hear the word “latex,” the idea of a natural, biodegradable product may not be the first thing that comes to mind. When you’re talking about bedding products like mattresses and pillows, though, natural latex is not only possible, but also common and, for many people, preferable to other products made with synthetic chemicals. The term “organic latex” refers to a natural substance made from the sap of rubber trees. The sap is collected and processed into a material that’s then poured into a mold. Manufacturers use one of to create latex foams: Talalay or Dunlop. Talalay latex is processed tree sap that’s poured partway into a mold. The rest of the mold is filled with air, creating a more uniform density for the finished product. With Dunlop latex, the liquid latex filled the entire mold, resulting in a finished product with different densities. Because organic latex is entirely plant-based, it’s naturally hypoallergenic and free of toxic ingredients. It’s also a very breathable substance, so it won’t retain heat like foam or other materials, and naturally resistant to mold, mites, and bacteria. It’s a popular choice for pillow temperature neutrality, breathability, and moderate conforming. It also doesn’t flatten like fiber-filled pillows, increasing their durability. Much like choosing a mattress, choosing your pillow is a personal decision influenced by your preferred sleep position and body type and size. Even the type of mattress you sleep on matters: Some mattresses (like memory foam) are designed so you sink into the surface, for example, meaning an especially thick pillow will leave your head at an uncomfortable angle and cause pain. However, the biggest factor in most pillow buying decisions is the filling. What’s inside your pillow makes a big difference in terms of support and pressure relief, as well as how well the pillow holds up to regular use. Polyester or polyfill, , , and feather pillows are common, but latex pillows are becoming increasingly popular. The latex may be shredded or formed, but it offers some advantages over other materials, including better temperature neutrality and resistance to allergens. If you’re considering a latex pillow, read on to learn more about what you should look for in a quality pillow. Purchasing a latex pillow can be confusing, as many terms are used interchangeably, and may be misleading. For example, “latex” itself often conjures images of synthetic, plastic-like materials. Synthetic latex does exist, but the latex used in most bedding is a natural, organic  product made without chemicals. Look for products that specifically note that the latex is made without additives. Other terms that may muddy the waters when shopping for a latex pillow are rubber — which is generally the same as latex, as they are both derived from rubber trees — and Dunlop or Talalay. These terms refer to how the latex is processed, and make little difference to the feel of your pillow. These are just some of the terms to watch for when purchasing a new pillow. When you’re comparing your options, keep the following in mind as well to make the best decision. : Loft refers to the height or thickness of a pillow, and is directly related to its comfort. Most pillows have either low (less than three inches thick), medium (3-5 inches thick), or high (more than five inches) loft. Although an exceptionally low or high loft isn’t comfortable, keep in mind that the loft will change when you lie on the pillow and compress the filling. Generally speaking, back sleepers prefer medium loft, are more comfortable on a high loft pillow, and stomach sleepers are best suited by a low or medium loft pillow. A supportive pillow is important to keeping your spine aligned and allowing your neck and shoulders to relax. For example, side sleepers have more space between their neck and the mattress, so a pillow should fill that space to ensure adequate support and prevent pain. Firmer pillows are generally more supportive. Pillows are usually rated on a scale from soft to firm. A pillow’s firmness is closely related to how well it maintains its shape and stays fluffy. The firmer the pillow, the less likely it is to flatten. Flat pillows are more uncomfortable and won’t provide as much support. : A close-conforming will relieve pressure on your neck and shoulders, allowing you to relax and get restful sleep — and keeps you from waking up in pain. Softer pillows generally provide more pressure relief. The most common shape for a pillow is a rectangle, but some pillows are designed for specific sleeping positions; for instance, they may have a curved side for back and side sleepers. Natural and organic pillows tend to have a higher price point than traditional latex pillows. Expect to pay upwards of $150 for a quality organic pillow. The higher the quality materials used in your pillow, the longer it will last. Choose the highest quality fill that fits your budget, as that will determine the comfort, support, and longevity of your pillow. If you change positions throughout the night, or use your pillow for support while reading or watching TV, or simply like to mold your pillow into your preferred shape, you want to choose a moldable pillow that can be adjusted to your preference. A pillow that uses a form provides extra support, but can’t be easily molded for comfort. If you have a tendency to sleep hot, your so you can stay cool and comfortable. Some materials, like memory foam, retain body heat and can cause sleep disruptions. Although the best pillow for your individual needs depends largely on personal preference, there are some distinct pros and cons to latex pillows. On the plus side, they offer exceptional pressure relief and support for side and , and stay cooler than other options. On the downside, they can be expensive, and aren’t always flexible enough to conform comfortably. Moderately conforming and responsive  latex provides an above average level of support for your head and ensures proper alignment and pressure relief. Latex is naturally breathable, and a shredded latex filling allows increased airflow so you sleep cool. Latex is a natural material, and is naturally hypoallergenic. It’s also naturally resistant to mold, dust mites, and microbial resistant. Some latex pillows don’t mold to your head, or it can be challenging to form them into a comfortable position. Latex pillows are more expensive than other types of pillows. Not all latex pillows offer removable covers, making cleaning a challenge. Generally speaking, side and back sleepers tend to be most comfortable on latex pillows. Latex provides extra firmness and support where it’s needed most, around the neck and shoulders. Side Sleepers: Side sleepers have a gap between their neck and the mattress, which needs extra support to ensure proper alignment. Without it, they are likely to wake up with . A latex pillow helps fill that space and offers that support and firmness. Sleepers Who Have Neck Pain: Again, adequate support for the shoulders, neck, and head ensures proper alignment and reduces the likelihood of pain and discomfort from sleeping with the neck bent at an angle. Back Sleepers: Back sleepers are also well suited to latex pillows. Maintaining proper alignment is important to preventing pain and discomfort in this position, and a softer latex pillow with a medium loft generally fits the bill. The exception to this are lighter sleepers who weigh less than 130 pounds. Lightweight individuals do not compress their mattress as much, and need higher loft pillows to ensure proper alignment. Hot Sleepers: Latex is ideal if you tend to sleep hot, as it’s a naturally cool material. Shredded latex in particular allows for plenty of airflow to keep you cool all night. Those With Latex Allergies: If you have a latex allergy, a pillow filled with the material is not a good choice, regardless of the cover or other materials used. Stomach Sleepers: Stomach sleepers may not even need a pillow, and might find that they are more comfortable without it. Latex pillows are often too firm and too thick to be comfortable for stomach sleepers. The most common pillows you’ll find on the market today are one of the following five sizes: Standard, Super Standard, Queen, King, or Body Pillow. The best size for you depends on a number of fasters, including your personal preference, the size of your bed, and your sleeping style. Standard pillows are the most common pillow size, and also the smallest and usually the least expensive. They also tend to have the most options for pillow cases, as well, especially when bundled with twin, full, and queen sheet sets. Super standard pillows are slightly wider, giving you just a little more space when you find standard pillows too small. Queen pillows are typically a full four inches wider than a standard pillow, giving you plenty of extra room. They are ideal when you have a tendency to shift positions throughout the night, or roll over a lot. King pillows are even larger, providing plenty of space for “active” sleepers. King pillows are also a good choice if you like to sit up in bed to read or watch television, as their size provides additional support. Finally, body pillows are designed for people who like to cradle their pillow, or who want extra support while sleeping. These pillows are especially popular among pregnant women, as they easily support the weight of their growing belly and help keep hips in alignment when placed between the knees. Body Pillow: 54” x 20” or 48” x 20” (most common sizes) Typical latex pillows are more expensive than those with fiber filling. Prices range significantly, from $40 for a basic model to $200 for a luxury organic pillow.  The quality of the materials used in the manufacture of the pillow are the biggest determinant of price, but the size and loft can also influence your cost. Latex pillows are typically not machine washable, especially when they are made with a combination of wool and latex. Depending on your specific pillow, you may be able to fluff it in the dryer on low or no heat and some pillows are made with a removable, washable cover. Simply remove the cover and wash according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Otherwise, latex pillows can usually be spot cleaned. It’s best to cover your pillow with a washable cover or case to keep it clean. Never allow your latex pillow to remain in direct sunlight for too long, as that can cause the material to break down. Latex pillows can be purchased anywhere you buy bedding, including retailers like Amazon, Target, or Bed, Bath & Beyond. Some luxury or organic options are only available online, directly from the manufacturer. A well-maintained latex pillow can last about 5-10 years. However, individual factors like how you clean the pillow, your sleeping habits, and the durability of the pillow itself can influence its longevity. All pillows should be replaced every few years, or if it starts to lose its shape, you are waking up with pain, you change your sleeping position, or if you notice changes in your skin (like acne). Some latex pillows are designed to be adjustable. These typically have a zippered covered that allows you to remove or add fill as needed to adjust the pillow to your preference. Because latex is made without harsh chemicals, latex pillows typically don’t have the same issues with off-gassing or odors as foam pillows. Some people notice a slight rubber smell when they first open a new pillow, but any odors will subside quickly and should not be offensive in any way.

313475c5-7fff-4068-a8c9-eaf8c858a90b,"Dr. Anthony Komaroff, Harvard Medical School In Association with Harvard Health Publications  » Will a special pillow or other sleep adjustments improve my neck pain? - Ask Doctor K Will a special pillow or other sleep adjustments improve my neck pain? I tend to have a lot of neck pain. Would it help to buy a special pillow, or make any other adjustments to the way I sleep? As with so many things, an ounce of prevention may be worth a pound of cure when it comes to neck pain. And how you sleep at night can make a big difference. Two sleeping positions are easiest on the neck: on your side or on your back. Whichever you prefer, choose an appropriate pillow. If you sleep on your back, choose a rounded pillow to support the natural curve of your neck, with a flatter pillow cushioning your head. You can achieve this by tucking a small neck roll into the pillowcase of a flatter, softer pillow. Or, use a special pillow that has a built-in neck support with an indentation for the head to rest in. I’ve used a “memory foam” pillow like that for many years, and it has greatly reduced the number of times I’ve awakened with neck pain. If you sleep on your side, use a pillow that is higher under your neck than your head. This will help to keep your spine straight. Sleeping on your stomach is tough on your spine because the back is arched and your neck turned to the side. Preferred sleeping positions are often set early in life and can be tough to change. (Not to mention that we often wake up in a different position from the one we used to fall asleep.) Still, it’s worth trying to start the night sleeping on your back or side in a well-supported, healthy position. Feather pillows tend to easily conform to the shape of the neck. They will collapse over time, however, and should be replaced every year or so. Memory foam pillows come both in traditional shapes, and in what I call a double hump shape to support your neck — the kind I use. Both types of pillows generally do a better job of conforming to the contour of your head and neck than older types of pillows (such as feather pillows or regular foam pillows). Manufacturers of memory foam pillows claim they help promote proper spinal alignment. Avoid using too high or stiff a pillow. This keeps the neck flexed overnight and can result in morning pain and stiffness. But we sleep not only in beds. Sometimes we sleep while riding in a plane, train or car. And who hasn’t dozed off while watching TV? In any of these circumstances, a horseshoe-shaped pillow can help. It will support your neck and prevent your head from dropping to one side if you doze. If the pillow is too large behind the neck, however, it will force your head forward. We spend a third of our lives asleep in bed. Plus, the evidence is growing that good quality sleep each night brings many health benefits. For those reasons, I think it is worth investing in beds and pillows that give you the best quality sleep — including protecting your neck.

When looking for a comfortable bed pillow, the choices can be a bit overwhelming. There are the different sizes, the different materials and now you can find pillows that are made for different types of sleepers. How do you begin to make the decision? Is a really necessary if you sleep on your side? If you do not have any issues with sleeping, then the best advice is to just go with your preferences, just as you would when choosing a mattress. If you are looking for a soft pillow that your head sinks into, look at feather pillows such as goose down or a down alternative. Find a firmer pillow if that is what you prefer. But if you experience neck pain, snore a lot or have trouble sleeping in general, it may make sense to take a closer look at what type of pillow you’ve been sleeping on and look for a better solution. Since the majority of people sleep on their side most of the time, there as been an increase in the number of pillows marketed as a side sleeper pillow. The most important features to look for in a good pillow for side sleepers are support and proper alignment. The one feature that many of the pillows that get the best reviews have in common is that they are made of memory foam. This material will conform to your head and neck to give you a firm but cushioned support. Some of the side sleeper pillows have unique designs that may take a few nights to get used to, but customers claim they solve sleep issues such as neck pain, achy shoulders, and back pain and have reduced snoring. While you can read product descriptions that make all types of claims, sometimes the best information comes from customer reviews of people who have similar sleep problems to yours. After reading many reviews, the best advice appears to be that you should find a pillow that has a good balance of support and comfort. And although the choices in bed pillows appear to be overwhelming, just replacing an old pillow with a new one may do wonders for your comfort and ability to get a good night’s sleep.

The 8 Best Custom Pillows To Help You Get A Better Night’s Sleep, According To Experts There was a point in my life when I thought I had . I would get into bed, usually too late to begin with, and just lay there for hours waiting for sleep to come. What would actually end up coming was constant tossing, turning, and re-adjusting as I searched for that sweet spot. You know the one: that elusive position where the pillow is cool enough that your head isn’t sweating, and your leg is perhaps wrapped around your sheets ever-so-perfectly. Eventually I realized that one of the main culprits of my sleeplessness (besides a nightly flashback of anything awkward I’d ever said or done) was the lack of head support I was getting from my pillow. I always had my arm hooked underneath the pillow, propping my head up for increased support. I’d soon wake up with an arm that was tingling from almost falling asleep itself, or, if I was finally able to snooze through the night, an extremely sore shoulder and neck, and an arm that needed to be shaken awake. I reached my breaking point when my bad sleep started to affect what time I was able to wake up, and I wasn’t getting into work at the time I wanted—snoozing my alarm to get just 5 more minutes (multiplied by 10). I thought about investing in a or trendy pillow when I first heard about custom pillows. Custom pillows are made specifically for you, based on things like how hot you run at night, your body measurements and age, and the amount of support you like to get while sleeping. An initial sweep of custom pillows on the Internet made me hesitant as they can definitely be an investment, though they range from as low as $30 to over $300. I sought some expert advice to see if investing in an expensive custom pillow was really worth it. “Pillows can definitely improve your quality of sleep,” says , DPT, CSCS, an orthopedic specialist. “The most important factor to consider is the spine—pillows that allow for a neutral spine position are best for most people.” For people like me who are constantly looking for more support and wake up with stiffness, Dr. Rafael also says that a firm pillow is typically recommended for improved neck and spinal support. “New technical fabrics that help with temperature control are also very beneficial,” he says. This content is imported from {embed-name}. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site. Okay, this was enough to get me seriously interested. After some more digging, I decided to try two different kinds of custom pillows to see how much of a difference they could make in getting (and keeping) me asleep. The first one I tried was from . These pillows are a personal favorite of W. Chris Winter, MD, a sleep specialist and author of The Sleep Solution: Why Your Sleep Is Broken and How To Fix It. (Dr. Winter currently uses the from the Bedgear Storm Series.)“If soreness is an issue, sleeping in a supine position (on your back) is best,” says Dr. Winter. “Weight and temperature, the coolness of the fabric or pillowcase, can be things to consider as well. If you sleep with your arm under the pillow, the amount of weight you place on your pillow can be an issue.” Keeping his advice in mind, I made sure to specify to Bedgear that I required a pillow with plenty of support. I was excited to read on their website that they also build their pillows to balance your temperature, no matter how hot or cold you get, and that they offer four different pillow heights depending on your preference. They offered free exchange, so if you slept on the pillow for 100 nights and weren’t satisfied with the results they’d send you a new one. I ended up going with their M1X pillow series, which has firm foam and “moisture-wicking and air flow technologies to balance temperature,” according to the website. Waiting for my Bedgear pillow to arrive, I felt like a child waiting for Christmas presents. It didn’t take long for it to come in the mail, and I unboxed it with the enthusiasm of an influencer opening a FabFitFun box for the camera. It definitely felt firmer than my current pillow, but not hard at all, which was relieving as I remembered a bamboo memory foam pillow that I had ordered a few years back that promised more support, only to end up feeling like I was sleeping on a literal rock. This pillow was not that way. My first impression was that I loved the crescent shape of the Bedgear pillow, which is designed to fit snugly under your neck, though it made it a little tricky when it came to tucking it into a pillowcase. I was dealing with some congestion the first night i tried it, and I actually found myself coughing less frequently which was an absolute blessing. I felt like I had more elevated support (no more arm tucking!). After a few nights on it I brought my old pillows out onto the curb and trashed them. Next to arrive was the . Launched in March 2018, Pluto is definitely the most talked about custom pillow at the moment, perhaps for its approachable price and on-point minimalist branding. I’m a sucker for good packaging, so when my Pluto arrived I was excited enough to snap a picture of it. Opening the box, I noticed it was shaped like a normal rectangular pillow, unlike my Bedgear one. I was relieved that it would fit into my normal pillowcase, but slightly disappointed as I had already grown accustomed to the contoured neck support of the crescent. The first night sleeping on my Pluto went well—it provided good support and was a little squishier than my Bedgear. At the end of the day (pun intended), I found myself reaching for the Bedgear pillow to ease my coughing, as the neck contour and higher level of firmness kept me feeling supported through the night. With that said, I think the Pluto Pillow is the perfect starter pillow and I’m sure I’ll find myself sleeping on it once my allergies subside. Both brands also offer the same 100-day satisfaction guarantee, so if you end up wanting more or less support you send it back for improvements. Both brands kept me cool through the night, my eyes closed, and my arm from being pinned under my head—a small change that has made a huge impact on my life. If you’re eager to dive into your own custom pillow journey, here are six additional options with great ratings to consider. A pillow from Noble is definitely a splurge, but if you have a serious issue that’s keeping you from a good night’s sleep it might be worth investing in. Noble pillows have built-in adjustability for possible future changes to your sleep preferences, and are ideal for anyone with issues such as shoulder injuries, arthritis, or breathing problems. Sleep Number’s Pillow[ology] is a truly customizable experience that puts the power into your hands to choose which combo of outer shell, inner core, and protector are best for you. The downside is that you’ll have to do a bit more research and soul searching on what kind of pillow might suit you best, but the reward is a totally affordable option that could seriously help the way you sleep. Eight Sleep’s customizable pillow works a little different from the rest. Their Ultimate Pillow comes filled with three removable layers that allows you to play around with whatever combination works best for you, two of which are insertable cushions and one that’s a memory foam layer. For $200, you get a set of two pillows. The customizable pillows from Headleveler come in four different sizes, which is helpful if you have a larger bed requiring king-sized pillows. I also love that they have a travel pillow option if you’re on the go. Their pillows even take into consideration things like neck length, which they say is essential to getting your best sleep. Now available to online, they used to only be available to order through a healthcare professional, and have been around for a long time—used first by chiropractic, orthopedic, and physiotherapeutic professional markets in the late 70’s. The Pancake Pillow puts the power in your hands every night to choose the amount of support and elevation you need with its six layers of down alternative microfiber fill. It’s the perfect pillow to provide for guests as well if you aren’t sure what kind of support they need while sleeping. This high-tech pillow uses 100 percent certified organic materials and claims to be carbon neutral and totally compostable, as well as allergy and mite proof. They custom make your pillow for you based on your measurements using what they call their NCI (Neck Compression Index), which tells them the exact amount of pressure you put on your pillow. These pillows are definitely a splurge, but perfect for anyone looking for total precision when it comes to their custom pillow.

Are Different Pillows For 'Side Sleepers' and 'Back Sleepers' B.S.? What you need to know before hitting up Bed Bath & Beyond. Just like there's no perfect pair of running shoes for everyone, there is no one perfect pillow. But with so many choices—each promising different solutions to ensure a restful night’s sleep—the process of picking a damn pillow from the pile at Bed Bath & Beyond can seem daunting to say the least.  There are pillows for , pillows for , pillows to , pillows that are also , pillows that , and that will cradle you ""from head to toe,"" just to name a few options. RELATED: 'I TRIED 6 ALARM CLOCKS TO CURE MY SNOOZING PROBLEM—HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED' Part of the problem with evaluating pillows that promise to be life-changing is that there is not a lot of conclusive research, says , M.D., a clinical assistant professor in the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at NYU Hospital for Joint Diseases and a spokesman for the American Association of Orthopaedic Surgeons.  Some small studies have suggested that pillow height could affect comfort. One  by a University in Hong Kong found that pillow height affects spine alignment, another from the University of São Paulo  that pillow height influences the amount of neck muscle activity, and a third by a pediatric hospital in Toronto  found that a neck support pillow was beneficial to people with chronic neck pain. “What the studies are showing is that everyone has different angles and different heights, so finding the right pillow does make a difference,” says , M.D., a member of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine and co-director of the Sleep Medicine and Research Center at St. Luke's Hospital in St. Louis. But more research is needed, she says. RELATED: 6 TRICKS THAT WILL HELP YOU BECOME ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO CAN FALL ASLEEP IN MINUTES It’s also helpful to take into account medical conditions, according to , M.D., an assistant professor of neurology with McGovern Medical School at UTHealth Houston and medical director of the Neurological Sleep Medicine Center at TIRR Memorial Hermann. For example, raising the head slightly during sleep is often recommended by doctors to help reduce snoring and sleep apnea. Sleeping on the has been found to calm acid reflux, according to a study from Jefferson Medical College, so pillows that encourage side sleeping on the left might provide some relief. Other pillows claim to help allergies or reduce neck pain. But there are other factors that could affect these conditions, too. “I don’t know that a pillow alone will help you sleep better,” Tallavajhula says. In fact, there are so many variables involved in sleep, that’s it hard to recommend a particular pillow, Razi says. “I personally have not found any good data to suggest what’s good for what,” he said. “It’s all marketing.” In other words, you don’t necessarily need to spend a lot of money to find a pillow that works for you. And specifics, such as size, filling, and shape, are often best left to personal preference. (See how bone broth can be good for your health with the Women's Health ) So what should you do the next time you’re shopping for a pillow? Ask yourself what you’re looking for in a pillow—especially if you want it to solve a specific problem, Tallavajhula says. “If you specifically have a medical condition you think you can help by using a pillow, you probably want to speak to a physician first,” she says. Next, know your sleep style. We want our pillows to support our head and neck, so sleep position can make a difference, Paruthi said. RELATED: EXACTLY HOW TO CHOOSE THE RIGHT MATTRESS FOR YOUR BEDROOM ISSUES “For people who are side-sleepers, they may need a pillow that’s taller to support their head and neck, whereas people who are back sleepers may need a shorter height to support that head and neck area,” she says.  So make sure to try the pillow before you buy it, Razi says. That can make buying a pillow online tricky—unless you’ve already tried the pillow and know you like it. While some stores offer lie down areas for a few minutes, Razi suggests lying there for at least 15 to 20 minutes to see which one helps you relax more. See if your local pillow store has a trial you can do before you purchase, too.  It’s often best to take the pillow home and test it out before you decide for sure that it’s the one for you, he says. ​ ​ But overall, don't place too much weight on your pillow when it comes to sleep. Things including your mattress, your environment, and your state of mind can also play a role in sleep. Ensuring a quiet space, a dark room, and a cool temperature can help. And most importantly, give yourself enough time to get the good sleep you need. Adults should get at least seven hours of sleep a night, Paruthi says. “Getting enough sleep is one of the three pillars of a healthy lifestyle,” she says. “We should make sure we’re having good diet, regular exercise, but also getting enough sleep.” There may not be enough data to say for sure which pillow wins the day. But given that we spend about a third of our lives asleep, it’s worth taking the time to find the one that works best for each of us, Paruthi says.   This content is created and maintained by a third party, and imported onto this page to help users provide their email addresses.

So, sorry not sorry to my one true love, Target, but let’s be real: as a belly and side sleeper, your pillows keep me tossing, turning and tweaking my neck all night… and not in a fun way. This year, when it was time to toss out my generic, aged Room Essential pillows from college, I opted to try the . (I’m already a big fan of my mattress — the podcast ads get me every single time.) When I first laid my head down on the Casper Pillow, it was It feels like I’m lying in a plush, luxurious hotel bed while my head is completely supported. Ten months, zero strained neck muscles, and fewer and further between sleepy mornings in the office later, this prized piece of bedroom real estate has become my ultimate key to beauty sleep. It keeps my neck nice and happy and stays cool even during the dog days of summer, all while staying fabulously fluffy (#goals). It’s my perfect “all-in-one” solution to my sleep sorrows. This belly-to-side sleeper, who was initially skeptical that a pillow could multitask with my snoozing preferences, was proven wrong. Because no matter which way I twist and turn during the night, the pillow shifted with me. After the first few months of this new sleeping arrangement, I woke up in completely different slumbering shape, with the pillow still in full, fluffy form. I was even more shocked when I sat up every morning with complete, pain-free neck mobility. Finally, I could go to the office feeling rested — and without cringing every time I turned my head. On the rare occasion that the pillow gets a tad chunky (nowhere near the clumpiness level of a Room Essential pillow), I’ve followed Casper’s instructions on how to properly fluff the pillow. In just a minute or two, the pillow is completely back to its fluffed out form. Who knew I was fluffing pillows wrong the last 26 years, and who knew that I’d take such joy in becoming a newly minted fluff buff? Is this adulthood? Bonus: No matter the temperature of my AC-less apartment, this pillow always stayed cool, eliminating the need to continually wake up and flip flop my pillow to the cool side. Hello, uninterrupted sleep! Who knew I’d become obsessed with a pillow, but trust me, nothing feels better than waking up feeling fresh and pain-free.

Hence take your own time to know about the kind of mattress that fulfills all your body needs, before you invest your money into it. Some of the major points to be kept in mind while choosing the right kind of mattress is: First of all calm down and tell yourself that – there is no need of buying a mattress in a rush at all. Rather invest some time online and browse through various options you have available. If required talk to your doctor or a physical therapist (especially if you are suffering from any health condition). They can recommend the best type of mattress as per your condition and body needs. The needs of each of your family members may differ. Few may like firm and a few others may like soft ones. Based on that, the mattress you need also differs. This simply means you have to get separate mattresses that suit each of your family member’s needs. If this is not feasible financially then try to understand the right mattress that suits most of your family members well. Also take note of your sleeping positions, body height, weight, etc. while choosing the right one. As a mattress that is good for side sleepers may not be suitable for stomach sleepers or back sleepers, it is always good for you to check about the mattress which supports your unique sleeping style. Different mattresses with different materials may work differently on your body type. It’s the inner coils or inner springs that matters most and not the outer fabric. Be sure that you check about the right material you need for your body. Also check about the padding, thickness, and depth of the mattress which plays an important role in providing you the best comfort while sleeping. Today TV, newspapers and the internet are loaded with lots of advertisements, each of them trying to sell you varieties of mattresses. This makes choosing the best mattress for your body type, a very confusing task. Many companies often claim that the mattress they manufacture is the best one and has good orthopedic qualities. Do not believe them as such! Instead, you can collect feedback or reviews from your closed ones including your friends, relatives, and consumers who had already tried the particular brand. Go for the mattress that has already proved its efficiency well. If possible take a “test drive” for sure. Check with the salesperson, whether they allow you to lie on the mattress for a minimum of 15 minutes. The good way for testing is to lie down on the mattress in a position you usually sleep on your bed. The best you can replicate your exact sleeping posture, the higher will be your chances of getting the best mattress for your body. Make sure that you do not get up before 15-20 minutes of the trial. 6- Keep away prejudices and don’t judge by price: It is a common belief that if a mattress costs more than others, it is the best one to buy. Believe me, this is completely a wrong assumption! Be away from all such prejudices! Never judge the quality of a mattress based on its cost. As every one of us has different bodily needs, the bestselling or a top-priced mattress can be a good option for others while it may not be a good option for you. Remember that purchasing a mattress can be an expensive investment for you. It should be therefore done with care. Consider buying the best product from a reliable most store which you trust the most. For instance, if you are planning to get one online, you can which is one of the most trustworthy stores present online. Here you can get the top brand with a proper warranty, delivery options, customer care, after-sales services, etc. A good branded mattress will offer you a minimum of a 10-year full replacement warranty. Be sure to check it out before you buy it. Gone is the time when adjustable beds are only meant for hospital rooms. These are today getting much more popular in the home all across the globe. Their ever-rising popularity is due to the fact that they are good for promoting the night’s rest for sufferers of back pain. If you really desire to get a sound pain free sleep all night these sleep-promoting bed frames can be a solution for you. The most advantageous feature of these all adjustable beds is it’s head and foot articulation.

This helps to reduce pressure points all over the body, including sensitive areas such as the shoulders and hips. That said, the pillow you choose may make you feel less comfortable while sleeping in this position. Side sleepers generally need thicker pillows to fill the space beneath their head and neck. Pillows that are too thin do not provide enough cushioning, while excessively thick pillows can interfere with spinal alignment and cause added pressure points to develop. Our best pillow for side sleeper picks are listed below. These seven selections are based on experiences from verified owners and customers, along with our own product research and testing. Further down, we’ll take a closer look at how pillows affect side sleeping and offer a few tips for choosing a pillow based on thickness, material composition, price, and other factors. Most Comfortable – Best Down –  Shredded memory foam and kapok tree fiber blend People who prefer a soft and conforming pillow feel High-loft design encourages spinal alignment for side sleepers Use this SleepFoundation.org link for the most current discount on the Layla pillows Our best side sleeper pillow picks begin with the Layla Pillow, which is filled with shredded memory foam and fibers from the kapok tree. The memory foam is infused with copper, which has natural cooling properties and prevents the pillow from retaining too much body heat. Copper has antimicrobial properties, as well. The kapok fibers are exceptionally soft with a down-like consistency, giving the pillow a very plush surface feel as the memory foam conforms to the head and neck. The Layla Pillow measures 4 inches thick, making it a medium loft model. Medium loft pillows can be ideal for side sleepers because they provide excellent cushioning for the head and neck without sinking too deeply or feeling too tall.

This ensures more overall support without sacrificing the plush feel of natural down. The Brooklinen Down Pillow has a higher loft.

The down and feathers also sleep exceptionally cool, and the cover is made from smooth cotton sateen. You won’t need to worry about this pillow absorbing and trapping body heat like those made of foam. The fill materials have also earned the pillow certification from the Down Association of Canada (where it is produced), giving you extra peace of mind as a consumer. Down pillows can be very pricey, but the Brooklinen model is fairly affordable at less than $120 in any size.

Tempur-Pedic also offers free ground shipping within the contiguous U.S. and reasonable rates for Alaska and Hawaii, as well as a five-year warranty that protects the pillow against defects.  Cross-cut gel-infused memory foam and microfiber Sleepers looking for a pillow with adjustable loft People who like the cushioning and contouring of shredded memory foam Use this SleepFoundation.org link for the most current discount on the Coop Home Goods pillows Our next pick is the Coop Home Goods Eden, a pillow that offers adjustable loft. The interior contains a proprietary blend of shredded, gel-infused memory foam and polyester microfibers. You can unzip the pillow and add or remove fill to adjust the pillow’s overall thickness. Coop Home Goods also sells the fill in bulk for owners who need to replenish their supply. This customizable design makes the Eden suitable for a wide range of sleepers, including most side sleepers. If you find that your preferred loft varies from night to night, you’ll be able to change your pillow’s thickness and feel very easily. The pillow also sleeps fairly cool. This can be attributed to decent airflow throughout the pillow, since shredded foam promotes more circulation than solid foam. The pillow’s cover, made of a polyester and rayon from bamboo blend, is also quite breathable. Conveniently, the entire pillow can be washed and dried in any household machine. The fill is contained in a removable liner, which should be separated from the cover before laundering. Priced at less than $90 in any size, the Eden is quite inexpensive compared to other pillows of this caliber. Coop Home Goods also offers bundling packages, which allow you to purchase two pillows and two mattress protectors at a discounted rate. A half-pound of fill for the Eden is available for $18.99.

Those who enjoy the insulating feel of authentic down Gusseted design improves shape retention and support Use this SleepFoundation.org link for the most current discount on the Parachute pillows Finding a comfortable down pillow can be tricky for side sleepers. Down is an exceptionally soft fill material that tends to sink under the weight of your head and neck, and side sleepers may not receive enough loft and experience added aches and pains. The Down Side Sleeper Pillow remedies this problem thanks to a 3.5-inch gusset along all four sides, which helps the pillow maintain a fuller shape and thicker loft despite its plush feel. The fill mostly consists of premium white European down, with some feathers for extra stability. The fill power is 750, so the pillow feels quite dense and tightly packed. This ensures side sleepers with neck pain won’t feel added discomfort. The shell is composed of silky-soft cotton sateen, and thick piping reinforces the sides to prevent fill from escaping and extend the pillow’s lifespan. When the pillow needs to be cleaned, Parachute recommends either dry cleaning or machine washing on a delicate cycle with mild liquid detergent. Standard and king sizes are available. This model is reasonably priced compared to other pillows with authentic down and feathers, and Parachute offers free shipping to all 50 states and Army/Air Post Office locations. You may return the pillow within 60 days of your original order, even if you’ve slept on it or cleaned it, and you’ll also receive a three-year warranty.  Single, aerated piece of ‘LOFT-X’ polyfoam People who prefer the contouring feel of adaptive polyfoam Single-piece construction provides consistent support Use this SleepFoundation.org link for the most current discount on the Bear pillows Single-piece foam pillows can be optimal for side sleepers because they cushion and conform to the head and neck, but typically provide stronger support than shredded foam or other fill materials. However, there is a common complaint: the foam absorbs and traps body heat to the point of sleeping uncomfortably warm. The Bear Pillow, our next pick, offers much better temperature control than many of its similarly constructed counterparts. The foam is aerated to maximize airflow. The cover is also made from blended fabric that is cool to the touch, and each end is equipped with mesh caps for added breathability and air circulation. The Bear Pillow has a medium feel. The foam conforms closely and your head may sink a bit, but the pillow provides enough reinforcement to keep your spine aligned. This ensures more stability and less pressure for side sleepers. Thanks to its single-piece construction, the pillow rarely needs to be fluffed or shaken to maintain a full shape. The cover can be removed and washed in a machine to keep the pillow hygienic. Bear recommends spot-cleaning the interior foam if it becomes dirty or stained. The Bear Pillow has a mid-range sticker price for a single-piece polyfoam pillow. Bear offers free shipping throughout the contiguous U.S., and those who live in Alaska and Hawaii pay a flat shipping rate of $100. Bear backs the pillow with a 100-night sleep trial, along with a two-year warranty. The return is at your own expense.  $130-150 – Standard/Queen $150-170 – King  Side 1: Medium Soft Side 2: Medium Firm People whose pillow firmness preferences fluctuate from night to night Reversible design with a distinct feel on each side Close-conforming feel relieves pressure on the neck Use this SleepFoundation.org link for the most current discount on the Amerisleep pillows Most side sleepers need extra pillow loft to provide adequate cushioning for the shoulders, neck, and head, which in turn ensures better spinal alignment and less pressure.

How does one obtain this? By buying from the source itself. The Pacific Coast Hotel Touch of Down Pillow is found in luxury hotels worldwide, and for good reason.

The Touch of Down Pillow contains an inner pillow filled with Resilia feathers, which are fluffier and more resilient than most feathers.

To ensure a hypo-allergenic pillow, both the feathers and down have been washed at least 8 times. The pillow cover is made from 230-thread count 100 percent cotton, which is soft, breathable, and resilient. Pacific Coast offers a 30 night sleep trial for the Touch of Down, so you can try before you commit. They also offer a 3-year limited warranty. Side sleeping is the most popular sleeping position among U.S. adults. This position has a few advantages over back or stomach sleeping. For one, side sleeping can minimize snoring because it keeps your airway open; back sleepers snore more often because the tongue falls back into the throat, creating an obstruction for the airway. Side sleeping can be beneficial to people with sleep apnea and/or acid reflux for the same reason. If you’re a pregnant woman, chances are you’ll feel more comfortable on your side than you will in other sleep positions; a bolster pillow for the legs or knees can also provide comfort for pregnant sleepers. Side sleeping can also align the spine and reduce discomfort in the shoulders, hips, and other areas where pressure points tend to develop. However, this is contingent on a mattress and pillow that offer enough support to align your head and neck, shoulders, lower back, and hips. Keep reading to learn about special pillow considerations for side sleepers, and how to choose a pillow model based on your body type and personal preferences. The best pillow for side sleepers will provide adequate cushioning to support the head and neck. Pillows that either sink too deeply or feel too thick can interfere with spinal alignment, and neck and shoulder aches typically occur as a result. In determining the right pillow, you should look at several factors, including loft, firmness level, and material composition. In the next few sections, we’ll discuss how side sleepers can find a pillow that will work for them. What to Consider When Purchasing a Pillow for Side Sleepers In your research for a pillow that is compatible with side sleeping, you’ll no doubt come across pillow manufacturers who claim their products are suitable for all sleep positions, or that their pillows’ construction and materials offer universal comfort for all sleepers regardless of body type or personal preference. These marketing claims are misleading. Each pillow is uniquely designed to provide a distinct feel. Given the demands of different sleep positions, any pillow you select will be better suited to some sleepers and less so for others. Rather than using marketing jargon to guide your pillow search, focus on the following attributes instead. Loft, or thickness, is arguably the most important consideration for side sleeping. Most side sleepers need medium to high loft pillows that provide enough cushioning for the head and neck without sinking too low. If your thickness preferences vary by night, you may be a good candidate for a pillow with adjustable loft levels. Support refers to how well the pillow maintains an even surface for your head and neck. Spinal alignment is imperative for side sleepers, so you’ll want a pillow that doesn’t sink too much or elevate your head excessively. Pillows with solid foam or latex cores typically provide the best support. A pillow that feels too soft will probably sink too much beneath your head, leading to alignment issues and the potential for added pressure. If the pillow is too firm, then you may experience discomfort around the neck and shoulders. Pillows with mid-level firmness are usually the best choice for side sleepers because they provide a balance of contouring and support. Many side sleepers feel pressure in the shoulders and hips because their mattress is not supportive enough. Likewise, pressure points may develop around the neck and shoulders if the side sleeper’s pillow does not keep these areas aligned with the spine. For this reason, side sleepers generally need a supportive pillow that also contours to the body. Some fill materials compress over time, causing the pillow to flatten and feel less comfortable. You’ll need to regularly fluff these pillows in order to give them a full shape. Other materials, such as solid foam and latex, maintain their shape with less effort. The price of a pillow largely depends on its material components. Pillows made of polyfoam, down alternative, and feathers typically have the lowest price-points, while those with memory foam, latex, down, and buckwheat hulls tend to be the most expensive models. That said, you should be able to find a high-quality pillow with any fill material for $150 or less in a queen size. The materials used to construct a pillow’s cover and inner components can impact a wide range of qualities, including durability, temperature regulation, and shape retention. You may pay more for a pillow with higher-quality components, but you can also count on more longevity and stronger performance from many of these models. The best pillow fill materials for side sleepers include memory foam, latex, buckwheat hulls, and other components that offer sufficient support without feeling too firm. However, how comfortable or uncomfortable a pillow feels for side sleeping depends on a few other factors. The most common pillow materials are outlined below. Memory foam, or viscoelastic polyurethane foam, is engineered to feel softer when it comes into contact with body heat. This creates deep conforming for your head and neck when lying on a memory foam pillow, which can help to align the spine and reduce pressure in different areas. Buckwheat pillows are filled with hulls, the hard outer casings of buckwheat kernels. These pillows have a very firm and supportive feel; many liken them to hard bean bags. Most buckwheat pillows can be adjusted for loft by adding or removing kernels, and they promote good airflow, too. Feathers are the outer plumage of ducks and geese. While light and airy, feathers have a coarser and denser feel than down. As a result, side sleepers won’t sink as deeply into the pillow. Feather pillows also sleep very cool and offer good durability compared to other pillow types. Latex is a substance derived from the sappy extract of rubber trees. When molded into a foam, latex contours to the body like foam but feels much more responsive. Side sleepers may find a latex pillow more supportive since the material does not sink as deeply. Down is the soft inner plumage of ducks and geese. The material is exceptionally airy and light, and it also promotes insulation. To ensure adequate support for sleepers, many down pillows are reinforced with feathers in their outer chambers. This prevents side sleepers from sinking excessively. Polyfoam molds to the body but it also feels more responsive. You won’t feel the same deep contour as memory foam, but the material is more adaptive than latex. Polyfoam has a tendency to sleep hot, but many manufacturers ventilate or aerate their foam to minimize body heat absorption. The most popular pillow sizes are standard, queen, and king. However, some manufacturers offer additional sizes to accommodate sleepers with different preferences. The following table lists facts and figures for the five most common pillow sizes. For the dimensions column, please note these are average measurements that will differ from brand to brand. Standard pillows are the most compact options. They are also the least expensive on average. You can get by with one standard pillow on a twin, twin XL, or full size mattress, but you’ll want at least two for larger mattress sizes. The super standard is slightly longer than the standard, so this size may be a good option if you find standards too small. However, you may have to do some digging – most major pillow manufacturers don’t offer this size. A queen size pillow is 4 inches longer than the standard, providing more room for people who toss and turn or use the entire surface of their pillow. King size pillows offer the most length among common pillow sizes. This ensures ample room for anyone who tosses and turns, or otherwise moves around in bed. However, king size pillows tend to be the most expensive models. A body pillow is at least 4 feet wide, and should be ideal for anyone who enjoys snuggling with a pillow. Pregnant women often find body pillows comfortable when placed between their knees. In addition to selecting a supportive pillow that promotes spinal alignment, side sleepers can use the following strategies for sleeping comfortably each night. The best mattress for side sleepers will provide ample cushioning to the shoulders and hips in order to align the spine and alleviate pressure in different areas. Most side sleepers prefer mattresses with softer feels that conform closely to the body without sinking too much beneath their heavier areas. A pillow between the knees can also improve spinal alignment and reduce pressure in the lower back and hips. Pillows filled with down/feathers, shredded foam, and other moldable materials tend to be most comfortable. You may also find more comfort and pressure relief by placing the pillow beneath your legs. A topper is a single layer of cushioning material placed on top of your mattress. Toppers can measure up to 4 inches thick, so using one can make your mattress feel significantly softer or firmer. For side sleepers, the right topper can mean closer conforming, better spinal alignment, and less pressure. Frequently Asked Questions About Pillows for Side Sleepers Roughly 30 to 40 percent of adults primarily sleep on their side, making it the most common sleep position. Its popularity can be attributed to a few factors. Side sleeping helps maintain an open airway to reduce snoring episodes, as well as symptoms from conditions such as acid reflux and sleep apnea. Side sleepers also tend to feel less pressure due to the natural alignment of their spine, though they’ll need a mattress and pillow that support the body without sinking too much. What is the most important consideration when choosing a pillow for side sleepers? Loft and materials are two of the most important factors for choosing a pillow as a side sleeper. A thicker pillow is usually ideal because side sleepers need to cushion their neck and shoulders, and the fill should be strong enough to resist deep compression and maintain a supportive surface for the pillow. The general consensus among side sleepers is that down alternative pillows are the least comfortable. Down alternative – a polyester material that mimics the softness and airiness of natural down – is not very supportive, so side sleepers may sink a bit too deeply into their pillow. Most down alternative pillows have a fairly low loft, as well. They may not provide enough thickness to keep the head and neck aligned with the spine. Pillows that are suitable for side sleepers are available from a wide range of sellers. If you purchase a pillow directly from the manufacturer, you’ll probably qualify for a longer sleep trial, product bundling packages, and other incentives. If you purchase your pillow from a third-party retailer instead, then there’s a chance your sticker price won’t be as high. You may also choose to buy your pillow at a brick-and-mortar store, where you’ll get the opportunity to test out different models firsthand.

Learn more about our process More people prefer side sleeping than any other sleep position. When you lie that provides adequate cushioning and support, sleeping on one side can promote even spinal alignment. This helps to reduce pressure points all over the body, including sensitive areas such as the shoulders and hips. That said, the pillow you choose may make you feel less comfortable while sleeping in this position. Side sleepers generally need thicker pillows to fill the space beneath their head and neck. Pillows that are too thin do not provide enough cushioning, while excessively thick pillows can interfere with spinal alignment and cause added pressure points to develop. Our best pillow for side sleeper picks are listed below. These seven selections are based on experiences from verified owners and customers, along with our own product research and testing. Further down, we’ll take a closer look at how pillows affect side sleeping and offer a few tips for choosing a pillow based on thickness, material composition, price, and other factors. Most Comfortable – Best Down –  Shredded memory foam and kapok tree fiber blend People who prefer a soft and conforming pillow feel High-loft design encourages spinal alignment for side sleepers Use this SleepFoundation.org link for the most current discount on the Layla pillows Our best side sleeper pillow picks begin with the Layla Pillow, which is filled with shredded memory foam and fibers from the kapok tree. The memory foam is infused with copper, which has natural cooling properties and prevents the pillow from retaining too much body heat. Copper has antimicrobial properties, as well. The kapok fibers are exceptionally soft with a down-like consistency, giving the pillow a very plush surface feel as the memory foam conforms to the head and neck. The Layla Pillow measures 4 inches thick, making it a medium loft model. Medium loft pillows can be ideal for side sleepers because they provide excellent cushioning for the head and neck without sinking too deeply or feeling too tall. For many, this results in even spinal alignment. The Layla Pillow is highly moldable and snuggly, as well, making it a good option for people who prefer cuddling with a pillow while they sleep. The pillow can also serve as a comfortable bolster for side sleepers beneath the legs or between the knees. At $99 in a queen size, the Layla Pillow has a mid-range price-point compared to other shredded memory foam pillows. Shipping is free for those who live in the contiguous U.S. If you reside in Alaska or Hawaii, you’ll only pay a $20 fee for your delivery. The pillow is backed by a 120-night sleep trial and a five-year warranty. People who prefer the plush, airy feel of a down/feather pillow Dense feather core improves support, while maintaining the plush feel of down Use this SleepFoundation.org link for the most current discount on the Brooklinen pillows Down – which refers to the soft inner plumage of geese and ducks – is a popular pillow material due to its naturally soft and airy texture. Unfortunately, many down pillows sink quite deeply and do not offer enough support for side sleepers. Our next pick, the Brooklinen Down Pillow, is a notable exception. This pillow is available in three firmness levels. The mid-level and firm feels have a chambered design with softer down at the surface and denser feathers making up the core. This ensures more overall support without sacrificing the plush feel of natural down. The Brooklinen Down Pillow has a higher loft. The down and feathers will compress a bit, but the pillow should provide enough cushioning for most side sleepers. The down and feathers also sleep exceptionally cool, and the cover is made from smooth cotton sateen. You won’t need to worry about this pillow absorbing and trapping body heat like those made of foam. The fill materials have also earned the pillow certification from the Down Association of Canada (where it is produced), giving you extra peace of mind as a consumer. Down pillows can be very pricey, but the Brooklinen model is fairly affordable at less than $120 in any size. Please note the plush pillows are a bit more expensive than the other two firmness levels. Brooklinen offers a 365-night sleep trial and a lifetime warranty for the pillow, both of which are exceptionally long.

The pillow has a medium firmness feel, built from its combination of latex and polyester fiber fill.

The organic cotton, latex, and polyester all help the pillow resist the buildup of common allergens as well. The Side-Sleeper Pillow has a medium- to high-loft that is well-suited to the needs of side sleepers. The loft can be adjusted by adding or removing fill, with additional bags of fill available for a small charge. Adjusting the pillow’s loft will also affect its firmness, allowing it to adapt to a variety of different sleepers. The Eli & Elm pillow ships free to the contiguous U.S. The pillow is backed by a 45-day return period as well as a 5-year warranty. Contoured shape relieves pressure on the head and neck Durable construction with excellent shape retention Use this SleepFoundation.org link for the most current discount on the Tempur-Pedic pillows Many pillows are comfortable for side sleepers, but a select few are specifically designed for people who experience aches, pains, and pressure points around the head and neck.

In determining the right pillow, you should look at several factors, including loft, firmness level, and material composition. In the next few sections, we’ll discuss how side sleepers can find a pillow that will work for them. What to Consider When Purchasing a Pillow for Side Sleepers In your research for a pillow that is compatible with side sleeping, you’ll no doubt come across pillow manufacturers who claim their products are suitable for all sleep positions, or that their pillows’ construction and materials offer universal comfort for all sleepers regardless of body type or personal preference. These marketing claims are misleading. Each pillow is uniquely designed to provide a distinct feel. Given the demands of different sleep positions, any pillow you select will be better suited to some sleepers and less so for others. Rather than using marketing jargon to guide your pillow search, focus on the following attributes instead. Loft, or thickness, is arguably the most important consideration for side sleeping. Most side sleepers need medium to high loft pillows that provide enough cushioning for the head and neck without sinking too low. If your thickness preferences vary by night, you may be a good candidate for a pillow with adjustable loft levels. Support refers to how well the pillow maintains an even surface for your head and neck. Spinal alignment is imperative for side sleepers, so you’ll want a pillow that doesn’t sink too much or elevate your head excessively. Pillows with solid foam or latex cores typically provide the best support. A pillow that feels too soft will probably sink too much beneath your head, leading to alignment issues and the potential for added pressure. If the pillow is too firm, then you may experience discomfort around the neck and shoulders. Pillows with mid-level firmness are usually the best choice for side sleepers because they provide a balance of contouring and support. Many side sleepers feel pressure in the shoulders and hips because their mattress is not supportive enough. Likewise, pressure points may develop around the neck and shoulders if the side sleeper’s pillow does not keep these areas aligned with the spine. For this reason, side sleepers generally need a supportive pillow that also contours to the body. Some fill materials compress over time, causing the pillow to flatten and feel less comfortable. You’ll need to regularly fluff these pillows in order to give them a full shape. Other materials, such as solid foam and latex, maintain their shape with less effort. The price of a pillow largely depends on its material components. Pillows made of polyfoam, down alternative, and feathers typically have the lowest price-points, while those with memory foam, latex, down, and buckwheat hulls tend to be the most expensive models. That said, you should be able to find a high-quality pillow with any fill material for $150 or less in a queen size. The materials used to construct a pillow’s cover and inner components can impact a wide range of qualities, including durability, temperature regulation, and shape retention. You may pay more for a pillow with higher-quality components, but you can also count on more longevity and stronger performance from many of these models. The best pillow fill materials for side sleepers include memory foam, latex, buckwheat hulls, and other components that offer sufficient support without feeling too firm. However, how comfortable or uncomfortable a pillow feels for side sleeping depends on a few other factors. The most common pillow materials are outlined below. Memory foam, or viscoelastic polyurethane foam, is engineered to feel softer when it comes into contact with body heat. This creates deep conforming for your head and neck when lying on a memory foam pillow, which can help to align the spine and reduce pressure in different areas. Buckwheat pillows are filled with hulls, the hard outer casings of buckwheat kernels. These pillows have a very firm and supportive feel; many liken them to hard bean bags. Most buckwheat pillows can be adjusted for loft by adding or removing kernels, and they promote good airflow, too. Feathers are the outer plumage of ducks and geese. While light and airy, feathers have a coarser and denser feel than down. As a result, side sleepers won’t sink as deeply into the pillow. Feather pillows also sleep very cool and offer good durability compared to other pillow types. Latex is a substance derived from the sappy extract of rubber trees. When molded into a foam, latex contours to the body like foam but feels much more responsive. Side sleepers may find a latex pillow more supportive since the material does not sink as deeply. Down is the soft inner plumage of ducks and geese. The material is exceptionally airy and light, and it also promotes insulation. To ensure adequate support for sleepers, many down pillows are reinforced with feathers in their outer chambers. This prevents side sleepers from sinking excessively. Polyfoam molds to the body but it also feels more responsive. You won’t feel the same deep contour as memory foam, but the material is more adaptive than latex. Polyfoam has a tendency to sleep hot, but many manufacturers ventilate or aerate their foam to minimize body heat absorption. The most popular pillow sizes are standard, queen, and king. However, some manufacturers offer additional sizes to accommodate sleepers with different preferences. The following table lists facts and figures for the five most common pillow sizes. For the dimensions column, please note these are average measurements that will differ from brand to brand. Standard pillows are the most compact options. They are also the least expensive on average. You can get by with one standard pillow on a twin, twin XL, or full size mattress, but you’ll want at least two for larger mattress sizes. The super standard is slightly longer than the standard, so this size may be a good option if you find standards too small. However, you may have to do some digging – most major pillow manufacturers don’t offer this size. A queen size pillow is 4 inches longer than the standard, providing more room for people who toss and turn or use the entire surface of their pillow. King size pillows offer the most length among common pillow sizes. This ensures ample room for anyone who tosses and turns, or otherwise moves around in bed. However, king size pillows tend to be the most expensive models. A body pillow is at least 4 feet wide, and should be ideal for anyone who enjoys snuggling with a pillow. Pregnant women often find body pillows comfortable when placed between their knees. In addition to selecting a supportive pillow that promotes spinal alignment, side sleepers can use the following strategies for sleeping comfortably each night. The best mattress for side sleepers will provide ample cushioning to the shoulders and hips in order to align the spine and alleviate pressure in different areas. Most side sleepers prefer mattresses with softer feels that conform closely to the body without sinking too much beneath their heavier areas. A pillow between the knees can also improve spinal alignment and reduce pressure in the lower back and hips. Pillows filled with down/feathers, shredded foam, and other moldable materials tend to be most comfortable. You may also find more comfort and pressure relief by placing the pillow beneath your legs. A topper is a single layer of cushioning material placed on top of your mattress. Toppers can measure up to 4 inches thick, so using one can make your mattress feel significantly softer or firmer. For side sleepers, the right topper can mean closer conforming, better spinal alignment, and less pressure. Frequently Asked Questions About Pillows for Side Sleepers Roughly 30 to 40 percent of adults primarily sleep on their side, making it the most common sleep position. Its popularity can be attributed to a few factors. Side sleeping helps maintain an open airway to reduce snoring episodes, as well as symptoms from conditions such as acid reflux and sleep apnea. Side sleepers also tend to feel less pressure due to the natural alignment of their spine, though they’ll need a mattress and pillow that support the body without sinking too much. What is the most important consideration when choosing a pillow for side sleepers? Loft and materials are two of the most important factors for choosing a pillow as a side sleeper. A thicker pillow is usually ideal because side sleepers need to cushion their neck and shoulders, and the fill should be strong enough to resist deep compression and maintain a supportive surface for the pillow. The general consensus among side sleepers is that down alternative pillows are the least comfortable. Down alternative – a polyester material that mimics the softness and airiness of natural down – is not very supportive, so side sleepers may sink a bit too deeply into their pillow. Most down alternative pillows have a fairly low loft, as well. They may not provide enough thickness to keep the head and neck aligned with the spine. Pillows that are suitable for side sleepers are available from a wide range of sellers. If you purchase a pillow directly from the manufacturer, you’ll probably qualify for a longer sleep trial, product bundling packages, and other incentives. If you purchase your pillow from a third-party retailer instead, then there’s a chance your sticker price won’t be as high. You may also choose to buy your pillow at a brick-and-mortar store, where you’ll get the opportunity to test out different models firsthand.

Learn more about our process While most people sleep on their backs or side, an estimated of people sleep on their stomachs. Though this sleeping position is not common, it does have certain benefits. Some sleepers find they are less likely to snore when sleeping face down. Stomach sleeping may reduce the likelihood of obstructive sleep apnea, as it can help keep the airway clearer than back sleeping. Since stomach sleeping is less prevalent, many pillows are constructed with side and back sleeping in mind. The firmness and loft of a pillow can determine the angle of the head and neck, and whether or not the spine is kept in alignment. One of the drawbacks to stomach sleeping is that it can lead to neck, shoulder, and back pain if the head and neck are not properly supported. As a result, it is especially important for stomach sleepers to find a pillow that keeps the head and neck at a comfortable angle. Other factors to consider when shopping for a pillow include breathability, pressure relief, and moldability. We’ll review our top picks for the best pillow for stomach sleepers, including details on their construction, performance, and why we recommend them. We’ll also take a closer look at the potential benefits of stomach sleeping and tips on how to improve sleep quality.

Though stomach sleeping is the least popular sleeping position and there are plenty of drawbacks to consider, some sleepers still find it to be a comfortable way to sleep. Often, this is because stomach sleeping can reduce snoring and symptoms. This is the main benefit of stomach sleeping, as the airway is less likely to become blocked. is caused by throat muscles relaxing and restricting air. When sleeping face down, the muscles cannot relax into the back of the throat. That said, stomach sleepers often put undue pressure on the neck and shoulders. Additionally, the hips and abdomen are more likely to press deeply into the mattress. This sleeping position can press the spine out of alignment. As a result, stomach sleeping is often discouraged by sleep experts. Understanding the drawbacks of stomach sleeping is the first step to promoting better sleep posture. Ergonomic support is important for stomach sleepers. A firm, supportive mattress and a low loft pillow can help ensure the spine is kept in alignment. A pillow underneath the hips can also help. Additionally, stomach sleepers may want to avoid turning their head to one side. We’ll break down each of these considerations further here, and explain how choosing the right pillow can help stomach sleepers find comfort and support. There are multiple factors for stomach sleepers to consider to ensure spinal alignment and full-body support. Understanding the following key factors is an essential part of shopping for a pillow. These include pillow loft, size, shape, and moldability, all of which affect the angle of the head and neck. Every sleeper has unique needs and preferences, but there are common issues that stomach sleepers face. Some pillow materials are better than others, and additional measures may need to be considered. What to Consider When Purchasing a Pillow for Stomach Sleepers When shopping for a pillow, it can be easy to be distracted by deals, discounts, and marketing claims about how a pillow works. Focusing on the nuts and bolts of a pillow, along with your personal needs, will go a long way toward making sure your purchase is a worthwhile one. The following factors are the top things that shoppers should look for when purchasing a pillow. These determine how comfortable and supportive the pillow will be, as well as how it performs in other areas. The loft of a pillow refers to its height. This is an important consideration for stomach sleepers, as it determines the amount of support the pillow provides. Pillows can have a low, medium, or high loft. Loft can often be adjusted by removing or adding fill. A low loft pillow, or one with a height below 3 inches, is generally preferred by stomach sleepers. A medium loft (3 to 5 inches) can also offer support for stomach sleepers, but this will depend on other factors like head size and personal preferences. The loft of the pillow should support the head and neck, keeping them at a comfortable angle. A pillow that is too high or too low can put stress on the neck and shoulders. Support determines if the spine is kept in alignment. Several factors impact the amount of support a pillow offers, including its loft, firmness, and size. The head, neck, and shoulders need to be properly supported. This helps prevent aches and pains for stomach sleepers by reducing tension in the neck and shoulders. Pillows range from soft to firm. In addition to sleeping position, body weight and personal preferences play a role in determining the best firmness level. Stomach sleepers may benefit from a soft to medium firm pillow, as long as the pillow keeps the head and neck at a comfortable angle. The materials used impact pillow firmness. Down, down alternative, and memory foam pillows are typically soft, while buckwheat and latex pillows tend to be firmer. A pillow that cradles the head and neck can help relieve pressure. Since pressure on the neck and spine causes discomfort for stomach sleepers, a pillow that alleviates pressure in these areas is beneficial. Ergonomic support keeps the head, neck, and spine aligned. Some materials, like latex and memory foam, relieve pressure exceptionally well by contouring to the shape of the head and neck. Pillows tend to have a rectangular or square shape, but the materials and construction determine how well the pillow retains its shape. Materials like down and down alternative compress easily and can lose shape throughout the night, resulting in the need to fluff the pillow for comfort and support. Latex is more likely to retain its shape throughout the night, providing consistent support for stomach sleepers. Memory foam compresses easily for a customized feel, but returns to its original shape when pressure is removed. The price of a pillow depends on the materials and construction used. Pillows have a wide range of price points, with budget pillows costing $10 to $20 and luxury options costing $150 or more. The wide price range makes it important for shoppers to set a budget beforehand. Shoppers should keep in mind that high-quality materials may cost more upfront, but will need to be replaced less often. The quality of materials used in a pillow determines its lifespan. On average, a pillow should provide consistent support for three years. Lower quality pillows will need to be replaced more often, as they are more likely to lose shape and cease to provide adequate support. Down and latex pillows often have long lifespans, while polyester and low-density polyfoam may degrade more quickly. Moldability refers to how easy it is for sleepers to shape the pillow as needed. This ensures a customized shape for comfort and support. Stomach sleepers may need to reshape their pillows throughout the night to make sure the head and neck are properly supported, and a moldable pillow can be beneficial. What Pillow Materials are Best for Stomach Sleepers? While pillows can be made with a variety of materials, we have found that down-alternative, memory foam, and latex pillows are best for stomach sleepers. Other available pillow types include buckwheat, down, feather, and polyfoam. Each pillow type has pros and cons for stomach sleepers, which we’ll break down further here. Memory foam is viscoelastic foam that responds to heat and pressure, allowing it to conform closely to the shape of the head and neck. For stomach sleepers, a can relieve tension and help promote spinal alignment. Some memory foam pillows have a solid memory foam core, while others use shredded memory foam for an adjustable loft. There is a potential for off-gassing, so stomach sleepers who are sensitive to odors may want to consider other options. Buckwheat pillows are filled with the hulls of buckwheat seeds. The hulls have an open shape that promotes airflow and helps regulate temperature. When used as a pillow fill, buckwheat is malleable. It conforms to the shape of the head and neck to provide support and relieve pressure. The loft of these pillows can be adjusted by adding or removing hulls, but some stomach sleepers may still find buckwheat pillows to be too firm. The hulls also make a rustling noise when the pillow is moved. Feather pillows are filled with the outer feathers of ducks or geese. The feathers compress easily and conform to the shape of the head. Feather pillows are soft and lightweight, which can be beneficial for stomach sleepers. That said, the insulating nature of feathers can cause heat retention. Feather pillows do not retain their shape as well, and often need to be fluffed. The loft of a feather pillow can be adjusted by adding or removing feathers. Natural latex is harvested from rubber trees. Latex is breathable, durable, and highly supportive for stomach sleepers. Latex pillows moderately contour to the shape of the head, neck, and shoulders to relieve pressure. Some stomach sleepers may find latex pillows to be too thick, dense, or heavy. Down is the soft under-feathers of ducks or geese. Down fill is softer than feathers. The malleable fill allows stomach sleepers to shape the pillow as needed. The loft can also be adjusted in some down pillows by adding or removing fill. The cradling effect of down supports the head and neck. are typically soft enough for stomach sleepers, but as they compress easily they will need to be fluffed to keep their shape. Polyfoam, or polyurethane foam, is often an affordable pillow fill. Polyfoam can offer pressure relief and moderate contouring, but it is not as breathable as other materials. Low-density foam is typically less durable and can sag over time. The size of a pillow determines the amount of surface area for a sleeper’s head, neck, and shoulders. This impacts the amount of support the pillow provides. There are five common pillow sizes available: A standard size pillow is the most common, and most pillowcases accommodate this size. The length and width of a standard pillow are comfortable for many sleepers, especially petite or narrow-shouldered sleepers and those who stay in the same sleeping position throughout the night. That said, it may feel too narrow for some. Those who change sleeping positions frequently or have broader shoulders may benefit from a larger pillow. A super standard pillow is not as common, but gives sleepers an extra two inches of room. This makes it more comfortable for sleepers who shift positions throughout the night. It may still feel narrow for some sleepers. A queen pillow gives users more surface area to change positions and still feel supported throughout the night. This size is four inches longer than a standard pillow, making it an ideal pillow for combination sleepers and those with broader shoulders. A king size pillow is one of the largest sizes available. The extra length gives sleepers plenty of room to move around as needed. It can also be used to support the upper body when sitting up in bed. Sleepers who toss and turn throughout the night and those who have broad shoulders will benefit from the additional surface area. Body pillows are long pillows designed to elevate other parts of the body. There are various sizes and shapes available. This type of pillow is often preferred by side sleepers and those who like to hold a pillow or prop up their legs or arms as they sleep. Stomach sleepers do not typically benefit from the use of a body pillow. While pillow choice is important for stomach sleepers, the following tips can also help them stay comfortable throughout the night. The is one that offers firm support to help keep the spine aligned. Stomach sleepers press their hips and abdomens into the mattress. If the mattress is too soft, this can cause them to sink in excessively and put pressure on the spine.  Even and consistent support from the mattress helps prevent spinal misalignment and reduces aches and pains for stomach sleepers. Since stomach sleepers run the risk of their lower bodies sinking deeply into the mattress, a pillow under the pelvis can help. This lifts the hips and abdomen and reduces pressure on the spine. Stomach sleepers who turn their heads to one side put stress on the neck and spine. Sleeping with the head straight down helps keep the spine aligned and reduces pressure on the neck and shoulders. Sleepers can prop their head up slightly with a pillow underneath their forehead. Stomach sleepers should also ensure they have selected a pillow made with breathable materials.

Impacting your mind, body and performance, skimp on your zzz’s, and you can kiss goodbye to any gains you might have built in the gym. The good news is there’s lots you can do to help yourself drift off, including , and trying one of these memory foam pillows. Are memory foam pillows better than traditional ones? Designed to mould to your head, neck and shoulders, while keeping your spine aligned, memory foam pillows can take a little getting used to. However, for many, once they’ve tried this firmer style of support, they’ll never go back. And for those that suffer from , these pillows can be a real game changer. If you’re still unsure, we’d recommend going for one that offers a trial period so you can try before committing. Whether you’re a front, back or side sleeper, we’ve found a memory foam pillow to get you off to the land of nod. These are the key features to look out for: If you sleep the same way you Savasana, look for a fairly supportive pillow with thin to medium height. Or, if you kip on your side, opt for a thicker pillow to align the neck and spine correctly, usually with firm support. The good news is memory foam is ideal for both these types of sleepers. If you sleep on your side, we also recommend sleeping with another pillow between your knees – it might sound a bit strange but this will align the hips and prevent lower back pain. If face down is how you like to doze, you'll find a flat pillow more comfortable – make sure to look for one with a soft filling such as microfibre. However, if you prefer firm support while sleeping on your front, then adjustable memory foam styles are available. If you’re a wriggler at night, then we’ll be honest — you might not get on with memory foam. Generally speaking, the stiller you sleep, the more likely you’ll fall in love with this type of pillow (however our winner does a great job at catering for all, so it’s worth giving one a go!). Otherwise, check out our for an alternative. We asked a panel of 18 testers to trial a variety of memory foam pillows over a two-week period. Each gave feedback, rating the pillow's comfort, support, overall design and how cool it was to sleep on. From the popular bed-in-a-box brand, Eve’s cooling pillow got top marks for facilitating a great night’s sleep. Keeping the spine aligned, it moulded to the head and shoulders well, and the wedged design suited both front, back and side sleepers (ideal if you tend to wriggle around!). Our panel was unanimous in saying they’d buy this pillow but, if for some reason you don’t get on with it, you’ve got 14 days to return. 13cm (medium thickness) 100% polyester 100% memory foam Yes 1.7kg No 14 nights 3 years Suitable for all sleepers, this pillow contains a cooling gel-infused memory foam, which our panel described as feeling luxurious and comfortable to sink into. It’s a little on the heavy side (so no pillow fights!) but at this price, we’ll let it off.  12cm (medium thickness) 40% Lyocell from Tencel, 60% Polyester Gel-infused memory foam Yes 2.5kg No None 5 years Our most expensive pillow on test is a memory foam hybrid, allowing you to adjust the thickness and firmness to your preference via removable ‘nanocubes’. It got top marks for staying fluffy, but it’s worth noting that it doesn’t smell great when it first arrives (so you might want to air it before hitting the sack). However, if you like the brand’s , we reckon it’s a worthy investment. Up to 22cm (adjustable thickness) 100% cotton Memory foam nanocubes and a microfibre layer Yes 0.75kg Yes No No Crafted from naturally hypoallergenic, organic bamboo, this sustainably sourced option will also biodegrade when you’re eventually done with it. It’s a bit shorter than your average pillow, so you might find there’s a bit of a gap when making the bed, but overall we think it’s the one to plump for (geddit) if you’re trying to make your home more eco-friendly.   12cm (medium thickness) 40% Bamboo fibre and 60% Polyester 100% Memory Foam Yes 1.8kg No 30 nights 10 years Certain workouts can leave you at risk of neck pain, but this supportive, firm pillow should help to alleviate it. The British-made design comes with three layers of removable foam so you can adapt the height, although most of our testers preferred it full. There’s plenty of time to decide if it’s right for you though, as this one comes with a 200-night trial offer. Up to 13cm (adjustable thickness) 98% polyester, 2% elastane 100% memory foam Yes 1kg Yes 200 nights 2 years If you’re one of those people that turn their pillow over to enjoy the cool side, you’ll love this memory foam pillow, which recreates exactly that feeling with a special cooling, breathable fabric. Although not quite as comfortable as the others on test, after a few nights acclimatising, it suited those that prefer firm support. 15cm (medium-thick thickness)45% Ice yarn, 55% polyester100% memory foamYes1kgNoNone 5 years  This content is created and maintained by a third party, and imported onto this page to help users provide their email addresses.

Learn more about our process Shoppers may associate luxury pillows with hotel stays and vacations, but there are benefits to using a luxury pillow at home. Luxury pillows are made with high-quality materials that offer long-lasting support and comfort. Sleepers can often feel the difference, especially when compared to a lower quality pillow that does not retain its shape or offer consistent support. Pillows play an important role in the overall sleep experience, as they can affect how the neck and spine are kept in alignment and how much pressure relief sleepers get. Although luxury pillows may cost more than the average pillow, they are an investment. Since this type of pillow is often more durable, it retains its shape and has a longer than average lifespan. Luxury pillows are often made with breathable materials to help keep sleepers comfortable and prevent heat retention. When looking for a luxury pillow, shoppers should consider the materials, including the pillow cover and fill, in addition to the quality of its construction. Your preferred sleeping position and body weight should also be considered, as these can determine what type of pillow you will find most comfortable. We’ll review our top picks for the best luxury pillows, including how they perform in terms of pressure relief and temperature regulation. We’ll also break down what a luxury pillow is and what sets this type of pillow apart from the rest. To help shoppers determine what pillow to choose, we’ll also answer frequently asked questions about luxury pillows and how to maintain them. Best High-End – Tempur-Pedic TEMPUR-Cloud Breeze Dual Cooling Pillow Best Firmness Options – Best for Side and Back Sleepers – The chambered Luxe Pillow is filled with premium down that is exceptionally plush and sustainably sourced. Use this SleepFoundation.org link for the most current discount on the Luxe Pillow pillows The Luxe Pillow Down Pillow is made with ethical and sustainable practices. The down fill is Responsible Down Standard Certified, meaning it is sourced humanely without unnecessary harm to the animals. The high loft of the Luxe Pillow compresses easily, cradling the head and neck to accommodate all sleeping positions. The 300 thread count pillow protector is made with 100 percent stretched cotton for softness and breathability, ensuring ample airflow throughout the pillow. Many luxury pillows include unique details, like the braided seams found on the Luxe Pillow Down Pillow. The pillow is constructed with three chambers, including an inner chamber filled with small-game waterfowl feathers that gives the pillow structure. The two outer chambers surrounding the feather core are filled with sustainably sourced white goose down. Though the chambered design offers plenty of support for sleepers, the pillow is malleable and soft. The softness of the outer chambers lets sleepers sink into the down pillow. The high loft and supportive core are sufficient for most side sleepers, and the pillow compresses easily for stomach and back sleepers. The Luxe Pillow Down Pillow is available in standard and king sizes. The pillow comes with a 100-night sleep trial, and the company asks that purchasers try the pillow for two weeks before initiating a return. The Luxe Pillow is easy to care for, as it can be machine washed on the gentle cycle and tumble dried with low heat. It can also be dry cleaned.  TEMPUR memory foam with TEMPUR-Breeze Gel coating Those who normally sleep hot on memory foam pillows Thanks to cooling gel inserts on both sides, this pillow from Tempur-Pedic offers better temperature control than many of its memory foam competitors. Use this SleepFoundation.org link for the most current discount on the Tempur-Pedic pillows Since forming in 1992, Tempur-Pedic has earned a stellar reputation for producing luxurious, well-crafted sleep products. The TEMPUR-Cloud Breeze Dual Cooling Pillow is a prime example. Its core is composed of Tempur foam, a proprietary high-density memory foam material that delivers excellent cushioning and pressure relief. The pillow has a medium feel, so the foam will contour closely to the head and neck to optimize your spinal alignment and reduce pressure points. The pillow measures roughly 6.4 inches thick. This means it is best suited to side and back sleepers, as these positions typically require more loft. Each side of the pillow features a cooling gel insert, which prevents the foam from absorbing too much body heat and sleeping excessively warm, and the quilted cotton cover is also quite breathable. The cover can be removed for machine washing and drying, but the foam should only be spot cleaned. Queen and king sizes are available. While the TEMPUR-Cloud Breeze Dual Cooling Pillow’s price-point is a bit steep, Tempur-Pedic offers bundled savings for customers who purchase two pillows in the same size. Shipping is also free of charge throughout the contiguous U.S. Returns are not permitted, but the company provides a five-year warranty for the pillow.  $130-150 – Standard/Queen $150-170 – King  Side 1: Medium Soft Side 2: Medium Firm Those who usually find memory foam pillows too hot People whose firmness preferences tend to fluctuate The Amerisleep Dual Comfort Pillow’s reversible design allows you to switch between medium soft and medium firm feels whenever you wish. Use this SleepFoundation.org link for the most current discount on the Amerisleep pillows For many sleepers, their preferred firmness varies from night to night. The Amerisleep Dual Comfort Pillow should appeal to these individuals thanks to its flippable design. One side of the pillow has a medium soft feel and will contour closely to the head and neck for targeted pressure relief, while the other is medium firm and provides more support. The pillow’s core consists of Bio-Pur, a proprietary memory foam noted for its density and durability. The foam is aerated with small holes that allow air to circulate throughout the interior and prevent excessive heat buildup – a common issue with memory foam products. The cover is made of soft, breathable polyester for added cooling and temperature control. Queen and king sizes are available for this pillow. You can remove the cover and launder it in any household machine whenever it needs to be cleaned, but the foam should only be spot cleaned as needed. The pillow’s sticker price is in line with similarly constructed models from other brands, and Amerisleep offers free ground shipping throughout the contiguous U.S. Although you can’t return the pillow, you’ll receive a warranty with your purchase that covers deep sagging and other structural defects for up to 10 years. Available in three density levels, the Boll & Branch Down Alternative Pillow offers the luxuriously plush and lofty feel of authentic down without the overheating or allergy potential. Use this SleepFoundation.org link for the most current discount on the Boll & Branch pillows While many luxury pillows are filled with down, plenty of shoppers may prefer a down alternative. The Boll & Branch offers the environmentally friendly Down Alternative Pillow in three different firmness levels to suit a variety of sleepers. Shoppers can choose between soft, medium, and firm. Each option has a 100 percent organic cotton cover with piping around the edges. The embroidered cover wicks away moisture and helps dissipate heat by increasing airflow throughout the pillow. The lightweight PrimaLoft synthetic fiber fill resists the buildup of moisture and helps regulate temperature. PrimaLoft mimics the feel of down and conforms to the shape of the head and neck for support and pressure relief. This can be helpful for sleepers who suffer from chronic neck pain and stiffness. The Boll & Branch Down Alternative Pillow is breathable and malleable. We find that the soft pillow is best for stomach sleepers, while the medium and firm options may be better suited for back and side sleepers. Shoppers should keep in mind their personal preferences and body types when selecting pillow firmness.

This includes investing in organic farming, paying workers fair wages, and providing safe work environments. The Down Alternative Pillow is produced in standard and king sizes. Boll & Branch offers a 30-night sleep trial and free returns. The Down Alternative Pillow can be machine washed as needed on the gentle cycle, and tumble dried with low heat until completely dry. Boll & Branch recommends washing the pillow infrequently. The SpineAlign Pillow’s adjustable, chambered design offers excellent support and pressure relief for side and back sleepers. Use this SleepFoundation.org link for the most current discount on the SpineAlign pillows The innovative SpineAlign Pillow features a unique shape intended to optimize alignment and alleviate pressure. The center chamber of the pillow is recessed and somewhat flat in order to cradle the head and neck, while both side chambers are fuller and loftier. This ensures a comfortable feel and fewer pressure points for most side and back sleepers. Each chamber contains shredded foam fill that can be added or removed to adjust the thickness and overall feel. This adjustable design makes the SpineAlign Pillow highly customizable for your specific needs and preferences. The chambers are equipped with zippers to prevent the fill from escaping. The cover is composed of quilted polyester with mesh end caps to promote breathability and help you stay cool. SpineAlign does not recommend machine washing or drying any part of the pillow – including the cover – so you should spot clean as necessary if stains or soiling occurs. Given the SpineAlign Pillow’s advanced design, its sticker price is quite reasonable, and customers in all 50 states receive free ground shipping. You’ll receive a sleep trial that allows you to test out the pillow for up to 60 nights before deciding whether to keep it or return it, as well as a five-year warranty.  600-fill power Hyperclean white goose down This pillow from Pacific Coast contains premium white goose down for a plush, lofty feel and excellent cushioning around the head and neck. Use this SleepFoundation.org link for the most current discount on the Pacific Coast pillows The White Goose Down Pillow from Pacific Coast offers the impeccable craftsmanship and luxuriously plush feel of a classic hotel pillow. The fill consists of 600 fill-power down that creates a very lofty feel and makes the pillow well-suited to side and back sleeping.

The cover and shell are both made of pure, breathable cotton that helps the pillow remain cool. Thick cording along the perimeter provides good structural integrity to prevent the fill from escaping. Both the cover and the pillow can be washed and dried in any household machine, making it easy and cheap to clean as needed. Standard/queen and king sizes are available.

Use this SleepFoundation.org link for the most current discount on the Saatva pillows Latex is a popular pillow material because it conforms to the head and neck much like memory foam, but without absorbing excess body heat. The Saatva Latex Pillow is a standout in this product category for a few reasons. It consists of a small inner pillow with shredded Talalay latex that is highly supportive, and a larger outer pillow that contains microdenier fabric with a downy feel. These materials create a plush feel without too much sinkage.

Should you decide to keep the pillow, you’ll also receive a one-year warranty. Shipping is free of charge for all orders in the contiguous U.S. Luxury pillows tend to have a higher price tag, so shoppers may wonder if they are worth the investment. But there are often concrete reasons for the added expense, as luxury pillows are made with high-quality materials for added durability, comfort, and consistent support. The quality of materials used to make a luxury pillow extends to both the cover and the fill. Cotton, linen, and rayon are commonly used for luxury pillow covers, and they are woven in a way to keep the fill from poking out. The seams may have added details, reinforcements, or gusset panels to add structure to the pillow and help it keep its shape. The fill used is often ethically and sustainably sourced, especially if it includes down and feathers. While most pillows last one to two years before needing to be replaced, purchasers can expect a luxury pillow to maintain its shape for at least three years without becoming lumpy or flat. Though there is not a standardized definition for what a luxury pillow is, there are certain features that set them apart. We’ll break these down further next to help shoppers understand what to look for when shopping for a luxury pillow. It is easy to become overwhelmed by the sheer number of pillows available in today’s market. Shoppers can narrow down their choices by considering the following factors that make luxury pillows stand apart from the rest. These characteristics point to a luxury pillow that is made to last. As luxury pillows are made with high-quality materials, including natural fabrics and fills, they tend to be breathable and temperature-regulating. This is good news for hot sleepers, who may find that conventional pillows retain body heat and sleep warm. Down is commonly used in luxury pillows, and it acts as natural insulation to keep sleepers comfortable. Latex is also frequently used and known for its breathable nature. These materials are not only breathable, but durable as well. In addition to the quality of materials and durability, shoppers should also consider the detailing of the pillow. Luxury pillows may have certain details that speak to the craftsmanship and quality of the pillow. This can include piped edges, embroidery, or reinforced seams that elevate the look and durability of the pillow. These extra touches can indicate that the company has invested time and extra effort in the pillow’s production. When investing in a luxury pillow, shoppers want to make sure it is a perfect fit. Adjustable luxury pillows are becoming more popular, as these pillows give purchasers the opportunity to add or remove fill for a customized feel. There are a variety of luxury pillows available, and what works for one person may not be the best for another. Each shopper will have unique needs that need to be met. Understanding your needs and priorities prior to shopping will help you know how to find a pillow that’s right for you. While luxury pillows are generally a valuable investment, there are certain factors that you should consider before making a purchase. Luxury pillows vary widely in terms of design, but there are common factors that indicate the quality of a pillow and if it will be a good choice. These factors include temperature regulation, pressure relief, price, and more. The term “luxury” covers a broad scope of products, and manufacturers may use it liberally to appeal to shoppers. That being said, not all pillows marketed as luxury may match that level of quality. It is important to look past product names and marketing to focus on what the pillow is actually made of and how well it will suit your personal needs. Shoppers should keep the following factors in mind when shopping for a luxury pillow. The quality of materials used determines the lifespan of the pillow. Luxury pillows are made with high-quality materials, but there are several factors to consider that speak to the durability of the pillow itself. A luxury pillow is often made with natural materials, including cotton, linen, latex, and down, or synthetic materials like memory foam and down alternative fill. Luxury brands tend to have traceable supply chains, certifications that attest to the sustainability and ethics of the materials sourced, and solid reputations for customer service and lasting quality. The loft of a pillow is its height, which can be considered low, medium, or high. Low loft pillows are less than 3 inches high, medium loft pillows measure between 3 and 5 inches, and high loft pillows exceed 5 inches in height. The loft determines the angle of your head and neck as you sleep. Along with firmness and fill, loft affects how much support you receive. A pillow may have a high loft, but certain materials like down and down alternative compress more easily. Sleeping position, body weight, head and shoulder size should all be considered when selecting pillow loft. Stomach sleepers often need a low loft pillow, while side and back sleepers can use a medium or higher loft pillow. A pillow supports the head and neck, helping to keep the spine aligned and relieve pressure on the neck and shoulders. Luxury pillows typically have better shape retention, so they can maintain consistent support and an even surface for sleepers throughout the night. The construction and fill determine the amount of support a pillow provides, and some luxury pillows have gusset panels or inner chambers for additional support and structure. Pillow firmness should be considered in addition to loft. Pillows can be soft, medium, or firm, and the firmness determines how much your head sinks into the pillow. Side sleepers tend to benefit from a thicker, firmer pillow that keeps the head lifted, while back sleepers may prefer a more medium firmness. Stomach sleepers often prefer a soft pillow to keep the head and neck at a comfortable angle. Some materials are firmer than others, and shoppers may need to try different pillow types and firmness levels to find the right fit. A conforming pillow that provides consistent support can help relieve pressure and tension in the neck and shoulders. Pressure-relieving materials like memory foam, latex, and down can contour to the shape of the head and neck to help keep the spine aligned and reduce tension. How well a pillow retains its shape is determined by its fill and construction. Luxury pillows often include structural details like pleated corners, reinforced seams, and gussets for shape retention. While conventional pillows are more likely to lose shape and flatten over time, luxury pillows tend to be made of more resilient materials like high-quality memory foam. Down pillows will need to be fluffed regularly to help keep their shape. Luxury pillows are often more expensive than conventional pillows, but there are a wide range of price points available. Shoppers should expect to spend anywhere from $50 to $150 or more, so it is important to set a budget before shopping. Factor in the cost of additional sleep accessories, such as pillow protectors and pillowcases. Moldability refers to how easily the pillow can be shaped or scrunched. Down pillows tend to be highly malleable, allowing sleepers to hug or shape them as needed. A moldable pillow also conforms more closely to the shape of the head and neck, which can be helpful for pressure relief. Luxury pillows are often made using breathable materials that help regulate temperature and prevent sleeping hot. Temperature regulation is affected by both the pillow cover and the fill. Lightweight, moisture-wicking covers include materials like cotton and linen. Down fill acts as natural insulation to regulate temperature, while latex is naturally breathable. While memory foam tends to sleep hot, luxury pillows that have this type of fill typically use modified varieties like open-cell or gel-infused memory foam to help dissipate heat. One of the main benefits of a luxury pillow is its lifespan. While conventional pillows can fall flat or feel lumpy within a year or two, luxury pillows are constructed with durability in mind. As a result, they have longer than average lifespans and are valuable investments. That said, the main drawback is that these pillows tend to be more expensive, which can be off-putting for some customers. The following pros and cons should be considered when shopping for a luxury pillow. : Luxury pillows should provide consistent support for at least three years, depending on the construction and materials used. This is a longer lifespan than the average pillow. : Luxury pillows are made with premium materials that feel comfortable and supportive for sleepers, with unique details that indicate the level of craftsmanship. : The high-quality materials used to construct these pillows are often highly breathable and moisture-wicking, which helps prevent heat retention and keep sleepers cool through the night. : Many luxury pillows are more expensive than conventional models. While they last longer, the upfront cost may not be ideal for shoppers on a limited budget. : Luxury pillows may require dry cleaning or spot cleaning, which is more maintenance than pillows that are machine washable. Down pillows will also need to be fluffed regularly. There are several types of pillows available, categorized by the type of fill used. Certain fills are more commonly seen used in luxury pillows, like memory foam or down and down alternative, though luxury options are available in most pillow types. While the type of material used to fill a pillow will make a large impact on its performance, the factor that separates luxury pillows from the rest is the quality of that fill. We’ll break down common fill and cover materials here, including some potential benefits and drawbacks of each. : Viscoelastic polyurethane foam, also known as , responds to heat and pressure for a closely conforming feel. Memory foam pillows may be made of a solid slab of foam, or shredded foam for adjustability and better airflow. Shredded memory foam pillows are often adjustable, while solid foam pillows are typically not. High-density foam is more durable than low-density foam, but may trap more heat. While foam is known for retaining heat, some memory foam pillows feature unique cooling constructions, or the fill is infused with gel, graphite, or copper to draw excess heat away. : Latex is made from the sap harvested from rubber trees, which is processed using the Dunlop or Talalay methods. Like memory foam, latex can be solid or shredded. It offers moderate contouring for pressure relief. Latex is highly durable and breathable, so these types of pillows tend to last a long time and keep sleepers cool. : Down is the insulating layer under the feathers of ducks and geese. Formed in soft clusters, down is malleable and conforming. Feathers have more structure and can be added to down pillows for better shape retention. While down and feathers are highly durable, they do require more maintenance. Most should be dry cleaned. : Buckwheat hulls, or the casings of buckwheat seeds, are used to fill firm pillows that contour to the shape of the head and neck. The open shape of the hull encourages airflow, making these pillows ideal for hot sleepers. Hulls can be added or removed to to adjust the loft. Some sleepers may find the rustling noise of the hulls to be bothersome. : Down alternative is a synthetic fiber fill, usually polyester or rayon, that mimics the feel of down at a more accessible price point. are hypoallergenic and easy to maintain, but they are often less durable than down pillows. : Cotton is a natural fiber that wicks away heat and moisture to keep sleepers comfortable. Luxury pillows are often made with organic cotton covers. Long-staple cotton is also popular, as the longer cotton fibers result in a softer, more durable fabric. : Rayon is a semi-synthetic fiber that can be derived from bamboo and other cellulose materials. It is a breathable fabric that is durable and affordable, but there are some environmental concerns when it comes to manufacturing rayon from bamboo or wood fibers with harsh chemicals. Linen is a natural fiber derived from flax. It is breathable, moisture-wicking, and highly durable, but it may not feel as soft as cotton or rayon. It is also prone to wrinkling. To know if your pillow is truly luxury, consider the quality of materials used, the construction, and the brand’s reputation. A luxury pillow will be made with high-end materials that retain their shape and provide consistent support. Reading reviews from verified buyers before purchasing the pillow is beneficial, as this feedback can attest to the quality and feel of the pillow. Luxury pillows range widely in price, but shoppers can expect to spend between $50 and $150. Shoppers should keep in mind that price is not the only indicator of quality, and it is possible to find luxury pillows on a budget. Luxury pillows are often a valuable investment, as they last longer than conventional pillows and will not need to be replaced as often. When cleaning a luxury pillow, it is essential to follow the guidelines provided by the manufacturer. Some luxury pillows can only be dry cleaned or spot cleaned as needed, while others are machine washable. Incorrectly caring for a luxury pillow can lead to loss of pillow shape and deterioration. Luxury pillows can be purchased online or in stores. Many mattress companies sell luxury pillows along with mattresses and . Department stores and home goods stores also sell luxury pillows. Be sure to read shipping, return, and warranty policies when purchasing a luxury pillow online, along with customer reviews. Luxury pillows should last three years at least, given that they are made with durable materials and high-quality construction methods. This ensures the pillow will retain its shape and resist flattening or becoming lumpy. A luxury pillow should last longer than the average conventional pillow, which typically lasts six months to two years at most. Some luxury pillows are adjustable, either with loose fill that can be added or removed, or a chambered design that has a removable core. Examples of loose fill pillows include shredded memory foam and buckwheat, while chambered pillows are often filled with down, down alternative, or latex.

Every time you drive, look over your shoulder, or talk to a group of people, your neck goes to work, bending your head anywhere you need to face. While you normally don’t notice your neck in action, when it is in pain, your neck becomes a very noticeable body part. The question of why you experience neck pain can have a variety of answers. It could be the way you sit at work, how you sleep, or the natural degeneration of aging. We’ve gathered some of the most common causes of neck pain in the following article, along with treatments that can offer pain relief when you need it most. At one time or another, nearly everyone has fallen asleep in an unpleasant position. Sometimes you start out that way, or sometimes the twisting and shifting you do while asleep leaves you in pain. Whether it’s on an airplane, in the car, or in your own bed, when you fall asleep in a way that bends your neck uncomfortably, you may wake up with a crick. The good news is that this cause of neck pain is usually not very serious. Better Sleep Positions and Treatment for Your Neck There are better and worse sleep positions for your neck. One of the worst is sleeping on your stomach. When you sleep this way, your back arches, and your head has to twist to the side to allow you to breathe. This puts extra pressure on your neck and shoulders and can lead to pinched nerves. You may not be able to do anything about the position you end up in while sleeping, but you can start your evening in a healthier sleep position. If your body is comfortable from this position, you may be less likely to move to an uncomfortable position in the middle of the night. When sleeping on your back, you naturally relieve the pressure that other positions can place on your spine. You can improve this natural advantage by choosing the right pillow. Back sleepers should choose a flat, soft pillow that is rounded for the space left open beneath your neck, providing it support. If your pillow doesn’t come with this type of neck support, you can tuck either a neck roll or a rolled-up hand towel into your pillowcase for the same kind of support. You can also use a feather pillow, which conforms to the space left between your neck and your mattress. Feather pillows break down over time, so if you choose this option, be prepared to replace your pillow every year or so. Watch out for pillows that are too high or too stiff—these can overextend your neck and cause pain. Side-sleepers should choose a pillow that is higher in the neck than the head, which will keep your spine aligned in a more natural position. A traditional pillow can work too if it’s made of memory foam, which allows your head to sink in while still providing neck support. If you do happen to wake up with a sore neck, an over-the-counter pain reliever along with rest should take care of it. Have you been looking up more than usual? Maybe you were bird watching, stargazing, or taking in an airshow. Whatever the reason, if you hold your neck in an unusual position for very long, you’ll be using your muscles in a way they aren’t used to. That leads to predictable discomfort the next day. For starters, don’t hold your neck in positions it isn’t used to unless absolutely necessary. When it is necessary, try to take frequent breaks with stretching and moving your neck in other directions. This will help keep your muscles loose and relaxed. Those tips are good for preventing strains in the neck. But what if you’re already in pain? Try to give your neck as much rest as possible. While you rest, use over-the-counter pain medicine to relieve the agony. If it still hurts after a few days or you find your mobility is limited, tell your doctor. Go to any bus stop or waiting room in America, and you’ll see it. People with shoulders slumped forward, necks down, noses in their cell phones. Perhaps the latest cause of neck pain, so-called “text neck” is a repetitive strain injury that can add stress and pain to your shoulders, lower back, and, yes, your neck. This cause of neck pain is unusual in that it affects younger people more than older people. While your phone gets all the blame for this ailment, it’s not the only culprit. Anytime you spend long periods hunched over, whether on the phone, at your computer, or at a workbench, you stand the same risk. To ease text neck, start with your posture. Straighten up your neck and back so that your spine is aligned. Your ears should be directly over your shoulders while you stare at your phone. You can improve your posture with a simple stretch; arch your upper back and neck backward, which will tuck your shoulders back as well. This can relieve the pain and stress that heavy cell phone use can cause. Finally, try lifting your smartphone to eye level. By looking forward rather than down, your neck won’t feel the strain as your head drops. If you play contact sports, sooner or later you’ll end up with a stinger. That’s the slang term for the shooting pain—almost like a lightning bolt—you might experience when you are hit in the nerves of your shoulders or neck. These usually go away after a few moments, but sometimes stingers last for days. Football tackles are the No. 1 cause of stingers, sometimes also called “burners.” They occur when a cord of nerves that runs from your shoulder to your neck called the brachial plexus is injured. Some people get them from spinal stenosis as well. And they can leave your arm weak and numb. Usually the pain and numbness of a stinger goes away after a few seconds to a minute or two. But itthey can linger, lasting for days in some cases. If this is true for you, or if you have received many stingers over your life, you should see a doctor. A doctor will test you to determine how much pain your neck is inyou have, how much weakness the injury has caused, whether or not both arms are affected, and how many stingers you’ve accumulated over your life. You will then be given a recommended course of treatment. If your stinger injury has lingered, your doctor will probably tell you to discontinue your sport until your symptoms have completely cleared up. Physical therapy can be a useful tool to regain your range of motion and strength. Recurrent stingers may require extra protective gear, such as special shoulder pads for football players. If you’ve been hit from behind by another car, you may develop whiplash. Whiplash is caused by blunt force from behind, and is most commonly a result of auto accidents. Other injuries can cause them it too, such as being tackled from behind. The name comes from the whip-like motion your head makes as it jerks forward and quickly back. That whipping motion can stretch and sprain the soft tissues in your neck. Symptoms of whiplash can come on gradually over the course of several hours. They include neck pain and stiffness, shoulder and arm pain, and spasms in your shoulders. You may also experience headaches, and some develop memory loss, dizziness, exhaustion, and other symptoms as well. Whiplash often gets better on its own after a few weeks or months have passed. Troublesome cases can last much longer, though. There are ways to ease the pain while your body recovers, as well as relieve any stiffness your injury has caused. After the initial acute symptoms are gone, you should be moving your neck, and avoid keeping it in the same position for too long. Although moving your neck is likely to be painful, movement is also what will help you recover more quickly. Don’t worry about doing greater damage—the damage is done at this point, and even painful movement will help you get better. That’s why doctors typically discourage using collars or braces that restrict movement, although they may be recommended for short-term use in some cases Try to remember this when you sit or lie down. Exercises are available that can help hasten recovery as well. While the movement can be painful, there are remedies for your pain. You can try either cold or warm compresses. Using a pillow firm enough to support your neck is encouraged. Keep your posture in line and remain upright whether you’re walking, standing, or sitting still. Gentle neck massages can help, too. When these at-home remedies aren’t enough, painkillers can help. Ibuprofen is good for relieving inflammation and pain. Sometimes over-the-counter pain relievers don’t do enough to stop severe pain. If that’s true in your case, talk to your doctor about prescription painkillers. Slipped disks in your spine are a common cause of neck pain. Also called herniated disks, slipped disks occur when the spongy pad between the hard bones of your spine ruptures and its jelly-like substance leaks. That places pressure on your spinal nerves, which are very sensitive to even light pressure. The result is typically pain. If the disk that has slipped is part of your neck, it can lead to pain, weakness, and numbness in your neck and arms. You may experience this as a burning pain. If you suspect a spinal disk has ruptured, you should see your doctor for a diagnosis. Your doctor will want to know your medical history and will perform a physical exam. If your doctor suspects a herniated disk, he or she may want to follow up with an MRI scan to confirm. Treatment may involve a combined approach using medicine and rest. Rest is important, as overusing the affected areas can cause your pain to return. When you do move, try to make your movements slow and controlled. That’s especially true when you need to lift something or bend over. While resting the area is key, you will want to avoid sitting for long periods. Your doctor may recommend short walks. Traction may be used as well. Medicine can range from over-the-counter painkillers to prescription muscle relaxers and pain medicine. Work with your doctor to find the combination that works best for you. Although surgery is not usually needed, some people with slipped disks will need an operation. That’s usually only recommended after other procedures have failed to ease symptoms. The surgery is called discectomy and fusion. In this procedure, the whole disk is removed, and bone is fused in its place. Spinal stenosis refers to a narrowing in your spine that pinches the vulnerable nerves in and around your spinal cord. When this occurs in your neck, it is called cervical stenosis. As you age, your risk of developing spinal stenosis increases; aging can cause bone spurs that narrow the spinal column. Only rarely do people under age 50 develop this condition, and when they do, it is usually the result of an injury. When you have neck pain, it is most commonly due to degeneration in your spine. Stenosis is one of the most serious consequences. Neck pain is only one of the symptoms. You may also find that your legs are weak and you may lose control of their movement, making it difficult to walk. You may find that your arms or legs become numb. You could also lose your “position sense,” which is the innate sense of where your limbs are when your eyes are closed. Cervical stenosis should be treated by a doctor. When preparing for your doctor’s visit, think about your neck pain and other symptoms. When did they start? What is the pain like? How often do you experience this pain? What are you doing when you feel your symptoms? Also think about any health problems you have that may be related, such as trouble with your arms, legs, or bowel or bladder control. After reviewing your medical history and giving you a physical exam, your doctor may take images of your spine via MRI scan or x-ray. Once a diagnosis has been made, surgery is often the best option. There are several types of surgery available for this condition, and you will want to discuss your options with your doctor. Bone spurs are smooth growths that develop as you age. They develop as your spinal discs wear down, causing the ligaments that hold them together to loosen. This wear can be the natural effect of aging, but it can also be hastened by arthritis. Osteoarthritis is the leading cause of bone spurs. As your ligaments loosen, they may compensate for the instability this causes by thickening. Thickened ligaments can start to form new bone that puts pressure on your spinal nerves. These bone spurs can cause tenderness in your joints and neck muscles, as well as inflammation. Bone spurs range in severity. Some cause only mild or moderate pressure on the spinal nerves, while others can cause muscle spasms, weakness, and more intense pain. Most patients will start with a conservative treatment for bone spurs that may include the following: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil), naproxen (Aleve), and aspirin. These can ease pain, relax muscles, and reduce swelling for a month to a month and a half. Physical therapy for improving strength, flexibility, and posture. Steroid shots, which reduce pain and swelling in the joints. Only three of these can be safely taken per year, and their effects are temporary. While these treatments may be enough, more serious cases of bone spurs could require surgery. Spinal tumors affect about 10,000 Americans every year. They can form in the neck or anywhere else along the spine. These tumors can be cancerous or benign, but even noncancerous tumors can pose serious health risks as they press against the spine. In many cases, spinal tumors start somewhere else in the body and spread (metastasize) to the spine. Although the causes of spinal tumors are not fully understood, having a family history of certain disorders elevates your risk. These include immune system disorders, Von Hippel-Lindau disease, and neurofibromatosis type 2. Although rare, these tumors can be passed down from generation to generation. Genetic testing is available to screen for this possibility. A wide variety of treatments and surgery are available for people with spinal tumors. What treatment options are best for you will depend on the location of the tumor, what type of spinal tumor you have, and how healthy you are. Here are some of the available care options: may be administered to reduce swelling. This can relieve pressure if part of the tumor is pressing against the spinal cord. A skilled surgeon can remove some spinal tumors. If surgery is unable to remove the entire tumor, radiation may be used to relieve more pressure. For cancerous tumors, chemotherapy may be ordered. These cancer-killing drugs may be given through injection or orally. attack cancer cells specifically, and are useful for certain spinal tumor types. This procedure focuses powerful radiation on the tumor directly. Doing this eliminates damage to healthy cells. Just by getting older, your neck becomes vulnerable to degenerative disk disease. The wear and tear of aging can cause the fibrous disc between your backbones to thin, crack, or dry out. This problem and the symptoms it causes are referred to as degenerative disk disease. Most people experience some spinal disc degeneration if they live long enough. By the time we reach 35, 30% of us show some amount of disc degeneration. By age 60 more than nine out of every 10 people show signs of degeneration. Degenerating discs are not necessarily painful, in which case the condition is simply referred to as “disc degeneration.” But when it does cause pain, degenerative disc disease can bring other problems as well. Your back’s discs can herniate or bulge, and they can cause bone spurs as well. Symptoms may include weakness and numbness in the arms and legs. It can also compress your spine, which can cause you to lose bowel and bladder control. Pain from disc degeneration in the neck tends to be worse when you move your head or stand or sit upright. You also may experience burning or tingling. What do you do if the discs in your neck are causing pain? It turns out you have several options. To begin with, try to avoid postures that cause you pain. A neck brace can be helpful in this way. There are other ways to relieve this painful condition, such as painkillers, epidurals, and anti-inflammatory drugs. When these approaches fail, surgery may be necessary. Traditionally this has meant spinal fusion, in which rods, screws, and bone grafts are used to secure the spine after the affected disc is removed. This approach has the downside of often accelerating the degeneration of nearby vertebral discs. Cervical disc placement is a newer approach that carries less risk of impacting nearby backbones.

f2d6ad73-e3fc-46e1-ba8c-6eb199f7ba62,"To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then . Having a baby is never without its ups and downs, but one of the most basic hardships of pregnancy can be . It’s especially challenging to find a comfortable sleeping position for a growing belly, and while there is debate about whether or not sleeping on your back raises your risk of having a stillbirth, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends sleeping on your side with a pillow between your legs or under your belly if you’re experiencing pain or discomfort while you sleep. A pregnancy pillow can help with that: it’s designed to ease pressure points in a pregnant person’s body, propping up your hips if you sleep with the pillow between your thighs, and supporting your neck and belly when you’re positioned on your side. “When there’s a lot of pressure in the [pelvic] area as the belly gets bigger, having your legs rested together sometimes isn’t as comfortable as having something between them,” Abbe Wain, M.D., an assistant professor of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive science at the Mount Sinai Health System in New York, . There are lots of pregnancy pillows out there to shop, but when we polled 14 moms on which ones actually helped them get a good night's rest, three main styles kept popping up. C-shaped pillows were the most popular: They're designed to support your hips, back, neck, and stomach, with a C-curve that props up your neck on one end, and a curved tail you can wrap your legs around. U-shaped pillows encompass the entire body, so they're especially helpful if you like to switch sides at night—with the only drawback being that you might kick your partner out of bed, since they run pretty large. Some pregnancy pillows serve a variety of functions, too, from a nursing pillow to a baby lounger to a small pregnancy pillow that can prop up your belly at night. There's no right or wrong answer (it really depends on how you sleep), but to help you narrow your search down, we asked a range of bodies and sleepers about the pregnancy pillows that worked for them, below.

Neck pain is a top reason for doctor visits and is more common in women than men. It's is often a response to overexertion, poor posture, stress, an injury, or sleeping in the wrong position. It can also arise from an injury where the neck experiences a rapid, forceful back-and-forth movement (whiplash), or from arthritis. Shoulder pain without neck pain tends to stem from an injury, for example, from strains or tendinitis. Exercises that of your neck have been shown in studies to work better than medication for relieving neck and shoulder pain.

It features a carefully designed ergonomic shape and high-quality materials. SleepDream occasionally offers discounts and promotions for shoppers who purchase more than one pillow. To find out how well the SleepDream performs, our team of sleep testers evaluated the pillow’s durability, comfort, and off-gassing. Aside from its lack of firmness options, the SleepDream performed well across the board. This pillow stands out when it comes to close contouring that gently cradles the head and neck. The SleepDream also performed well in categories where memory foam pillows often fall short, including moldability, temperature control, and odor potential. The SleepDream is a relatively durable pillow with a sturdy construction. That said, memory foam has a tendency to form lasting impressions over time with frequent use. The SleepDream will likely last between 2 to 3 years, which is the average lifespan for a pillow. The SleepDream lacks firmness options. Sleepers with varying sleep styles and body weights often require different firmness levels in order to sleep comfortably. While the medium firm feel of the SleepDream Pillow appeals to a variety of sleepers, those who prefer a plush or firm pillow may want to consider other options. Unlike pillows made with shredded memory foam, microfiber, or down feather fill, solid core pillows have a rigid shape. The SleepDream holds its shape and doesn’t require fluffing to maintain its loft during the night. Sleepers who enjoy cuddling with their pillow typically look for a fill material that’s less rigid and more malleable. Despite its solid core construction, our sleep testers found the SleepDream to be moldable due to the memory foam’s response to pressure. Memory foam is known for its ability to gently cradle and conform to the shape of your body while still providing support. The SleepDream is no exception. This pillow’s high-quality memory foam core provides excellent conforming comfort that cradles your head and neck. Memory foam is notorious for sleeping hot, and its ability to cradle and conform to your shape also means that the airflow between your head and the pillow can be limited. However, our sleep testers found the SleepDream retained less heat than the average memory foam pillow. New pillows often emit a noticeable odor known as off-gassing. This is generally caused by the release of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Depending on the materials in the pillow, the strength and duration of this smell can vary. The SleepDream is CertiPUR-US certified and has low off-gassing potential. An individual’s preferred sleep position and body weight have a significant impact on how they perceive a pillow’s comfort.

We found that the SleepDream’s moderate loft and excellent conforming ability was suitable for all positions and body weights. The SleepDream Pillow performed the best for . People who prefer to sleep on their side tend to need ample support for the head and neck. While support is key, a pillow that provides too high or too low of a loft can misalign the neck and cause pain. The contours of the SleepDream’s ergonomic shape are designed to elevate the neck and keep it aligned with the head and spine. As a result, this design was comfortable for our side sleeping testers of all body weights. Back sleeping promotes spinal alignment, but this position still requires a supportive pillow to keep the head and neck at a comfortable angle. Back sleepers are also more prone to .

The purpose of a pillow is pretty simple: Keep your head and neck aligned while you sleep. If only were as straightforward. Store shelves and catalogs are stuffed with options: Down, memory foam, latex, polyester, buckwheat hulls. Adding to the confusion is the fact that terms used to describe pillows—such as soft, medium, and firm—differ from brand to brand. And price isn’t necessarily an indicator of performance.   Which Pillow Fill Is Right for You? How Consumer Reports Tests Pillows Can a Specialty Pillow Help You Sleep? Pro Pillow-Shopping Tips So many consumers people look for a pillow that feels just right in the store. But a squeeze only tells you so much. It takes about 10 to 15 minutes for your neck to relax onto the pillow, according to Susan Gordon, associate professor of physiotherapy at James Cook University in Australia. “You will need a week sleeping on a pillow to work out if it really is the right pillow for you,” she says. Others opt for trial and error: “The pillow that I have is too soft/hard/flat, so I’ll get a firmer/softer/fuller one next time.” Many give up and sleep with multiple pillows, though that can keep your head too high and throw off the natural curve of your neck. Consumer Reports suggests a more methodical approach to choosing a pillow. Start your search by matching the pillow to your dominant sleep position: side, back, stomach, or combination. That’s the position you settle into and is likely to be your favorite, according to Rebecca Robbins, Ph.D., a fellow at the New York University School of Medicine and co-author of “Sleep for Success!” (AuthorHouse, 2010). Many pillows are now labeled this way, but the terms vary from brand to brand. Use our advice to fine-tune your shopping. Finally, check pillow return policies, so you don’t get stuck with a closet full of rejects. Almost 70 percent of us sleep on our sides, according to a survey from Consumer Reports. A firm or extra-firm pillow is the best pillow to maintain the proper alignment or curve of the neck and head at what a study in a 2015 issue of Journal of Manipulative and Physiological Therapeutics found was the most comfortable height—10 centimeters, about 4 inches off the mattress. A traditional or contoured memory foam or latex pillow can support the head at the proper angle and might not flatten as quickly over time when compared with a polyester or down pillow.  Look for a pillow that supports or cradles the head without losing the natural curve of your neck. Start with medium-loft, medium-firm models filled with down alternative, memory foam, or latex foam. Loft is a pillow’s height as it lies flat on the bed. Sleeping on your back is often associated with snoring or the more serious sleep apnea, in which a person stops breathing momentarily. Because gravity can cause the tongue to block the airway and create the disruptive buzzing, one solution is to prop up the sleeper using two to three firm pillows or a wedge pillow to elevate the top half of the body, according to Thomas Roth, Ph.D., founder of the Sleep Disorders Center at the Henry Ford Health System in Detroit. If you roll over to sleep, your face is very close to the mattress. A thin or soft and scrunchable pillow filled with down or feathers, a down alternative, polyester, or thin foam can keep your neck’s natural curve. But a firm, high-loft pillow could leave you with a sore neck.  If you’re a multiposition sleeper, the best pillow for you might have softer and firmer sections, or one that’s lower in the center (for back sleeping) and higher on the sides (for side sleeping). Buckwheat hulls and pillows made of multiple materials fit this bill. For more on what’s inside your pillow, read, “” Most pillows last about two years. You should replace yours if it doesn’t pop back when you fold it in half, or in thirds for king-size pillows.   Not getting enough Zzzzs?

Like many competing hybrids, the Helix Midnight Luxe sleeps quite cool. A support core of pocketed coils generates steady air circulation to help the mattress maintain a comfortable core temperature, while the breathable Tencel cover wicks away moisture from your body.

The Nectar mattress can help relieve back pain thanks to its robust comfort system made up of three separate layers of memory foam. While this material compresses to hug the body, Nectar has constructed the foam to avoid concerns that can arise from memory foam being too soft or sleeping too hot. The top layer of memory foam is one-inch thick and gel-infused to resist heat buildup. It is quilted into a Tencel cover that also promotes breathability. A second memory foam layer is three inches and made to be slightly firmer and more stable, avoiding the sag found with some memory foam beds. A third layer of memory foam is one-inch thick and gel-infused, adding up to a total of five inches of memory foam for noticeable pressure relief. With a Medium Firm feel, the the Nectar works well for side sleepers who weigh over 130 pounds as well as back and stomach sleepers who weigh under 230.

The support core of the WinkBed is made up of pocketed coils that are arranged in zones to deliver extra support to the heavier parts of the body. Reinforcements around the perimeter give the WinkBed a standout level of edge support that keeps you stable when sleeping or sitting near the edge. Above this core is a thinner layer of coils that are also individually-wrapped to tailor their compression to the body’s weight. The combination of both sets of coils allows the mattress to cushion pressure points to help with spinal alignment without sacrificing bounce or permitting excessive sink. Added contouring from polyfoam in the pillow top gives an extra touch of support that’s needed for people with back problems. The WinkBed is available in three firmness options (Medium Soft, Medium Firm, and Firm) plus a separate model, the WinkBed Plus, built for people of above-average body weight. This range of options caters to people in all sleeping positions. Motion isolation and temperature regulation are both above average, and WinkBeds backs their product with a 120-night sleep trial and a lifetime warranty.  Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King People who experience sharp pains or pressure points along their spines Zoned transitional layer provides targeted bodily support The Level Sleep Mattress boasts a zoned design that reduces pain and pressure very well for side and back sleepers. The top layer of the mattress is composed of adaptive polyfoam that contours to the body. Beneath this lies a transitional layer divided into three zones based on firmness. Softer foam cushions the head, shoulders, and legs while firmer foam reinforces the torso and hips, where people tend to carry the most weight. This design ensures people receive adequate contouring and pressure relief without sinking too much. The Level Sleep Mattress is also very well suited to couples. The foam layers absorb movement and prevent this motion from transferring across the surface – a common source of disruptions for sleep partners – and the mattress is completely silent and creak-free. For an all-foam model, the mattress also provides above-average temperature regulation and won’t sleep hot for most folks. The mattress is reasonably priced given its innovative, high-quality construction. Customers in the contiguous U.S. also qualify for free ground shipping.

The DreamCloud Mattress is a luxury hybrid mattress with a plush quilted surface and a medium firm (6) feel. The DreamCloud combines pressure relief and great support to keep the sleeper’s spine aligned and midsection supported, making it a great option for those with back pain. The quilted top of the DreamCloud consists of a foam fill with a breathable cashmere blend cover. Under this is a comfort layer of gel-infused memory foam, which doesn’t trap as much body heat as conventional foams. Below this is a polyfoam transition layer followed by a support core of individually-wrapped coils. The DreamCloud is distinguished by its thick profile, which allows it to have both substantial comfort layers and support core. Consequently, the DreamCloud is able to provide a significant amount of pressure relief while being capable of supporting most sleepers regardless of sleeping position or body weight. We also rated the bed well, in temperature control, and ease of movement, making it a great all-around mattress. Dreamcloud offers an excellent 365-night sleep trial and lifetime limited warranty, and for a luxury hybrid mattress, it comes at a relatively affordable price point.  Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King, Split King People with firmness preferences that change from night to night Shoppers looking for a mattress with an extensive sleep trial Reversible construction with sleep surfaces on each side Sturdy pocketed coils offer support and responsiveness Save 30% on any Idle mattress with this code: NEWYEAR30 The flippable Idle Hybrid is constructed with a sleep surface on the top and bottom sides. You can choose a medium firm (6) or firm (8) feel for both sides. Customizing the mattress with a different firmness level on each side allows you to flip between two distinct surfaces whenever you want to change the feel, while selecting the same feel for both surfaces can extend the bed’s lifespan if you rotate it regularly. Both surfaces of this mattress are constructed with comfort layers of adaptive polyfoam that contours to the body without hugging too closely. Denser polyfoam layers reinforce the top layer to prevent excessive sinkage, and a shared support core of pocketed coils provides excellent overall stability for the mattress. The Idle Hybrid is also well suited to hot sleepers because the coils promote steady airflow throughout the mattress core and maintain a comfortable sleeping temperature. For maximum cooling, we recommend the firm feel because you won’t sink as deeply beneath the surface. The coils also make the surface feel quite responsive, which most couples prefer for sex. Side sleepers will probably find the medium firm feel more comfortable because it offers more cushioning for the shoulders and hips. Ample padding is crucial for even alignment and less pressure for this position. Back and stomach sleepers may prefer the firm feel instead, especially if they weigh more than 230 pounds. The Idle Hybrid has a price-point that is slightly below average for a hybrid and Idle ships the mattress for free to all customers in the contiguous U.S. The company’s 18-month sleep trial is one of the longest in the mattress business, and the Idle Hybrid also comes with a lifetime warranty.  Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King Eco-friendly design features several natural and organic materials Our best latex hybrid pick is the Birch by Helix, also known as the Birch Mattress. This eco-friendly hybrid is constructed with comfort layers of natural/organic wool and natural Talalay latex, which provide consistent body conforming. These materials also allow the bed to sleep exceptionally cool, since they are highly breathable and can help regulate the sleeper’s body temperature. The pocketed coil support core is reinforced with a layer of organic wool batting, which also helps air circulate through the bed. The Birch Mattress is medium firm, making it ideal for side and back sleepers who weigh 130 to 230 pounds; it may also be suitable for lighter or heavier individuals who prefer moderate firmness and conforming. The components are sustainably sourced, as well. And because it is built with pocketed coils, the Birch Mattress is less prone to squeaking than innersprings and hybrids made with other coil types. The Birch Mattress has a below-average price-point compared to other latex hybrids constructed with natural and organic materials. Birch also offers free shipping to all 50 states. The mattress is backed by a 100-night sleep trial and a 25-year warranty.  Soft (2-3), Medium Firm (6), Firm (7-8)  Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, Split King, California King, Split Cal King Sleepers who want a durable mattress made of high-quality materials People who like the bounce of an innerspring but need extra support Anyone who wants a choice of firmness to suit their sleeping position Those who want hassle-free setup and removal of their old mattress Choice of two height profiles & three firmness levels Coil-on-Coil construction with extra pillow top support Get $200 off when you spend $1,000 or more at Saatva.com Saatva has established a strong reputation in the online mattress industry for their line of products made with thoughtful designs and quality materials. People struggling with back pain find the Saatva mattress to offer a compelling mix of contouring and springiness because of the double-layer of coils and a foam-filled pillow-top. The Saatva’s support core is made with thick (13 gauge) Bonnell coils that have a perimeter of high-density foam. This combination forms a solid, stable foundation that works well for higher-weight sleepers and enhances overall edge support. To offer more conforming, the Saatva has a four-inch layer of individually-wrapped micro-coils. This layer allows the mattress to relieve pressure while upholding the stable feel of the support core. A euro-style pillow top is stuffed with extra foam and a memory foam lumbar pad, a key feature for people with lower back pain. Saatva offers this mattress in three firmness levels, so people in any position and body weight can find an option that will work for them. The mattress resists excess heat buildup, especially with its breathable organic cotton cover. Customers can also choose between an 11.5” and 14.5” model. White-glove delivery is included, which means Saatva installs the mattress in your bedroom and will haul-away your old mattress. Customers have 180 nights to test it out, but if you opt to return it, a $99 return shipping fee is deducted from the refund. A 15-year warranty provides protection against defects over the longer-term.  Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King Above-average temperature neutrality for an all-foam model Get 35% off a Cocoon Chill Mattress with code: SLEEPFOUND35 Sealy has been around since 1881, so they’ve had some time to engineer a bed that relieves pressure in the back to alleviate pain. The Cocoon Chill, an all-foam mattress with two firmness options, is just that bed. Conforming closely to the sleepers body and coming in both medium soft (4 out of 10) and medium firm (6) options, the Chill is great for relieving back pain among sleepers of most positions and weights. The cover of the Chill is made from a polyester-cotton blend infused with phase-change material (PCM). This innovative fabric is designed to absorb body heat from the sleeper and release it away from the mattress. Since memory foam tends to trap a lot of body heat throughout the night, this is an especially useful feature of the all-foam Cocoon Chill. The comfort layer is made of memory foam, which conforms around the shoulders and back to ease pressure points, preventing and alleviating back pain. Under this is a polyfoam transition layer followed by a high-density polyfoam support core. The Cocoon Chill performs extremely well in both pressure relief and motion isolation, making it a top pick among people with chronic pain as well as couples. We recommend the medium soft option for side and back sleepers under 130 pounds, and the medium firm option for everyone else. The price of the Chill is pretty standard relative to other memory foam beds. Sealy offers a 100-night sleep trial and a 10-year warranty, and ships free to the contiguous US.  Soft (3), Medium (5), Medium Firm (6), Firm (7-8)  Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King Exceptional durability backed by a 25 year warranty Get $100 off a PlushBeds Mattress with code: SF100 The PlushBeds Botanical Bliss is a great option for “green” shoppers who would rather spend their money on sustainably made goods. The mattress contains layers of organic latex that have received certification from the Global Organic Latex Standard, as well as a cover made of organic wool that has been certified by the Global Organic Textile Standard. Latex is a popular mattress material for people with back pain because it contours to the body without sinking too deeply. The Botanical Bliss is highly customizable. You can choose from a profile of 9, 10, or 12 inches depending on your desired thickness. The firmness is also adjustable. The mattress comes with a medium (5) or firm (7) feel, and you can unzip the cover and swap the order of the layers to make it feel softer or firmer. This makes the Botanical Bliss suitable for virtually anyone regardless of their body type, sleep position, or thickness and firmness preferences. Temperature regulation is another strong point of this mattress. The latex is highly breathable and won’t absorb body heat like memory foam, while the wool cover has moisture-wicking properties to keep you cool and dry at night. And thanks to the natural durability of latex, the Botanical Bliss has a very long expected lifespan. All-latex beds tend to be somewhat pricey and the Botanical Bliss is no exception.

Rather than utilizing foams or latex like most modern mattresses, the Parachute features a modern take on a classic luxury mattress construction. The Parachute mattress is topped with a cover of organic cotton, which is breathable and soft. The comfort layers consist of a top batting layer of New Zealand wool on top of three tiers of stacked microcoils. This wool batting not only provides cushioning to the surface of the mattress, but wicks away moisture to make the bed sleep cooler. The tiered micro coils are designed to support different parts of the body optimally, and result in a supportive and firm surface that will keep sleepers from sinking too far into the mattress. The support core consists of a zoned pocketed coil system, which also provides targeted support. Due to its luxury innerspring construction, the Parachute Mattress performs significantly well in temperature control, ease of movement, and edge support. Its firm feel and high degree of support cater particularly well to sleepers over 130 pounds, especially back and stomach sleepers. Lighter side sleepers or those who like close-conforming foam mattresses may not feel as comfortable on the Parachute. As a luxury mattress, the Parachute is sold at a slightly higher price then most innersprings, but is slightly less expensive than the average luxury mattress. Parachute offers a 100-night sleep trial and a 10 year warranty on their mattress. They also ship for free to the contiguous US. Back pain is a widespread problem that affects an estimated at one time or another. It can make all types of daily activities difficult including walking, working, sitting, and lifting even lightweight items. Unfortunately, back pain complicates sleep as well, making it hard to find a comfortable position to fall asleep and keep sleeping soundly through the night. Research studies have found that over half of people with report sleeping problems. These negative impacts on sleep arise in people who have both sudden and short-term (acute) back pain and those who have long-term, persistent (chronic) back pain. People with pain tend to have fragmented sleep that occurs from waking up during the night. Upon waking up, getting back to sleep can be difficult because of ongoing aches and discomfort. Pain can also contribute to stress, depression, and anxiety, all of which can be detrimental to quality sleep. Back pain sufferers can take a number of steps to try to feel and sleep better. Getting medical help for serious back problems may help reduce pain. Treatments depend on the cause and nature of a person’s symptoms and can range from surgery to physical therapy to pain-relieving medications. Smaller changes can contribute to pain reduction as well. Taking care when lifting, sitting with proper posture, and avoiding unnatural movements can reduce aggravation of back pain. Having a mattress that keeps the body aligned can reduce stress on the spine and facilitate better sleep. Back pain can present in many different ways and for a wide variety of reasons. To help classify back pain, it is normally described as either acute or chronic. Acute back pain comes on rapidly and is often a sharp, intense pain. In many cases, acute back pain is directly tied to a specific event such as a fall, an awkward twist of the body, or lifting a heavy object. It is pain that normally comes from injury to muscles and/or ligaments. Chronic back pain lasts for three months or longer and persists despite attempts to remedy it. It can involve sharp pain but may occur as stiffness or a dull soreness. Sometimes it can be connected to a prior injury, but often has no clear or immediate cause. Another way to distinguish between types of back pain is based upon which part of the back is affected. Lower back pain is by far the most common type of back pain. It affects the lumbar region, which includes the lowest five vertebrae (L1-L5) of the spine. Pain in this area is the second most common reason — after only cold- and flu-like symptoms — why people visit their doctor. Lower back pain can be tied to basic muscle strain as well as to more complicated issues affecting the nerves, organs, and vertebrae. Examples of possible causes include compression fractures, ruptured or herniated disks, and narrowing of the spine (spinal stenosis). The lower back has more curvature and range of motion than other parts of the back, and this makes it more susceptible to injury related to movement and posture, including positioning during sleep. If a mattress offers insufficient support, the lower back may twist or bend in an unnatural way. For example, if the bed is too soft or is worn out, the hips, which carry more weight, may sink deeply into the mattress and out of alignment with the lumbar area. When that or any other misaligned position is held for an extended period during the night, it can be a direct contributor to back pain. Middle back pain is much less common than lower back pain. The middle back is generally identified as above the lumbar spine but below the rib cage. The anatomy in this area is designed to promote stability over flexibility, reducing the propensity for movement-based injury compared to the lower back. Even though mid-back pain is less common, it can still occur as a result of numerous conditions. Nerve compression, damage to discs, fractures, and muscle or ligament injury can occur in this region. Middle back pain can also be caused by serious underlying problems, like tumors or organ problems, making it important to get it reviewed by a doctor, especially if it occurs alongside other unexplained symptoms. Stiffness and aching in the mid-back can arise because of poor posture and lack of spinal support. Because of the amount of time spent in the lying position during sleep, these alignment issues can often be connected to a mattress that does not adequately support the body and cushion a person’s pressure points. Upper back pain is less common than lower back pain but occurs more frequently than middle back pain. It affects the thoracic region, which runs from the bottom of the rib cage up to the lower neck and involves the 12 vertebrae that connect to the ribs.As with middle back pain, the reduced flexibility of bones and muscles in this region make movement-based strains less common than in the lower back. Pain in this area can occur for similar reasons as the mid-back — nerve, disc, muscle, ligament, or vertebrae problems — but there is a greater likelihood that this pain is connected to a potentially serious health issue.Pain in the upper back and in the shoulders can also come about because of awkward or unsupportive body positioning. If a pillow is not the right height or if a mattress doesn’t properly accommodate the shoulders, it may place undue pressure on the anatomy of the thoracic region, heightening the risk of upper back pain. Regardless of whether back pain has started suddenly or has been a long-term issue, people experiencing it should make sure to get checked out by a doctor. Not only can a physician help try to relieve pain, they can conduct a full diagnostic process to determine if back pain is being caused by a more serious underlying health issue. Sleeping position can have a direct effect on back pain. Each sleeping position creates a unique set of pressure points and areas that need cushioning, and this is why having the right mattress to suit your sleeping position is an important part of preventing and reducing back pain. Back sleepers tend to have their most serious pressure points around the lumbar area. If a mattress is too soft, the weight of the abdomen will cause this region to sink out of alignment with the rest of the back and hips. If the mattress is too hard, it won’t accommodate the natural curvature of the spine in the lumbar area. For this reason, a Medium-Firm to Firm mattress usually works best for back sleepers. have high-impact areas where the body is the widest, notably at the shoulders and hips. A mattress needs to be contouring enough to cushion those pressure points but not so soft as to let them sink too deeply into the bed and out of line with the rest of the body. Most side sleepers get the best results from a Medium to Medium-Firm mattress. have pronounced pressure points in the lumbar area and around the neck. If their pillow is too tall, it can put excess bend in the neck and upper back. If the mattress is soft, the pelvic area can dip too far, putting the body in a U shape that stresses the spine as well as the muscles and ligaments in the lower back. As a result, stomach sleepers tend to have less back pain if they use a thin pillow and have a . Body weight is an important factor to consider along with sleeping position. People who weigh more will sink further into a mattress, exacerbating the risks in all sleeping positions of the heavier parts of the body becoming misaligned. Sleepers of above-average body weight (over 230 pounds) typically need a firmer mattress than someone of average weight who sleeps in the same position. Similarly, people who weigh under 130 pounds are less prone to sinking into the bed, and can sleep on a softer, more contouring mattress without the same risks of the body sagging out of alignment. In fact, to get the support that they need, lighter-weight sleepers generally need a softer mattress than an average-weight sleeper in the same sleeping position. A mattress can definitely be a cause of back pain because it plays such an important role in how the body is positioned through the night. Most people know that posture is important but only think about their posture in the context of standing and sitting. This can cause them to overlook the importance of having a mattress that is the proper fit for them based on their body shape, weight, and sleeping position. If the spine and joints aren’t aligned and well-cushioned during sleep, they won’t be able to relax. Instead of recovering, the body will be strained, exacerbating pre-existing back issues and sowing the seeds for new ones. The easiest way to know whether a mattress is a contributing factor to back pain is if the pain tends to be the most pronounced in the morning when you wake up. If the pain is the worst when you get out of bed and subsides during the day, there’s a good chance that your mattress is playing a part in your aches and pains. A key step in choosing a mattress is deciding which mattress type is most likely to work for you. Virtually all mattresses on the market today can be broken into five types based on their construction and materials. Within each category, you can find consistent features; however, there can be notable variation from one brand or model to the next. Some types allow for a greater diversity of designs, which leads to a wider variation in the expected feel and performance of any specific mattress. Hybrids are constructed with an innerspring support core that is supplemented by a significant comfort system that may include layers of foam, latex, micro-coils, cotton or fiber fill, down, and/or wool. The comfort layers on a hybrid are much more robust than on an innerspring mattress. Hybrids try to capture the best of multiple bed types without suffering from their downsides. For example, hybrids tend to offer moderate to significant contouring that aids in pressure point relief, while their coils permit excellent ventilation, making temperature regulation a plus on most hybrid beds. : An innerspring mattress is composed almost entirely of metal coils. There may be a thin layer of cotton, polyester, or foam above the coils, but this layer does not significantly change the mattress performance. Historically, innersprings were the most common mattresses, but their popularity has declined considerably as foam, latex, and hybrid models have gained steam. A benefit to innersprings is that they are among the most inexpensive options that you can find. You can use the extra money saved to customize the feel to suit your needs with a mattress topper. : In latex mattresses have an interior construction made completely with latex, which is a type of rubber. Most mattresses use natural latex from trees, but synthetic or blended latex is used occasionally. The comfort layers and support core may employ different types of formulations of latex. Latex has moderate contouring effects, allowing it to cushion the body without an excessive amount of sink. Airbeds feature a support core of inflatable chambers. Sleepers can use a remote or smartphone app to control a pump that can add or remove air from the chambers, adjusting firmness in real time. There may be other materials, including foam, latex, cotton, polyester, or wool, layered as a comfort system above the support core. The primary benefit of airbeds is their adjustability. Being able to quickly modify the firmness of the bed can be a huge plus for people with back pain because it lets them get “dialed in” depending on the nature of their pain and posture at that exact point in time. Foam is layered to create both the support core and comfort system of an all-foam mattress. Memory foam is a popular material in foam mattresses as is polyurethane foam (polyfoam), which can be manufactured to have a range of distinct characteristics. Latex may be included among the layers, but no coils are used in a foam mattress. Memory foam tends to offer the highest degree of hug. This allows these mattresses to deliver proportional cushioning to the areas of the body that need it most, which can be especially useful for side sleepers who have sharp impact points. When you’re struggling with back pain, you may feel like you’re willing to give anything to get relief, but the realities of your budget can mean that you have to think about the impact of any mattress purchase on your bottom line. The good news is that there are multiple wallet-friendly ways to improve your bed, enhance your sleep, and give your back a rest. A great way to score a deal on a new mattress is to buy online. While it might seem like a strange concept if you’re used to going to a brick-and-mortar store, the truth is that buying online offers some huge advantages. Most online mattresses are sold directly by the manufacturer. Eliminating the middle-man and the need for showroom space means lower prices, and the growing competition between retail and online storefronts has only generated more deals for shoppers. But the benefits go beyond just price. Shopping online is convenient, allowing you to browse options from the comfort of your own home and without any salespeople eagerly pushing a sale to earn a commission. Having the time to research each mattress and compare it to others is a major contrast to the brick-and-mortar experience where you’re limited to just what’s available in that store. When buying online you don’t have the ability to feel out a mattress before purchasing, but almost all online retailers provide a sleep trial with no-hassle returns, offering you a full refund if you try out the mattress and don’t like it. This gives you a no-risk opportunity to try out a mattress for weeks or months in your own bedroom as opposed to for just a few minutes in a store. Over the longer-term, virtually all online mattresses come with a warranty of at least 10 years to protect against future problems, which are rare in mattresses sold both online and in-store. Shipping is usually free within the contiguous U.S. with the mattress being delivered as a “bed-in-a-box.” To do this, the mattress is compressed and sealed in plastic. When you remove it from its packaging, it regains its full size within a matter of hours. This serves as a convenient way of getting the mattress set up in your bedroom without having to coordinate with a delivery team. Online mattresses come in a wide range of styles and price points, allowing every customer to find the right fit for their preferences and budget. These mattresses are typically reliable and made with the same quality of materials as mattresses sold in stores. Many of the big, well-known mattress brands have even come into the fold and launched products to be sold online. Another benefit is that customers have a wealth of useful resources to help guide their decision. In the past, getting details about the performance of mattresses sold in retail stores was a challenge. Online, though, there are helpful sites, including ours, offering reviews and detailed explanations of what you can expect from any specific brand or model. Many sites also have coupons to help you get the best price. While it can seem like a leap to buy a mattress online for the first time, thousands of customers have already been won over to this exciting approach to finding a high-quality mattress at a great price. A mattress topper provides another way to change up the feel of your bed without breaking the bank. Instead of replacing your whole mattress, a topper lets you place a fresh layer above your existing mattress. Most mattress toppers are 1 to 3 inches tall and can be made of memory foam, polyfoam, latex, cotton, polyester, down, or a mix of materials. Memory foam is one of the most popular types of toppers, providing an opportunity to try out this material without committing to a completely new bed. A major benefit of a topper is that you can take advantage of a new comfort system that fits your needs. This may include a change in the firmness and/or the contouring to cushion your pressure points. For people with back pain, the difference can be notable and serve as a meaningful step toward better sleep. At the same time, it’s important to remember that any topper comes with potential downsides. Every material has pros and cons, and those will be reflected in a topper. Most sleepers above 130 pounds need a topper that is at least two inches thick, and higher-quality versions can cost a few hundred dollars. Toppers also won’t offer the same level of overall performance as a full mattress. Remember that a mattress is built with multiple layers designed to work together. With a topper, that element of coordinated design doesn’t apply, so they may not capture the full benefit of the material (like memory foam). A topper may wear out over a shorter period of time, especially if it’s thinner, made with lower quality materials, or if you weigh over 230 pounds. Last, a topper can’t make a deteriorating mattress feel “like new.” If your existing mattress is already sagging, a topper will end up sagging, too. For this reason, a topper is the best bet when you need to adjust the feel or support of your existing mattress, not when your existing mattress has started to give out. Changing your sleeping position is one way to try to get back pain relief. If you are a back or stomach sleeper with a soft mattress and you don’t have the budget for a new bed, you can try to switch to a side sleeping position that will receive more support from your existing mattress. In general, experts recommend that stomach sleepers try to adjust to side or back sleeping because it’s easier to get appropriate support in those positions. For people with acute pain, temporary changes to your sleeping position may help to reduce stress on already sore or achy parts of your back. For example, people with lumbar pain might try a period of side sleeping to avoid the excess bending of that area that can happen on your stomach or back. While changing sleeping positions is worth a shot, it’s often not a long-term solution because the change can be hard to stick with. Some people just can’t get comfortable in a different position or they may quickly revert back to their old sleeping position during the night. In these cases, other approaches are more likely to be beneficial over the medium- to long-term. Additional Sleeping Accessories for Sleepers With Back Pain Besides a mattress, other accessories can play a part in making your bed conducive to quality, pain-free sleep. Upgrading your pillows and your bed base can be done as a lower-cost way of improving your sleeping surface, or you can purchase these along with a new mattress as part of a complete overhaul. Pillows play an important role in preventing and reducing back and neck pain. Pillows that provide proper support to the neck can improve spinal alignment because the spine extends into the neck (known as the cervical spine). In addition to supporting the head, pillows can be strategically placed to provide cushioning and comfort to other parts of the body. Numerous factors affect any individual fight neck and back pain. The amount of loft of your pillow should fit your personal preference and body shape. The right loft level is also largely determined by the firmness of your mattress and your sleeping position, as outlined in the following tables. To reduce back pain, pillows can be used to support other parts of the body besides just the head and neck. may find it helpful to put a pillow between their knees, especially if they draw their legs up toward their chest. Using a pillow in this way can reduce pressure on the hips and lumbar area. A full-length body pillow can be used to prevent twisting through the lower back. can benefit from a low-to-medium loft pillow placed beneath the knees, which can aid in maintaining a more natural bend in the lower back. may get pain relief by placing a thin pillow below the pelvis to hedge against excess pressure or sinking of the lumbar area. Some stomach sleepers use no pillow at all for their head or may rest only their forehead on a very thin pillow. The base of the bed can contribute to a supportive overall sleeping surface for people with back pain. Some people opt for an adjustable bed, which allows for the upper and lower body to be raised at various angles. Many adjustable bed frames also include a heat or massage feature that can be a nice bonus for back pain sufferers. The optimal position for any sleeper on an adjustable base will depend on the type of back pain that they have and their sleeping position. Back sleepers, for example, frequently find that a slight elevation of the torso and legs helps take pressure off of the lower back. It is essential to ensure that your mattress is compatible with an adjustable bed before purchasing and setting one up. Even customers who don’t want an adjustable bed should take care in choosing the foundation, platform, or base for their mattress. Most manufacturers list recommended characteristics of the base, including distance between any slats of a bed frame. Following these guidelines keeps the mattress in good condition and avoids premature sagging. Using an approved base may be necessary to maintain the validity of the mattress warranty as well. Mattress Features To Look For to Relieve Back Pain When shopping for a mattress to help relieve back pain, some features are more important than others. With so many products and a bevy of marketing hype, it can be tough to parse out what really matters. You’re most likely to get the most satisfaction out of your purchase by focusing on certain key considerations: the materials and design will play a huge role in the performance of a mattress. The contouring, bounce, firmness, temperature regulation, and motion isolation of a mattress will be different for each mattress type, so it is critical for shoppers to think about their priorities and choose a mattress with components that will best meet their needs. weight from the body is not distributed evenly; instead, certain areas tend to require more cushioning. A zoned mattress takes that into account and offers reinforced support in those areas. a mattress made with excellent materials is much more likely to provide the performance, reliability, and durability that people with back pain need. firmness is a key driver of mattress comfort and is largely a matter of personal preference. At the same time, the right firmness level can play a big part in whether a mattress offers sufficient support, and that will depend significantly on a person’s body weight and sleeping position.

Learn more about our process is a common sleep disorder that may affect as many as , although many cases go undiagnosed. (OSA) is the most common form of the disorder, and often the most disruptive to daily life. Fortunately, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy is an effective treatment for many individuals suffering from the condition. However, nightly use of a CPAP machine will necessitate some changes to the sleep environment. Many CPAP users find that their mask presses into the pillow, causing mask leaks and discomfort. A good pillow can help improve comfort for sleep apnea patients while also reducing the risk of face mask air leaks. Some pillow designs feature indents for CPAP masks and hoses, and others are crafted to keep sleepers comfortable on their backs. The best pillows for sleep apnea can improve both comfort and CPAP performance, often resulting in better quality sleep. If you have or suspect you may have sleep apnea, you should talk to your doctor for a diagnosis and treatment options. The best pillow for sleep apnea may be beneficial, but it is not a replacement for medical care. Instead, it should act as a complement to your existing treatment plan.

Factors such as support, pressure relief, loft, and firmness all affect the overall performance of a pillow, so shoppers should carefully consider them. For those with sleep apnea, aspects such as contouring, pillow shape, and CPAP-specific design features should also be kept in mind. What to Consider When Purchasing a Sleep Apnea Pillow The following criteria can influence the performance, comfort, and quality of a pillow, so they’re worth assessing when shopping for new pillows. There are many pillow options on the market, but sleepers can easily narrow down their options by focusing on the factors that are most important for those with sleep apnea. Sleeping position has a substantial effect on pillow performance, particularly for CPAP users. Side and stomach sleepers often experience pressure from their mask pushing into the pillow, which can cause both discomfort and air leaks. Those who sleep on their side or stomach may benefit from a CPAP pillow with indents or cutouts to accommodate their mask, while back sleepers can also utilize cervical and designs. The shape of a pillow and how well it retains its shape are important considerations for those with sleep apnea. Side sleepers often prefer contoured designs, which can comfortably accommodate the shoulders and neck. Specialty shapes, such as wedge pillows and CPAP pillows, are also worth considering for certain sleepers. CPAP pillows allow space for the mask and hose, making them popular with side and stomach sleepers, while wedge pillows elevate the upper body, which may appeal to back sleepers. Many of the best pillows for CPAP users feature design elements intended to accommodate CPAP masks and hoses. Generally, this includes indented areas of the pillow which give extra room for face masks. It may also include grooves that the tubing can rest in. This factor is most important for side and stomach sleepers and for any CPAP user who has experienced trouble with mask seal or comfort in the past. Loft refers to the height of the pillow. It influences the angle of the head and neck, which can affect spinal alignment, ease of breathing, comfort, and more. Some pillows have an adjustable loft, allowing sleepers to add or remove material to achieve their desired comfort level. Stomach sleepers tend to prefer low-loft pillows, back sleepers medium-loft, and side sleepers high-loft. Support measures how well the pillow holds up the neck and head and keeps the spine aligned. Some materials, like polyfoam and memory foam, tend to be more supportive than others. Firmness is measured on a scale of very soft to very firm. Personal comfort preferences, sleeping position, and bodyweight can all influence the desired firmness level for each sleeper. The best firmness for a sleeper typically balances support and contouring to promote spinal alignment while providing comfort. Depending on their designs, pillows can either relieve pressure or create pressure points. A pillow’s loft, materials, and firmness level, combined with sleeping position, all contribute to a pillow’s pressure relief performance. Some specialty designs have specific features intended to relieve pressure on the neck. In the case of cervical pillows, a small indent is found in the center of the pillow, cradling the head and reducing pressure on the neck. Pillows can be found in a range of price-points. Quality pillows for sleep apnea will generally be found in the $50 to $150 range. The best values are often competitively priced models with high-quality materials and design features since they balance quality and affordability. Pillows can be made with a variety of materials, although most for sleep apnea use memory foam. There are varying levels of quality within each category of materials. Regardless of the type of material, high-quality components typically enhance the pillow’s comfort, performance, and durability. Some pillows trap warmth more than others. For sleepers who tend to overheat at night, a pillow’s temperature-regulating properties are an important consideration. Memory foam tends to sleep warmer than many materials. However, these models often contain cooling design features intended to combat heat retention, like gel infusions or perforations for better airflow. There are many different pillow styles, each with distinct pros and cons. Pillows can differ in shape, style, materials, and firmness levels. Finding the option that works best for you depends on your personal preference and sleep position. As for sleep apnea pillows, there are a few categories that are generally best. CPAP pillows are specifically designed to accommodate CPAP masks. They generally feature indented areas on both edges of the pillow, which leave space for bulky full-face masks and/or tubes. These pillows are well suited to side and stomach sleepers who need the extra space to accommodate their mask, although back sleepers may find that they are too lofty. Wedge pillows feature a sloped design that helps to elevate the upper body in bed. They are commonly used for lounging in bed while reading or watching TV, but some sleepers also find them useful for sleeping. Their elevation can reduce airway compression and may also help to minimize . Cervical pillows are ergonomically designed and primarily intended for back sleepers. They are engineered to relieve pressure on the neck, often featuring an indent in the center of the pillow intended to cradle the head. Sleep apnea patients who are combination sleepers or back sleepers may benefit from cervical pillows. Standard pillows are generally filled with down, feathers, down alternative, or foam. They have a standard rectangular shape, are widely available, and are generally inexpensive. However, they do not offer any features specifically designed for the needs of those with sleep apnea. Choosing the right pillow can help those with sleep apnea get better rest, but there are many other factors worth exploring. In addition to practicing and , there are some practices that those with sleep apnea should pay close attention to. For those who have been prescribed CPAP therapy, is very important. Various small steps can help improve the efficacy of the machine, including ensuring the mask fits properly and washing your face before putting on the mask. Ensuring that the CPAP components are cleaned frequently is important for safety, sleep quality, and general hygiene. CPAP masks, in particular, require frequent cleaning in order to reduce the buildup of body oils. A clean CPAP mask will provide a tighter seal, reducing the risk of air leaks. Sleep apnea is a long-term condition for many sleepers, and its severity can change over time. Family doctors and sleep specialists can tailor recommendations to each patient. For example, they may customize pressure settings on CPAP units based on your needs. Patients should make appointments with a sleep specialist every few years, particularly if sleep issues arise. Bodyweight can have a substantial impact on . Excess weight, particularly near the throat, can cause airway restriction and other breathing issues. Many modern CPAP units have built-in humidification. For those who do not use a heated humidifier, it may be worth trying. Humidifiers help keep the nasal passage moist, potentially reducing irritation and congestion and improving CPAP performance. Trying out different sleep positions may be worthwhile for those struggling with sleep apnea. Some individuals experience reduced sleep apnea symptoms while on their sides. Others prefer back sleeping, as it allows for the most comfortable fit for CPAP masks. Various lifestyle changes, including , , and can all have an effect on sleep quality for those with sleep apnea. Frequently Asked Questions About Pillows for Sleep Apnea The guide above supplies most of the information you will need to find a good pillow for sleep apnea. If you still need help, we’ll answer commonly asked questions below. A good CPAP pillow will usually cost between $40 and $100. Wedge pillows are often more in the $75-$150 range. Material, size, and design features can all affect pillow pricing. Certain materials, like down, latex, and wool, tend to cost more than popular options like memory foam and polyfoam. Does sleeping with the head elevated help sleep apnea? Some individuals with sleep apnea find that sleeping with their head elevated does improve sleep quality. A found that a slight elevation of the upper body “significantly improves OSA severity without interfering in sleep architecture”. This sleeping position can be achieved with the help of a wedge pillow for sleep apnea or an . Sleeping on a wedge may help with sleep apnea. As referenced above, one study found that sleep apnea patients sleeping with their head elevated slightly (7.5 degrees) experienced improved sleep quality. Sleeping without a pillow is unlikely to improve sleep apnea severity. In fact, it is likely to jeopardize the spinal alignment of side and back sleepers, potentially putting more pressure on the airway. However, stomach sleeping may be beneficial for those with sleep apnea, and many individuals who favor this position sleep without a pillow to avoid forcing the head backward. Some pillows may help certain individuals get better sleep. Finding the right pillow is a highly individualized process, so there is no way to know with certainty whether a specific pillow will work for you. If you’re struggling to rest comfortably with sleep apnea, you should talk to your doctor. Not only can they provide a treatment plan, but they may also be able to suggest what type of sleep apnea pillow may be best for your condition.

Learn more about our process Sleeping on the stomach tends to place strain on the neck and spine, and this effect can be exacerbated by the wrong mattress. While some sleepers prefer this position, they may suffer from associated aches and pains as a result. A supportive mattress that prevents the sleeper’s midsection from sinking in too deeply can help align the spine and reduce back pain. Selecting a new mattress that is more conducive to stomach sleeping may provide sleepers who favor this position with a better night’s sleep. With so many mattresses available online, finding the right mattress for your sleep position can be time-consuming. We’ll point you in the right direction with our picks for the best mattresses for stomach sleepers.

The standard Dawn has a firm (7-8) feel and is geared toward back and stomach sleepers who weigh 130 pounds or more. A comfort layer of responsive Helix Dynamic Foam offers a balance of contouring and bounciness. Many people liken this material to latex, rather than memory foam. A standard Dawn also includes a polyfoam transitional layer, followed by a support core of 8-inch pocketed coils that stabilize the entire mattress and reinforce the edges to prevent excessive sinkage. If you’d like a thicker mattress with more padding than the standard Dawn, consider the Helix Dawn Luxe. This model features an additional memory foam comfort layer, resulting in a closer body contour. The Dawn Luxe’s coils are also divided into zones based on gauge, or thickness, so you’ll sink very little when moving across the surface and getting on and off the mattress. The Helix Dawn and Dawn Luxe are both well suited to stomach sleepers thanks to their firmer feels and strong support systems. Although you’ll pay a bit more for the Dawn Luxe, its price-point is still in line with the average hybrid model. Helix Sleep also offers free ground shipping to all 50 states and a 100-night sleep trial.  Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King Get $399 worth of free accessories with every mattress purchase. The all-foam Nectar Mattress conforms to the sleeper’s body without excessive sinking, making it a strong option for stomach sleepers. The Nectar Mattress uses three layers of memory foam: a layer in the quilted cover, a comfort layer, and a transition layer. Memory foam responds to a sleeper’s weight and heat to adjust to their shape, cradling their body and relieving pressure points. While the Nectar’s three layers of memory foam contour to a sleeper’s body, a high-density support core stabilizes the mattress and prevents sagging around the sleeper’s midsection for better spinal alignment. The Nectar’s all-foam construction absorbs a significant amount of motion while remaining whisper-quiet. Some foam mattresses tend to sleep hot, but the Nectar combats heat retention with a breathable cover and a layer of gel memory foam to disperse heat. Rating around 6, the Nectar has a medium firm feel. While sleepers from any weight group may find this firmness comfortable, it is a particularly appropriate setting for stomach sleepers between 130 and 230 pounds. The Nectar is affordable compared to similar mattresses on the market, and it comes with a lifetime warranty and 365-night sleep trial.  Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King, Split King Sleepers who prefer the feel of a firmer hybrid mattress Save 30% on any Idle mattress with this code: NEWYEAR30 The Idle Hybrid is our next top pick for stomach sleepers. This mattress is a reversible model. One side has a medium firm (6) feel and the other has a firm (7-8) feel. Both sleep surfaces are constructed with polyfoam comfort layers that cushion and conform to the body while also feeling somewhat responsive and bouncy. The Idle Hybrid’s shared support core contains 6-inch pocketed coils; the comfort and transitional foams on each sleep surface serve as base layers when you use the opposite side. If you prefer one of these feels over the other, Idle also gives you the option of customizing both sides of the bed with the same firmness level. We recommend the Idle Hybrid to stomach sleepers – particularly those who weigh at least 130 pounds. Both sleep surfaces have firmer feels and the coils deliver strong support, so stomach sleepers shouldn’t sink too much regardless of which side they choose. The Idle Hybrid is a great choice for hot sleepers, as well. The entire mattress is encased in a Thermocool fabric cover designed to regulate your temperature and help the surface of the mattress stay cool, and steady airflow through the coil system also ensures consistent temperature neutrality. The Idle Hybrid’s price-point is below-average compared to other hybrid models. Ground shipping is free for all orders. Additionally, Idle Sleep provides an 18-month sleep trial that is much longer than the trial periods from most competing brands. You’ll also receive a lifetime mattress warranty for added peace of mind.  Soft (3), Medium (5), Medium Firm (6), Firm (7-8)  Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King Get $100 off a PlushBeds Mattress with code: SF100 The PlushBeds Natural Bliss is a supportive, eco-friendly, all-latex mattress made using natural and organic materials. The bed avoids the use of harmful chemicals and animal products through the use of a plant-based fire barrier. One of the standout features of the PlushBeds Natural Bliss is its sheer customizability. The mattress comes in multiple thicknesses that are each composed of different combinations of latex layers. The latex layers are all encased in a cover made of organic cotton. This cover can be easily opened, allowing you to rearrange the layers of latex in the mattress and change how firm it feels at will. Each version of the Natural Bliss starts with Dunlop latex as its support core. Dunlop latex is a naturally dense material that provides the strong degree of support and pushback that stomach sleepers need in order to keep their spines aligned as they sleep. The thinner models have a single, 6-inch base of Dunlop latex, while the thicker variants split this core into two layers. The comfort layers of most models are composed of Talalay latex, which tends to be softer, lighter, bouncier, and more breathable than Dunlop latex. These layers conform to the body in a pressure-relieving cradle, allowing sleepers to sink into the bed somewhat and cupping common pressure point areas like the shoulders and hips. The 8-inch Natural Bliss has a single 2-inch layer of Talalay latex, while the 10-inch variant is made with two. Performance is generally consistent across all the different Natural Bliss models, with some minor variation here and there. The thicker models are going to be better at relieving pressure and isolating motion thanks to the body contouring of their Talalay comfort layers. The firmer models will have slightly better support around the edges, though the all-latex construction of these beds means that they’ll all provide a strong, resilient surface. The beds are all highly durable, bouncy, and breathable. Latex sleeps rather cool and the Talalay layers have an open-cell design that allows for additional airflow throughout the mattress. Their construction means they won’t carry a strong “new mattress smell” that some all-foam beds are known for, and the latex naturally resists the buildup of moisture and allergens. Sleepers who weigh more than 230 pounds will find themselves to be best supported on one of the thicker, firmer models and should opt for one of the beds that is at least 8 inches thick. Lighter sleepers will be able to sleep comfortably on most thicknesses, though they’ll likely want to go for a more middle of the road firmness level. The Natural Bliss ships for free to the contiguous U.S. The mattress is backed by a 100-night sleep trial and a 25-year warranty. Read our Full PlushBeds Natural Bliss Review to learn more  Soft (2-3), Medium Firm (6), Firm (7-8)  Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, Split King, California King, Split Cal King Shoppers looking for more firmness and thickness options Sleepers who prefer a balance of bounce and pressure relief Get $200 off when you spend $1,000 or more at Saatva.com As a hybrid model, the Saatva combines multiple layers of foam, a layer of pocketed coils, and a layer of Bonnell coils. This construction gives the Saatva Mattress a balance between the benefits of both foam and innerspring mattresses, including bounce, edge support, breathability, and contouring. The top layer of the Saatva Mattress consists of a Euro pillow top with an organic cotton cover and a layer of polyfoam. This layer provides cushioning for a stomach sleeper’s pressure points without excessive sinkage. Next, a thin layer of memory foam rests near the midsection of the mattress, supporting and cushioning a stomach sleeper’s hips. A layer of pocketed coils within the comfort system gives deeper contouring and support while allowing airflow. This layer also provides some bounce, while the pocketing of the coils inhibits motion transfer across the layer. A layer of Bonnel coils acts as a durable, breathable support core for the mattress, while a foam encasement around the perimeter of the mattress creates a sturdy edge. The Saatva Mattress is available in two thickness options and three firmness options. The thickness options are 11.5 inches and 14.5 inches, while the firmness options are soft (3), medium-firm (6), and firm (7). The firm version of the mattress will likely be the most suitable for stomach sleepers over 130 pounds due to its extra support. Stomach sleepers under 130 pounds may prefer the soft or medium-firm settings. The Saatva Mattress comes with a 15-year warranty and a 180-night sleep trial. White Glove delivery is free of charge.  Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King The Birch is a latex hybrid mattress that uses natural, eco-friendly materials to provide a supportive, cool night’s sleep. The mattress is wrapped in a breathable cover made of 100 percent Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS) certified organic cotton. Rather than using chemical-based flame retardants, the Birch’s top layer is a fire barrier made from a combination of wool and rayon. A second layer of organic wool adds some cushioning as well as natural temperature regulation by helping to wick moisture away from the body through the night. The Talalay latex comfort layer provides some pressure relief and body contouring, but with more of a bouncy feel akin to sleeping “on” rather than “in” the mattress. The support core is a robust bed of individually pocketed innerspring coils. Combined with the latex layer, these coils provide the extra bit of pushback that many stomach sleepers need to keep their spines aligned. The perimeter is reinforced with strong coils to bolster the bed’s degree of edge support. The Birch has a medium firm feel that measures at about a 6 out of 10 on our firmness scale, as well as a strong balance of support and cushioning. These features make the bed suitable for sleepers of a wide variety of weights and preferred sleeping positions. Couples with different sleep preferences and needs should be able to find compromise on the Birch, while hot sleepers will appreciate its breathability. Natural materials like wool and latex also tend to resist the buildup of moisture, dust, and other allergens. The Birch mattress comes with free shipping to all 50 states. It is backed by a 100-night sleep trial period as well as a 25-year, semi-prorated warranty. Birch also offers a 10-year accidental damage protection plan for an additional charge.  Soft (4), Medium (6), Firm (7), Plus (8)  Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King Mattress shoppers looking for a model with multiple firmness options For many stomach sleepers, finding the most comfortable mattress hinges on choosing the correct firmness. The WinkBed luxury hybrid is available in four different firmness levels, making the mattress suitable for most people regardless of their body type or general preferences. People who weigh less than 130 pounds will likely prefer the medium soft feel, those who weigh 130-230 pounds may find the medium firm feel most comfortable, and the firm feel is geared toward sleepers who weigh more than 230 pounds. Additionally, the WinkBed Plus – also firm – is specifically designed for people in the latter weight group. The standard WinkBed is constructed with two layers of adaptive polyfoam and a transitional layer of foam-encased pocketed microcoils, while the WinkBed Plus swaps out the microcoils for a thick latex layer. Either way, the mattress provides strong support and feels quite responsive on the surface. All WinkBed models feature a support core of pocketed coils divided into different zones based on gauge, or thickness. Thicker coils line the perimeter to minimize sinkage and also provide enhanced support to your midsection and hips, while thinner coils deliver gentler cradling for the head, neck, and legs. Temperature regulation is another strong point of this mattress. Air circulates freely through the main coil system to help the WinkBed maintain a comfortable core temperature, and the microcoil and latex layers are also quite breathable. The WinkBed is competitively priced for a hybrid model, but the company will ship the mattress for free anywhere in the lower 48 states. You’ll receive a 120-night sleep trial with your purchase, during which you’ll be able to exchange the mattress if you would like to try another firmness level, as well as a lifetime warranty against structural defects.  Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King Athletes and people with physically demanding jobs Celliant fiber cover is designed to improve recovery The Bear Hybrid is a standout mattress for a few reasons. A comfort layer of adaptive polyfoam contours to the body hugging too closely – a common complaint about memory foam – and a transitional layer of high-density polyfoam provides extra reinforcement and minimizes uncomfortable sinkage. The support core contains thick pocketed coils and a base layer of high-density foam. These components collectively make the mattress very supportive for stomach sleeping, while its medium firm feel ensures a bit of conforming to alleviate aches and pains. The Bear Hybrid’s cover is made of Celliant fabric, an innovative material intended to absorb heat, convert it into infrared energy, and transmit this energy back into the body through your skin. This process can assist with physical recovery during sleep, making the mattress useful for athletes and people with physically demanding professions. Celliant fabric also sleeps quite cool, so the mattress is also well suited to those who sleep hot. Since the Bear Hybrid has a medium firm feel, stomach sleepers who weigh up to 230 pounds will probably find it most comfortable. Combination sleepers in the same weight group who also use the side or back position should also receive adequate support and cushioning. The Bear Hybrid’s sticker price is very approachable compared to other hybrid models and the company provides free ground shipping throughout the contiguous U.S. You’ll receive a 100-night sleep trial with your purchase, as well as a 20-year warranty. Most experts advise against stomach sleeping, but some individuals find this position most comfortable. Because stomach sleeping can lead to physical discomfort, those who favor this position may benefit from a mattress that meets their specific needs as closely as possible to reduce the possible drawbacks of stomach sleeping. There are several potential issues associated with stomach sleeping. First, turning the head for an extended period of time can lead to neck soreness. Stomach sleepers also usually extend their necks backward, which could compress the spine and cause arm numbness due to restricted blood flow and compressed nerves. Stomach sleepers who bring a leg up may torque their hips and , which could lead to pain. Additionally, if the sleeper’s midsection sinks too deeply, it could place strain on their spine. Since stomach sleeping can cause aches and pains, stomach sleepers may also toss and turn more during the night, so they might not get enough restful sleep. While stomach sleeping has potential drawbacks, it also has a possible benefit: some individuals may snore less when sleeping on their stomachs. We’ll examine the potential effects of stomach sleeping in more depth. Spinal alignment refers to how a person’s body lines up. When standing, someone who is holding their back straight and tall likely has a good spinal alignment, while a sloucher’s spine is not as well aligned. Improper alignment can lead to strain, which may cause aches and pains. The same is true when a person lies down. Regardless of a person’s sleep position, ideal spinal alignment keeps the spine as straight as possible without bending or twisting. Stomach sleepers often struggle to achieve good spinal alignment. A mattress that is too soft may allow their midsections to sink in too deeply. Similarly, a mattress that’s too firm may not allow their shoulder and head area to sink in enough. Either issue could strain the . Many stomach sleepers benefit from a mattress that balances conforming and support, allowing their shoulders to sink in enough without letting their hips sink in excessively. Stomach Sleepers With Back, Neck, and Shoulder Pain Stomach sleepers using the wrong type of mattress mattress may experience in their back, neck, shoulders, and other body parts. Since stomach sleepers frequently crane their head to the side rather than sleeping face-down, they often experience neck pain. Adults also often carry a lot of their weight near their midsections. Without proper support, a stomach sleeper’s heavy midsection might dip too deep into the mattress and lead to more aches throughout the body. Additionally, when a mattress does not help the sleeper keep their spine and joints in proper alignment, their muscles may work overtime during the night in an attempt to better align the spine. Since these muscles cannot relax, the sleeper may wake up with more aches and pains. If you wake up with pains that tend to diminish during the day, your mattress could be the root cause of the problem. The right mattress may be able to provide better spinal support, preventing undue strain and allowing your muscles to relax during the night. Stomach sleeping generally isn’t recommended. The position isn’t conducive to good spinal alignment, which can affect the sleeper’s back, neck, and shoulders. Since many stomach sleepers experience aches and pains during the night as a result of their sleep position, they may toss and turn more and awaken less rested. While the right mattress may help stomach sleepers get a better night’s sleep, it is unlikely to completely erase all the possible drawbacks of stomach sleeping. Changing sleep positions may be the best way for stomach sleepers to improve their sleep in the long run. While changing your sleep position may seem daunting, there are some strategies that could make it easier. Using a body pillow is one way to transition away from stomach sleeping. A body pillow can help you prop yourself up on your side, and over time, you might be able to transition fully towards side sleeping. Using a cervical pillow can also encourage you to stay on your side or back rather than rolling onto your stomach during the night. Which Mattress Firmness is Best for Stomach Sleepers? The supportiveness of a mattress is influenced largely by the mattress’s firmness and the sleeper’s weight. A mattress that isn’t supportive enough for a may be perfectly supportive for a lighter individual. Mattress firmness is traditionally rated on a 10-point scale, in which 1 is the softest possible mattress and 10 is the firmest. Stomach sleepers usually prefer a slightly firmer feel than side sleepers in the same weight group. This is because firmer models can prevent a stomach sleeper’s midsection from sinking in too deeply, which can help improve their spinal alignment. Stomach sleepers who weigh between 130 and 230 pounds frequently favor a medium or medium firm model falling between 5 and 6 on the firmness scale. Mattresses in this range usually balance conforming and support. Stomach sleepers who weigh under 130 pounds usually prefer a softer feel to enjoy contouring and pressure relief, while sleepers who weigh over 230 pounds often favor a firmer feel to provide sufficient support without excessive sinkage. Assessing your weight and body shape may make it easier to determine what firmness is best for you. Which Type of Mattress is Best for Stomach Sleepers? The type of mattress that is may depend on your personal preference and the nature of the pain you’re experiencing. While individual models vary based on materials, construction, and quality, some commonalities usually exist between different models of the same type of mattress. Hybrid mattresses traditionally use different materials in their comfort and support layers. The comfort layer usually consists of polyfoam, memory foam, latex, wool, cotton, and/or micro-coils, while the support core is generally constructed of coils. Hybrid mattresses tend to provide an exceptional balance between conforming and support, which is usually beneficial for stomach sleepers. The comfort layers have cushioning for pressure points, while the support layers are often stable enough to prevent a stomach sleeper’s midsection from sinking in excessively. The main defining feature of an innerspring mattress is its layer of coils. There are several types of coils, including pocketed coils, Bonnell coils, offset coils, and continuous-wire coils. Innerspring mattresses may also have thin comfort layers to provide cushioning. Quality innerspring mattresses provide relatively even support throughout the mattress, so the midsection shouldn’t sag significantly. Latex mattresses can contain natural latex, synthetic latex, or a blend of both. The firmness and density of this foam often vary between mattress layers to adjust the overall feel of the surface. Talalay latex has a springier feel and is frequently used in comfort layers, while Dunlop latex has a denser feel and may be used in comfort or support layers. Latex mattresses spread the sleeper’s weight over a wider surface area than all-foam mattresses. While this provides pressure-relieving cradling, it doesn’t allow as much sinkage, which may promote better spinal alignment for stomach sleepers. Airbeds use air chambers that can be filled or emptied to adjust the firmness of the mattress. They may use a crank, remote control, or app to make these adjustments. Many airbeds have thin comfort layers of foam, latex, cotton, wool, or other materials to provide some surface-level cushioning, while the air chambers act as the support system. A sleeper can adjust an airbed’s firmness, allowing them to change the feel of the mattress if their needs and/or preferences change. Some airbeds also allow sleepers to adjust the firmness of each side of the bed, so it may be able to accommodate stomach sleepers and their partners, regardless of the partner’s sleep position and firmness preference. A foam mattress’s comfort layer may include memory foam, polyfoam, or layers or each. The support layer usually consists of firm polyfoam to reinforce the comfort layer. Most foam mattresses adjust to a sleeper’s body and position, which can relieve sharp pressure points associated with stomach sleeping. However, it is important to note that softer foam mattresses may allow a stomach sleeper’s midsection to sink in too deeply for proper alignment. Accessories Important For Sleeping on Your Stomach Maintaining proper spinal alignment requires more than just the right mattress. Stomach sleepers may also benefit from carefully selecting pillows and mattress toppers. The right sleep accessories can help provide stomach sleepers with a more restful and comfortable night’s sleep. A may make sleeping more comfortable, but for stomach sleepers, it could also further exacerbate neck strain. A pillow may force a stomach sleeper’s neck to extend backward. This can compress the spine, which could cause arm numbness. Because of this, some stomach sleepers prefer to sleep without a pillow. A mattress with soft comfort layers can provide cushioning and support while keeping the stomach sleeper’s spine better aligned. For stomach sleepers who choose to use a pillow, a low loft option is best. Thicker pillows may force the neck to extend even farther backward, putting additional pressure on the spine and leading to more aches and pains. In addition to a head pillow, some stomach sleepers may wish to use additional pillows to promote better spinal alignment and relieve aches and pains. Using a low loft pillow under your pelvis may help reduce pressure in the lower back and stomach region by preventing your midsection from excessive sinking. Placing a low loft pillow under your shoulders may help alleviate pressure in the upper spine and shoulder area by filling the open space between your neck and the mattress. While these pillow options may not be comfortable for everyone, stomach sleepers may want to try different pillow arrangements to see what works best for them. A topper rests on top of the mattress, modifying the feel of the surface. Toppers may be constructed of memory foam, polyfoam, convoluted foam, latex, down, down alternative, and/or wool. Since toppers are usually less expensive than buying a new mattress, many sleepers look to them as a short-term solution to fix the feel of an uncomfortable sleep surface. Since many toppers use memory foam, purchasing a topper is an easy way to try out the material before committing to a new mattress. While memory foam toppers do not provide all the benefits of a new memory foam mattress, they do offer the material’s popular pressure relief and hug. This is more pronounced in thicker toppers, which adjust the feeling of the mattress more significantly. While a mattress topper can be an affordable way for stomach sleepers to enjoy extra cushioning and conforming, they do not traditionally provide support. If your mattress is already sagging, a mattress topper will not help to even out the surface. However, if your mattress feels too hard, a topper might soften the surface. Similarly, if you are experiencing sharp pressure points, a thicker topper with good cradling may provide relief. What Mattress Features Are Important For Stomach Sleepers? A mattress’s features contribute to its performance. The following considerations are particularly important for stomach sleepers to keep in mind as they shop for a mattress. While some companies may refer to mattresses as having “universal comfort,” this simply means these mattresses are meant to satisfy most sleepers. However, stomach sleepers have unique needs, so they should assess a mattress’s features themselves to ensure it is appropriate for them. Stomach sleepers may enjoy any type of mattress. However, understanding the different types of mattresses can help you deduce what it is likely to feel like and what benefits it may offer. Most stomach sleepers prefer a balance of contouring and support. While contouring helps relieve pressure points caused by stomach sleeping, excessive conforming could place more strain on the spine. The quality of the materials can determine how long the mattress will last and how well it will wear. Sagging in the midsection of the mattress is of particular concern for stomach sleepers. High-quality materials often resist this tendency better, offering an even surface to support better spinal alignment. A mattress’s firmness level plays a role in how supportive it is for an individual. Lighter individuals often require softer mattresses to enjoy cradling, while heavier individuals frequently favor firmer models for greater support and less sinkage. Pressure relief ties closely to contouring. Mattresses that contour to the individual’s body help spread their weight more evenly across the surface of the mattress, thereby relieving pressure points. Stomach sleepers often experience pressure around their hips and shoulders, which may be relieved by the right mattress. Which Mattress Firmness is Best for Stomach Sleepers?

() There is a correlation between sleep and hypertension: sleep deprivation and disrupted sleep exacerbates the problem. The autonomous nervous system changes during sleep and that can affect blood pressure. () The worst position for sleep if you have high blood pressure is on your back. () A Japanese study on the effect of sleep position found that blood pressure was reduced significantly when lying in the prone position (face down) as compared to lying on the back.

If the pillow is too large behind the neck, however, it will force your head forward. While we sleep, as when we’re awake—and it’s not just conjuring dreams, it’s cleaning house.

Learn more about our process Sleeping on your side is considered to be the most common sleeping position. There are major benefits to side sleeping, including reduced back pain, improved breathing, and better digestion. This makes sleeping on your side beneficial for your overall health and well-being. The type of mattress you sleep on directly affects how much support and comfort you get each night. For people who have been sleeping on an older mattress, studies have shown that a new mattress can improve and reduce overall pain and stiffness. Side sleepers often experience shoulder pain and lower back pain if their mattress is unsupportive or uncomfortable. A mattress that contours to the shape of the body and provides pressure point relief is especially beneficial for side sleepers. These features reduce back and shoulder pain while cushioning the areas of the body that press deeper into the mattress. With so many different mattress types and features on the market, it can feel overwhelming to decide which mattress is right for you. We cover our top picks for the best mattresses for side sleepers and what sets them apart from other mattresses. We also include more on the benefits and drawbacks of sleeping on your side, and how this position affects sleep.  Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King Get $200 off + 2 Free Dream Pillows when you spend over $1,750 with code: SLEEPFOUND200 The Helix Midnight mattress was designed specifically with side sleepers in mind.

Sleeping on your side is highly regarded within the medical community, and its benefits are compelling. Not only does side sleeping open your airways and reduce snoring and symptoms of sleep apnea, but it may also improve brain health and help prevent certain neurological issues. For people with heartburn, and especially for pregnant women, sleeping on your left side has been shown to reduce . This sleeping position is also best for keeping your spine aligned, though there are measures you should take to ensure your body and spine get the proper support when sleeping on your side. Putting too much pressure on your neck, shoulders, and back can result in aches and pains. When the spine is aligned, it is in a straight, neutral position. If the spine is misaligned during sleep, this can result in back pain and other issues. Though side sleeping is the least likely position to exacerbate spinal pain and other symptoms, there are still precautions that should be taken to ensure the spine is aligned as you sleep. A contouring mattress responds proportionately to pressure points, cushioning the hips and shoulders. This helps keep the spine in neutral alignment. Side sleepers who maintain a are less likely to have back pain. This means sleeping on your side with your legs stretched out, and a higher loft pillow underneath your head. To keep your hips square, you may choose to sleep with a thinner pillow between your knees. The neck is part of the spine, so it is also important to keep your neck supported and resist tucking in your chin. These measures will help your spine maintain a neutral position. Since side sleepers put pressure on one shoulder as they sleep, they are more likely to experience . The added weight on the shoulder, especially if the mattress does not offer enough cushioning or contouring support, can result in neck and shoulder pain. Those who sleep on their side are also more likely to push one shoulder up towards their neck, which causes the spine to be misaligned. Purchasing a mattress with the right firmness is an essential step towards reducing shoulder pain for side sleepers. It is also important to keep in mind your weight, as lighter people will not press into the mattress as much, and will put more pressure on the mattress. The mattress should cushion the shoulder and prevent it from sinking in too deeply, or not enough. The right pillow can also make a difference. The loft of the pillow should be high enough to keep your head and neck in line, and help prevent your shoulder from pushing up towards your neck. For side sleepers with back problems, the right mattress can make all the difference. If a mattress does not contour to the shape of the body and provide ample support, this can cause a misalignment in the joints and the spine. As a result, your muscles can’t relax and have to work overtime to keep everything aligned. A contouring mattress, on the other hand, keeps the spine aligned and relieves joint pain. This keeps the hips and shoulders aligned as well. Some mattresses also have customized support for the lumbar region. The simplest way to determine if your back pain is caused by your mattress is to pay attention to your back pain throughout the day. If you wake up with back pain that subsides or lessens as the day goes on, your mattress is likely the culprit. The best mattress for side sleepers will provide a flat, even surface without any sagging or indentations. A responsive material, like memory foam, will cushion pressure points and keep the spine aligned. The mattress should provide full-body support to prevent back pain. Which Mattress Firmness is Best for Side Sleepers? Mattress firmness is a subjective measure of comfort, so whether you choose a soft or firm mattress for sleeping on your side will depend on several factors. Mattresses are usually rated on a firmness scale of 1 to 10, or extremely soft to extremely firm. Medium soft to medium firm mattresses are most common. For side sleepers, mattress firmness determines how cushioned the pressure points are. It affects how much the shoulders and hips sink into the mattress, which helps keep the spine aligned. A comfortable mattress will alleviate aches and pains. There are a few factors to consider when deciding on mattress firmness, including personal preferences, body weight, and mattress type. Heavier people press deeper into the mattress, so the same mattress may feel different to people depending on their weight and body type. The comfort layers affect the firmness and feel of the mattress. Memory foam conforms closely to the shape of the body, while latex offers gentle contouring with more bounce. Innerspring coils can add firmness to a mattress. Of the several types of mattresses available, each has benefits and drawbacks for side sleepers. The best mattress for side sleepers will offer consistent support and contouring comfort. Most mattresses fall into one of the following categories. These are the most common mattress types on the market today, and understanding the difference between each type is key to determining which mattress is right for you. Though specific mattress models will vary in materials, construction, and unique features, there are commonalities within each category that will help you decide what type of mattress best suits your needs. A hybrid mattress has an innerspring support system with thick comfort layers of memory foam or latex. Combining elements of these different types of mattresses into a hybrid design maximizes the benefits of each, with fewer drawbacks. A hybrid mattress may include a transition layer of polyfoam or micro coils beneath the foam comfort layers. The base of innerspring coils adds airflow and support to the mattress. Highlight: Contouring support with temperature regulation. Since a hybrid mattress has substantial comfort layers, it tends to provide contouring support that relieves pressure points and keeps the spine aligned. While an all-foam mattress can restrict airflow and retain heat, a hybrid mattress typically has better temperature regulation due to the innerspring coils. For side sleepers, this means conforming comfort without . An has a support base of steel coils, with thin comfort layers of fiber or foam. This traditional mattress style is minimalistic and offers less contouring than a hybrid or foam mattress. Widely available and easily recognizable, innerspring mattresses also tend to be affordable. The steel coil support base of an innerspring mattress can be reinforced for better edge support. This increases the supportive surface area of the bed, ensuring side sleepers who sleep near the edge of the bed experience consistent support. It also prevents sagging along the edges over time. A latex mattress is constructed with latex comfort layers and a latex support base. This type of mattress is most often made with natural latex, which is manufactured with sap harvested from rubber trees. The sap is then processed with the Dunlop or Talalay method. Dunlop latex is dense and durable, while Talalay latex is lighter and softer. Synthetic latex can also be used; this type of latex is made with petrochemicals. Latex gently contours to the shape of your body, alleviating pressure points while preventing the feeling of sinking in too deeply. For side sleepers, this reduces shoulder and back pain. There is also more airflow around the body and better temperature regulation. In an mattress, the support comes from internal rubber chambers that are inflatable. The firmness is adjustable by filling the chambers with air, or removing air as needed. Airbed mattresses are often remote-controlled or can be paired with a smartphone app. The built-in pump adjusts the chambers to your preference. This type of mattress usually has comfort layers of foam, latex, wool or other fibers. For side sleepers who are unsure of what their preferred firmness level is, or for those who find their needs change, an airbed mattress offers customizable firmness. Some airbed mattresses include two air chambers, so people who share the bed and have different preferences can adjust their sides individually. Certain models even include adjustability for different parts of the body. For side sleepers, this can mean adjusting the firmness under the shoulders and hips to keep the spine aligned. A foam mattress has comfort layers and a support base of foam. The comfort system is often made with memory foam layers, and can include traditional viscoelastic memory foam, open-cell foam, or gel-infused foam. The support base is usually constructed with high-density polyfoam for added support and durability. Memory foam contours closely to the body, responding to pressure and cushioning areas like the hips and shoulders. For side sleepers, this promotes proper spinal alignment and reduces aches and pains. A mattress that offers full-body support and contouring is the most important purchase for side sleepers. Further customizing the mattress with sleep accessories, including pillows and mattress toppers, can make side sleeping more comfortable. Pillows ensure the head and neck are aligned, while mattress toppers can change the comfort system of the bed. Understanding what to look for in these sleep accessories is important for both comfort and support. When sleeping on your side, a pillow for your head is necessary for spinal alignment. A medium or high loft pillow should lift your head enough to keep both your head and neck aligned with your spine. This relieves pressure on the neck and shoulders. The following table outlines the ideal pillow loft based on sleeping position. In addition to having a comfortable pillow under your head, knee pillows (or regular pillows) can be used to further customize your sleeping position and alleviate aches and pains. Side sleepers will benefit from drawing their legs up slightly toward their chest, and placing a pillow between their knees. This helps keep the hips square and spine aligned. A mattress topper is a comfort layer that sits on top of your existing mattress. Toppers are usually made with memory foam, latex, or other common comfort layer materials. Adding a thicker comfort layer to your current mattress can increase the level of contouring and pressure point relief your mattress provides. This helps to alleviate back and joint pain. Selecting a memory foam mattress topper gives you the chance to try out this material without committing to a new memory foam mattress. While you will not experience the full advantages of a memory foam mattress from just a topper, it is less expensive than purchasing an all-new mattress. It can also be a stepping stone to buying a new mattress if you decide you like the material. Before purchasing a mattress topper, be sure to evaluate the current condition of your mattress. A mattress topper will enhance the comfort of a mattress, but it will not offer support or fix a broken mattress. If your mattress is sagging or unsupportive, it is time for an all-new mattress. What Mattress Features Are Important For Side Sleepers? Due to added pressure put on the shoulders and hips, there are special considerations that side sleepers should keep in mind when shopping for a mattress. Mattress companies can often use misleading terminology, or exaggerate some of the benefits of unique features. The following factors are the most important to consider when shopping for a new mattress. : Each mattress type has pros and cons, but for side sleepers, it is important that the mattress offers contouring and full-body support. The type of mattress you purchase determines other key components, including temperature regulation, motion isolation, and pressure point relief. Understanding your priorities and preferences will help you select the right mattress type. How a mattress responds to pressure and conforms to the shape of your body determines how well it contours. A contouring mattress keeps the spine aligned and cushions pressure points, which are essential factors for side sleepers. The quality of materials used directly affects the durability of a mattress. While high-quality materials can be more expensive, they often increase the lifespan of a mattress and make it a more valuable investment. Cheaper materials can break down more quickly and offer less support over time. While this is a subjective measure of comfort, side sleepers need a balance of soft cushioning for the shoulders and hips and support to keep the spine aligned. Consider your personal preferences and weight as well, as these can affect which firmness level will provide the most comfort and support. Side sleeping puts pressure on the shoulders and hips. Contouring materials like memory foam and latex relieve pressure points and prevent shoulder and back pain for side sleepers. Which Mattress Firmness is Best for Side Sleepers?

Learn more about our process Sutera is an online pillow company based in the U.S. While the company started out producing the flagship Sutera orthopedic pillow, its product line has since expanded to include the Lavender Zen Pillow and the Hydroluna Pillowcase. The flagship Sutera Pillow provides ergonomic support through its contoured butterfly-shaped design. This unique build is intended to accommodate all sleep positions. The pillow is composed of solid memory foam to gently cradle the head and neck and help support the spine. It has a 5-inch loft and a medium firm feel. The Sutera Lavender Zen Pillow is constructed with aerated memory foam and infused with lavender essential oil. Shoppers can purchase Lavender Zen Mist spray to refresh the smell. We’ll focus on the flagship Sutera Pillow. We’ll assess its performance, explain its construction, break down its pricing, and summarize company policies to help you decide whether the Sutera Pillow is the best option for you. Use this SleepFoundation.org link for the most current discount on the Sutera pillows The Sutera Pillow is an orthopedic model with a distinct butterfly shape engineered to accommodate side, back, and stomach sleeping. Cutouts along the sides give stomach and side sleepers extra space to rest their arms, while the wings contour around a back sleeper’s neck for additional support. This pillow is made of solid to cradle the head and neck while promoting proper spinal alignment. A removable polyester cover encases the pillow to protect it. The cover is machine-washable for easy cleaning. There is only one loft and firmness option available for the Sutera Pillow. However, the 5-inch loft and the medium firm feel should accommodate a wide range of sleep positions and preferences. We’ll focus on the flagship Sutera Pillow, but we’ll also give some information on Sutera’s other model, the Lavender Zen Pillow, to help you decide which option might be right for you. While the Sutera might not be optimal for sleepers looking for a more traditional feel, its orthopedic design offers ergonomic support. The Sutera Pillow and the Lavender Zen Pillow each come in one size, and they measure slightly smaller than standard pillow dimensions. While both pillows are made of memory foam, they differ in shape, loft, and construction. Orthopedic pillows are usually more expensive than other varieties, typically costing between $40 and $200. The Sutera Pillow falls toward the lower end of this average price range. Price variations between models can be attributed to differences in size, materials, and quality. Rather than focusing solely on a pillow’s price, customers should keep in mind that the best value will balance price, quality, and performance. A more expensive pillow may be worth the extra money if it will last longer and feel more comfortable. Several key factors typically matter most when it comes to pillow performance. Durability, shape retention, conforming, and can all impact the comfort and usability of a model. The Sutera Pillow performs well overall. Our testers found its strengths to be shape retention and conforming. Since the Sutera gets its support from a solid piece of memory foam, it responds to the weight and heat of a sleeper’s head and neck to conform to their unique shape. Once the sleeper moves, the memory foam should return to its original form. For most shoppers, the Sutera Pillow’s greatest weakness will likely be the lack of firmness options. While the Sutera is carefully designed to accommodate all sleep positions, its medium firm feel may not be ideal for those who prefer a plush pillow or an exceptionally firm model. We’ll break down the flagship Sutera Pillow’s performance across all of our main performance categories. The Sutera’s memory foam construction should hold up well over time. This material tends to be quite durable. However, some impressions could form, particularly if you consistently sleep in the same position. With just one firmness, the Sutera does not offer much variety. While its medium firm feel should accommodate most individuals regardless of their body type and sleep position, those who prefer a plusher or firmer feel may want to look elsewhere. Unlike down and down alternative pillows, there is no need to fluff a memory foam pillow like the Sutera to refresh its shape. The memory foam will compress under the sleeper’s head and neck and then return to its original shape when the weight is removed. While lasting indentations could form over time, these shouldn’t be severe. While a sleeper can’t bunch or manipulate the Sutera as they would a down or down alternative pillow, the Sutera’s memory foam should naturally mold to the shape of their head and neck. This helps relieve pressure, but it doesn’t allow sleepers to control the shape of the pillow based on personal preferences. The Sutera’s memory foam conforms closely to the head and neck, cradling them to help relieve pressure and support the spine. This conforming is similar to that of other memory foam models. Memory foam has a reputation for trapping heat, but the Sutera should maintain a more neutral temperature than other foam pillows.. The memory foam in the Sutera is engineered to encourage airflow, while the medium firm feel limits sinkage. Air should circulate more freely around the sleeper to help dissipate heat. Synthetic foams often have smells that remain from the manufacturing process. Because of this, the Sutera may have a slight initial odor. Those who are sensitive to odors may want to leave the pillow in a well-ventilated room until it has aired out, which should take a few hours to a few days at most. Most look for a pillow with a medium to high loft and medium firmness to fill the gap between the bed and their head and neck, without forcing their head too far upward. This should feel comfortable while promoting proper spinal alignment. For most side sleepers, the Sutera Pillow fits the bill. At 5 inches thick, it is a medium loft model with a medium firm feel that should provide contouring while limiting sinkage. Additionally, its unique butterfly-shaped design gives side sleepers a spot to rest their arms. The Sutera is particularly suitable for side sleepers who weigh under 230 pounds. These individuals are likely to get a strong balance of contouring and support. Side sleepers who weigh over 230 pounds may prefer a firmer pillow for additional support, though individuals in this category may still find the Sutera Pillow to be comfortable. usually need a medium loft pillow to lift the head enough to align the spine without forcing it toward the chest. The Sutera’s medium loft and medium firm feel should be appropriate for most back sleepers. Those who weigh under 130 pounds will likely get exceptional support. Back sleepers who weigh over 130 pounds could sink into the pillow more deeply, but they should still get enough support to prevent notable strain or pressure. Back sleepers may also benefit from the Sutera’s ergonomic design. The butterfly shape gives extra support to the neck while limiting the potential for the head to fall to either side. : usually need thinner, softer pillows than those who favor other positions. While on the surface, the Sutera’s medium firm feel and medium loft may not seem ideal for this sleep position, its ergonomic butterfly-shaped design can be conducive to stomach sleeping. Individuals who weigh under 130 pounds are most likely to find the Sutera comfortable for stomach sleeping. They shouldn’t sink in too deeply, but the pillow will gently lift their head off the mattress while giving them a place for their arms. Those who weigh over 130 pounds may sink into the memory foam more deeply, which could make the orthopedic design feel somewhat more restrictive. However, they may appreciate the extra space for their arms.

With curiously constructed pillows designed to relieve everything from sinus pressure to snoring, it can be tough to know what, if anything, lives up to the hype. Consumer Reports asked two sleep doctors about the claims that a specialty pillow can lead to a better night’s sleep. Here’s what they said. From left: Anti-snore pillow, buckwheat-filled pillow, wedge-shaped pillow. It keeps the snorer on his side (chronic snorers tend to sleep on their backs), aligning head and shoulders for uninterrupted airflow and quiet breathing. More From Consumer Reports The Best Pillow for the Way You Sleep Best Mattresses of 2020 Best Foam Mattresses for $600 or Less  “When we sleep on our sides, we snore less,” says Raymond Hall, D.C., sleep-science expert and chiropractor who practices at Pacific Coast Sports Medicine in West Los Angeles. “So these can help, but I’d consider lots of other factors as well. Is the person overweight? Drinking alcohol before sleep? How are his sinuses? The pillow itself isn’t the be-all and end-all.” Michael Breus, Ph.D., a clinical psychologist and fellow of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine who is widely known as the Sleep Doctor, agrees. “These pillows can be effective, but they can also be uncomfortable. Check the return policy. If it doesn’t work in the first three to five nights, you’ll probably be sending it back."" It conforms to the shape of your head, keeping sweaty sleepers cool and dry. “Buckwheat pillows are form-fitting, molding to your neck and upper shoulders, but unless the buckwheat can be removed to change the height of the pillow, these won’t allow for spinal alignment,” Breus says. Hall says there is an upside: “One of the main reasons people wake up at night is that their head gets hot. So the fact that buckwheat can keep you cool is a plus.” But on balance he finds buckwheat pillows a bit ... arbitrary. “I’m not a big fan of amorphous happenstance situations where something like hulls or whatever have to form perfectly together to give you the right support.” Also, buckwheat pillows are known to be loud. “I tried one and couldn’t deal with the noise it made,” Breus says. It minimizes acid reflux and sinus pressure by angling the head, shoulders, and torso. “I love wedge pillows,” Breus says. “We use them in sleep medicine all the time.” Hall expands on the advantages of wedges: “The 20- to 30-degree elevation helps acid drain back into the stomach rather than sit in the throat, and puts less pressure on the head. They help people sleep better through flu and colds, too.” From left: Cervical pillow, water-filled pillow, large L-shaped pillow. It alleviates neck pain by supporting the natural curve of the neck.  “A lot depends on fit,” Breus says. “If you’re a back sleeper and a cervical pillow has too much height, it will push your head forward and compromise breathing. If you’re a side sleeper and the pillow doesn’t raise your head enough, or too much, it can cause neck pain rather than relieve it. It’s all about whether a given pillow achieves alignment.” Hall agrees that fit is key. He believes strongly in cervical pillows—so much so that he designed a line of them, which he sells online. His pillows are available in three sizes, to ensure the right fit. “A good cervical pillow lets you navigate from side to side while maintaining an optimal position. This is especially important during REM sleep, where we lose control of our muscles and the neck is prone to getting hurt. The right neck pillow can prevent injury.” It provides soothing support to reduce neck pain—and it’s adjustable; firmness is determined by the amount of water you add.  Hall is concerned about leaking but more so about the sleep experience. “Water can feel really hard—especially if the plastic it’s wrapped in doesn’t have much give. I used to have a water bed, and it never had adequate support. This is similar—the designs just aren’t that great.” Breus speculated that sleeping on a water pillow “might be a little loud” because your ear is pressed against it, which amplifies every crinkle of plastic and slosh of fluid. “But from a support perspective, this could be a winner if it could mold to your head and neck”—so the pliability of the plastic casing of a given water pillow is a big factor. Better neck, head, and shoulder placement and support for side sleepers—plus something to hug. “It’s a decent idea—a pseudo body pillow that supports the head and neck and wraps down in front of body for side sleepers,” Hall says. “It elevates the upper arm a bit, which is good, because when the elbows touch, that puts pressure on the shoulders. And as humans, we like support—we like to cuddle. But we move around 14 to 16 times a night, and a pillow like this might be difficult to reposition and navigate over.” Breus also sees pros and cons: “I like these a lot, because they can go between the legs to minimize hip strain. That’s especially great for pregnant women and those with lower back or hip pain. But they can put a barrier between you and your partner.” To get a good night's sleep, you also need a proper mattress that suits your size and sleep style (side, back, or a combination).

Body pillows are long, narrow pillows. Most sleepers choose to use them to prop up a leg while sleeping on their sides, which can help relieve pressure and align the hips and spine. While the name would suggest they are for the body, many sleepers also use them under their heads or arms for added comfort and support. How you use a body pillow may depend largely on its style. There are several different shapes and styles of body pillows, each of which carries distinct potential benefits. Some wrap around the body, while others rest on just one side of the sleeper. U-shaped and C-shaped pillows may appeal to those looking for full-body support, while rectangular pillows may be better suited to those simply looking to prop up their leg or lean against a pillow. Just as body pillows come in different shapes, they also contain different fills. A pillow’s fill can directly affect its support, cushioning, and breathability. Many sleepers may benefit from a body pillow, including back pain sufferers, pregnant women, side sleepers, stomach sleepers, and anyone who enjoys snuggling with a pillow. If you’re not sure if a body pillow is right for you, keep reading to learn more. With so many options, choosing the best body pillow for you requires weighing your priorities and assessing your options. The section below will explain some of the top factors that may influence your decision. The following criteria vary between body pillows, leading to differences in their performance and comfort levels. Focusing on these aspects of a body pillow may make it easier to find an option that fits your needs and preferences as closely as possible. As you shop, keep in mind that not all body pillows are ideal for all sleepers. Even if a company claims that its body pillow is universally comfortable, it may not be the best option for you. That’s why we recommend paying attention to the criteria that affect a pillow’s performance and keeping in mind which aspects are personally important to find the right pillow for your needs. Most body pillows measure between 48 and 54 inches in length. Shorter pillows may be ideal for sleepers who aren’t as tall or who don’t feel they need cushioning between their ankles. Longer body pillows may be better for taller individuals and those who want cushioning for more of their bodies. Body pillows also vary in width. Narrower pillows may allow a sleeper to wrap their arms and legs around them comfortably, while wider pillows may keep the sleeper’s limbs more uniformly elevated. Body pillows come in three main shapes: U-shaped, C-shaped, and rectangular. The U-shaped and C-shaped designs provide more full-body cradling, while rectangular pillows give one-sided support and cushioning. We’ll explain these shapes in more detail below. The fill of the pillow affects its feel, support, and breathability. Pillows may be made up of several different types of fill, including foam, latex, polyester, and down. The fill material can have important implications for a pillow’s performance, though some models use different construction techniques that set them apart from other pillows that use similar materials. On average, body pillows tend to weigh between 5 and 7 pounds, but you can find both lighter and heavier options. If you plan to rest the pillow on top of one of your arms or legs, a lightweight body pillow may be more comfortable. Lightweight options may also be easier to move and reposition. However, heavier pillows may feel more securely situated on your bed. The firmness of the body pillow affects its plushness and support. Some sleepers prefer a softer pillow for its extra cushioning, while others favor a firmer option for its added support. Which firmness option is best may also depend on your intended use. If you’re looking for a cushy body pillow to hug during the night, a soft pillow may be what you’re looking for. If you want a body pillow to drape your leg over while sleeping on your side, a firmer option may better support your alignment. Many side sleepers experience pressure between their knees as a result of one knee resting on top of the other. A body pillow wedged between the legs can help relieve this pressure by cushioning the knees and keeping them from pressing together. At the same time, body pillows can also help promote better spinal alignment, thereby limiting the strain and associated discomfort that side sleepers often experience in their hips, shoulders, and spines. Most body pillows run between $20 and $100, but you can find budget models for under $10 and luxury models for over $200. The price is usually reflective of the pillow’s materials and construction. Depending on your needs and intended use, any price point may be a good value for you. However, the lowest-priced body pillows may not last as long as some of the other options on the market. Quality materials can improve a body pillow’s performance and lifespan. While body pillows made of quality materials usually carry a higher ticket price, they may have better performance or a longer lifespan that justifies the added expense. Since body pillows typically press against the body, they could also impact a sleeper’s temperature. Memory foam is often prone to trapping heat, so body pillows that use the material and do not have sufficient temperature-regulating features may get too warm for people who tend to sleep hot. Fiber, latex, and down fill are typically more breathable. Anyone looking to adjust their sleep surface and enjoy support for more potential sleep positions may benefit from a body pillow. However, body pillows might appeal most to pregnant women, side sleepers, back pain sufferers, stomach sleepers, people recovering from surgery, and those with chronic pain. A pregnant woman’s belly adds weight around her midsection, which can create back discomfort. Doctors usually advise pregnant women to sleep on their sides, and a body pillow can make this more comfortable by providing extra support. C-shaped and U-shaped body pillows are especially popular for their distinct cradling sensation. Side sleepers often experience discomfort in their hips, shoulders, and knees as a result of their sleep position. Sleeping with a body pillow can help prevent the upper shoulder from slouching, separate the knees to limit pressure, and help keep the pelvis better aligned with the spine. Body pillows can help support the neck and spine, which may relieve back discomfort. This extra support may also enable the muscles to relax more fully, thereby preventing some of the aches and pains that typically occur when a sleeper unknowingly tenses their muscles to keep their spine aligned. Experts typically advise against sleeping on the stomach since it can lead to discomfort and strain. A body pillow can give avid stomach sleepers a similar sensation to stomach sleeping while propping them up on their side. Not only can this reduce some of the aches and pains associated with stomach sleeping, but it can also help train the sleeper to lie on their side instead. Discomfort from surgery may make it difficult for individuals to lie in their preferred sleep position. Those recovering from surgery can use a body pillow to try different positions while enjoying support and cushioning. Like those who are recovering from surgery, sleepers suffering from chronic pain may need to move around and sleep in more positions than the average sleeper. A body pillow can give the sleeper the support they need to explore different options, better equipping them to find the sleep position that’s best for their current symptoms. Because they would provide back sleepers with uneven support, most individuals who sleep exclusively on their backs steer clear of body pillows. That being said, back sleepers could use a rectangular body pillow as a head pillow, though the extra length may be unnecessary since a smaller pillow can typically accomplish the same task at a more affordable price. Body pillows come in a variety of styles and may use a wide array of fill materials. Each style and material has potential benefits that may make it better suited to some sleepers than others. U-Shaped pillows are especially appropriate for sleepers looking for the cradling sensation of having a pillow on either side of their body. Thanks to their support and versatility, U-shaped pillows are usually one of the most popular styles for pregnant women. Like U-shaped pillows, C-shaped body pillows provide support around more of the sleeper’s body. Typically, the pillow lies underneath the sleeper’s head, along the front of their body, and between their knees. This support for the head, neck, and knees may be especially appropriate for pregnant women and those who suffer from aches and pains in their knees, hips, necks, and backs. Rectangular body pillows look kind of like a conventional bed pillow that’s been stretched out. These long, narrow pillows can be used behind a side sleeper’s back for support or along their front to give them somewhere to rest the arm and leg that aren’t under their body. This is one of the most common body pillow shapes on the market. It’s also generally one of the most affordable, making it a solid option for shoppers who are looking for pressure relief and support on a budget. Body pillows may use either solid or shredded memory foam or polyfoam. Whether solid or shredded, both memory foam and polyfoam shape to the sleeper’s body for contouring and support. Polyfoam is typically more breathable than memory foam, so it may be a better option for those who tend to sleep hot. Though not as common, some body pillows use natural or synthetic latex. Latex is popular for its buoyant feel and its strong temperature regulation, which may make it especially well suited for people who change positions a lot during the night and those who are prone to overheating. Natural latex is also considered eco-friendly, so environmentally-conscious shoppers often prefer it. Many body pillows use fiber fill, and polyester is one of the most common types of fibers used today. Body pillows with fiber fill are usually breathable, making them well suited to people who usually sleep hot. Many are also hypoallergenic and washable, so allergy sufferers and others concerned with maintaining a clean sleep surface may prefer them. Down body pillows typically have a plush feel and strong temperature regulation. Since down is often associated with luxury and durability, shoppers looking for an exceptionally luxurious body pillow might consider it. However, pillows made of down may be more prone to lumpiness, spikiness, smells, and noisiness than some alternative options. They also tend to be less supportive, so sleepers may have to fluff their down body pillow frequently to keep it from going flat. What style of body pillow is best for specific needs? The best style of body pillow will depend on your specific needs and preferences. U-shaped and C-shaped body pillows may be a better choice for sleepers looking for full-body cradling, while rectangular body pillows are a strong option for those looking for one-sided support. Body pillows can cost under $10 or over $200, but most fall in the $20 to $100 price range. While low-cost options may look like a good deal on the surface, they sometimes use lower-quality materials that make them less durable. A higher-end body pillow may come at a higher initial price-point, but it could be a better value in the long run if you hope to use the pillow for years to come. Care instructions vary between body pillow models. Customers should follow these instructions carefully to preserve the longevity of their body pillow. Many body pillows have removable, machine washable covers for easy cleaning. Some pillows can also be laundered, but you should not attempt this unless the care instructions provide specific instructions because some fill materials will sustain damage if washed. You can purchase a body pillow in most stores that sell sleep accessories, including Amazon, home goods stores, department stores, and manufacturer websites. A body pillow’s life expectancy will vary based on its materials and construction. Like other pillows, body pillows can absorb oil and dead skin cells, which could attract dust mites. If the pillow is washable, regular laundering can help, but your body pillow may still go flat over time. In general, most pillows will last up to two years. However, body pillows made of durable materials like latex and down may last for much longer. There are a few adjustable body pillows on the market. Some pillows allow you to add and/or remove fill to adjust the feel or add and/or detach pieces to modify the shape. Most body pillows are not adjustable, but they can often be repositioned and manipulated to achieve the intended effect.

This company’s brands produce some of the most popular “As Seen on TV” products on the market today. The Copper Fit brand focuses on producing items infused with copper. This material is thought to protect against bacteria and odors, but some also believe it may have other health benefits, like reducing aches and pains. Most of the Copper Fit product line consists of wearables, including compression sleeves, socks, and gloves. The is currently Copper Fit’s only sleep accessory. This memory foam pillow shapes to the sleeper’s head and neck for comfortable support, while a copper-infused fabric case is designed to help limit bacterial growth. The pillow’s distinctive cutout design makes it easier for side sleepers to rest their arms in a more natural position. We’ll detail the Angel Sleeper Pillow’s construction, pricing, and performance. We’ll also walk you through some of the most important company policies for shoppers to consider before placing an order. Use this SleepFoundation.org link for the most current discount on the Copper Fit pillows The Angel Sleeper Pillow is middle-of-the-road when it comes to both firmness and thickness. It has a medium feel, which is in the range most side and back sleepers prefer. Similarly, it has a medium loft, measuring 5 inches thick. This should accommodate most side and back sleepers with small- to average-sized heads, but some individuals with larger heads may prefer a thicker model. As a memory foam pillow, the Angel Sleeper contours closely to the head and neck to limit pressure while supporting neck and spinal alignment. It won’t have the plush feel of many down or down alternative pillows, but it may be a good option for those concerned with support. The two traits that make the Angel Sleeper Pillow stand out most are its cutout sides and copper-infused cover. Side sleepers who struggle to find a place to rest their arms may appreciate these cutouts since they leave extra room near the head. Acne sufferers and people concerned with cleanliness and odors may like the copper cover since it is intended to inhibit bacterial growth. Copper also has strong thermal conductivity, which may help pull heat away from the sleeper. However, since the memory foam pillow could trap heat, the cover alone may not be able to regulate temperatures enough for hot sleepers. Overall, the Angel Sleeper Pillow is conforming, supportive, and innovative, and it’s likely to satisfy many sleepers. The table below details the specifics of the Angel Sleeper Pillow’s sizes, thickness, and materials. While the pillow comes in just one loft and firmness, shoppers can select between the two most common pillow sizes. Pillows can range in price from under $10 to over $200 depending on their quality and materials. Memory foam models typically fall towards the middle of this price range, averaging around $50 or $60 each. The Angel Sleeper’s price is in line with most similarly constructed models. Since it uses an innovative design and includes a copper-infused cover, it may be a better value than some equivalently priced memory foam models. While price is an important factor in any purchasing decision, shoppers should try to look at more than this criterion alone. Quality is often more critical since it can affect comfort and durability. Buying inexpensive pillows that need replacing every few months because they become flat or lumpy may ultimately cost more than purchasing a high-quality pillow that can last for a year or more. Shoppers are unlikely to find a pillow that excels in all performance categories. When assessing a model, it is most important to consider what factors you prioritize so that you can see how the pillow stacks up against your personal preferences. The Angel Sleeper performs well overall, but like any pillow, it has strengths and weaknesses that may make it more appropriate for some sleepers than others. Its most valuable trait may be its conforming. Not only can this help promote optimal spinal alignment, but it can also distribute the weight of the head more evenly to limit pressure points. The Angel Sleeper also earns strong marks in durability, shape retention, moldability, and odor potential. Its weakest areas are firmness options and temperature control, so it may not be ideal for people who prefer a softer or firmer model and those that sleep hot. The Angel Sleeper Pillow should hold up well over time. Like other memory foam models, however, it could develop lasting impressions, especially if you tend to sleep in the same position every night. Just one firmness option is available: medium. While this is likely to accommodate the vast majority of sleepers, those who prefer a plusher or firmer feel may need to look elsewhere. Memory foam models typically retain their shape well, and the same holds true of the Angel Sleeper. It should return to its original shape when pressure is removed, but indentations could form where you sleep on it most often. While the Angel Sleeper molds well to the shape of the head and neck, individuals accustomed to down or fiber pillows should be aware that the moldability of memory foam is very different. It automatically adjusts based on heat and weight rather than manual manipulation, so you don’t have to fluff it or bunch it like more conventional pillows. However, this can also mean that you have less control over the precise shape. Conforming is one of the Angel Sleeper’s biggest strengths. Its memory foam gently cradles the head and neck to support the spine while limiting pressure buildup. Most similarly constructed models should also excel in this category. Like most memory foam pillows, the Angel Sleeper may feel too warm to some people. Memory foam’s unique composition and close hug often retain heat, which is then trapped against the head and neck. For many individuals, this may not be a problem, but hot sleepers could find it uncomfortable. The copper-infused pillowcase may regulate temperatures to an extent, but this is unlikely to be significant enough to keep the pillow cool. The Angel Sleeper may have a slight initial odor, which is common for products that contain synthetic foam. However, this smell should air out within a few days. If you are sensitive to odors, you may prefer to leave the pillow in a separate well-ventilated room until it finishes off-gassing. The Angel Sleeper’s medium loft and feel are well suited for side sleeping. This pillow should be thick and supportive enough to fill the distance between the head and neck and the mattress to keep the spine aligned. The Angel Sleeper also has the added benefit of a cut-out to give side sleepers a place to rest their arms. Side sleepers who weigh under 230 pounds are likely to get the best support. Those who weigh more than 230 pounds may be more likely to have broader shoulders or larger heads, so the Angel Sleeper may not be thick or supportive enough for some individuals in this weight group, so it may be difficult for them to keep their necks and spines aligned. Back sleepers need a supportive pillow that prevents their head from slumping back, which could strain the neck and aggravate snoring. However, a pillow that is too thick and/or too firm could push the chin towards the chest and cause discomfort. Most back sleepers prefer medium to firm pillows with a medium loft. While the Angel Sleeper is an appropriate thickness for most back sleepers, its firmness falls towards the lower end of the ideal range. This may make it most comfortable for back sleepers who weigh less than 130 pounds. Those who weigh over 130 pounds may have heavier heads, which could sink more deeply into the Angel Sleeper’s memory foam. Individuals in this weight group may still find the Angel Sleeper comfortable, it may not be the ideal firmness for them. : Stomach sleepers usually need a softer, thinner pillow than those who favor other positions. A pillow that is too firm or too thick could push their head backward, putting pressure on their necks. The Angel Sleeper’s medium loft and medium firmness may be too much for stomach sleepers from all weight groups. However, some may enjoy its conforming and cushioning and appreciate the cutout space to rest their arms.

Learn more about our process Purple got its start in 2015 when it launched its first mattress. Since then, the company has steadily released new products, including four pillows to accompany their mattresses and sheets. The Purple Harmony Pillow is the company’s luxury pillow. It features the Purple Grid, a patented, specialty material known as a hyper-elastic polymer that is found in many Purple products, including its mattresses. The product line includes three pillows in addition to the Purple Harmony Pillow. , the flagship model, is made with 3 inches of the Purple Grid as well as two removable polyfoam bolsters that can add height and firmness. is made with interlocking balls of polyester and can be easily adjusted to give the pillow a firmer or softer feel. is a smaller, child-size version of the Purple Pillow with an internal composition made entirely of the Purple Grid. What distinguishes the Purple Harmony Pillow is its core, which is made with responsive Talalay latex. This latex is surrounded on all sides by the Purple Grid. With these materials working together, this pillow provides excellent comfort, pressure relief, and temperature regulation that suits most sleepers. We’ll cover everything you need to know about the Purple Harmony Pillow including its pricing, composition, performance, and how it compares to other Purple pillows. Use this SleepFoundation.org link for the most current discount on the Purple pillows The Purple Harmony Pillow is an excellent fit for sleepers who want a high-performance pillow made with durable materials. These materials maintain their shape while also contouring to the head and neck to provide pressure relief. Made with Talalay latex that is both soft and bouncy, the dependable latex core gives this pillow its overall structure. Surrounding the latex is the proprietary Purple Grid material that is designed to comfortably cradle the head and neck, making sure each area gets the support it needs. Latex and the Purple Grid are excellent at resisting heat retention because of their ability to permit considerable airflow for ventilation. The breathable mesh cover helps wick moisture from your head to better preserve a well-regulated temperature throughout the night. Customers can choose between two height options, allowing sleepers in most positions, and especially side and back sleepers, to find the right level of loft to meet their needs. The following sections cover the in-depth details of the Purple Harmony Pillow while also offering basic information about Purple’s other pillows to help you compare and contrast. A first step in evaluating a pillow is reviewing how it’s constructed, including its cover, fill, loft, and overall size. The Purple Harmony Pillow has two versions. The Standard model is 6.5 inches tall, and the Tall model is 7.5 inches tall. Both have the same length and width dimensions, 26” x 17”, which are comparable, although slightly smaller, than most standard pillows (26” x 20”). The construction and loft of the Purple Harmony Pillow offers a clear contrast relative to Purple’s other pillow offerings. Talalay Latex Core Purple Grid (Hyper-Elastic Polymer) top and bottom 3” Purple Grid (Hyper-Elastic Polymer) Multiple factors go into the price of a pillow. The type and quality of materials, its size, as well as its design and features can all influence its cost. Most pillows fall in a wide price range between $20 and $200. The Purple Harmony Pillow is a luxury model, which is reflected in its price. The flagship Purple Pillow costs slightly less, and the more economical Purple Plush Pillow, which does not include any of the hyper-elastic polymer Purple Grid, is the most affordable option. The most important thing to consider in a new pillow is its performance. After all, you’re counting on your pillow to keep you comfortable and supported so that you can wake up well-rested and pain-free. The Purple Harmony Pillow demonstrates strong performance in most categories. Its robust interior materials ensure excellent shape retention, making the loft level reliable and eliminating the need to frequently fluff the pillow. These materials also deliver a compelling blend of cushioning and resilience, cradling your head and neck lightly to relieve pressure without sagging, sinking, or feeling stuck. Both the latex and the Purple Grid are constructed with open spaces in the material. Air can move freely in these spaces, inviting cooling airflow for excellent temperature regulation. The blend of fibers in the cover contributes additional breathability along with a stretchy and soft feel. Talalay latex is well-regarded for its durability, and as the core of the Purple Harmony Pillow, facilitates an above-average ranking for durability. The Purple Grid, built to withstand heavy pressure in mattresses, also holds up well over time. Though the Purple Harmony Pillow doesn’t score as highly in moldability, firmness options, or odor potential, its strong performance in other categories makes it a worthy consideration for people looking for an all-around solid pillow constructed with high-quality materials. Talalay latex, which forms the central core of the Purple Harmony Pillow, has a well-earned reputation for durability. It resists sagging or wearing down, helping the pillow maintain its loft over potentially multiple years of use. The surrounding Purple Grid is also well-built and continues to perform well over time. The Purple Harmony Pillow has a medium-firm feel. It is not offered in any other firmness, and sleepers have little ability to modify this feel. Despite the broad appeal of medium-firm pillows, shoppers who want more adjustability are unlikely to be satisfied with the Purple Harmony Pillow. Strong shape retention is a standout feature of the Purple Harmony Pillow. The thick piece of Talalay latex in the center creates a strong foundation for the pillow’s shape, and the Purple Grid also excels at naturally retaking its original form when you’re not using the pillow. While the Purple Grid’s hyper-elastic polymer is somewhat moldable, allowing you to make minor adjustments to the pillow to suit your body, the latex core limits how much you can really mold the Purple Harmony Pillow. Both Talalay latex and the Purple Grid have impressive abilities to respond to the weight and pressure of your head and neck, conforming to your body in order to eliminate pressure points and foster a sense of comfort. At the same time, the strength of these materials prevents excess hug that some sleepers find off-putting. The hyper-elastic polymer creates open space in each square of the Purple Grid, allowing airflow and preventing the material from building up heat. The latex core is aerated with numerous tiny holes that invite cooling ventilation. Along with a breathable cover, these materials make temperature control a clear strength of this pillow. The material in the Purple Grid as well as the latex core both have some potential for generating a mild odor, especially in the few days after you’ve taken the pillow out of its packaging. In most cases, this smell dissipates within a week or so, but some people may find it bothersome. Sleeping position and body weight are two important considerations when looking for your perfect pillow. A pillow needs to suit the needs of your body, so reviewing how you sleep can help evaluate any pillow, including the Purple Harmony Pillow, and determine if it is right for you. People who sleep on their side need a pillow with a height that is roughly equal to the distance between their shoulder and head. A pillow that is too short will cause the neck to bend too far downward; one that is too tall will push the neck too far upward. The necessary amount of pillow loft can change based on how firm the mattress is, how much a person weighs, and how much their shoulder sinks into the bed. The Purple Harmony Pillow is a solid fit for because of its durable height and the Purple Grid’s ability to cradle and support the head and neck. Most side sleepers do best with the Standard, 6.5-inch model, but people with a bigger frame or wider shoulders should opt for the Tall, 7.5-inch model. When lying on your back, it’s important that your head not tilt too far up or down, which can overstretch and strain the neck. For this reason, usually prefer a medium-loft pillow that has enough firmness to resist sagging yet enough contouring to relieve pressure and tailor to fit their head and neck. The Purple Harmony Pillow checks all of these boxes, making it a quality option for most back sleepers. The latex core creates a stable base while the Purple Grid offers just the right amount of cradling to keep the neck comfortable and well-supported. In general, back sleepers should opt for the Standard, 6.5-inch model because the Tall model has too much loft for most back sleepers. : is the least common position, and it also brings certain risks for spinal alignment. Tall pillows can create an acute neck angle by forcing the head to bend far backward. This can be exacerbated if someone also turns their head to the side, which can add twisting to this excessive bend. Avoiding this problem typically means using a pillow with much lower loft and slightly less firmness than side or back sleepers. This allows the head to settle into a position that creates a more neutral angle for the neck and spine. Both versions of the Purple Harmony Pillow are too tall and firm for most stomach sleepers. They tend to perform worse for stomach sleepers over 130 pounds who sink further into the mattress as the greater distance between their upper torso and head can sharpen their neck angle on a tall pillow. Use this SleepFoundation.org link for the most current discount on the Purple pillows The Purple Harmony Pillow can be purchased directly from Purple on their website. Many Purple products, including pillows, are also sold through their retail partner, Mattress Firm; however, it’s best to check with local Mattress Firm locations to find out if the Purple Harmony Pillow is in stock.

How Often to Buy a New Mattress and Pillow for the Best Sleep Possible How Often to Buy a New Mattress and Pillow for the Best Sleep Possible Sinking into every night should feel so good that you practically have a mind-body orgasm. Buying a new mattress and pillow on the right schedule is a huge part of creating this kind of haven. But it can be far too easy to put off these purchases until your mattress and pillow are basically crumbling into heaps of foam and filling. (Unless buying a new mattress and pillow sparks joy for you, in which case you’re probably really on top of this.) There are several reasons why it’s not great to sleep on an ancient mattress or use a pillow that is giving up the ghost. This is how often experts recommend you replace your mattress and pillow—and why. Why you don't want to sleep on a super-old mattress or pillow First of all, using a worn-out mattress or pillow might inflame health conditions like allergies and asthma, Neomi Shah, M.D., associate professor of sleep medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, tells SELF. This is because your mattress and pillow can harbor allergens like , which are microscopic creatures that feed off your dead skin, according to the . Dust mites can kick off the physiological processes behind and symptoms, and if these critters die in your mattress or pillow, they can build up over the course of years. This is especially true if you’re not using . Then there’s the way that having a super old mattress and pillow can screw with your neck and back, causing you pain when you wake up, Mona Zall, D.O., an interventional spine orthopedist at Cedars-Sinai Kerlan-Jobe Institute in Los Angeles, tells SELF. Some people even develop pain from this that rouses them at night, Dr. Shah says. This can disturb your sleep, as can tossing and turning because your mattress or pillow isn’t doing its job. In a perfect world, your and pillow would text you a heads-up when it’s time to put them to pasture, preferably with a 50 percent off coupon for your next ones. Sadly, that’s not going to happen, so you have to keep more general guidelines in mind. Overall, the says that mattresses are good for about eight years. However, it might be smart to get a new one sooner than that if you’re over 40 because your body may need more support as you sleep, the organization says. As for your pillows, the says it’s often best to get new ones every two years. There is something to be said for generally sticking to these guidelines, which might mean you’re buying a new mattress or pillow when the old one still feels pretty good. Doing this can help you avoid the negative health effects that can creep up when your mattress and pillow are too old. If you start to experience these health consequences, it might take time for you to realize your mattress or pillow is the cause, which could add up to unnecessary stress, sleep disturbances, and . With that said, everyone is different. It’s not like your mattress and pillow will go bad on a specific date. They’re not cheese, and we should all be thankful for that. If you bought a stellar mattress nine years ago and aren’t dealing with any negative effects, well, cool. Mattresses especially can get really expensive, so we’re not telling you to buy a new one needlessly if there really is no reason to make that purchase. But keeping those guidelines in mind is always a good idea. What’s even more important, though, is paying attention to physical signs that you might need a new mattress or pillow no matter where you are in that timeline. If you find that you’re experiencing the following issues, it’s probably time to consider buying a new mattress or pillow ASAP. This is one of the biggest tip-offs that it’s time to change your mattress or pillow, Dr. Zall says. Back and neck pain can strike at any point in your day for a multitude of reasons, but waking up sore in these spots is usually an indicator that you didn’t have enough support in your sleep, Dr. Zall says. There’s also the possibility that your pillow or mattress is too firm. (A lacking pillow may be the , whereas back pain is probably .) The says that worn or sagging spots on your mattress signal a lack of the support you need in order to sleep comfortably and not experience related pain during the day. “You may even feel like you get stuck in your bed and that it’s harder than it should be to change positions,” Dr. Zall says. If you sleep with someone else and end up rolling around whenever they shift in bed, this is another sign that your mattress isn’t offering enough support, according to the . Unless, of course, you have a water bed, in which case you’re exempt from this one. 4. You can see your body’s outline when you get out of bed. While this looks pretty cool, it’s a sign that your bed may have gotten way too soft to offer you the proper level of support, Dr. Shah says. Once you’re out of bed, your mattress should return to its original shape, she explains. (Again, there’s an exception here: If your bed is made of a material like memory foam, that slow fade of your body’s imprint is more normal.) If you’re constantly fluffing and smoothing your pillow into submission, it’s time to toss it. Using a pillow with these issues can result in insufficient neck support that leads to pain. Sure, hotel beds are supposed to feel like actual heaven on earth. But if you notice that you sleep like a baby away from home and toss all night in your own bed, that might be because your mattress or pillow isn’t living up to its full potential. Overall, the right time to buy a new mattress and pillow depends on different factors. Keeping a timeline in mind is great, but experts say that you shouldn’t ignore the signals your body might be sending you about your mattress and pillow. Given that it’s cheaper to swap out pillows than it is to buy a new mattress, you might want to start there if things don’t feel right, Dr. Shah says. And before actually coughing up the money for a new mattress before that time line is up, it may make sense to talk to your doctor if you’re at all unsure that your current one is giving you problems. A good physician will want to help you get the restful sleep you need. 6 Ways Your Mattress Could Be Negatively Affecting Your Health 8 Reasons You're Waking Up Mid-Sleep, and How to Fix Them Korin is a former New Yorker who now lives at the beach.

Learn more about our process Fibromyalgia is a common health condition that can contribute to widespread musculoskeletal pain. Many fibromyalgia sufferers are also more sensitive to temperature. Not only can the pain and temperature sensitivity associated with the condition lead to poor sleep, but fibromyalgia may also be linked to other sleep problems, including disruptive sleep, a lack of restorative sleep, and/or insomnia. Many individuals with fibromyalgia also suffer from sleep apnea and/or restless leg syndrome, making it even more difficult to get much-needed rest. While you should consult your doctor for a treatment plan, quality sleep is important regardless of underlying medical conditions. The best mattresses for fibromyalgia can help support better sleep, which may help fibromyalgia sufferers feel less daytime fatigue. In this guide, we’ll share information on our favorite mattresses for fibromyalgia. We’ll also detail important factors to consider as you shop for the best mattress for you.  Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King Memory Plus Foam and Dynamic Foam work together to provide notable pressure relief Pocketed coil core cradles the body and limits sinkage Get $200 off + 2 Free Dream Pillows when you spend over $1,750 with code: SLEEPFOUND200 The hybrid Helix Midnight’s combination of support and conforming coupled with its low price point may make it appropriate for budget shoppers with fibromyalgia. A polyester cover encases the mattress. This cover is soft-to-the-touch, breathable, and slightly stretchy. The comfort layer consists of Memory Plus Foam, Helix’s take on memory foam. This material adjusts to the sleeper’s shape to relieve pressure. A polyfoam transition layer gives extra cushioning while acting as a barrier between the comfort and support layers. The support core uses wrapped coils, giving bounce while limiting motion transfer. Airflow through the coil system helps keep the bed cooler. This layer also has perimeter reinforcement to create a sturdy edge. A base layer of polyfoam supports the coil core. A Luxe version of the mattress is also available. This version uses a Tencel cover for enhanced breathability, a quilted pillow top for extra cushioning, and zoning in the coil layer for targeted spinal support. Rating around 6 on the firmness scale, the Helix Midnight has a medium feel. This should provide enough support for most sleepers who weigh under 230 pounds, especially if they sleep on their sides or backs. Individuals who weigh over 230 pounds may experience more sinkage, which may make it difficult to keep their spines well aligned. The Helix Midnight is protected by a 10-year limited warranty. A 100-night sleep trial gives you time to try the mattress at home.  Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King Those whose firmness preferences may change over time People who tend to sit or sleep near the edge of the bed Two-sided design with two firmness options accommodates changing needs Infusions of copper are intended to redistribute heat and prevent microbial growth Hybrid design combines pressure relief, motion isolation, and bounce Get $220 off a Layla Hybrid Mattress + 2 pillows, sheets, and protector FREE with code: SLEEPFOUNDATION People whose firmness preferences may change over time due to their fibromyalgia symptoms might appreciate the two firmness options of the Layla Hybrid. The Layla Hybrid is a flippable hybrid model with a different firmness on each side. One side has a medium-soft feel, rating around 4. The other side is firm, coming in around 7-8. Both sides of the mattress excel in edge support. The medium-soft side also performs well in motion isolation and pressure relief, while the firm side excels in temperature regulation, sex, and ease of movement. All sleepers who weigh under 130 pounds and side sleepers who weigh between 130 and 230 pounds may like the plusher feel of the medium-soft side. Individuals with any position preferences who weigh over 130 pounds may enjoy the firm side. The cover is constructed of polyester, viscose, and poly Lycra. This soft-to-the-touch material is also breathable to let air circulate through the mattress. Each side of the mattress has a memory foam comfort layer that adapts to the individual’s body shape to take pressure off areas prone to pressure buildup. The medium-soft side has a 2.5-inch layer of memory foam, while the firm side uses just 1 inch. A copper-gel infusion in each of these comfort layers transfers heat away from the sleeper’s body to keep the mattress surface cooler. Both sides also use a zoned polyfoam transition layer with firmer support near the middle of the bed. Deep channels in the foam let heat escape. The medium-soft side uses a 2-inch transition layer, and the firm side uses a 1.5-inch layer. The Layla Hybrid’s support core is made up of 6 inches of pocketed coils. These coils move independently to respond to changes in pressure without transferring excessive motion. Two rows of narrower coils line the perimeter to reinforce the edge. Sleepers can try the Layla Hybrid Mattress during a 120-night trial period. A 10-year warranty covers defects in materials and workmanship.  Medium Soft (4), Medium Firm (6), Firm (7-8)  Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King, Custom Sizes Couples looking for a balance between motion isolation and bounce Three firmness options to match different needs and preferences Phase change material, copper infusion, and other features designed for cooling Balanced performance with notable pressure relief, edge support, motion isolation, and more Get 20% off a Brooklyn Bedding Mattress with code: sleepfoundation20 The Brooklyn Bedding Aurora Hybrid is a luxury hybrid built for cooling, so it may be a good choice for people who are sensitive to temperature as a result of fibromyalgia. Its cooling features start in the cover, which is infused with a phase change molecule crafted to keep the skin temperature 88 degrees. Contouring and pressure relief comes from the 1.5-inch top layer of polyfoam. This material is infused with copper and a phase change molecule to help transfer heat away from the sleeper’s body. Next, a 2-inch layer of polyfoam gives extra cradling while responding quickly when the sleeper changes position. A 1-inch memory foam transition layer separates the comfort system from the core, giving deep compression support. Thanks to its gel swirl, this layer also contributes to cooling. The support core uses 8 inches of pocketed coils. Coils give the bed more bounce, but they move independently of each other to limit motion transfer. Air can circulate between the coils, further cooling the sleep surface. A final 1-inch layer of polyfoam gives the coils a base to rest on. The Brooklyn Bedding Aurora Hybrid comes in three firmness options, which are called Soft, Medium, and Firm. Since the Soft version rates around 4 on the 10-point firmness scale, we consider it medium-soft. The Medium rates around 6, which could be classified as medium-firm. The Firm comes in between 7 and 8, making it truly firm. All three versions of the mattress excel in pressure relief. The Soft and Medium options also isolate motion quite well, while the Medium and Firm versions rate well for ease of movement, temperature neutrality, sex, and edge support. The Soft version of the mattress may be best suited for sleepers who weigh under 130 pounds. The Medium option performs well across weight groups, but stomach sleepers who weigh over 230 pounds may sink in too deeply. The Firm option can also accommodate all weight groups, though side sleepers who weigh under 130 pounds may experience more pressure buildup. A 10-year warranty protects against defects. The Aurora Hybrid also comes with a 120-night trial period.

While some foam mattresses trap heat, the Nola Original uses cooling materials that may make it more suitable for those with temperature sensitivity. The mattress cover is constructed of viscose, which is soft, breathable, and moisture-wicking to keep the sleeper cool and dry. A 2-inch layer of proprietary AirFoam polyfoam contours to the sleeper’s body to relieve pressure, but it springs back to its original shape more quickly than most memory foam. This comfort layer is also engineered to dissipate heat faster than memory foam. Next, the transition layer consists of 1 inch of polyfoam, which gives the bed a slight bounce while preventing sleepers from sinking in against the firm core. A 7-inch layer of polyfoam serves as the mattress’s core, providing support while allowing airflow. The Nolah Original Mattress has a medium feel, rating at a 5. This firmness is likely to provide an excellent blend of support and contouring for sleepers who weigh less than 130 pounds. Side sleepers who weigh between 130 and 230 may also like the plushness and cushioning. The mattress is likely to feel too soft to some individuals who weigh over 230 pounds. Pressure relief and motion isolation are some of the Nolah Original Mattress’s biggest strengths. The Nolah Original Mattress comes with a 120-night sleep trial and a 15-year limited warranty.  Medium (5), Medium Firm (6), Firm (7), Firm (8)  Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King Breathable cotton and Talalay latex and temperature-regulating wool reduce heat retention Get $100 off a PlushBeds Mattress with code: SF100 The PlushBeds Botanical Bliss is a latex model that cradles the sleeper’s body without allowing much sinkage. Fibromyalgia patients who have difficulty moving on a bed with more hug may like the Botanical Bliss’s mixture of pressure relief and ease of movement. Multiple options are available when purchasing the Botanical Bliss Mattress. Customers can select between three thickness options: 9 inches, 10 inches, and 12 inches. They can also choose between two firmness options: medium (5) and firm (7-8). Note that Botanical Bliss refers to the firm option as “Medium-Firm.” Owners can modify the firmness of their mattress at home by unzipping the cover and repositioning the layers. A knitted organic cotton cover encases the bed. This material absorbs moisture and allows airflow to keep the sleep surface cool and dry. It’s also soft to the touch. Next, a layer of organic wool adds to the Botanical Bliss’s temperature regulation and moisture-wicking. The 9-inch version of the mattress uses one 2-inch layer and two 3-inch layers of Dunlop latex. Three 3-inch layers are used in the 10-inch version. The 12-inch version uses four 3-inch layers. Dunlop latex offers cradling and pressure relief with a buoyant feel. While the material contours to the sleeper’s body, it spreads the compression over a wider area. This leads to a sensation more akin to floating than sinking. Temperature regulation, ease of movement, pressure relief, edge support, and sex are some of the biggest strengths of the Botanical Bliss. Sleepers who weigh under 230 pounds may enjoy the medium version of the mattress, while those who weigh over 130 pounds might like the firm version. Those who weigh between 130 and 230 pounds may find either firmness comfortable depending on their personal preferences. A 25-year limited warranty covers qualifying defects. The Botanical Bliss also has a 100-night trial period. Read our Full PlushBeds Botanical Bliss Review to learn more  Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King Sleepers who awaken easily when their partner moves during the night Layers of premium foam conform to the body for pressure relief Get $200 off a Casper Wave Hybrid Mattress with code: SLEEPFOUNDATION Engineered for support and cooling, the Casper Wave Hybrid’s close conforming helps relieve pressure without trapping much heat. People who suffer from fibromyalgia-related pain and temperature sensitivity may appreciate this combination. The cover uses a mixture of materials, including recycled polyester, polyester, rayon, Lycra, and upcycled cotton, giving it breathability and slight stretch. The Wave Hybrid features three layers in its comfort system, starting with a small layer of poly foam to give the surface a conforming feel. Under that is a layer of aerated latex, which has a responsive feel and doesn’t trap a ton of body heat. Below that is a zoned memory foam layer, which conforms to the back and shoulders while supporting the mid-section. The transition layer is made of gel-infused polyfoam and is also zoned. Individually-pocketed coils in the support core give the mattress bounce while allowing ample airflow. A layer of foam wraps around the outside of the layer to reinforce the edge. The Wave Hybrid has a medium feel, coming in around 5 on the 10-point firmness scale. Because this is on the softer end of the range most sleepers tend to prefer, it may be best suited for sleepers under 230 pounds, particularly those who sleep on their sides or backs. Those who weigh over 230 pounds may sink in more than ideal for optimal spinal alignment, especially when sleeping on their stomachs. Thanks to its medium feel and close hug, the Wave Hybrid excels in motion isolation and pressure relief. Its cooling features also help it maintain a more neutral temperature than most close-conforming mattress models. The Casper Wave Hybrid comes with a 10-year limited warranty. Customers can try the mattress at home with the 100-night trial period. Read our Full Casper Wave Hybrid Review to learn more When purchasing a mattress, shoppers should take into account the things that impact their sleep. For many individuals, sleep position and weight are the biggest factors, but people with fibromyalgia should also consider their symptoms. In this section, we’ll highlight some of the most important things to examine when selecting a mattress. The following factors can play a role in which mattress is best for an individual. While some mattress companies may claim their mattress is universally comfortable, it is important to remember that comfort is subjective. What is comfortable for another person may not be comfortable for you. Considering your fibromyalgia symptoms and how each factor may affect them can help you select the best mattress for you. For many individuals, price may be one of the main deciding factors in their mattress purchase. While low-priced options are appealing, higher-priced models may also be a good value. More expensive mattresses may carry a higher sticker price due to their quality materials and durable builds. A mattress in any price range may be suitable for fibromyalgia sufferers, but shoppers may also want to set money aside for mattress accessories. Those with fibromyalgia may enjoy a mattress topper for extra cushioning, breathable sheets for more temperature regulation, and/or additional pillows to accommodate changing aches and pains. High-quality materials often make a mattress more expensive, but they can have distinct advantages. Some materials are specially engineered to regulate temperatures, relieve pressure points, and/or support proper spinal alignment. Quality materials also frequently last longer than lower-quality materials. A mattress’s firmness influences how much contouring and support an individual will experience. People with fibromyalgia may wish to select their mattress firmness carefully to ensure they enjoy the best balance of contouring and support. Models that are too soft may not support the sleeper’s natural spinal alignment, while mattresses that are too firm could contribute to pressure buildup. The ideal firmness varies based on an individual’s weight, sleep position, and personal preferences. As a general rule, lighter individuals usually prefer softer models and heavier individuals generally favor firmer models. When an individual lies down, their wider, heavier body parts generally put more force on the mattress. On some mattresses, this could lead to pressure buildup. Any sleeper could experience aches and pains as a result of pressure points. However, since people with fibromyalgia usually already experience significant pain, added discomfort could be more problematic for them. Therefore, those suffering from fibromyalgia are likely to prefer a mattress with strong pressure relief. A sturdy edge can make it easier to use the full surface of the mattress. This may be important to couples who want the extra space that sleeping close to the perimeter of the bed affords. Fibromyalgia sufferers whose pains make it harder to get into or out of bed may also prefer a strong perimeter so that they can sit near the edge of the bed without it feeling unstable. Contouring refers to how a mattress adjusts to the sleeper’s body shape. Mattresses with more contouring often have strong pressure relief. However, close contouring can also make it more difficult for some individuals to change positions on a bed. People with fibromyalgia may appreciate pressure relief from contouring, but those who have mobility issues and like to change positions during the night may find close contouring somewhat restrictive. People with fibromyalgia are often sensitive to temperature. Some mattress models trap heat, which could make a comfortable night’s sleep more challenging. Memory foam is usually most associated with heat retention, but many memory foam models use special materials and construction techniques to keep the sleep surface cooler. Innerspring, hybrid, and latex models tend to be breathable, which allows heat to dissipate away from the sleeper’s body. People with fibromyalgia may change positions throughout the night in order to find the most comfortable sleep position. Some mattresses are easier to move on than others, so fibromyalgia sufferers with mobility issues may prefer a model that rates well for ease of movement. Memory foam often hugs closely to the sleeper’s body and usually responds relatively slowly to changes in pressure, which could contribute to a “trapped in the bed” feel. Mattresses that use foams engineered for responsiveness, latex, and/or coils are usually easier to move on. Different types of mattresses vary in their performance. Those with fibromyalgia may like any type of mattress depending on their personal preferences. However, paying attention to the traits of each mattress type may make it easier for people with fibromyalgia to select a model that meets their needs. Most mattress models can be classified as one of five main types: hybrid, innerspring, latex, airbed, or foam. Performance varies between individual models due to their unique materials, quality, and construction techniques, but mattresses within the same category tend to share some similarities. Hybrid mattresses use a combination of two or more materials. The support core is constructed of coils, while the comfort layer may include memory foam, polyfoam, latex, microcoils, and/or other materials. Contouring and Breathability. People with fibromyalgia may prefer a model with good contouring to help relieve their pressure points. However, close conforming can also trap heat. The comfort layers of most hybrid models cradle the sleeper to relieve pressure, while their coil cores tend to allow significant airflow to allow heat to dissipate. The main feature of an innerspring model is its coil system. This layer makes up the bulk of the mattress, though some models also include thin comfort layers. Responsiveness. Innerspring models usually have a springy feel that makes it easier to move on the bed. People who frequently change positions due to their fibromyalgia pain may like the responsive feel of most innerspring models. Made from the sap of rubber trees, natural latex foam can be fabricated using either the Talalay or Dunlop process. Talalay is usually springier and more breathable, while Dunlop tends to be denser and more durable. Some models also use synthetic or blended latex. Weightless Pressure Relief. The low point elasticity of latex means that it compresses over a wider area when weight is applied. This redistributes the sleeper’s weight to relieve pressure buildup with what many sleepers liken to a floating sensation. People with fibromyalgia who like pressure relief without a lot of hug may find latex models ideal. Airbeds use air chambers as their support system. Depending on the model, the sleeper can fill or empty the chambers using a remote, an app, or a crank. Some airbeds also have thin comfort layers to soften the surface of the mattress. Adjustability. Emptying or filling an airbed’s chambers adjust the firmness of the sleep surface. Since fibromyalgia symptoms can change over time, this adjustability may give individuals more flexibility to cater their sleep surface to meet their current needs, even if they change every night. Foam models may include multiple types of foam, including memory foam and polyfoam. Memory foam is most often used in the comfort and/or transition layer, while polyfoam may be used in the comfort layer, transition layer, and/or support core. Pressure Relief and Motion Isolation. All-foam models usually hug closely to the sleeper’s body to reduce pressure buildup around the shoulders and hips. They also tend to absorb motion, which reduces the vibrations a sleeper feels when their partner moves. Individuals who awaken easily or experience pains as a result of their fibromyalgia may like this combination of pressure relief and motion isolation. The symptoms of fibromyalgia can impair sleep in several different ways. Widespread pain is one of the most common symptoms associated with fibromyalgia. As with any condition that causes pain, fibromyalgia may make it more difficult to fall asleep and/or stay asleep. Temperature sensitivity common with the condition could also lead to discomfort. Psychology Today also notes that sleep problems are now viewed as one of the main characteristics of fibromyalgia. Those with fibromyalgia may experience insomnia, disruptive sleep, and/or a lack of restorative sleep. Further exacerbating the issue, people with fibromyalgia also frequently suffer from other disorders that can interrupt sleep, like sleep apnea and restless leg syndrome. A study published in Nature Reviews Rheumatology suggests that poor sleep quality may be both a cause and a result of pain, creating a vicious cycle. With so many symptoms that can impact sleep, it should come as no surprise that many people with fibromyalgia experience daytime fatigue. While mattresses can’t relieve all the symptoms associated with fibromyalgia, the right mattress could help fibromyalgia sufferers get more restful sleep by limiting other factors that could interrupt sleep. Heat retention, motion transfer, noise, lack of support, and pressure buildup could interfere with sleep, and the right mattress could help minimize these. How Does Sleep Position Affect Fibromyalgia Sufferers? The position an individual sleeps in can affect the pain they experience. Each position has certain potential benefits and drawbacks. People with fibromyalgia often select their sleep position based on their current aches and pains, but that sleep position could have unforeseen consequences. Many individuals with fibromyalgia may find sleeping on their backs comfortable. The right mattress can support proper spinal alignment and reduce spinal strain by allowing the sleeper’s hips to sink in just the right amount. While opinions vary between individuals, some sleepers feel that sleeping on their backs reduces lower-back pain. Fibromyalgia patients who experience more back pain when sleeping in the position might consider using a pillow under their knees. Back sleeping may be more problematic for fibromyalgia sufferers who also snore or have sleep apnea since this position may worsen symptoms. However, propping up the upper body with a wedge pillow may help. Back sleepers tend to prefer a slightly firmer mattress that doesn’t let their hips sink in too far. Too soft of a mattress could strain the sleeper’s lower back, while too firm of a mattress could contribute to pressure buildup. The wider areas of a side sleeper press harder on the mattress than the rest of their body. Some mattresses redistribute the sleeper’s weight to reduce pressure on key areas, like their hips and shoulders. Side sleepers with fibromyalgia are likely to prefer a mattress that cradles their curves to reduce pressure buildup and support their spinal alignment. As with any sleep position, finding the right firmness is critical. A side sleeper’s hips and shoulders could sink too deeply into an overly soft mattress, which could put the spine out of alignment. Too firm of a mattress could contribute to pressure points and put a strain on the sleeper’s lumbar region. Since side sleepers’ legs rest on top of each other, any side sleeper could also experience hip and knee discomfort, but this may be more pronounced for people with fibromyalgia. A pillow placed between the knees may make the position more comfortable for some individuals. Sleeping on your stomach can strain the spine and neck, so it generally isn’t advisable. However, many people with fibromyalgia may choose to sleep in whichever position feels the best that night. The bulk of a person’s weight is usually centered around a person’s belly and hips. When sleeping on their stomach, this weight can pull their midsection into the mattress and put a strain on the lumbar region. Stomach sleepers also generally turn their heads to the side, which may lead to neck strain. A thick pillow could further exacerbate this neck strain by forcing it to extend backward. If you frequently sleep on your stomach, some methods might help limit strain and discomfort. A firmer mattress may be more supportive of the sleeper’s hips and promote better spinal alignment. Many stomach sleepers also choose to use no pillow or a very thin pillow to reduce neck strain. Stomach sleepers might also transition away from the position by using a body pillow to prop themselves onto their sides. Alternating between multiple sleep positions may help those with fibromyalgia sleep more comfortably by switching which body parts experience pressure. Combination sleepers may experience both the pros and cons of each sleep position they employ. Last Things to Consider with a Mattress for Fibromyalgia While we’ve discussed some of the main factors that may influence your mattress decision, you may still have some questions. Here are a few more things to consider while you shop. Mattresses come in a wide range of price points, so individuals with fibromyalgia may be able to find a budget-friendly option that provides relief. If you don’t want to replace your mattress, you can also purchase accessories that may make the sleep surface more comfortable. People who have temperature sensitivity may benefit from a cooling pillow or sleepwear, breathable sheets, and/or a fan. Those who have aches and pains may like a mattress topper for extra cushioning and/or a selection of pillows to give them more options. Most mattress models cost between a few hundred and a few thousand dollars, so how much of an investment you make depends on what you’re comfortable with. Lower-cost options frequently perform well, but some breakdown more quickly. Higher-end models may feature advanced materials to enhance the mattress’s performance, and they are often more durable. The warranty, sleep trial, and shipping options might ultimately influence your mattress selection. Mattresses generally come with a warranty that protects against certain defects. Understanding what’s covered, how long the coverage lasts, and what you need to do to ensure you don’t void the policy may give you a better idea of what to expect. Direct-to-consumer mattresses also generally come with a sleep trial during which customers can try the mattress at home and return it if they are not satisfied. People with fibromyalgia may prefer a mattress with a generous trial period so that they can see how the mattress performs with their symptoms. Shipping policies may also be worth considering. If your fibromyalgia pain would make it difficult for you to move the mattress to your room of choice and unpack it, you may wish to look for a company that offers White Glove delivery.

The 14-inch Midnight Luxe is a hybrid mattress designed for side sleepers, with thick memory foam and polyfoam comfort layers that cushion the shoulders and hips. We rate it as a medium firm, or a 6 out of 10 on the firmness scale. The company’s Luxe mattresses are 2 inches taller than their counterparts and feature a memory foam pillow-top with a Tencel cover. Tencel is a breathable plant-based fabric that wicks away moisture from your body, letting it disperse through the coils for a cooler sleep. The additional memory foam adds a plush, cushioning feel right as you lie down. Thanks to its hybrid construction, the Midnight Luxe manages to prevent most motion transfer while still providing a responsive surface that doesn’t hinder movement. The pocketed coils are reinforced in the lumbar area and around the edges. The mattress has a symmetrical design, so it can be rotated from head to foot to increase the pillow-top’s longevity without adversely affecting its performance. Helix Luxe mattresses are CertiPUR-US and OEKO-TEX Standard 100 certified, meaning they’re free of harmful substances. Helix offers a 100-night sleep trial and a 15-year warranty for the Luxe mattresses. Shipping is free in the U.S., with an additional fee for Canada.

The DreamCloud’s firmness level is rated as a medium firm, or 6 out of 10 on the firmness scale. The foam layers under the cover conform to the body’s curves, but the mattress gets progressively firmer and the individually-wrapped coils ensure a stable foundation that keeps the spine on an even plane. Higher-gauge coils reinforce the edges, reducing sinkage despite the thick comfort layer section. While the DreamCloud isn’t outstanding at reducing motion transfer, it has a bouncy surface that couples will love for sex. The mattress also sleeps cool, thanks to the moisture-wicking cashmere cover and the hybrid design that allows heat to dissipate through the coils. DreamCloud offers a 365-night sleep trial, allowing plenty of time to test out the mattress in all four seasons before committing to the purchase. The mattress ships free to the contiguous U.S. and is backed by a lifetime warranty.  Soft (2-3), Medium Firm (6), Firm (7-8)  Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, Split King, California King, Split Cal King Shoppers looking for a mattress with firmness and thickness options 3-inch Euro-top adds luxurious cushioning for a side sleepers hips and shoulders Two layers of coils enhance the responsiveness and breathability Get $200 off when you spend $1,000 or more at Saatva.com Pillow-top innersprings have earned a somewhat negative reputation for feeling too stiff despite their cushioning surfaces. The Saatva Classic builds on the classic design with some innovative features that cater to a wide range of people regardless of their body type, sleep position, and firmness preferences. A pillow-top containing layers of memory foam and adaptive polyfoam allows the Saatva to contour more closely than the average innerspring. The mattress also features a pocketed microcoil transitional layer and a bonnell coil support core. This coil-on-coil design creates a bouncy feel on the surface without making the mattress feel too stiff. The coil layers also promote steady airflow throughout the mattress core to maintain a comfortable temperature – a major asset for hot sleepers. You can choose between soft (3), medium firm (6), and firm (7) feels for the mattress, depending on your ideal level of support, as well as a 11.5-inch or 14.5-inch profile. The soft feel and lower profile are best suited to side sleepers and those who weigh 130 pounds or less, while those who weigh more – especially back and stomach sleepers – will probably find the firmer feels and 14.5-inch profile more comfortable. Saatva is one of the few online mattress brands to offer free White Glove delivery anywhere in the contiguous U.S. This service includes in-home assembly in a room of your choice and old mattress removal at no extra charge. The company also offers a 180-night sleep trial, one of the longest in the mattress industry, and a 15-year warranty for the mattress.  Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King People who prefer sleeping on high-profile mattresses Those who would rather not set up their mattress themselves BlackICE 4.0 system includes heat-wicking materials and cool-to-the-touch fabrics Use this SleepFoundation.org link for the most current discount on Beautyrest mattresses The Beautyrest Black is a quintessential luxury pillow-top mattress. This high-profile model is constructed with at least four foam layers that provide close body-contouring and pressure relief. The mattress has a medium (5) feel, but its sturdy pocketed coil system delivers edge-to-edge support and prevents excessive sinkage for people who weigh up to 230 pounds. Beautyrest offers a couple of customization options based on your ideal levels of conforming and temperature control. The “Cooling Upgrade” includes a layer of memory foam infused with carbon fibers intended to draw heat away from your body and help the surface stay cool. The “Cooling + Comfort” upgrade adds an additional memory foam layer for even deeper contouring, which can be particularly helpful for side sleepers who experience pressure points in the shoulders, lower back, or hips. Standard Beautyrest Black models measure 13 inches thick. With the Cooling + Comfort upgrade, the profile increases to 15 inches. Either height should be suitable for people who prefer thicker mattresses. Although this mattress has a fairly high price-point, Beautyrest offsets your up-front costs a bit by providing free White Glove delivery for all orders, including in-home assembly and old mattress removal. The mattress also comes with a 100-night sleep trial and a 10-year warranty. Read our Full Beautyrest Black Review to learn more A pillow-top mattress gets its name from the extra layer, resembling a pillow, that is permanently attached to the top of the outer cover. This layer is usually between 2 and 4 inches thick and consists of materials such as memory foam, polyfoam, fiberfill, latex, or cotton. The separation between the pillow-top and the rest of the mattress tends to be clearly visible from the outside, with many mattresses leaving a gap between the edge of the pillow-top and the edge of the mattress. Pillow-tops sometimes, but not always, have a cover made of a different material than the rest of the mattress, such as silk or Tencel. Pillow-tops can either add extra cushioning or make the mattress more responsive. You’ll usually only see them on innerspring or hybrid mattresses, the aim being to supply the mattress with a larger comfort layer section to complement the coils. Euro-tops are a type of pillow-top that are more integrated into the mattress. They may still have piping to differentiate them from the standard comfort layers, but typically the edges are stitched in and flush with the rest of the mattress. Like standard pillow-tops, Euro-tops can be anywhere between 2 and 4 inches thick. They typically feature denser materials instead of the extra-plush fill of a standard pillow-top. Because they don’t have the gap around the perimeter, Euro-top mattresses commonly have better edge support than standard pillow-top mattresses They also tend to be more durable and made of better-quality materials. All of these factors mean that Euro-top mattresses are usually more expensive than standard pillow-top mattresses. Memory foam, latex, polyfoam, silk, cotton, fiberfill, wool There’s a wealth of pillow-top options on the market, so it’s important to know what you value in your mattress before you set out to buy a new one. Do you prefer a standard or Euro pillow-top? Memory foam, latex, or another type of fill? Hybrid or innerspring mattress? In addition to the pillow-top itself, it’s also important to consider the benefits of the mattress as a whole. This means weighing edge support, temperature neutrality, material quality, and other factors. Buying a new mattress can be confusing. There’s a wide variety of models on the market, and mattress companies often use fancy marketing terms or mattress jargon that can make it difficult to understand how a mattress actually performs. Luckily, the rise in online mattress companies has also transferred more power to the consumer. Online mattress companies are often more transparent about what’s inside their mattresses, and it’s easier than ever before to compare and contrast different models. These are the most important things to consider when buying a new mattress. Pillow-top innerspring mattresses are often a more affordable option than hybrid models, which makes them an attractive choice for people who want pressure relief on a budget. Due to their more sophisticated construction and higher-quality materials, Euro-top mattresses will set you back more. Sleepers interact differently with the layers of a mattress depending on whether they sleep on their side, back, stomach, or a combination of the three. Pillow-top mattresses are usually best for and due to their plush, conforming feel. The vast majority of pillow-top mattresses are either innerspring or hybrid models. Both have an innerspring support core, but hybrids feature a thicker comfort layer section in addition to the pillow-top. Most pillow-tops are designed to conform to the sleeper’s body, forming a cradle that relieves pressure points. The thicker the pillow-top, the more cushioning it will be able to provide before the sleeper starts to interact with the layers below. The quality of a pillow-top mattress will vary greatly depending on the materials used in the pillow-top. Poor-quality foams or fiberfill may start to break down after just a few years, while latex and higher-quality foams will be more durable. The aim of a pillow-top is usually to soften the feel of a mattress, so most pillow-top mattresses are fairly plush. If we describe firmness on a scale of 1 to 10 with 10 being the firmest, the average pillow-top mattress might fall around a 5. This firmness level is generally best-suited to side sleepers and back sleepers who weigh less than 230 pounds. The vast majority of pillow-tops are designed to add pressure relief to a mattress that might otherwise cause sore spots where heavier parts of the body dig into the mattress. Memory foam pillow-tops contour closely to alleviate these pressure points, and even cotton, silk, wool, or polyfoam models will feel soft and welcoming. While built-in Euro-tops often boast strong edge support, this is a virtue that is frequently lacking in standard pillow-top mattresses. Since the pillow-top is sewn on top of the comfort layers and often not attached around the perimeter, pillow-top mattresses can compress considerably when pressure is put on the edges. This is inconvenient when getting in and out of bed, and may reduce the usable surface area when sharing the bed with a partner. Temperature regulation with a pillow-top mattress is a double-edged sword that depends on the build and materials of the mattress. Memory foam pillow-tops can get uncomfortably warm, particularly in beds that conform closely to the sleeper and don’t leave room for heat to escape. On the other hand, pillow-tops made of more breathable materials like latex or cotton can form a barrier between the sleeper and the rest of the mattress, allowing room for airflow and preventing heat retention. Most pillow-tops are made of materials that make little to no noise when bearing weight. Since they absorb much of the movement from a sleeper, they can also help reduce noise in the coil layer. Pillow-top mattresses are beloved for their luxurious, conforming feel, but some sleepers may find they lack support. Below are some pros and cons of pillow-top mattresses. Pillow-tops are typically made of plush materials that enhance the feel of a mattress by supplying extra contouring and pressure relief. Many pillow-tops use fiberfill or other materials that don’t require the investment of a full-on luxury mattress. Due to their close conforming, practically all pillow-tops absorb motion to some extent, cutting down on disruptions to a sleeping partner. Pillow-top mattresses have a high profile and a classic look. Latex pillow-tops can give the mattress a more responsive surface that is desirable for sex and makes it easier to switch sleeping positions. In hybrid mattresses, pillow-tops made from breathable materials such as cotton, down, or latex can supply an extra layer for heat dispersion instead of allowing body heat to get trapped in the comfort layers. Pillow-tops are sometimes made with materials of inferior quality, such as fiberfill or low-density memory foam, that are prone to developing permanent body impressions after some time. Adding a pillow-top to an innerspring bed will invariably cause it to retain more heat, especially if it’s made from memory foam or another heat-retaining, close-conforming material. The extra few inches of comfort layers may interfere with proper spinal alignment in some sleepers, especially stomach sleepers and those who weigh more than 230 pounds. Virtually all pillow-top mattresses have a higher-than-average profile that may require deep-pocket sheets, which will mean investing in new linens along with your new mattress. Pillow-tops are found almost exclusively on innerspring and hybrid mattresses. The primary purpose of a pillow-top is to add more cushioning to a mattress with relatively thin comfort layers. Latex and memory foam mattresses already succeed in providing contouring pressure relief, so adding a pillow-top would usually be redundant. While innerspring and hybrid mattresses both have a coil support core, they differ slightly in their build. are built with a significant comfort layer section over an innerspring support core, which is usually made with pocketed coils. The most common comfort layers found in a hybrid mattress are memory foam, polyfoam, latex, or a blend of these. Hybrids combine the support, bounce, and cooling properties of innersprings with the conforming pressure relief of foam or latex. Pillow-top hybrids take this last part up a notch, offering increased comfort while still retaining the benefits of the coils. are almost entirely composed of coils. Although some innerspring mattresses have a thin layer of foam or fiberfill on top, the feel of the bed is principally determined by the springs. Innersprings are one of the most budget-friendly types of mattresses, which is why many people turn to this option for a pillow-top mattress that supplies a high-end feel without breaking the bank. Last Things to Consider With a Pillow-Top Mattress Before buying a new mattress, there are a few more things to take into account. The materials used to make a pillow-top are usually less durable than those found in the rest of the mattress. Memory foam, fiberfill, and similar options can develop permanent body indentations after just a few years, which unfortunately shortens the lifespan of the mattress as a whole. For a more robust option, consider pillow-tops made of latex or a higher-density memory foam. Pillow-top mattresses provide immediate cushioning that works well in showrooms, giving the mattress a luxurious and inviting feel when you first lie down. However, we recommend choosing a mattress with a generous sleep trial and sleeping on it for at least 30 nights to see how the mattress holds up. Allowing your body this time to adjust can give you a better idea of whether the mattress will be supportive enough in the long run. Pillow-tops add plushness to an otherwise firm mattress, but they’re no substitute for the deep cradle of a memory foam mattress. If you’re the type of sleeper who needs deep pressure relief, whether because of chronic pain, body type, or another reason, then you might find that a pillow-top does not provide a deep enough “hug” to align the spine and release pressure points. Although most pillow-tops are designed to reduce the firmness level of a mattress, firm pillow-tops do exist. That said, due to the nature of the materials used, even firm pillow-tops will eventually wear out and may become more plush. For this reason, people seeking a harder surface would do better to buy a mattress that is specifically engineered to be firm, such as a latex mattress.

Learn more about our process Arthritis is a common medical condition that affects one or more joints in a person’s body. While there are many different forms of arthritis, they all share some similar symptoms, including joint pain, stiffness, swelling, and tenderness. These symptoms can make it more difficult for a person to get the quality sleep they need. The right mattress may help ease arthritis pain, while the wrong mattress could exacerbate it. Mattress comfort can be affected by several factors, including a person’s weight and preferred sleep position. However, some mattresses may be more accommodating for arthritis sufferers than others. In this guide, we’ll share our picks for the best mattresses for arthritis and joint pain sufferers. We’ll also explain what to look for when shopping for a mattress, examine the effects of sleep position on joint pain, and detail how the mattress type may affect arthritis sufferers. Best for Side Sleepers –  Soft (2-3), Medium Firm (6), Firm (7-8)  Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, Split King, California King, Split Cal King Get $200 off when you spend $1,000 or more at Saatva.com The Saatva Mattress is a hybrid model that has strong pressure relief and three firmness options, which may make it a good choice for arthritis sufferers from all weight groups. Three firmness options and two height options are available for the Saatva Mattress. Sleepers can select between Plush Soft (2-3), Luxury Firm (6), and Firm (7-8). They can also select between an 11.5-inch thick mattress and a 14.5-inch thick option. The Saatva’s hybrid design combines a Euro pillow-top and two layers of coils. The Euro pillow-top contains polyfoam, .75 inches of fiber fill, and 1 ounce of Dacron. To adjust the feel of each mattress, the thickness and firmness of the polyfoam vary between models. The Plush Soft and Luxury Firm options have 1.25 inches of soft foam in their Euro pillow-tops, and the Firm version uses 1.5 inches of firmer foam. A .625-inch layer of polyfoam rests under the Euro pillow-top. The lumbar region is supported by a .375-inch layer of memory foam. This layer adds to the pressure relief while promoting proper spinal alignment. A layer of 14.5-gauge wrapped coils measures 4 inches thick, adding bounce, breathability, and support. The base layer consists of 13-gauge hourglass coils, which add durability and cooling airflow. This layer is 4 inches thick in the 11.5-inch version of the Saatva and 7 inches thick in the 14.5-inch version. Final base pads support the core. A layer of foam wraps around the edge of the mattress to reduce sagging. Compared to other hybrid models, the Saatva is quite affordable. It also excels in temperature neutrality, pressure relief, and ease of movement. Its three firmness options can accommodate most sleep positions and weight groups, but not all firmness options will be ideal for all individuals. Sleepers who weigh under 130 pounds may favor the Plush Soft version, while sleepers who weigh over 230 pounds might prefer the Firm version. Most sleepers from all weight groups are likely to find the Luxury Firm version comfortable. The Saatva comes with free White Glove delivery. Customers can try the mattress at home during the 180-night trial. A 15-year warranty protects against defects in materials and workmanship.  Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King Partners from different weight groups and/or who have different position preferences Latex hybrid design offers above-average pressure relief The Awara Mattress is a latex hybrid that offers cradling without a lot of hug, making it a strong choice for arthritis sufferers who want pressure relief without the feeling of being “trapped in the bed.” Three layers give the Awara cushioning, contouring, and support. A Euro-top cover contains wool and cotton to wick away heat and moisture while cushioning the surface. The comfort layer uses 4 inches of Dunlop latex. Dunlop latex has low point elasticity, which means it spreads the force of the compression out over a wider area, creating the sensation of sleeping “on” rather than “in” the bed. Natural latex also tends to sleep cooler than synthetic foam. A 9-inch layer of coils gives bounce and support while allowing cooling airflow. Each coil is pocketed and can move independently, limiting motion transfer. The Awara’s medium-firm (6) feel can accommodate sleepers from all weight groups with any position preferences, so it may be a particularly appealing option for couples with different sleep styles. Its combination of breathability, contouring, support, and bounce earn it high marks for temperature regulation, pressure relief, ease of movement, edge support, and sex. With its 365-night trial period, customers have a longer-than-average window to try the Awara Mattress in their homes. Awara also offers a lifetime limited warranty.  Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King Those who want pressure relief without much sinkage Zoned support system offers targeted pressure relief Thanks to its all-foam construction and three-zone design, the Level Sleep Mattress has strong pressure-relieving properties that may appeal to sleepers with arthritis. The Level Sleep Mattress is constructed of three layers of foam. A 1-inch layer of polyfoam serves as the comfort layer. This material is engineered to distribute the sleeper’s weight more evenly to reduce pressure buildup near their shoulders and hips. A 3-inch transition layer uses Energex polyfoam, which strikes a balance between contouring and responsiveness. The head end of the bed uses soft Energex foam, the midsection uses firm Energex foam, and the leg area uses medium foam. This zoning aims to promote proper spinal alignment through targeted support and softness. A 7-inch support layer of polyfoam reinforces the mattress surface. The mattress cover is removable and washable. The Level Sleep Mattress has a medium (5) feel. This is on the softer end of the average firmness range for mattresses, contributing to a plusher feel and extra pressure relief. For most sleepers, pressure relief is likely to be the Level Sleep Mattress’s biggest strength. While the mattress may be particularly comfortable for side sleepers, its midsection may not be firm enough to support the hips of back and stomach sleepers who weigh over 130 pounds. A 365-night in-home trial gives sleepers an opportunity to try the Level Sleep Mattress. It also comes with a lifetime limited warranty.  Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King Individuals who prefer sleeping on an organic mattress People who want extra support from ergonomic zoning Organic wool and cotton cover is naturally moisture-wicking Use this SleepFoundation.org link for the most current discount on Avocado mattresses Its high-quality materials and durable latex hybrid construction help the Avocado Green Mattress support sleepers while relieving their pressure points, making it a strong option for those with arthritis. An organic cotton cover and organic wool fire barrier wick away moisture while allowing air circulation into the bed. The vegan version of the mattress uses cotton in place of wool. A comfort layer with 2 inches of Dunlop latex contours to the sleeper with minimal hug. The low point elasticity of latex leads to compression over a wider surface area, which many sleepers liken to a floating sensation. Dunlop latex is also responsive and highly durable, so it should return to its original shape quickly when the sleeper changes positions and it is unlikely to form lasting impressions over time. The core consists of 8 inches of coils. Each coil is pocketed to restrict the spread of motion between coils. The layer is divided into five ergonomic zones that use different coil gauges to provide targeted support for better spinal alignment. Sturdy perimeter coils also reinforce the edge of the bed. Finally, a 1-inch layer of Dunlop latex acts as a base for the spring system. Pillow-top versions of the Avocado Green Mattress and the Avocado Vegan Mattress are also available. These versions add an extra 2 inches of Dunlop latex for a plusher feel. The Avocado Green Mattress and the Avocado Vegan Mattress both rate around 7-8 on the 10-point firmness scale, which means they have firm feels. With the optional pillow-top, the Avocado Green Mattress and the Avocado Vegan Mattress have medium-firm feels, rating around 6. Strengths of the original version of the mattress include durability, temperature neutrality, ease of movement, edge support, and sex. Because of its firm feel, this version of the mattress may be particularly well-suited for individuals who weigh over 130. Side sleepers who weigh under 130 pounds may be more likely to experience some pressure buildup near their hips and shoulders, but the pillow-top version can give them extra cushioning and pressure relief. The pillow-top version may also have extra motion isolation and pressure relief, but its softer feel could allow the hips of stomach sleepers who weigh over 230 pounds to sink in too deeply. The Avocado Green Mattress is protected by a 25-year limited, partially prorated warranty. Customers have one year to try the mattress in their home as part of the trial period.  Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King, Custom Sizes Balanced blend of robust support and plush comfort Get 20% off a Brooklyn Bedding Mattress with code: sleepfoundation20 The Brooklyn Bedding Bloom is a latex hybrid model with a robust support core and mid-range firmness, making it able to accommodate the needs of most sleepers regardless of their weight and preferred sleep position. The bed’s quilted cover is 1.25 inches thick and contains a breathable blend of cotton and wool. A 3-inch layer of Talalay latex has a springy, responsive feel with contouring that may feel akin to sleeping “on” the bed rather than “in” the bed. The support core has 8 inches of pocketed coils that add to the bed’s bounce while limiting the spread of motion. This coil system rests on a 1-inch polyfoam base. The Brooklyn Bedding Bloom comes in a medium (5) firmness that accommodates a wide range of weight groups and position preferences. Sleepers who weigh between 130 and 230 pounds are likely to feel the most comfortable on the Bloom, though the bed is both contouring and supportive enough to meet the needs of lighter and heavier sleepers. Thanks to its latex hybrid construction, the Brooklyn Bedding Bloom excels in several performance categories, including pressure relief, ease of movement, and sex. Couples with different needs from a bed may be able to find solid middle-ground in the Bloom. Customers can take advantage of a 120-night trial period. A 10-year warranty covers qualifying defects. Read our Full Brooklyn Bedding Bloom Hybrid Review to learn more  Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King Excellent pressure relief for the hips and shoulders Use this SleepFoundation.org link for the most current discount on Tuft & Needle mattresses The Tuft & Needle Mint Mattress is a good option for people with arthritis who experience pain or pressure points in their shoulders, lower back, or hips. This mattress is constructed with a comfort layer of adaptive polyfoam that contours closely and reduces discomfort much like memory foam, but without the telltale “body hug” associated with that material. The polyfoam also has an open-cell composition and won’t retain much body heat, allowing you to stay cool and comfortable all night long. A second layer of adaptive polyfoam reinforces the comfort layer to prevent excessive sinkage, while a base layer of high-density polyfoam stabilizes the entire mattress for added support. The Mint Mattress has a medium firm feel (6) that is best suited to people who weigh 230 pounds or less – especially side and back sleepers. Couples should experience fewer sleep disruptions on the Mint Mattress. The foam layers absorb movement and prevent motion from transferring across the surface when your co-sleeper changes positions or gets in and out of bed, and the mattress itself is completely silent when in use. The Mint Mattress has a sticker price that is in line with the average all-foam model, and Tuft & Needle provides free ground delivery anywhere in the contiguous U.S. You’ll receive a 100-night sleep trial with your purchase, along with a 10-year warranty that protects against structural defects. Read our Full Tuft & Needle Mint Review to learn more  Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King Couples looking for a blend of motion isolation and bounce Zoned microcoil layer for targeted pressure relief Get 15% off a Leesa Mattress with code: SLEEPFOUNDATION The Leesa Legend’s multiple layers of foam and two coil layers provide significant contouring that can help reduce pressure buildup for arthritis sufferers. Its hybrid design starts with a top layer constructed of 1 inch of polyfoam engineered to balance conforming and bounce. This layer is hole-punched to allow more cooling air circulation through the mattress. Next, a 1-inch layer of memory foam gives deeper contouring to relieve the pressure that often builds up around the shoulders and hips. The 1.5-inch microcoil layer is zoned, meaning it features different feels across the surface to support different parts of the body differently. Pocketed microcoils are used at the head and foot of the bed, while the midsection uses polyfoam. This construction is designed to give more pressure relief for the shoulders and legs and extra support for the hips to promote better spinal alignment. The 1-inch polyfoam transition layer acts as a barrier to prevent sleepers from sinking in against the firm coil core. A 6-inch layer of 15-gauge coils serves as the support core. Each coil is pocketed to reduce motion transfer, and strong airflow reduces heat retention. The springs rest on a final base layer of 1 inch of polyfoam. Thanks to its medium-firm feel, the Leesa Legend is likely to be comfortable for most sleepers. It rates around 6 on the 10-point firmness scale, which is one of the most popular firmness ratings for sleepers from all weight groups. The Leesa Legend excels in most performance categories, including motion isolation, ease of movement, sex, temperature neutrality, pressure relief, and edge support. While most sleepers are likely to sleep comfortably on the Leesa Legend, stomach sleepers who weigh over 230 pounds may experience sagging near their hips due to the medium-firm feel. This could put a strain on their spines. A 100-night trial period lets sleepers try the mattress in their homes, and a 10-year limited warranty covers qualifying defects. How to Choose a Mattress for Arthritis and Joint Pain Choosing a mattress is a big decision for anyone, but it can be particularly impactful for people suffering from joint pain. This section will highlight some of the most important things to consider when selecting a new mattress. While comfort preferences may vary between individuals, some factors tend to come into play in determining a mattress’s overall performance. It may help to consider these categories when selecting the best mattress for you. A mattress can cost anywhere between a few hundred and a few thousand dollars. Lower-priced options may be easy on the pocketbook, but some higher-priced models are also good values for their durability and advanced features. When budgeting for their mattress purchase, joint pain sufferers might want to leave room in case they wish to purchase additional accessories for added comfort. Adjustable bed frames, pillows, and mattress toppers may be helpful tools to customize the sleep surface to better meet an individual’s needs and preferences. Contouring is how a mattress adjusts to a sleeper’s body shape. A mattress that contours well allows a sleeper’s wider, heavier body parts to sink in, which can help support better spinal alignment. Better spinal alignment may help reduce some of the aches and pains often associated with sleeping. High-quality materials are often more expensive, but they may also contribute to superior performance and durability. Since higher-quality materials often resist sagging and indentations, they could help ensure that a comfortable mattress remains comfortable longer. While firmness preferences are subjective, they tend to be closely linked to an individual’s weight. Lighter individuals usually prefer a softer mattress that allows them to sink in enough to enjoy contouring, while heavier individuals tend to prefer a firmer model for more support. A mattress that is too soft may lead to spinal strain, and a mattress that is too firm could contribute to pressure buildup, so arthritis and joint pain sufferers may benefit from selecting their firmness level carefully. Pressure relief may be one of the most important factors for joint pain sufferers to consider when selecting a mattress. Body parts that are wider or heavier apply more force to a mattress. If the mattress does not have strong pressure relief, pressure could build up in these areas. Pressure relief is usually directly linked to contouring because mattresses that contour to the sleeper’s body help redistribute their weight more evenly across the surface. Edge support refers to how sturdy the perimeter of the bed feels. A strong perimeter may make it easier for arthritis and joint pain sufferers with mobility issues to sit on the edge of the bed, which may, in turn, facilitate getting into or out of bed. Individuals who frequently sleep near the perimeter of the bed may also feel more secure on a bed with good edge support. Depending on their materials and construction, mattresses may retain heat or allow it to dissipate away from the sleep surface. Individuals who tend to sleep hot usually prefer a breathable sleep surface. Latex, hybrid, and innerspring models tend to have the strongest temperature regulation, but some all-foam models also have features to support cooling airflow through the mattress. Ease of movement can affect how easy it is to change positions on a mattress. Mattresses with materials that conform closely and/or are slow to respond to changes in pressure are usually the most difficult to move on. Softer, high-density memory foam comfort layers are sometimes associated with a “trapped in the bed” feel, while latex, coils, and more responsive foams are generally easier to move on. Joint pain sufferers with mobility issues may prefer a more responsive mattress. The type of mattress may influence its potential benefits and drawbacks. Hybrid, innerspring, latex, airbed, and foam are the most common types of mattresses, and any of these may be a good choice for some sleepers with arthritis. We’ll discuss these mattress types in greater depth below. As with any condition that causes pain or discomfort, arthritis could make it harder to get restful, quality sleep. Aches and pains may make it harder to fall asleep or could lead to tossing and turning during the night. The position someone sleeps could either reduce or contribute to pain. Depending on an individual’s pains, they may prefer any sleep position. However, most experts usually recommend back or side sleeping. If you continue to suffer from arthritis and/or joint pain that interrupts your sleep, we recommend talking to your doctor. According to Johns Hopkins, back sleeping can have both pros and cons for pain sufferers. Neck pain could be aggravated by sleeping face up. However, some people find sleeping on their backs alleviates their lower-back pain. Others may experience more back pain in this position, but the Cleveland Clinic suggests that placing a pillow under the knees could help. The right mattress can help support a back sleeper’s natural spinal alignment. If the mattress sags excessively near the midsection, the sleeper could experience strain in their lower backs. If the mattress is too firm, they might have some pressure buildup around their hips. Since sagging tends to be the most common problem for back sleepers, many people who prefer this sleep position select a firmer-than-average mattress to get the support they need. People tend to be wider near their shoulders and hips, so these body parts usually put more force on the mattress when a person sleeps on their side. This can contribute to pressure points. Without the right mattress, a side sleeper’s spinal alignment could also suffer. Too soft of a mattress may allow the shoulders and hips to sink in excessively, while too firm of a mattress may not allow them to sink in enough. Either of these options could put a strain on a side sleeper’s lower back. Side sleepers could also experience knee and hip pain from their legs resting on each other. Some side sleepers place a pillow between their knees for added relief for their hips and knees. Most experts do not recommend stomach sleeping, but some people prefer it. People tend to carry extra weight near their midsections, which could pull their hips too far into the mattress and put a strain on their lower backs. Since stomach sleepers often turn their heads to the side, they may also strain the neck. Some stomach sleepers prefer to use a thin pillow or no pillow to keep their neck in a more neutral position. Thicker pillows may force the neck to extend backward, contributing to additional strain. If you want to transition away from sleeping on your stomach, using a body pillow may help. Combination sleeping can bring together the potential benefits and drawbacks of multiple sleep positions. Switching positions during the night can shift the location of strain and/or pressure. Depending on which sleep positions the person prefers, they may still experience pressure buildup in their hips and shoulders, lower back strain, and/or neck strain. However, switching positions may make these aches and pains less pronounced. What Type of Mattress is Best for Arthritis and Joint Pain Hybrid, innerspring, latex, airbed, and foam mattresses are the major types of mattresses currently sold. Each mattress model may have some variations from other mattresses that use similar constructions due to differences in materials, quality, and construction techniques. However, there are some common similarities between mattresses in each category. Hybrid models pair comfort layers of memory foam, polyfoam, latex, wool, microcoils, and/or other materials with a coil support system. This combination usually gives some of the benefits of innerspring and foam or latex mattresses with fewer drawbacks. Balanced Support and Contouring. Joint pain sufferers may enjoy cushioning, contouring, and pressure relief from a hybrid mattress’s comfort system. The coil core tends to give more even support, which could be beneficial for spinal alignment. Innerspring models are generally seen as the most traditional type of mattress. They consist primarily of springs. While they may have a comfort layer for cushioning, this layer is usually thin. Stable Support. High-quality innerspring mattresses do not permit much sinkage and usually have a relatively even plane. Joint pain sufferers who want support without a lot of contouring may like innerspring models. Natural latex is made from the sap of the rubber tree. Latex mattresses may include natural latex, synthetic latex, or a blend. Dunlop latex is generally denser, while Talalay latex has a bouncier feel. Pressure Relief Without Hug. Latex has low point elasticity, which means that rather than compressing exclusively directly under the sleeper’s weight, it spreads the compression over a wider area. This lends to pressure relief without the hug often associated with memory foam, so joint pain sufferers with mobility issues may find a latex mattress easier to move on. The support system of an airbed consists of fillable air chambers. These chambers can usually be filled or emptied using either a crank, a remote control, or an app. Airbeds may also contain comfort layers for added cushioning, though these comfort layers are usually relatively thin. Adjustable Firmness. The firmness of an airbed can be adjusted by filling or emptying the air chambers. Arthritis and joint pain sufferers may appreciate the flexibility of being able to change the firmness of their mattress to adjust their current preferences. Additionally, many airbeds have separate air chambers on each side of the bed, allowing partners to select different firmness settings. Foam mattresses are constructed of multiple layers of foam. These may include memory foam, polyfoam, or a combination of both. Most foam mattresses use softer, closer conforming foam in their comfort layers and firm polyfoam in their support cores. Close Conforming. All-foam models often conform more closely than other types of mattresses. Joint pain sufferers looking for a pressure-relieving hug may enjoy this close conforming. Last Things to Consider with a Mattress for Arthritis and Joint Pain Purchasing a mattress is a big decision, and you may still have some lingering questions or concerns. We’ll answer some of the top questions customers have when buying a new mattress. While there are budget-friendly mattresses on the market that could be good options for arthritis sufferers, pillows and mattress toppers may also prove effective. A good pillow can help support your natural spinal alignment. Some arthritis sufferers may also like a wedge pillow to support their knees or upper bodies. If your existing mattress is in good condition but you’re looking for more pressure relief, a quality mattress topper can add plushness and contouring without the expense of replacing the whole mattress. Budget-friendly mattresses may cost just a few hundred dollars. These models often offer strong pressure relief and good support, but some may be more prone to forming impressions over time. Higher-priced models may seem like a big investment, but quality materials and construction can help the mattress last longer, which may make it a better value in the long run. A company’s policies may play a role in your purchasing decision. The shipping, trial period, and warranty may be particularly important to consider. Customers who suffer from joint pain may find it more challenging to set up their mattresses. If you need assistance, you may want to consider whether the company offers White Glove delivery. Most online mattress companies offer trial periods that give customers a chance to try the mattress at home. Arthritis sufferers may use this window to determine whether the mattress provides any relief. Finally, the mattress’s warranty can provide customers with additional protection for their purchase.

Learn more about our process Snoring can affect the sleep quality of both the snorer and their partner. This familiar noise occurs due to vibrations in the airway, which may be caused by inflammation, gravity affecting the soft tissues, and other factors. While there is no reliable cure for snoring, some adjustments may help reduce it. Purchasing a pillow for snoring is often one of the first attempts sleepers make to find relief since this option is usually affordable and convenient. For many individuals, snoring is affected by sleep position. A pillow that sufficiently lifts the upper body may help reduce airway compression from the head falling back due to an unsupportive pillow or being pushed too far forward by a pillow that’s excessively thick and/or firm. We’ll share some of the best pillows for snoring and explain how they may help. We’ll also examine factors that could influence which pillow may be best for your snoring, explore possible causes of the condition, and provide other potential ways to reduce snoring. While snoring is common, it can be a sign of a serious health condition, so it’s important to discuss your symptoms with your doctor. Only your qualified medical provider can help you decide what is best for your health. Best for Side Sleepers – Gentle wedge slope elevates the upper body, reducing airway compression Use this SleepFoundation.org link for the most current discount on the Helix pillows The Helix Wedge Pillow lifts the upper body while conforming to the sleeper’s shape to reduce airway compression from gravity without creating sharp pressure points. This pillow measures 24 inches by 24 inches by10 inches and uses a classic triangular wedge design. It has a medium firm feel and is constructed of a layer of gel memory foam and a layer of polyfoam to mold to the body without allowing excessive sinkage. A rayon and polyester blend cover allows air to circulate into the pillow so that heat can escape. This cover can be removed and washed in a machine to keep the surface fresh. Given its firmness, the Helix Wedge Pillow may provide the best mixture of cushioning and support for those who weigh over 130 pounds. The wedge shape is most conducive to back sleeping, though some also enjoy this design for side sleeping. Shape retention, conforming, and durability are among the Helix Wedge Pillow’s greatest strengths. It should resist indentations and sagging to provide support for years to come, while also contouring enough for added comfort. A 100-night sleep trial allows you to test whether this pillow helps improve your snoring. If you don’t find relief after 30 nights, you can return it for a refund of the purchase price. A 1-year limited warranty protects against manufacturing defects, like stains, rips, and tears. Supports spinal alignment and a healthy sleep posture Use this SleepFoundation.org link for the most current discount on the EPABO pillows While ergonomically designed pillows often carry a higher price tag, the EPABO Contour Memory Foam Pillow cradles the head and neck without breaking the bank. It consists of solid memory foam carefully designed to ergonomically support the head and neck and limit airway compression. If the EPABO Contour Memory Foam Pillow is too thick for you, there is a removable piece of memory foam in the center of the bottom that measures approximately .8 inches thick to allow for slight in-home adjustments. This memory foam is engineered to allow airflow, which is enhanced by the breathable, moisture-wicking rayon and polyester blend cover. The cover has a silky smooth feel, and a hidden zipper makes it easy to remove. Once separate from the pillow, the cover is machine-washable. Because of its medium firm feel and thickness, the EPABO Contour Memory Foam Pillow will likely be most appropriate for back and side sleeping. Highlights of the pillow include its exceptional shape retention and comfortable conforming. Three size options are available. The standard size measures 21 inches by 13 inches by 3.9 inches thick. Both queen options are 24 inches by 15 inches, but they differ in height with one measuring 4.6 inches and the other totaling 4.8 inches. The thicker version of the queen is slightly firmer, which may make it better suited to individuals who weigh over 230 pounds. The EPABO Contour Memory Foam Pillow is eligible for Amazon’s 30-day return policy.  Shredded memory foam and kapok tree fiber blend Those who want more control over the loft of their pillow Use this SleepFoundation.org link for the most current discount on the Layla pillows Finding a comfortable position that reduces snoring often requires determining the optimal pillow loft for you. The Layla Kapok Pillow makes that a little easier by allowing owners to customize the loft to fit their needs and preferences. The pillow arrives overstuffed with a fill of plush memory foam and kapok tree fiber. If it is too thick for you, simply unzip the cover and remove some of the fill for a thinner pillow. Owners can continue to experiment with the loft level until they find the right balance for their snoring. The material is also highly moldable, so sleepers can also bunch and manipulate the pillow as needed. A soft polyester and viscose blend cover with CuTEC fibers encases the fill. CuTEC is a proprietary copper fiber technology designed to wick away heat and limit odors. While the pillow generally has a medium soft feel, it may seem plusher if you remove some of the fill. At full loft, snorers who sleep on their backs and sides are likely to get the right level of support. Stomach sleepers will likely need to remove much of the fill to prevent their heads from being pushed too far backward and potentially putting more pressure on their airways. This pillow is a standard rectangular shape and comes in queen and king sizes. A 120-night money-back guarantee lets you return the pillow for a refund after you’ve tried it for at least two weeks. Defects like faulty seams and flattening of the fill are covered by a 5-year warranty. Side and back sleepers who weigh more than 130 pounds Contoured design cradles the head and reduces pressure on the neck Use this SleepFoundation.org link for the most current discount on the Tempur-Pedic pillows The Tempur-Pedic Neck Pillow uses supportive TEMPUR memory foam in an ergonomic design to promote healthy spinal alignment that may help reduce snoring. A single piece of extra firm TEMPUR memory foam makes up the pillow’s core, giving exceptional support while conforming subtly for added comfort and pressure relief. This material retains its shape well, which should enhance the pillow’s usable lifespan. Because of its ergonomic shape and extra firm feel, the Tempur-Pedic Neck Pillow may be a good match for side and back sleepers who weigh at least 130 pounds. The polyester knit cover can be removed and washed in a machine. The Tempur-Pedic Neck Pillow comes in three sizes: small (3 inches thick), medium (4 inches thick), and large (4.5 inches thick). The small size is recommended for side sleepers with shoulders up to 4 inches wide and back sleepers with shoulders up to 6 inches wide, the medium is suggested for side sleepers with 4-6 inch shoulders and back sleepers with 6-10 inch shoulders, and the large is intended for side sleepers with shoulders over 6 inches and back sleepers with shoulders greater than 10 inches. A 5-year limited warranty provides for repair or replacement in the event of qualifying faulty materials or workmanship. Snorers who like the feel of their existing pillows Pillow insert gently moves when snoring is detected Use this SleepFoundation.org link for the most current discount on the Smart Nora pillows Rather than acting as a conventional pillow, the Smart Nora is an adjustment device designed to work with your existing pillow to reduce snoring. The insert goes under the pillow, and a snoring detector is mounted above the head. When the detector registers the first signs of snoring, the insert gently inflates to lift the head. This is intended to stimulate the throat muscles and allow you to resume breathing normally without waking you or your partner. This device will likely be best suited for back sleepers since it may lift a side or stomach sleeper’s head more than ideal. However, since it works with virtually any pillow, the owner can select the loft, shape, firmness, and size they find most comfortable. Customers can try the Smart Nora risk-free during a 30-night trial window and return it for a full refund if they’re not satisfied. A 1-year limited warranty protects against manufacturing defects. The Smart Nora is designed exclusively for snoring and is not intended for other conditions, including sleep apnea. Combination sleepers who switch between their back and side Blend of shredded latex and down alternative provides a unique feel Lofty design is well suited to back and combination sleepers Use this SleepFoundation.org link for the most current discount on the Saatva pillows Thanks to its three-part design, the Saatva Pillow gives back sleepers the power to add or remove components to achieve the best loft for their snoring. The core consists of shredded Talalay latex that combines support, shape retention, responsiveness, and breathability to help keep the spine aligned without retaining a lot of heat. This piece fits into an outer plush layer of down-like microdenier fiber encased in a cotton shell, which adds cushioning and loft while enhancing the breathability. A cotton pillow cover zips over these layers. Both the microdenier fiber layer and cover are removable and machine-washable. Owners can configure their pillow however they like, whether that involves combining all three pieces or using the Talalay core and microdenier fiber layers separately. When fully assembled, the pillow has a medium soft feel that may be most comfortable for individuals who weigh less than 130 pounds. Snorers who weigh more than 230 pounds may not get enough support to prevent their head from slumping down and increasing pressure on the airway. The Saatva Pillow is available in queen and king sizes. It comes with a 45-day return policy, during which customers can return the product for a full refund of the purchase price if they decide it’s not right for them. Shoulder cut-out improves comfort and spinal alignment Shredded fill provides a highly moldable sleep surface Use this SleepFoundation.org link for the most current discount on the Eli & Elm pillows The Eli & Elm Side Sleeper Pillow’s unique U-shape is specially designed to promote proper spinal alignment for side sleepers, which may also limit airway compression that could cause snoring. Shredded latex and polyester make up the fill for a plush, supportive, highly moldable surface. The fill is encased in an interior liner, and an outer cover consisting of cotton, polyester, and spandex goes over it. This cover is removable and machine-washable in cold water. Both the fill and cover materials let air circulate to limit heat buildup and help the sleeper maintain a more comfortable temperature. Owners can customize the firmness of the Eli and Elm Side Sleeper Pillow by unzipping it and adding or removing fill to achieve the desired firmness, support, and loft. Unmodified, the pillow has a medium feel. However, if this is not firm enough, you can request additional fill for a fee. Snorers can test out different fill levels until they find the solution that works best for them. Customers that are not satisfied with the pillow can return it for the first 45 days for a full refund of the purchase price. A 5-year warranty covers defects in materials and workmanship, including issues like the stitching coming undone and the fabric fraying or ripping. Selecting a pillow for snoring requires all the normal considerations involved in finding the right pillow and some factors unique to the condition. Assessing your needs and preferences will help inform your decision. What to Consider When Purchasing a Pillow for Snoring Sleeping position, loft, support, firmness, and other factors are some of the top things to look for when purchasing a pillow for snoring. Not only do these factors affect comfort, but they can also influence the likelihood of soft tissues vibrating during the night. Many companies that produce pillows for snoring try to present their models as ideal for all sleepers and positions. While these options may accommodate most individuals, they won’t be optimal for everyone since personal needs and preferences vary. Weighing the unique factors that affect your sleep with specific aspects of the pillow design can help you find the best snoring pillow for you. Sleeping position can affect comfort, alignment, and snoring. Most sleepers should aim for a pillow that keeps the neck aligned since allowing the head to slump or forcing it upward could lead to more pressure on the airway and trigger snoring. Because of the force gravity has on the soft tissues in the airway, snoring is especially common for back sleepers, so some who favor this position prefer to use a wedge pillow for additional elevation. The right pillow loft is critical to healthy spinal alignment, and it can also help with snoring. A model that is too thick might push the head up, while one that is too thin could allow the head to droop, either of which could contribute to airway constriction and increased snoring. The ideal loft depends primarily on body type and sleep position. Sleepers with broader shoulders and/or heavier heads usually need a thicker pillow to fill the space between their mattress and head and neck while providing adequate support, and those with narrower shoulders and/or smaller heads often need a thinner model for support without excessive lift. Support is essential to maintaining proper spinal alignment, and it can also play a role in snoring prevention. If the pillow goes flat under the weight of a back or side sleeper’s head, the neck may bend and cause the airway to constrict. Similarly, if the pillow is too supportive, it may force the neck to bend in the other direction, also potentially putting pressure on the soft tissues. Unfortunately, finding the right level of support is often a matter of trial and error since it can depend on the weight of your head, your sleep position, your shoulder depth, and more. The firmness level affects the pillow’s support and comfort. A firm pillow may be ideal for individuals who weigh more and need the extra support to keep their necks aligned, while a softer option may be better for smaller sleepers who need extra plushness to sink in. You should also consider sleep position and pillow loft when assessing firmness. Side and back sleepers usually need firmer options than stomach sleepers. However, depending on the fill, an especially thick pillow may not need to be as firm to feel supportive. While pressure relief does not significantly affect snoring, it can have a major impact on comfort. A pillow that molds to the head and neck to redistribute their weight can help prevent pressure from accumulating around any one area, which may limit aches and pains and “hot spots” from pressure buildup. Various pillow shapes may be used as anti-snoring pillows depending on sleep position and personal preferences. Some sleepers prefer standard rectangular bed pillows, while others may benefit from a wedge-style pillow or contoured design. Wedge pillows elevate the entire upper body rather than just the head and neck, which is intended to reduce the likelihood of gravity forcing the soft tissues of the airway to compress. Ergonomic, contoured pillows are designed to support spinal alignment, and this could also limit snoring for some individuals. As with any pillow, the prices of snoring pillows vary a great deal. Budget-friendly options start at under $40, while high-end and technologically advanced options can top $150. When considering the price-point, you should also weigh the overall value. More durable options may not need to be replaced as frequently, so they may be worth it over time even if they require a higher initial investment. Pillow materials influence comfort, performance, durability, and support, so selecting a model constructed of quality materials can make a big difference in the sleep experience. Those made of lower-quality components often cost less, but it may be worth spending extra for a high-quality anti-snore pillow if it is likely to be more effective, feel more comfortable, and/or last longer. Since allergic reactions can contribute to snoring, allergy sufferers may also want to weigh the ease of care and allergy potential of any materials in the pillow. Moldability refers to how easy it is to manipulate the shape of the pillow. Some snorers may prefer to bunch up their pillow to fit comfortably under their head and neck and accommodate any sleep position they choose. However, this may also require more effort during the night to find the right shape to keep the spine aligned and limit airway compression. While little research examines the effects of temperature on snoring, many experts believe sleeping in a cooler room is beneficial. Similarly, finding a pillow that regulates temperatures well can reduce the likelihood of the sleeper overheating and trying to reposition to find the cool side of the pillow. Breathable models usually provide strong temperature control by allowing heat to escape. Some advanced components, like phase change material and gel-infused foam, also purport cooling effects. The best pillow style for snoring will depend on your sleep position and personal preferences, but wedge pillows, ergonomic models, adjustable options, and memory foam varieties often top the list. Wedge pillows get their name from their distinctive wedge-like shape. These models are typically constructed of foam and designed to elevate the upper body, which is thought to limit soft tissue compression that leads to snoring and relieve sinus pressure by allowing drainage. Adjustable options allow users to modify the loft and/or firmness of their pillow based on their personal needs and preferences. These models may be beneficial for snorers since they provide the opportunity to experiment with different feels to see what works best. Additionally, if symptoms change over time, the owner can adjust their pillow accordingly. Solid memory foam pillows respond to the sleeper’s heat and weight to mold to their head and neck. This may help sleepers maintain the natural banana-like curvature of the neck, which could in turn reduce the likelihood of poor posture contributing to throat vibrations. Shredded memory foam pillows are also available. These options tend to be more moldable than solid memory foam, but they’re less likely to retain their shape for consistent support throughout the night. Like memory foam pillows, polyfoam models may contain either shredded or solid material. The shredded options typically perform better in moldability and the solid options generally earn higher marks for shape retention. Since polyfoam tends to be more breathable than memory foam, it may be a good option for snorers concerned about overheating. However, lower-quality polyfoam options may be more prone to developing lasting indentations that limit the pillow’s ability to keep the spine aligned. A latex pillow may use either shredded or solid latex foam. Since latex tends to be relatively dense, either option should be durable and supportive, though shredded models will likely be more moldable. Natural latex is resistant to dust mites, a frequent allergy trigger, so pillows made of the material may be ideal for those who snore due to their allergy symptoms. Feather pillows are often both moldable and supportive, which may make it easier for snorers to find a comfortable position that limits snoring. However, some feather pillows may harbor allergens, so they might not be ideal if you suspect allergies are contributing to your snoring. Down is a softer, lighter type of feather that has a plush feel and exceptional moldability. Like feathers, however, down models could trigger allergy symptoms for some individuals, potentially aggravating snoring. There are several possible . While the root cause is a vibration of the tissues in the airway, this can be triggered by muscle relaxation, allergies, and certain physical ailments, like a deviated septum, nasal polyps, and/or enlarged tonsils and adenoids. If a condition could cause inflammation or narrowing of the airway, it could also likely lead to snoring. Age and weight are also often . As an individual gets older, the throat muscles may relax more overnight, leading to sonorous vibrations. Carrying extra weight could also be linked to less muscle tone and more tissue around the neck, which may increase the likelihood of snoring. Other more controllable aspects could also contribute to snoring. Many people snore more when sleeping on their backs because gravity may make the throat more likely to narrow. acts as a muscle relaxant, so consuming it may cause the airway to relax and contribute to more snoring. Additionally, smoking could irritate the airway and trigger inflammation that could cause the throat to vibrate. Many snorers find relief with the right pillow since it can change their position. Lifting the head and neck often makes gravity work in the sleeper’s favor, allowing their throat muscles to relax without blocking the airway. We want you to get the best night’s sleep possible, which can be done under a medical professional’s guidance. Talk to your doctor for help determining the cause of your snoring and charting a course of action. Pillow choice can be one of the easiest and most affordable ways to reduce the severity of snoring, but there are other options. The following tips may be used in addition to selecting the right pillow for you. is a medical condition that causes abnormal breathing during sleep, and snoring is a common sign of the disorder. A sleeper may temporarily stop breathing, which can lower the body’s oxygen supply and lead to less restful slumber. This condition can have serious health impacts, so it’s important to talk to your doctor to determine whether you suffer from sleep apnea and what should be done to protect your health. are designed to reduce snoring by either holding the lower jaw or tongue forward to prevent them from falling back and putting pressure on the airway. Most of these devices are sold over the counter, but you may want to consult with your doctor to see if they’re a good option for you. If you’re a back sleeper, repositioning to your side may help limit snoring. This position makes the tongue and lower jaw less likely to fall towards the back and press on the airway, so many individuals snore less when sleeping on their sides than on their backs. If you struggle to stay on your side, a body pillow positioned behind you might help prevent you from inadvertently returning to back sleeping. Alcohol can relax the muscles, while tobacco can cause throat irritation, both of which could lead to vibrations in the airway. Limiting or eliminating your use of alcohol and/or tobacco may help reduce snoring. Lifting the upper body can often relieve snoring by reducing pressure on the airway. While this can be done with the right pillow, an is another great option that allows you to experiment with what position works best for you. Frequently Asked Questions About Pillows for Snoring Our guide details some of the most important factors to consider when purchasing a pillow for snoring and highlights some top picks, but we know you may still have some lingering uncertainties. We’ll answer some of the most common questions shoppers have while shopping. A may help reduce snoring for some sleepers. They lift the upper part of the body so that the soft tissues are less likely to block passages due to posture, thereby limiting vibrations. While wedge pillows may not be effective for all individuals depending on the cause of their snoring, many sleepers find them helpful. Sleep position often affects snoring. When sleeping on the back, the tongue and lower jaw can recede and put pressure on the airway, so back sleepers are often especially prone to snoring. If you want to see if your snoring is affected by your sleep position, try repositioning onto your side to see if it continues. Snoring is very common, affecting approximately . These numbers may be even higher for older individuals. Since snoring is so widespread, anti-snoring pillows are available from most retailers that sell pillows, including department stores, home goods retailers, and mattress stores.

Learn more about our process Do you prefer pillows with an exceptionally plush feel that sink beneath your head and neck? Are you more partial to light pillows that are very moldable and ideal for snuggling? If you answered yes to either question, then you may be a great candidate for a down pillow. Down refers to the inner plumage of ducks and geese, which is very soft and lightweight. Some pillows only contain down while others contain a blend of down and feathers, the coarser outer plumage of the same birds. Ethical sourcing is an important consideration for down pillows. Since the down and feathers must be extracted from animals, consumers should research how different pillows are sourced and constructed. Read on to learn more about down pillows in terms of pricing, available designs, and performance across different categories. Below, you’ll find our top eight picks for down pillows sold today. Each selection is based on experiences and reviews from verified owners, as well as our own product research and analysis. Best Goose Down – Most Comfortable – Best for Side Sleepers – Best Luxury – Down & Feather Company Natural Nights Goose Down Pillow Sleepers seeking a plush, mid-level, or firm feel from their down pillow Three firmness levels suitable for different sleep positions and body types Use this SleepFoundation.org link for the most current discount on Brooklinen pillows The Brooklinen Down Pillow exemplifies many of the qualities people have come to love about this pillow type. The interior does not include any chambers or baffles, resulting in a traditional feel – though support level depends on the selected loft level. The soft “plush” feel contains 100 percent down, resulting in deep sinkage around the head and neck. This will be the most comfortable choice for many stomach sleepers. The medium “mid-plush” and firm feels mostly contain feathers, so you’ll feel more reinforcement and sink much less. We recommend these loftier options for side and back sleepers. A shell made of smooth cotton sateen encases the entire pillow and double-stitched seams help to keep the cover intact and prevent escaping fill. The down and feathers are also treated during production to remove microbes that trigger allergies for some sleepers. Spot or dry cleaning is recommended if stains occur, but you can freshen up the pillow and expand its shape by placing it in a dryer on an air fluff setting. Regardless of which loft you choose, the Brooklinen Down Pillow is very affordable. Brooklinen also allows you to return the pillow in exchange for a full refund within 365 days of purchase, even if you’ve used and cleaned it. Shipping is free for customers in all 50 states, as well. Sleepers who prefer a plush feel with added support for their down pillow Shoppers looking for a down pillow with above-average durability Chambered design delivers excellent support and plushness Breathable, lightweight 230 thread count cotton cambric shell Use this SleepFoundation.org link for the most current discount on Helix pillows The Helix Down & Feather Pillow is a standout pillow due to its innovative chambered design. The pillow’s core primarily contains feathers while the outer chambers are padded with 550-fill power down. This creates a plush feel for the pillow as well as a decent support system, so your head won’t sink as deeply into the fill. The pillow has a loft of about 6 to 8 inches, which offsets the down’s soft feel and ensures decent thickness for the pillow no matter how much your head weighs. The chambered design also distributes the fill evenly, so you won’t need to fluff this pillow too often. The pillow’s shell is composed of smooth cotton cambric with a thread count of 240. The material is fairly durable and the seams are piped to help the cover hold together, so the pillow is less likely to lose fill over time than many competing down and feather models. The cotton is also quite breathable. While down can absorb and trap heat for some sleepers, this pillow’s cover should maintain a consistently comfortable temperature. The pillow’s price-point is in line with other down and feather models. In addition to free ground shipping for customers in all 50 states, Helix backs the pillow with a 100-night sleep trial and a three-year warranty. Most sleepers regardless of their loft/firmness preferences Three firmness options to accommodate preference differences Organic cotton shell and responsibly-sourced down fill Three-chamber construction to maintain shape and structure Use this SleepFoundation.org link for the most current discount on Boll & Branch pillows A common complaint about down pillows is that they feel too soft, since many are crafted for an exceptionally plush feel. The Boll & Branch Down Pillow is a notable exception because it is available in three density settings. The soft option contains the least amount of fill, which equates to a fill power of about 600. The medium density option contains a slightly more fill, resulting in a mid-level feel, while the firm option has a fill power of 700 and provides great support to the head and neck. The cover is made of organic cotton that has been certified by the Global Organic Textile Standard, one of the world’s foremost authorities on organic fabrics. The down fill has also earned a certification from the Responsible Down Standard, ensuring no animals are harmed or treated unfairly when the down is collected. Boll & Branch washes the down fill three times to remove as many allergens as possible. As a result, the pillow is hypoallergenic and its fill holds up well over time. The pillow can be washed and dried in any household machine. The price-point of this pillow depends on the density you select, but all three options are quite affordable given the high-quality materials and construction. Boll & Branch also offers free shipping to all customers in the contiguous U.S. and accepts returns within 30 days of delivery.  100% polyester inner panel 80% white duck down, 20% feather outer chamber 60% white duck down, 40% feather inner chamber Those who prefer a plush down feel with extra support for the head and neck Sleepers seeking a durable pillow that holds up over time Use this SleepFoundation.org link for the most current discount on Casper pillows Another responsibly produced option, the Casper Down Pillow contains five chambers of ethically sourced white duck down and feathers. This pillow carries the certification, which carries strict requirements such as no harvesting from live animals, no forced feeding, and third-party auditing for every stage of the supply chain cycle. If you’re an animal lover who wants to ensure the products you buy are cruelty-free, then the Casper Down Pillow definitely fits that bill. The pillow’s complex inner design includes five individual chambers. The inner chambers consist of down and feathers in a 60/40 ratio, resulting in a balance of softness and support, while the outer chambers contain a plush blend of 80/20 down and feathers. The high down content means your head will sink a bit, but the chambers reinforce the head and neck to reduce pressure and discomfort. The outer shell is made of pure cotton while the inner panels are polyester. You can wash and dry this pillow in any household machine. To expand its shape, place in the dryer on a low tumbly setting. The Casper Down Pillow is quite affordable compared to other down and feather models, as well, and customers in the contiguous U.S. and Canada qualify for free ground shipping. The pillow is backed by a one-year warranty. Those who prefer a down pillow that feels very plush and sinks deeply People who tend to sleep cold when temperatures are low Premium goose down for an exceptionally soft and insulating feel Use this SleepFoundation.org link for the most current discount on Kassatex pillows Goose down tends to feel plusher than duck down, and it also traps more heat in order to provide better insulation. This can be attributed to goose down clusters, which are thicker and denser than down clusters from ducks. The Kassatex White Goose Down Pillow, one of the best goose down pillows on the market, is well crafted and carries an entry-level price-point for those who’ve never used this type of product before. Packed with 650-fill power white goose down, the pillow delivers a traditional down feel and sinks very deeply beneath the head and neck. Since goose down insulates so well, this pillow is a great choice for people who tend to feel chilly during colder times of the year. By the same token, the Kassatex White Goose Down Pillow may sleep a bit warm during hotter months, but the cover is made of smooth, breathable cotton to help minimize body heat buildup. Three loft/firmness options are available. Most side sleepers with probably prefer the thicker, firmer pillow, while the medium and soft feels are better suited to back and stomach sleepers, respectively. You can wash and dry the pillow in any household machine, so cleaning expenses will be minimal. The down and feathers inside the pillow have been treated with eco-friendly bluesign soap, as well. Ground shipping is free for customers in all 50 states, and Kassatex offers customized monogramming for an added charge. You can test out and return the pillow within 60 nights of delivery, provided it has not been monogrammed.  Hyperclean 550 fill power down and feather fill Supportive, chambered design with a feather core and down cushioning Use this SleepFoundation.org link for the most current discount on Pacific Coast pillows A high-quality down pillow can easily run you upwards of $150, making the Double DownAround Medium Pillow from Pacific Coast a great bargain, but sturdy construction and premium materials ensure it compares favorably with higher-priced competitors. The pillow features a chambered design with a core of Resilia feathers and an outer layer of Hyperclean down, giving the pillow a cushioning yet supportive feel. The cover is composed of breathable 300 thread count cotton engineered to hold up over time and prevent the fill from escaping. A 1.5-inch gusset with thick piping ensures the pillow will mostly maintain a full shape, meaning you won’t need to fluff it too often. You can launder the pillow in your household machines, even if you don’t own a front-loading washer. The pillow is designed for a medium feel. Pacific Coast also offers soft and firm versions of this model if you aren’t satisfied with the medium option. In addition to a relatively low price-point for the Double DownAround Medium Pillow, Pacific Coast offers very reasonable flat shipping rates for U.S. and Canada orders. The pillow comes with a 30-day trial period, as well as a three-year warranty against structural defects and an “allergy warranty” if you experience down allergy symptoms. Use this SleepFoundation.org link for the most current discount on Parachute pillows Side sleepers often struggle with down pillows because they are not lofty enough, resulting in uncomfortable sinkage along the head and neck. As its name implies, the Parachute Down Side Sleeper Pillow is designed to remedy this issue. A thick 3.5-inch gusset along the sides helps the pillow maintain a thick, full shape that is conducive to the side sleeping position. This gusset is reinforced with thick piping for added longevity. Although the pillow has a medium feel, most of its fill consists of premium European white down. This creates a plush, cloud-like feel. The cover is made from smooth cotton sateen, making this pillow a good option for people with sensitive skin. Parachute recommends machine washing the pillow in a cold, gentle cycle with mild detergent if it needs to be cleaned, though dry cleaning is also acceptable. Standard and king sizes are available. Parachute offers free shipping to all 50 states, as well as Army and Air Post Office locations. You may return the pillow for a full refund within 60 days of your original order, even if it has been used or cleaned. A three-year warranty is also included with each purchase. Down & Feather Company Natural Nights Goose Down Pillow Sleepers who prefer a soft, medium, or firm feel for their down pillow Those who would rather use a pillow that sinks deeply beneath the head 750 fill power for exceptional plushness and insulating Use this SleepFoundation.org link for the most current discount on Down & Feather Company pillows Our next pick is the Natural Nights 750 Fill Power Goose Down from Down & Feather Company. Composed of premium white down clusters encased in a cover of organic Egyptian cotton, this pillow offers the traditional feel of a down pillow. The core does not contain any chambers of baffles, so your head will sink very deeply into the pillow. You can choose between four different firmness options which also vary by loft, making the pillow a good option whether you sleep on your side, back, stomach, or a combination of the three. Durability is another major strength of this pillow. The cover is made from organic Egyptian cotton that holds up very well over time and should prevent the fill from escaping. The white Hungarian goose down clusters offer 750-fill power, indicating a very dense and plush feel. The downside to these high-quality materials is limited care options – spot clean the pillow if necessary, but never wash or dry it in a machine. These pillows are quite expensive, as well; prices vary by size and loft, but expect to pay at least $300. Down & Feather Company incentivizes customers with a 30-night sleep trial and a free pillow adjustment as part of their return policy, as well as a 10-year warranty for added peace of mind. Down feathers, or simply just down, are the soft inner plumage found beneath coarser exterior feathers of ducks and geese. Ducklings and goslings are entirely covered in down when they are very young; as they age, the exterior feathers will develop. Since down’s primary purpose is to insulate birds against the cold, the material has become very popular in jackets, vests, gloves, and other garments intended for cold weather. Down is also exceptionally soft and lightweight, making it ideal for pillows, comforters, and other bedding accessories. Some products contain 100 percent down and are labeled as such, but most feature a blend of down and feathers. The plush feel of down pillows causes them to sink deeply beneath your head and neck while you sleep. This distinguishes down pillows from other pillow types – such as , latex, and buckwheat – that feel firmer and provide stronger support. Goose down typically comes in thicker clusters. As a result, goose down pillows often feel plusher and more insulating than those filled with duck down. Read on to learn more about how to find the best down feather pillows. This guide will discuss price expectations, size availability, pros and cons for sleepers, and ethical considerations for this type of pillow. Most down pillows offer a similar feel characterized by exceptional plushness and deep sinkage beneath the head and neck. However, there are subtle differences between these pillow models that make them better suited for some types of sleepers and less suited for others. Important considerations include the type of down used, ratio of down to feathers, cover material, loft, and price-point. We also encourage shoppers to research the down and feather harvesting practices of different companies to ensure their pillows and other products are ethically sourced and manufactured. While misleading claims and specs are widely used throughout the mattress and bedding industry, this problem is particularly common with products containing down. Some pillows contain 100 percent down, but most contain a blend of down and feathers from the same type of bird. The feathers provide more support to stabilize the pillow and prevent excessive sinkage. The regulates how down and feather pillows and other products are labeled. According to the International Down and Feather Testing Laboratory (IDFL), pillows containing at least 75 percent down require the percentage of down to be listed on the product tag. If a pillow contains less than 75 percent down, then percentages for both down and feather fill must both be listed. Only pillows that contain 100 percent down can carry this listing. Below, you’ll find the most important considerations to take into account when shopping for a down pillow. Loft, or thickness, affects how supportive the pillow feels. Side sleepers generally need more loft in order to align the head and neck with the spine, which in turn reduces pressure throughout the body. Back sleepers need some loft to keep their body on an even plane, but too much can elevate the head and create neck and shoulder pain. For most stomach sleepers, a low-loft down pillow allows them to rest comfortably without contorting their head too much. As we discussed above, 100 percent down pillows can be found but they are somewhat scarce and usually quite expensive. High feather content in a down pillow may drive down the price-point and make the pillow more supportive, but this can cause the pillow to feel less plush. For most sleepers, 50 to 80 percent down is the sweet spot – you’ll feel soft cushioning of down without sacrificing feather support for the head and neck. Support is tied to both loft and down/feather content. For any given sleeper, the pillow should keep the head and neck upright and even with the rest of the body. Other factors like head size and sleep position can change how supportive a pillow feels, too. It’s important to note that traditional down pillows sink a bit and do not offer the same support as pillows with sturdier fill materials, such as memory foam, latex, or buckwheat hulls. How soft or firm you prefer your pillow to be is likely tied to your sleep position and head/shoulder dimensions. When browsing different down pillows, look for the “fill power” of each model. This indicates how dense the down fill is and, consequently, how firm or soft the pillow will feel. A lofty down pillow with high fill power will probably be the firmest option – but even then, down pillows tend to feel softer compared to other pillow types. While down molds closely to the head and neck, the material doesn’t conform evenly to provide support and alleviate pressure quite like foam or latex. Since down pillows tend to sink a bit, some sleepers may experience added or increased pressure as their head falls back. Most down pillows are sold in traditional standard, queen, and king sizes, all of which have a rectangular shape. Some brands offer body pillows padded with down and feather fill, as well, but these models are fairly rare. Contoured and orthopedic down pillows are virtually non-existent; in order to reduce neck and shoulder pain, these pillows are constructed from foams, latex, and other denser materials. The average down pillow costs between $80 and $200 in a standard or queen size. Expect to pay more for pillows with 100 percent down content or a high content of goose down. Those with higher ratios of feather fill will typically cost less. The quality of a down pillow can affect how it performs in different areas. Dense down with a high fill power will give the pillow a fuller shape that requires less fluffing and shaking on your part. Cover quality is also important, since shell fabrics that deteriorate quickly can cause the down and feathers to escape and essentially ruin the pillow. Moldability refers to how snuggly a pillow is and whether it can be scrunched into different shapes to provide more or less support. Down pillows are very moldable due to their soft fill. They are a great option for people who like snuggling with a pillow or prefer a bolster between their knees. Since down insulates birds beneath their exterior feathers, you may notice more heat buildup with down pillows. That said, these pillows generally don’t sleep as warm as pillows with polyfoam or memory foam fill. The composition of the cover can play a role in temperature regulation since some fabrics – such as organic cotton and cotton percale – are more breathable than others. Down pillows offer an exceptionally plush and lightweight feel that distinguish them from other pillow types. Some sleepers find the softness and sinking effect quite comfortable – but for others, the pillows do not provide enough support to the head and neck. And while down pillows can provide above-average insulation in colder weather, the insulating properties of down cause them to sleep excessively warm for some people. If you prefer a softer feel for your pillow, then you’re probably well suited to down. The material offers unparalleled plushness and cushioning for the head and neck, even compared to feathers, and you’ll sink quite deeply into the pillow. Down’s main purpose is to keep ducks and geese warm. As a result, many down pillows provide excellent insulation during colder times of the year. The soft and lightweight feel of down pillows makes them ideal for snuggling. They can also be scrunched into different shapes. Most down pillows are designed for durability. The covers will be piped or double-stitched around the seams to prevent down and feathers from escaping and the fill itself will not lose its softness over time. While you can find plenty of budget-friendly options, most down pillows – particularly those with high down content – are fairly expensive. Since down has natural insulating properties, this fill material can cause the pillow to absorb body heat and sleep somewhat warm. This is especially true if the shell and liners are made from less breathable fabrics like polyester. Since down pillows tend to sink quite a bit, they may not provide enough support for some sleepers. Thankfully, many down pillow manufacturers offer these models with different loft and firmness options. Most down pillows do not maintain a full shape very well, so you’ll need to fluff them regularly. Many can be placed in a dryer for expedited shape recovery. We recommend down pillows to anyone who feels most comfortable on a very soft surface that sinks deeply beneath the head and neck. However, how much you like or dislike lying on a down pillow may depend on your sleep position, body type, head size, and other factors. Our picks for who is and isn’t suited to a down pillow include the following: The offer a high loft and dense fill. Side sleepers often develop pressure points because their head, neck, and shoulders are not aligned with the spine. A fuller down pillow ensures that their body remains on an even plane. Down pillows with less loft may cause added aches and pains. The back sleeping position promotes spinal alignment, so the key for these sleepers is even support from head to toe. A mid-loft down pillow that sinks a bit while reinforcing the head and neck will be ideal for many back sleepers, but too much loft can cause pain to develop around the neck and shoulders. Down pillows are highly moldable, allowing you to scrunch them into different shapes to add or decrease support. They are also quite snuggly and provide good padding if you enjoy sleeping with a pillow between your knees. Although down has insulating properties, most down pillows sold today sleep fairly cool because the fill is not too dense. The pillows usually contain a fair amount of feather fill, as well. Feathers don’t absorb body heat quite like down. Since tend to have larger heads and broader shoulders, many find down pillows uncomfortable because they sink too deeply and do not provide adequate reinforcement. These sleepers may want to consider a pillow with solid memory foam, latex, buckwheat hulls, or other supportive fill types. Stomach sleepers may feel comfortable on low-loft down pillows that are somewhat flat. This way, they won’t need to turn their heads to the side – leaving them vulnerable to neck and shoulder pain. Unfortunately, many down pillows have medium to high loft and will be too thick for stomach sleepers to rest comfortably. Sleep apnea is a disorder characterized by temporary loss of breath during sleep. People with sleep apnea require enhanced neck and head support to maintain an open airway and minimize choking episodes. Most down pillows do not provide this level of reinforcement. Vegans oppose products that use animal-based components, even if the animals are not killed or harmed in the process. Down and feather pillows will not be suitable for dedicated vegans, but down alternative pillows – cushioned with polyester puffballs that mimic the softness of authentic down – can be a comfortable substitute. Down pillows are widely available in the standard, queen, and king sizes. Although some brands offer down and feather body pillows, these models are much less common. Next, we’ll discuss the most common pillow sizes and dimensions. Please note: the dimensions listed below may vary by a few inches, depending on the manufacturer. The standard size typically measures 20 inches wide by 26 inches long. This size is ideal for people who sleep on a twin, twin XL, or full mattress, as well as couples that share a queen, king, or California king. Standards are quite common. The super standard size measures 20 inches wide by 28 inches long, giving sleepers a bit more space than a traditional standard. This size is not particularly common, but some brands offer “standard” sizes that are technically super standards based on their measurements. Another very common size, the queen measures 20 inches wide and 30 inches long. If you tend to change sleep positions or toss and turn, the queen offers a bit of extra space compared to the standard. A typical king size pillow measures 20 inches wide and 36 inches long, so this will be an ideal size for anyone who moves around frequently in bed. Keep in mind that this size will take up most of the surface of a twin or twin XL mattress, so you may only need one if your bed is this size. A body pillow is quite long – usually 54 inches or longer – but its width will be about 20 inches. You can sleep with a body pillow beneath your head while snuggling with it, a favored position among many pregnant women. Unfortunately, you’ll have a hard time finding body pillows made from authentic down. Down alternative body pillows are much more common. A manufacturer that offers ethically sourced and cruelty-free down and feather products should carry a certification attesting to these qualities. The is considered one of the most prominent certifying organizations for this type of material. In recent years, manufacturers of down and feather products have faced added scrutiny for how these materials are harvested from ducks and geese. As noted during an in-depth report from , plucking down and feathers from live birds can leave bloody wounds and open sores on the animals. Inhumane living conditions for animals and force-feeding practices are other issues that have come under attack from animal rights activists. The RDS carries strict criteria. In order to earn this certification, manufacturers cannot pluck down or feathers from live birds or force-feed the animals. The RDS also requires “holistic respect for animal welfare,” which means the birds must be treated humanely from the time they hatch until they are slaughtered. The RDS awards this certification after thoroughly auditing the manufacturer during a series of onsite visits, animal inspections, and staff interviews. Many manufacturers claim their down products are ethically produced, but you should still ask to see certifications that prove these products are made humanely. You can usually find a standard or queen size down pillow in the range of $80 to $200. However, fill content can affect the price since pillows containing 100 percent down tend to be quite expensive, whereas pillows with a high content of feather fill often cost much less. Many down pillows should only be spot cleaned or dry cleaned if stains occur. Washing them in a machine can damage the down and also cause rips in the cover that lead to escaping fill. However, you can place most down pillows in a dryer to recover their shape. Some down pillows can be washed and dried in your household machine, so be sure to check the care tag just in case. Where can I buy a down pillow? Down pillows are widely available through online and brick-and-mortar sellers. However, you’ll want to check the product specs to ensure you aren’t buying a “down” pillow that contains 90 percent feathers. Most down pillows are well made and offer decent longevity, so expect them to last at least two to three years. Cover durability is a key concern. If the fabric does not hold up well over time and the seams come apart, then the pillow may lose some of its fill. You can use a pillowcase or protector to extend the lifespan, too. Most down pillows cannot be adjusted by adding or removing fill, but many manufacturers offer multiple loft options and allow you to exchange the pillow if it feels too thick or thin. You should never attempt to adjust a down pillow yourself unless it is explicitly designed for customizable loft. Otherwise you could permanently damage the pillow. The treatments and cleaning procedures for down and feather fill can result in a distinct odor for new down pillows. However, most people say these smells dissipate within a few days. Try placing the down pillow in a dryer before using it for the first time. This will help its shape expand and flush out unwanted odors.

Learn more about our process Buckwheat pillows – also known as sobakawa – originated in Japan, but today they are used across the globe. These pillows are filled with buckwheat hulls, the hard outer casings of buckwheat seeds. The hulls have a firm feel but they are quite small and will conform closely to the head and neck; many people liken buckwheat pillows to firm, dense bean bags. The best buckwheat hull pillows offer many benefits for sleepers. For one, they are fully adjustable. You can add or remove hulls from the interior to change how lofty and supportive the pillow feels. The hulls are quite durable, as well, and many buckwheat pillow manufacturers sell extra hulls in bulk when owners need to replenish their supply. Another advantage is excellent temperature regulation. The hulls promote steady airflow throughout the pillow’s core, and many of these models come with breathable cotton or organic cotton covers. If this type of pillow sounds comfortable – or at least intriguing – check out our best buckwheat pillow guide below. We’ll discuss the origin and evolution of sobakawa pillows, how they are constructed, how well they perform in different categories, and what to expect in terms of sizing and pricing. First, let’s explore our best buckwheat pillow picks. Each selection is based on experiences and reviews from verified owners, and hands-on product analysis from our testing crew. Best Luxury – Best Adjustable – Those who prefer firm support and gentle contouring from their pillow Use this SleepFoundation.org link for the most current discount on Hullo pillows First up is the Hullo, a buckwheat pillow that is made in the United States. Thanks to an entry-level price-point, the Hullo is a great option if you’ve never tried a buckwheat pillow before and want to test out an affordable model. Small, standard, and king sizes are available. Hullo also offers hassle-free returns within 60 nights, giving you ample time to try out the pillow and decide whether it’s right for you. While the pillow offers adjustable loft, it maintains a fairly firm feel regardless of the fill volume. This makes it ideal for side and back sleepers seeking a pillow that delivers strong support. The cover is made of organic cotton twill, which is highly breathable and long-lasting. The cover, combined with the naturally durable hulls, gives the pillow excellent longevity. Hullo also sells hulls in 10- or 20-pound bulk shipments whenever you need to replace the original fill. As is the case with other buckwheat pillows, you’ll never need to clean the Hullo’s fill but the cover can be washed and dried in any household machine. Keep in mind the pillow can weigh anywhere from four to 12 pounds at full capacity, depending on which size you select. Hullo offers free standard shipping for all orders in the contiguous U.S.  14"" x 20"" - $95 6"" x 17"" - $109 16"" x 28"" - $139 Sleepers looking for a pillow with adjustable loft Comes with GOTS certified organic cotton pillowcase Use this SleepFoundation.org link for the most current discount on Sweet Zzz pillows The Sweet Zzz Buckwheat Pillow is a great option for people who prefer to buy organic, sustainably made products. Both the cotton cover and non-GMO buckwheat hull fill have received certification from the Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS), one of the world’s leading authorities on these types of products. The hulls can also be added or removed to adjust the pillow’s overall loft, making it suitable for most people regardless of their sleep position – though back sleepers will probably feel most comfortable. Temperature control is another strength of this pillow. The hulls promote steady airflow throughout the interior to help the pillow maintain a cool core temperature, and the cover is also very breathable. The natural durability of cotton and buckwheat hulls ensures a longer-than-average expected lifespan for the pillow too. Sweet Zzz offers three sizes for the pillow. Those seeking a traditional rectangular shape can opt for the queen size. Other options include a smaller Japanese size that could be likened to a throw pillow, as well as a cylindrical size that can be used as a bolster as well as a headrest. The cover can be washed and dried in any household machine, though you’ll first need to remove the hulls. Standard shipping is free for all pillow orders within the contiguous U.S. Sweet Zzz also offers a 50-night sleep trial for the pillow, along with a one-year warranty. Sleepers who prefer a plush feel with added support for their down pillow Shoppers looking for a down pillow with above-average durability Enased in an extra-thick, machine-washable cotton pillowcase Use this SleepFoundation.org link for the most current discount on PineTales Cotton pillows The PineTales Buckwheat Pillow from PineTales is a high-quality handmade model. The pillow is filled with hulls that are organically grown without any pesticides, making it an environmentally friendly option for shoppers. The hulls are also heat-treated during production to make them less appetizing for insects. The pillow is available in two sizes. In addition to a standard option, you can select a smaller “Japanese” size inspired by traditional sobakawa pillows. The quilted outer cover and inner lining are made of unbleached cotton that offers exceptional breathability. This model sleeps very cool, even compared to other buckwheat pillows, and it will be ideal for people who tend to overheat in bed. Both cover components are completely machine washable, as well – you’ll just need to remove the hulls first. PineTales also sells rayon from bamboo pillowcases for those who prefer extra cooling. If you need to replenish your hull supply, the company offers bulk shipments in 1, 3, 5, and 10 pounds. Although the pillow’s price-point is a bit steep compared to similarly constructed models, the quality of materials and construction ensures long-term value for owners. You can also test out the pillow for up to 45 nights before deciding whether to keep or return it. If you aren’t satisfied with the buckwheat pillow, consider the Millet Pillow from PineTales instead; millet hulls offer a slightly softer feel and better moldability than buckwheat hulls. Sleepers who want a very firm feel for their pillow Shoppers who are unsure which pillow size is best for them Filled with buckwheat hulls grown in the U.S. and cleaned without fumigants Use this SleepFoundation.org link for the most current discount on ComfyComfy pillows Durability is a hallmark of most buckwheat pillows due to their long-lasting hulls. The ComfySleep Buckwheat Pillow is a standout due in part to its cover, which is made from 12-ounce organic cotton in a sturdy twill weave that offers more long-term strength than percale or sateen. You can also include a Pima cotton pillowcase with your purchase for only $10 if you’d like some added protection.

The cotton for the cover is also domestically grown. For sizing, you can choose from five options. These include three smaller sizes inspired by traditional sobakawa styles, as well as standard and queen sizes more familiar to western sleepers. Depending on the size you choose, the pillow may weigh anywhere from 4 to 10 pounds when filled to capacity. The ComfySleep Buckwheat Pillow’s sticker price is on par with other buckwheat models, even with the pillowcase added. Extra hulls are sold in 2- and 10-pound bulk shipments. Standard shipping is free for all orders, or you can select expedited shipping for an extra charge. ComfyComfy also offers full refunds on returns made within 60 days of the original purchase.

If you aren’t satisfied with the wool, considering trying one of the alternate fill materials instead. The pillow offers a loft of up to 4.5 inches. Sachi Organics backs the pillow with a 30-night sleep trial and issues full refunds on all returns within this period. In addition to buying it online, you can purchase the Sachi Organics Rejuvenation Pillow at one of the company’s dedicated showrooms or brick-and-mortar sleep health stores across the country. Known as sobakawa in their home country of Japan, buckwheat pillows are filled with hulls, the hard outer casings of buckwheat seeds. Hulls can be added to or removed from the interior to adjust the loft, or thickness. This makes buckwheat pillows highly customizable and suitable for both side and back sleeping, though the hulls maintain a very firm feel regardless of the fill volume. Buckwheat pillows offer other benefits for sleepers, as well. The hulls do not trap body heat like synthetic fills, allowing the pillow to sleep quite cool. Hulls are also naturally hypoallergenic, making them a good alternative for people who are allergic to down, feathers, and/or latex. Longevity is another strong point of buckwheat pillows since the hulls are very durable; most pillow manufacturers sell extra hulls in bulk when the time comes to replenish your supply. You’ll never need to clean the hulls, but most buckwheat pillows come with cotton covers that can be washed and dried in your household machines. There are also some drawbacks to using a buckwheat pillow. Most complaints from sleepers stem from the very firm feel of these pillows – excessively firm for some people. The hulls may also emit a strong initial odor that takes several days to completely dissipate. Weight may be another issue for some individuals because buckwheat pillows can weigh as much as 10 to 12 pounds when full to capacity. Read on to learn more about buckwheat pillows. Our guide will include important factors for first-time buckwheat pillow buyers, pros and cons, and some answers to frequently asked questions about these products. Before deciding which buckwheat pillow to purchase, we recommend comparing different brands and models to see how they stack up in terms of construction, size, and price. Most buckwheat pillows sold today are fairly similar to one another but there are some important distinctions to take into account. What to Consider When Purchasing a Buckwheat Pillow For most people, the biggest draw for buckwheat pillows is their ease of adjustment. Hulls can be added or removed to change how thick and supportive the pillow feels, and most brands offer bulk hull shipments at reasonable prices when you need to refresh your fill. Expect to pay about $5 to $15 per pound for extra hulls. Buckwheat pillows are also ideal for people who prefer natural products. Many models are filled with hulls that are grown and harvested organically without pesticides or chemical fertilizers, and organic cotton covers are also common. Be sure to check for certifications if you encounter a buckwheat pillow that is advertised as organic. The Global Organic Textile Standard and the U.S. Department of Agriculture are two of the most prominent certifying organizations for products made from organic materials. You should take other assertions about buckwheat pillows with a grain of salt, too. Some brands claim that adjusting the loft will also change the pillow’s firmness, but this is a bit misleading. While buckwheat pillows can be adjusted for loft, they will maintain a firm to very firm feel due to the natural hardness of the hulls. Buckwheat pillows are also less than ideal for many stomach sleepers due to their thickness and firmness, despite some brands that claim their pillows are suitable for all sleep positions. Rather than relying on claims and assertions from buckwheat pillow sellers, we recommend focusing on the following factors instead. Most buckwheat pillows are designed for adjustable loft. Their designs include a zippered outer cover that allows access to the interior and a lined pouch to house the hulls. This level of customization is especially helpful for people who sleep in different positions, since side sleeping generally requires more loft than back sleeping. Buckwheat hulls are quite firm, so these pillows provide excellent support for most side and back sleepers. The hulls mold to the body without sinking too much, ensuring strong reinforcement for the head and neck. Adjusting the loft by adding or removing hulls can make the pillow feel more supportive depending on which sleep position you use. Most buckwheat pillows are considered firm to very firm. Some sleepers love how hard and supportive the pillows feel, while others find them excessively stiff and bulky. Exceptions include pillows filled with a blend of buckwheat hulls and softer material that provides more cushioning, such as the Sachi Organics Rejuvenation Pillow listed in our top picks. Side sleeping usually requires more pillow loft to ensure the head and neck are aligned with the spine. With a high volume of hulls, buckwheat pillows can alleviate pressure for side sleepers very well. Back sleeping promotes spinal alignment, so this position does not need as much loft to reduce pressure for sleepers. Like other types of pillows sold in North America, buckwheat pillows are typically sold in standard, queen, and king sizes. Some brands also offer smaller sizes inspired by traditional sobakawa pillows from Japan. Body pillows with buckwheat hulls are very rare, but they are available through select brands. The average buckwheat pillow in a queen or king size costs between $50 and $150. Shoppers can usually save some money by choosing a smaller, traditional sobakawa size. When buying hulls in bulk, you’ll usually pay $5 to $15 per pound; in some cases, you’ll pay less per pound by buying shipments of 10 pounds or more. Buckwheat hulls are very durable but the pillows will eventually flatten, so you’ll likely need to make at least one bulk hull purchase before the pillow reaches the end of its lifespan. Also be sure to check the cover composition. Common materials for buckwheat pillow covers include standard cotton, organic cotton, and rayon from bamboo. The hulls mold quite closely to the body. Many liken the feel of a buckwheat pillow to that of a very firm beanbag. Since the hulls are so small, the pillow will contour quite closely to the head and neck to deliver enhanced support and pressure relief. Temperature neutrality is a major strength of these pillows. The hulls promote steady airflow throughout the interior and do not trap body heat like other fill materials (such as foam). Most buckwheat pillows have breathable cover materials, as well. Buckwheat pillows offer adjustable loft, strong support, and great overall durability. However, many people find these pillows excessively firm; we recommend trying out a buckwheat pillow as part of a sleep trial before finalizing your purchase to ensure it won’t feel too stiff for your head and neck. Pros and cons for buckwheat pillows include the following: Buckwheat pillows can be adjusted for loft by adding or removing hulls from the interior. These pillows are ideal for anyone who prefers a thicker pillow one night and less loft the next. The hulls are quite durable, ensuring a longer-than-average lifespan for buckwheat pillows. Most brands sell extra hulls in bulk, as well. Buckwheat pillows offer unparalleled support thanks to their adjustability and the natural firmness of their hull fill. The hulls promote consistent airflow to maintain a comfortable core temperature, making these pillows ideal for hot sleepers. Most buckwheat pillows are also encased in breathable cotton or rayon from bamboo covers, too. The most common complaint about buckwheat pillows is that they feel too firm. Unlike the pillow’s loft, you won’t be able to adjust the firmness by adding or removing hulls. Odor potential is high for new buckwheat pillows; the hulls carry a distinct, earthy smell that may persist for several days after you unpack the pillow. Buckwheat pillows also have high noise potential. The hulls produce a rustling sound as they mold to the head and neck, and some sleepers find this disruptive. Compared to other pillow types, buckwheat pillows are a bit pricey. The average standard and queen size models cost between $50 and $150. Anyone who wants exceptional firmness and strong support for their head and neck is very well suited to a buckwheat pillow. Since these pillows have adjustable loft, you’ll be able to customize how thick your pillow feels on a nightly basis. Other sleepers who are or are not well suited to buckwheat pillows include the following: Side Sleepers: By molding to the head and neck while maintaining strong support, a lofty buckwheat pillow can promote spinal alignment for side sleepers. Flatter pillows can negatively affect spinal alignment, so side sleepers typically feel more pressure when using them. The best buckwheat pillow for neck pain will support your head and neck without sinking too much, ensuring even alignment. Back Sleepers: Back sleepers tend to feel most comfortable on buckwheat pillows with medium loft. This ensures their head and neck lie on an even plane with the rest of their body, which can cut down on pressure points and prevent . Those with Allergies: Some people have buckwheat allergies but this condition is fairly rare. Buckwheat pillows can also serve as comfortable alternatives for people with allergies to latex, down, feathers, and other pillow fill materials. Hot Sleepers: Buckwheat pillows . The hulls will not absorb and trap body heat like foam or down, and air circulates freely throughout the interior. Most of these pillows also include covers made from breathable fabrics. Those Who Prefer Plush Pillows: Even when the hull fill is supplemented with softer materials such as wool or cotton batting, buckwheat pillows generally feel quite firm. This is considered their most polarizing characteristic. Many people love the exceptional firmness and support, but others simply find the pillows uncomfortable and excessively stiff. Stomach Sleepers: Most prefer low to medium loft for their pillow. If the pillow is too thick, it can force the head and neck to rest at an uncomfortable angle. Stomach sleepers typically prefer a plusher feel, as well. Some stomach sleepers find buckwheat pillows quite comfortable, but they are in the minority. Light Sleepers: The pillow will produce a soft rustling sound as the hulls contour to the head and . This can disrupt sleep for people who awaken easily due to noise. Most buckwheat pillow brands offer a selection of sizes, including western and traditional options. At the same time, buckwheat pillows are not as widely sold as most pillow types and you may be limited to a small number of sellers based on your budget. Sizes for buckwheat pillows include the following: Standard: A standard rectangular pillow typically measures 20 inches wide by 26 inches long, though there is some variability from brand to brand. One of the most popular pillow sizes, the standard is ideal for people who mostly remain still while sleeping and don’t toss, turn, or change positions too often. Super Standard: A super standard measures 20 inches wide by 28 inches long. This size is best suited to people who enjoy the standard size but want a couple extra inches of space, but super standards are not particularly common. Queen: A queen size pillow usually measures 20 inches wide by 30 inches long. Queens, like standards and kings, are quite popular and widely available. This size is a good “middle of the road” option if you find standards too narrow and kings too wide. King: Most king size pillows measure 20 inches wide by 36 inches long. This size is optimal for people who toss and turn or change sleep positions rather frequently. If you share your mattress with someone, you will need a wider bed to accommodate two king size pillows. Body: Buckwheat body pillows are quite rare but they are available through certain sellers. Since the hulls mold closely, these pillows are actually quite conducive to side sleeping and snuggling with a pillow. However, buckwheat body pillows are very heavy and can weigh more than 20 pounds when full to capacity. Specialty: In keeping with the traditional sobakawa design, many buckwheat pillow brands offer “Japanese” or “personal” sizes that are a bit smaller than the standard. They can be used for sleeping if you don’t need much width, and they also work well as knee and leg bolsters. Frequently Asked Questions About Buckwheat Pillows The average buckwheat pillow costs $50 to $150 in a standard or queen size, making these models somewhat expensive compared to other pillow types. Most brands also offer hulls in bulk for about $5 to $15 per pound. To clean a buckwheat pillow, first you must completely empty the hulls; we recommend placing them in a sturdy container such as a plastic bucket or bin. For most models, the cover will be made of cotton, rayon from bamboo, or other machine washable fabrics, making it easy to clean at home. Never attempt to wash the hulls. Buckwheat pillows are somewhat rare but their increasing popularity has led to wider availability in North America. If you’re looking for a traditional size, consider buying the pillow from a company that is based in Japan; some domestic brands offer these sizes, but they are not as common. With proper care and maintenance, buckwheat pillows can last a very long time. Cover deterioration is typically the biggest issue with longevity. As the fabric wears out over time, you may need to replace the cover. The hulls are quite durable and buckwheat pillow brands usually offer extra hulls in bulk. Buckwheat pillows are completely adjustable for loft and support. Simply add or remove the hulls to change how thick the pillow is. However, most buckwheat pillows are very firm regardless of how many hulls you use, so their feel cannot be adjusted. The hulls may emit a distinct, earthy odor when the pillow is new. Over time the hulls will lose their smell but it may take a week or longer for the odors to completely dissipate. Buckwheat pillows can be constructed entirely with natural, plant-based components, making them very eco-friendly compared to pillow types that require synthetic materials. Many buckwheat pillows are organic, meaning the buckwheat plants are grown and harvested without chemical fertilizers or pesticides. The cotton used to assemble the cover may be certified as organic if it meets certain criteria, as well.

We’ll discuss the benefits and drawbacks of down alternative pillows, and provide advice on how to choose the right loft, firmness level, size, and shape. What to Consider When Purchasing a Down Alternative Pillow Many down alternative pillows appear similar at first glance. Furthermore, bedding companies can often use confusing marketing terms to vaunt the advantages of their products. This makes it difficult to compare pillows from different manufacturers, making it even trickier to know which pillow is right for you. Understanding the primary factors that influence pillow performance is key to knowing what attributes to look for. We’ve provided a summary of the most important factors to help you find the pillow that best suits your sleeping style. The loft of a pillow refers to how high it sits. Pillows with a thicker loft will keep your head at a sharper angle compared to flatter pillows. Since down alternative pillows tend to compress when you lie on them, you may consider buying a pillow with a slightly higher loft. Alternatively, you can buy a down alternative pillow with extra filling and adjust it until you find the loft that allows your head to sit at a comfortable angle. The support provided by a pillow is determined mostly by its loft, firmness, and contouring ability. Most down alternative pillows offer a medium level of support, which should be sufficient for most sleepers, but may cause neck strain in those who require closer contouring or a firmer surface. Some sleepers may find that scrunching the pillow into shape can help bolster the neck. The tighter a pillow is packed with down alternative filling, the firmer it will feel. That said, down alternative is inherently fluffy and there’s a limit to how firm it can get. Those who need a firmer surface may prefer a buckwheat or latex pillow. Although they don’t contour to the same extent as memory foam pillows, down alternative pillows are much softer than buckwheat or latex pillows. As a result, common pressure points that tend to form in places like the ears shouldn’t be a problem with a down alternative pillow. Unlike memory foam pillows which can come molded to any form, most down alternative pillows come in a classic rectangular shape. They can be further pummeled to fit the space you need, but left alone they will usually spring back to their original shape. Down alternative pillows are somewhat high-maintenance in that they must be constantly re-fluffed to avoid flattening out and developing lumps. Pillows can cost well into the hundreds of dollars depending on their materials and build. Down alternative pillows tend to be among the cheapest, although shoppers should keep in mind that they’ll need to be replaced every few years. The quality of the materials used to make a pillow have an impact on its durability, as well as its ability to provide support and pressure relief. Poor-quality materials may feel welcoming at first but are usually quick to break down. Down alternative made with polyester fiber is usually not very high quality. If you’re concerned about this, look for a pillow that blends down alternative with or latex to make it more resistant. Many sleepers appreciate the ability to mold their pillow to some extent. Down alternative lends itself well to this, taking on any form you punch it into and returning to its original shape afterward. A pillow that traps heat can be terribly uncomfortable, especially for those who run hot or who live in warm climates. Luckily, down alternative pillows have a breathable structure and are known for . What Are the Pros and Cons of Down Alternative Pillows? Down alternative pillows are cool, soft, and allergy-friendly. What’s not to love? The following are some of the major pros and cons. Down alternative comes close to rivaling real down for softness, and since it doesn’t weigh very much, it’s easy to move. For those who like the softness of down but prefer to keep the animals out of it, down alternative may present a more ethical choice. Some pillows may trap dust, but in general, down alternative is usually made of synthetic fibers that don’t provoke allergies as real down would. In contrast to other pillow types, most down alternative pillows can be machine-washed and -dried. Like real down pillows, down alternative pillows are highly scrunchable and can be molded into the user’s preferred shape. Down alternative pillows are one of the cheapest types of pillows, with a much lower price tag than real down. Whether made of polyester fiber or cotton, down alternative doesn’t trap heat, and the fluffy composition of the pillow allows room for airflow to keep the temperature neutral. Many manufacturers offer the option to add or remove filling so users can customize the loft and firmness according to their sleeping position. Down alternative is usually made of polyester microfiber or cotton, neither of which has a strong smell. Down alternative is one of the most common material types, and consequently there is a wide range of down alternative pillows to choose from. While down alternative pillows can be re-fluffed to some extent, most down alternative pillows gradually lose their fluffiness and get flatter over time. Down alternative doesn’t conform as closely as materials like memory foam, which may affect its ability to provide pressure relief in sleepers with more sensitive needs. As with a real down or feather pillow, down alternative is known to compress significantly under the sleeper’s head, which can lead to neck and shoulder pain in side sleepers or those who weigh more than 230 pounds. A gusseted edge may help mitigate this problem. Down alternative can produce some noise when shifting positions, and some down alternative pillows also have a crackly cover. Some sleepers may find their pillow feels increasingly lumpy as the contents clump together. Down alternative pillows sleep cool and are versatile enough to be used for any sleeping position. They also present an attractive alternative for allergy sufferers or those concerned about the ethics of animal products. Because they can be adjusted for firmness and loft, down alternative pillows work well for stomach, back, and side sleepers. Stomach sleepers should find that low-loft pillows flatten out nicely to reduce twisting of the neck. Firmer, higher-loft pillows can be scrunched into shape for back and sleepers or those with a more eclectic sleeping style. Down alternative is an allergy-free option for people who suffer from allergies to animal dander. Most down alternative pillows are also resistant to dust mites and mold. Down alternative pillows are highly breathable, making them popular with those who sleep hot. Down pillows are soft and luxurious, but they present an ethical problem for people who try to avoid animal products. The next best thing is down alternative, which offers many of the same advantages without the moral dilemma. Down alternative pillows don’t always stay put like latex, and they don’t offer the close conforming of memory foam. This means they may not be suitable for people with , as this group needs sturdier support to keep the head, neck, and spine aligned. Those who do choose a down alternative pillow should opt for a higher loft than normal to compensate for the fact that the pillow will sink a little when lying on it. Snorers and people who suffer from sleep apnea do best with a pillow that keeps the head elevated. This helps open the airway, reducing the chances of restricted breathing. Unfortunately, most down alternative pillows are not supportive enough to maintain the head at this angle. Sleepers who use a CPAP machine may also find this hard to accommodate with a down alternative pillow. Since down alternative compresses under weight, sleepers who weigh more than 230 pounds may find it fails to provide sufficient support. Which Down Alternative Pillow Sizes Are Available? Down alternative pillows come in most of the standard mattress sizes. The exact dimensions may vary between manufacturers. Standard pillows measure 20 by 26 inches. Their relatively small size makes them suitable for use with any size mattress, including a twin or full sized mattress. They’re also a good option for people who like sleeping right up to the edge of their pillow. Almost all manufacturers offer a standard option. Two inches larger than standard pillows, Super Standard pillows measure in at 20 by 28 inches. This is a less common size, but may be a good option for those who need just a little bit more length. You may also see these under the name “Jumbo Pillow.” The queen size pillow is one of the most common, in large part due to the popularity of queen size mattresses. At 20 by 30 inches, this size is ideal for a queen mattress or for anyone who wants a slightly longer pillow. King size pillows measure 20 by 36 inches. This is significantly longer than a queen size pillow and may be perfect for sleepers who tend to shift from side to side throughout the night. It’s also long enough to make a useful prop when sitting up in bed. Body pillows usually measure 20 by 54 inches. Many side sleepers find that “hugging” a body pillow helps align the hips and knees in order to improve spinal alignment and reduce pressure points. Frequently Asked Questions About Down Alternative Pillows The average price for a down alternative pillow is between $20 and $30. High-quality down alternative pillows can range up to $80. Proprietary materials, cooling technology such as phase-change material or gel beads, and the quality of the cover can all raise the price-point. Most down alternative pillows are machine-washable and can be tumble-dried on low heat. Adding a tennis ball to the dryer can help ensure the pillow dries evenly and stays fluffy. Always be sure to check the care instructions before washing the pillow for the first time, as some may be dry-clean or spot-clean only. Down alternative pillows are easy to find online and in brick-and-mortar stores. This gives them another advantage over feather and down pillows, which are comparatively rare. The average down pillow lasts around 2 years before needing to be replaced. Machine-drying the pillow and fluffing it regularly can help boost the loft for a while, but eventually, the contents will flatten out and the pillow will be unable to maintain its original height. As this lifespan is on the short end for a pillow, it’s something to keep in mind when setting your budget. Down alternative pillows are adjustable in that users can add or remove filling to change the loft, and scrunch the pillow into shape. However, it’s not as common to find down alternative pillows with removable inserts or other personalizable features. Those who want a specific shape, such as a cervical neck pillow, would do better to look for a material that holds its shape, like memory foam or latex. Unlike real down or memory foam pillows, brand-new down alternative pillows have little to no odor. This is a major benefit for people who are sensitive to smell.

Proper and good night sleep can only be achieved with the presence of comfortable pillows. Most of us think that all pillows are just the same with each other. However, choosing the right kind of pillow can also be very tricky. What we don’t know is that there are actually pillows designed or created for specific types of sleepers. We can agree that some of us prefer sleeping on our backs. Others would also like to sleep on their stomach while there are also some who prefer turning to their sides during sleep. So in case we are one of those people who find comfort in positioning to the side, it is then necessary for us to know the best type of pillow that is suitable for our way or position in sleeping. But what is the best pillow for side sleepers? There are actually various types of pillows available these days. Some of them are firm, while others are extremely soft and cuddly. However, we must also consider our sleeping type or position in buying or choosing the right type of pillow for our use. One of the most common sleep types is none other than the side sleepers. These are people who can achieve good sleep in positioning to their sides. Side sleepers are also further subdivided into three types. The first type is the type of sleeper who usually curls on one side, which is almost similar to the fetal position. The second type of sleeper is the one who lies on one side with both arms extended forward. The third type of side sleeper is the one who also lies on the side but the arms are pointing downwards. No matter what type of side sleeper we are, there are actually that are specifically designed to satisfy or enhance the comfort of our position in sleeping. Most of these pillows provided for side sleepers are soft and huggable unlike the firm ones designed for those who sleep on their backs. The traditional soft and plump pillows are the best types of pillows for side sleepers. However, there are still special pillows made for side sleepers who are having a hard time attaining optimal sleep at night. These sleepers include those who experience the following symptoms such as waking up in the middle of the night with sore ear, waking up and feeling achy all over the body, experiencing neck or back pain and as well as snoring. So what are these pillows suitable for side sleepers having a hard time finding sleeping? Pillows designed for side sleepers should be able to satisfy the needs or the wants of the body during sleep. As we sleep on our sides at night, it is usual for us to feel as if our shoulder is always in the way. Because of this, the pillows of side sleepers are designed in order to provide comfort on the pressured area. This pillow ensures sleepers of getting a comfortable and healthy night’s sleep. Pillows are actually very important during sleep. These items go hand in hand with the mattress and the blanket in providing good and comfortable sleep. The pillow is designed in order to provide support on the vital or delicate parts of the body during sleep such as the neck and the head. Pillows are also used in order to help keep the spine properly aligned during deep slumber. However, once we keep on waking in the middle of the night adjusting or reshaping the pillow in order to provide the comfort we are looking for, then this only means that the pillow that we currently have is not suitable in satisfying our needs. Great pillows designed particularly for side sleepers are capable of cradling the neck and as well as the other delicate joints in our upper body. This is the reason why comfort is always achieved using the right type of side sleeper pillows. These pillows are also created in order to make sure that the head and the body is properly aligned. This prevents us from waking in the middle of the night just to adjust the shape or the form of the pillow. Aside from this using the perfect side sleeper pillow allows us to wake up the next morning feeling more refreshed and rejuvenated without the achy feelings in the body that we usually have before. In addition to these, the texture of the is also thick and foamy. This aids in relieving the pressure placed on our arms during sleep thus providing more comfort and satisfaction. With the use of the thick memory foam pillow, our head will be adequately held and the sleeper’s arm can be free or supporting it. Aside from the thickness of the pillow, side sleepers also require something that is soft. Using firm pillows can cause an angle that is not comfortable for the neck or the head. A good pillow should also cushion any area placed with pressure and must also adjust to the contour of the head and the neck rather than the other way around. This prevents causing stiff neck or any discomfort as we wake up the next day. are already available in local department stores and can also be purchased through the internet. As we can see, buying pillows that are suitable for our position in sleeping can be a very good investment. This avoids us from spending more money in treating stiff neck and other pains caused by other pillows. What are Your Views on This?

Learn more about our process It’s estimated that of the American population suffers from scoliosis. Characterized by the presence of an unnatural curve in the spine, scoliosis can cause added pressure and sore spots that make it difficult to get a good night’s sleep. While the right mattress won’t cure scoliosis, some of the pain from scoliosis can be alleviated with a mattress that delivers pressure relief and spinal support where it’s most needed. In turn, this can help you get the quality sleep you need to work your way toward healthy spinal alignment. We’ll offer advice on how to choose the best mattress for scoliosis, diving into the science behind how scoliosis affects your sleep and explaining how to choose a mattress that fits your individual needs. We’ll also include some of our top picks for mattresses on the market today. Best for Back and Stomach Sleepers –  Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King Those who experience pain or pressure points along the spine Excellent pressure relief for side and back sleepers Get $399 worth of free accessories with every mattress purchase. People living with scoliosis typically need a mattress that will cradle the body and alleviate pressure along the spine. The Nectar Lush fits this description to a T. The mattress is constructed with a 3-inch comfort layer of medium-feel memory foam that contours very closely to reduce aches and pains in sensitive areas. The Lush also features transitional and base layers of high-density polyfoam to reinforce the sleep surface and prevent sleepers from sinking too much. Since the Lush has a medium feel, it is best suited to people who weigh up to 230 pounds – side and back sleepers in particular. People in this weight group receive a comfortable balance of cushioning and support. This mattress is also a good choice for co-sleepers. The foams absorb movement and prevent it from transferring across the surface, which can be useful for those who share their bed with people who have scoliosis and are prone to tossing and turning. The Lush is also completely silent, allowing you to sleep soundly whenever their partner gets in and out of bed. Although the Lush is somewhat expensive for an all-foam mattress, Nectar offers a few perks for customers. Ground shipping is free anywhere in the contiguous U.S. and the company’s 365-night sleep trial is one of the longest in the industry. Additionally, the mattress is backed by a lifetime warranty that protects against structural defects for as long as you own it.  Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King Side and back sleepers under 230 pounds, including combination sleepers Fans of foam mattresses who tend to overheat at night Get 15% off a Leesa Mattress with code: SLEEPFOUNDATION Designed with pressure relief in mind, the all-foam has a top layer of responsive polyfoam, a second layer of memory foam, and a high-density polyfoam support core. Due to its proprietary foam designed to reduce heat retention, the Leesa sleeps relatively cool for an all-foam mattress. The mattress has a medium feel, or 5 out of 10. Its contouring foams align the spine and relieve pressure points in side and back sleepers under 230 pounds, including adolescents with scoliosis. The all-foam construction of the Leesa mattress ensures that very little motion gets transferred from one side of the bed to the other. This makes the mattress a good choice for sensitive sleepers who share the bed. Despite this commendable motion isolation, the Leesa mattress also has a bit of bounce. This comes in handy for sex, and it makes it easier to switch positions to avoid pressure points from your scoliosis. Leesa is a certified-B corporation that works with non-profit organizations to donate mattresses to children in need. The Leesa mattress comes with a 10-year warranty and 100-night sleep trial, subject to a 30-night break-in period.  Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King, Split King People whose firmness preferences fall between medium firm and firm Shoppers who would like to buy a mattress with a long sleep trial period Flippable design allows for customization of top and bottom sleep surfaces Hybrid design balances contouring from adaptive polyfoam with deep support of pocketed coils Save 30% on any Idle mattress with this code: NEWYEAR30 Some people with scoliosis have firmness preferences that vary from night to night. A reversible mattress is ideal for these individuals because these models have distinct feels on the top and bottom sides. The is one such mattress. You can choose between a medium firm (6) or firm (8) feel for both sleep surfaces. Selecting a different feel on each side allows you to flip the mattress and adjust the feel whenever a change is needed, while opting for the same firmness level on both sides can extend the bed’s lifespan if you periodically rotate it. Both sleep surfaces of the Idle Hybrid feature comfort layers of adaptive polyfoam. This material contours evenly like memory foam, but without the signature “body hug” that some people find uncomfortable. The medium firm feel conforms more closely, but both firmness levels offer decent support thanks to transitional layers of dense polyfoam and a shared support core of strong pocketed coils. The Idle Hybrid is also well suited to hot sleepers because the coils promote steady airflow throughout the mattress core. Responsiveness is another strong point. Thanks to the coils, both surfaces have a springy feel that allows you to move across the mattress without sinking. Couples typically prefer bouncier mattresses for sex too. The Idle Hybrid’s price-point is quite reasonable compared to other hybrid models and Idle provides free ground shipping anywhere in the contiguous U.S. The company also offers an 18-month sleep trial, which is one of the longest in the mattress industry, and a lifetime warranty for added peace of mind.  Soft (4), Medium (6), Firm (7), Plus (8)  Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King Any sleeper type, including those who weigh more than 300 pounds Scoliosis sufferers who could use zoned spinal support Coil-on-coil design allows for excellent airflow and cooling delivers targeted spinal support for scoliosis patients using a combination of micro-coils, a lumbar pad, and zoned pocketed coils. With four firmness options to choose from, the WinkBed has appeal for sleepers of any body type or position preference. The mattress is available in medium soft (4), medium firm (6), firm (7-8), and Plus (7-8) options. The medium soft model provides above-average motion isolation for couples. In turn, the Plus option replaces the micro-coil layer with a layer of latex to provide added support for sleepers over 300 pounds. All four models have a plush Euro-top cover that provides some initial pressure relief. WinkBeds boasts excellent edge support due to reinforced coils around the perimeter of the bed. The mattress’s breathable Tencel cover and coil-on-coil construction also allow for a healthy amount of airflow to keep the mattress cool. Combination sleepers will appreciate the bed’s responsive surface, which facilitates movement and is an advantage for sex. The WinkBed is made with durable materials and backed by a lifetime warranty against workmanship and manufacturing defects. WinkBeds also offers a 120-night sleep trial, on the condition that customers are required to sleep on the mattress for at least 30 nights before requesting a return.  Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King Celliant fiber cover for cooling and better recovery The all-foam has a 12-inch profile and a medium firm feel which falls at a 6 out of 10 on our firmness scale. The mattress combines four layers of premium foams that form a supportive yet pressure-relieving cradle for side and back sleepers with scoliosis. Most memory foam mattresses respond slowly to pressure, giving sleepers the feeling of being trapped in the bed. In contrast, the Bear Pro has a top layer of polyfoam that shields sleepers from the sinking feel of memory foam. This gives the bed a bit more bounce and makes it easier to shift positions. The best part is that the Bear Pro still manages to provide the great motion isolation that we expect from all-foam beds. The Celliant fabric in the cover is designed to reflect body heat back at the sleeper in the form of infrared energy. This is meant to improve circulation and help tissue recovery. In combination with copper and gel infusions in the foams, this also prevents heat build-up in the mattress. The Bear Pro ships free in the contiguous U.S. and comes with a 100-night sleep trial and 10-year warranty.  20 Year - 1st 10 Year unlimited, 2nd 10 Year pro-rated  20 Year - 1st 10 Year unlimited, 2nd 10 Year pro-rated  Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King, Split King Those who normally feel uncomfortably warm on all-foam mattresses Medium firm feel encourages proper spinal alignment The is a 12-inch all-foam mattress. The top layer is made of a plant-based open-cell foam that conforms to reduce pressure points. This rests on top of another foam layer that’s zoned using surface modification technology. Specially designed grooves in this layer enhance airflow and provide targeted cushioning and spinal support for sleepers with scoliosis. The mattress is supported by a high-density polyfoam base layer. Amerisleep also makes a hybrid version of the mattress, replacing the polyfoam base layer with pocketed coils. The AS2 is the second-firmest mattress in Amerisleep’s line-up, with a medium firm feel that equates to a 6 out of 10 on the firmness scale. The mattress provides an even balance of support and pressure relief that is especially comfortable for sleepers under 230 pounds. It’s rare for an all-foam mattress to sleep cool, but the Amerisleep AS2 succeeds in maintaining quite a neutral temperature overnight thanks to the breathable cotton-blend cover and proprietary foams. Because the top layer of foam has a fairly quick response to pressure, the AS2 allows for relatively easy movement. It also has stronger edges than many of its competitors, and people who sleep with a partner should experience minimal disruptions as the foams absorb most motion. Amerisleep ships the mattress free within the continental U.S. and offers a 100-night sleep trial with a mandatory 30-night break-in period. A 20-year warranty protects against manufacturing and workmanship defects.  Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King, Split King, Split California King People with scoliosis who could benefit from enhanced lumbar support Sleepers of any body type or preferred sleeping position Anyone who needs some extra help setting up the bed Free white-glove delivery and removal of old mattress Get $200 off when you spend $1,000 or more at Saatva.com Available in two firmness options, the is a 12-inch mattress with a quilted organic cotton cover and pressure-relieving layers of memory foam. The Loom & Leaf has two primary comfort layers, both made with dense memory foam that conforms slowly to the sleeper’s body to ease pressure points. The top layer of memory foam contains cooling gel swirls, phase-change material, and pincore holes to fend off heat retention. Additional gel in the lumbar area gives extra support to the spine, and several layers of high-density polyfoam provide a stable base for those with scoliosis. Loom & Leaf customers can choose between a medium firm (6) and firm (7-8) mattress. The medium firm model relieves pressure points in sleepers under 230 pounds, while the firm model supplies excellent support to sleepers over 230 pounds. Since the firm mattress conforms less to the sleeper’s body, it offers better temperature neutrality and a bouncier surface for sex. Both models absorb movement so you don’t have to worry about waking your partner every time you switch positions. The Loom & Leaf is not compressed for shipping. Instead, Saatva delivers all its beds with free White Glove delivery, including old mattress removal if needed. The Loom & Leaf has a 180-night sleep trial and a 15-year warranty. You should always work together with your healthcare provider to manage your scoliosis. However, we can offer some advice on how to choose a mattress that keeps your spine supported to help reduce aches and pains. We’ll cover everything you need to know about how a mattress works, how scoliosis affects your sleep, and how to get the most out of your mattress if you have scoliosis. Finding a mattress that ticks all the boxes can seem like an impossible task, especially if you have additional considerations due to your scoliosis. Many mattress companies also like to take advantage of their consumers, using fancy-sounding words to inflate the price of their products. But choosing a mattress for scoliosis doesn’t have to be that difficult. We’ve laid out the most important factors to prioritize to help you narrow down your search. : Mattress prices vary widely depending on the materials and construction of the mattress. The good news for people with scoliosis is that on average, memory foam mattresses have a lower price-point than other materials. You may pay more for cooling technology or other features. All mattresses will eventually start to sag and develop permanent body indentations, rendering them unable to deliver proper support and pressure relief. Mattresses made with higher-quality materials, such as denser foams or higher coil counts, will last longer before they need to be replaced. If you plan to use your mattress for many years, it may be worthwhile to invest in a good-quality one. The right firmness for each person is mostly determined by body type, preferred sleeping position, and personal preference. A mattress that is too hard may cause uncomfortable pressure points, while a mattress that is too soft may fail to keep the back sufficiently supported. Depending on your sleeping position and the kind of scoliosis you have, you may experience uncomfortable pressure points where certain parts of your body jut into the mattress. Conforming materials like memory foam or latex can help cushion these pressure points to help reduce pain. *sagging hips also cause pressure build-up Edge support is important for people who struggle to get in and out of bed, or who like to spend time sitting on the edge of the bed. Mattresses that compress around the edges can also reduce the amount of usable space when sharing the bed with a partner. Hybrid mattresses and innersprings tend to have the best edge support. Certain materials contour more closely to the curves of the body, allowing heavier parts such as the shoulders and hips to sink in further. This can relieve pressure from these body parts, and may improve spinal alignment in some sleepers. However, close-contouring mattresses can also restrict movement, so they are not for everyone. Hybrid and latex mattresses allow room for airflow, which helps prevent heat build-up. In contrast, memory foam and polyfoam mattresses tend to absorb heat, which can lead to an uncomfortably warm sleep surface. If you tend to run hot, look for a mattress made with naturally breathable materials or cooling features such as phase-change material. Ease of movement is important for combination sleepers and can also facilitate sex. If you value being able to easily switch positions on your mattress, look for a latex or hybrid mattress. These mattresses are naturally bouncy and won’t make you feel stuck in the bed. The caveat is that beds with responsive surfaces tend to transfer motion across the bed, which can be a problem if you’re a sensitive sleeper and you share the bed. The materials and construction of a mattress significantly affect factors like contouring, responsiveness, edge support, and temperature regulation. Knowing what features you value in a mattress can help narrow down your search to a specific mattress type. The majority of mattresses that are currently sold are classified either as hybrid, innerspring, latex, airbed, or all-foam. Because they are built similarly, mattresses of a given type will resemble each other to some extent in terms of performance and feel. That said, they will also vary depending on the quality of the materials used and the exact makeup of each individual model. The best type of mattress for scoliosis will depend on your needs. : Hybrid mattresses feature an innerspring support core and a substantial comfort layer section. The comfort layers can be made of polyfoam, memory foam, latex, cotton, wool, or other similar materials. The coils are usually pocketed coils. : Meet In The Middle. Hybrid mattresses are defined by their balanced features. The comfort layers add pressure relief and motion isolation, while the coils contribute to edge support, bounce, temperature neutrality, and overall support. This makes them ideal for people who suffer from pressure points but need an extra-supportive mattress. : Made with a support core of metal coils and occasionally a very thin comfort layer, innerspring mattresses revolutionized the mattress industry in the late 1800s and remained the most popular model for decades. They are steadily decreasing in popularity as people start to explore options with thicker comfort layers. : Cheap And Cheerful. Innerspring mattresses provide a solid support system and good airflow, which is a perfect starting base but usually not cushy enough for someone with scoliosis. For an economical and personalizable bed, those who wish for added pressure relief can purchase a mattress topper in the material of their choice. : Made from the milky-white substance of the rubber tree, natural latex can be processed in several different ways. All-latex mattresses take advantage of this versatility, combining different types of latex in the support core and comfort layers. Mattresses can also be made with synthetic latex, which tends to be more affordable. : Responsive Contouring. Latex provides pressure relief without conforming as closely to the body. Its resilient surface helps distribute body weight to provide support while enabling sleepers to switch positions easily. : Airbeds have a support core made with air chambers that can be inflated or deflated. By adjusting the amount of air within the air chamber, users can control the firmness level of the bed. Most airbeds have a separate air chamber for each sleeper, and may feature an additional comfort layer system made with foam, latex, or other materials. : Ongoing Firmness Control. Airbeds allow users to adjust the firmness in real time, which means the mattress can adapt almost instantaneously to the needs of someone with scoliosis as they switch positions or experience pain in different areas. : Foam mattresses eschew coils in favor of a high-density polyfoam base layer. The comfort layers may be made of memory foam, polyfoam, latex, or occasionally materials that add padding such as cotton or wool. : Unbeatable Conforming. Of all mattress types, foam mattresses tend to perform the best on contouring. This is particularly true of memory foam mattresses, which conform closely to the sleeper’s body to alleviate pressure points and encourage natural spinal alignment. Scoliosis happens when the spine curves unnaturally to one side by a factor of at least 10 degrees. Looking at the spine from the back, this causes a C-shaped or S-shaped curve. In most cases, the cause of scoliosis is unknown, although some cases have been linked to cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, or problems with bone formation before the baby is born. Scoliosis appears to be genetic and is usually more severe in females. While signs of scoliosis usually appear just before puberty, it occasionally presents in babies. Some adults may develop scoliosis later in life as a result of wear-and-tear on the spine. Scoliosis can manifest differently depending on the type of scoliosis and its degree of severity. Common signs of scoliosis include uneven shoulders or hips, an off-kilter gait, poor posture, ill-hanging clothes, or protruding ribs or shoulder blades on one side. Some children may exhibit a visible curve in the spine. Wearing a back brace during adolescence can help slow the curve of the spine until the person is finished growing. More rarely, some people may also resort to surgery to correct the curve. Around 40 percent of adolescents with scoliosis experience that can lead to . Even when scoliosis doesn’t cause pain, it may lead to unnatural curves in the body that affect the way you interact with your mattress, making it hard to fall asleep and stay asleep. Children or adolescents who wear a brace may have extra pressure points that make it difficult to find a comfortable position at night. There is evidence to suggest that sleeping on the convex side of a thoracic curve may cause that lead to frequent nighttime awakenings. Pain medication may also interfere with sleep, and studies have found that people can suffer from impaired sleep for up to after scoliosis surgery. People with scoliosis may have trouble getting back to sleep after nighttime awakenings. Like many , this cycle may be exacerbated by the anxiety and depression caused by the scoliosis itself. Practising and using a mattress that’s quiet and isolates motion transfer may help minimize added disruptions. Scoliosis causes important structural changes to your body, so it’s crucial to pick a mattress that delivers strong support for your spine and minimizes pressure points in the , , or other parts of the body that are affected by the curve of the spine. Many sleepers with scoliosis find that a medium firm surface provides the best balance of support and pressure relief. Still others swear by a zoned mattress that provides targeted support and pressure relief. How Does Sleep Position Affect Scoliosis Sufferers? When selecting mattress firmness, keep in mind that different sleeping positions put stress on different parts of the body. This can have a heightened impact in people with scoliosis, especially those with asymmetrical hips, shoulders, or ribcages. Typically, doctors recommend that people with scoliosis sleep on their back or side. These positions put less strain on the spine and are less likely to lead to back pain and pressure points. Back sleeping is considered the healthiest position because it encourages natural spinal alignment. It also helps distribute body weight, avoiding the pressure points that can occur in heavier body parts such as the hips and shoulders. Back sleepers with scoliosis should sleep on a mattress that’s firm enough to keep the spine on an even plane, yet soft enough to prevent pressure build-up. For most sleepers, this translates to a medium firm mattress, although this will depend on your body type as well. You may find that tucking a pillow beneath the lumbar area or the shoulders can help take pressure off sensitive areas. Depending on the type of scoliosis, sleeping on your side may or may not be recommended. People with misaligned hips and shoulders may find it uncomfortable to sleep on their side. A mattress that’s too soft may allow the hips to sink in too far, which can interfere with spinal alignment. On the other hand, a mattress that doesn’t allow the hips and shoulders to sink in far enough can cause pressure points in these areas and contribute to lower back pain where the hips meet the spine. The best solution is to find a mattress that contours just enough to allow the hips and shoulders to settle naturally. Side sleepers can place a pillow between the knees to keep the hips in line. Many people with scoliosis also insert a pillow under the ribcage to coax the spine towards a healthier position. Most doctors recommend against sleeping on your stomach if you have scoliosis. This position allows the hips to sink in and forces the neck to bend at unnatural angles, which can put stress on the spine. Stomach sleepers will do best with a firm mattress and a flat pillow, which will keep the hips in line with the rest of the body and won’t force the neck to contort as much. Sleepers who frequently switch sleeping positions benefit from a mattress that is more responsive, such as a latex or hybrid mattress. This extra “bounce” makes it easier to move around and may be doubly beneficial from those who suffer from pressure build-up when they stay in the same position for too long. When choosing a new mattress, it’s important to consider not only your usual sleeping position but also your body type. People who weigh more than 230 pounds put extra pressure on a mattress. These sleepers need a mattress that’s firmer and more supportive to keep heavier body areas from sinking in too far and throwing off spinal alignment. In contrast, those who weigh less than 130 pounds benefit from a plusher and closer-conforming mattress. This reduces pressure points while allowing the hips and shoulders to sink in just enough for proper spinal alignment. Last Things to Consider with a Mattress for Scoliosis Additional things to consider when shopping for a mattress include budget, pillow, and sleep trial and warranty policies. The good news for people with scoliosis is that memory foam mattresses tend to be among the most affordable models, and this is usually the type that’s recommended for scoliosis patients. But if the price of a new mattress is too prohibitive, you may also consider buying a mattress topper. This won’t be able to fix a sagging mattress, but it can add contouring to relieve pressure points. The average price of a good mattress starts at around $800 and can be as much as $2,000 or more depending on the type and the features it offers. All-foam mattresses usually cost between $900 and $1,300, hybrid mattresses run between $1,300 and $2,000, and latex mattresses will set you back around $1,600 to $2,000. You may be able to find exceptions or seasonal discounts that lower the price. Along with your mattress, your can also affect your spinal alignment. A pillow that’s too low or too high will fail to keep your head, neck, and spine aligned. Side sleepers should opt for a pillow that’s as high as the space between the ears and the tip of the shoulders, and back sleepers will need a slightly thinner pillow that supports the neck without curving it too far upwards. Stomach sleepers usually need a flatter pillow, or sometimes none at all. Some people with scoliosis relieve pressure on the spine by tucking an extra pillow between the knees when lying on the side, under the lumbar area or shoulder blades when lying on the back, or under the hips when lying on the stomach. Mattress companies typically offer a sleep trial of at least a few months. This allows time for your body to adjust to the feel of the mattress, and gives you leeway to return it if you discover it’s not right for you. Mattresses should also be backed by a warranty against workmanship and manufacturing defects. Among other things, this usually covers permanent indentations in the foam that limit the mattress’s ability to deliver pressure relief and support. Mattresses that sag prematurely can exacerbate pain caused by scoliosis, so you may want to look for a warranty of at least 10 years. How Does Sleep Position Affect Scoliosis Sufferers?

Try a Different Pillow Note: This post contains affiliate links and I may be compensated if you click on them. Insomnia can have a multitude of causes. Thus insomnia treatments vary greatly. In this article we will examine the inability to fall asleep stemming from discomfort caused by bad sleeping positions. Poor resting posture can lead to aches and pains as well as restlessness. Often times, unexplained back pain, aches and sore muscles are caused by sleeping awkwardly. So for some people falling asleep and resting throughout the night is just a matter of finding a better way to get comfortable. While this is not guaranteed to work for everyone, here is one of many insomnia treatments that a large number of people say has worked wonders for them. What is this amazing solution? It is memory foam. This “amazing” sleep aid is comprised of several components, the most notable one being polyurethane. It is dense yet flexible, and was designed to help astronauts combat the G-force experienced during takeoff. While this cushioning device never made it in the capacity for which it was created, it has found a second and more productive role. After performing favorably in a series of test studies, the memory foam was used to bring relief to patients suffering for bed sores and other aches associated with long stints in bed. Remember that this implement was devised by NASA. Thus you can guess that it had a high price tag. The cost made it impractical for wide spread use. However, the development of similar foam products at much more affordable prices have brought about the use of memory foam by the general public. Not only is this foam used in pillows, but also in and devices designed to support the back. This brings us back to our original purpose. Memory foam pillows and mattresses have proven effective as a posture related insomnia treatment. There’s no guarantee, but these items might work for you. With a 3 Inch Thick, 4 Pound Density Visco Elastic Memory Foam Mattress Pad Bed Topper, you can instantly make any mattress more restful, comfortable and supportive in sagging areas of mattress. The memory foam conforms to your body perfectly and reduces pressure points that cause you to toss and turn, so you sleep better. The Shredded Memory Foam Pillow By Coop Home Goods Down Pillows lack the support needed for many sleepers which often leads to neck pain. Memory Foam can suffer from heat buildup from the lack of airflow. Also, you’re not able to adjust the pillow from how it comes molded. If the pillow is too thick or too thin, you’re out of luck.

A cooling pillow draws heat away from the body, and certain materials do this better than others. That being said, each person is different and what works for one may not work for another. In addition to regulating temperature and providing a comfortable sleep environment, a cooling pillow may also relieve pressure and provide ample support for the head, neck, and shoulders. While the focus of this guide is a pillow’s cooling properties, there are additional factors that determine if a pillow is a good purchase or not. Shoppers should consider what type of pillow they want, and what is most important to them in addition to cooling properties. The cooling properties of a pillow determine how well it regulates temperature, dissipates heat, and keeps you cool throughout the night. Most cooling pillows have passive cooling properties, meaning they are constructed with materials that either encourage airflow or draw heat away from the body. Gel, copper, phase-change materials, and graphite are all conductive materials that pull heat away and dissipate it. Moisture-wicking materials like wool, cotton, and bamboo are helpful for hot sleepers prone to sweating throughout the night. These breathable materials also circulate air and prevent heat retention. For shoppers, it is important to focus on the materials and construction of the pillow over any marketing buzz. What position you sleep in each night determines the firmness and loft you should look for in a pillow. Side sleepers need a pillow with a higher loft that fills the space between the neck and shoulders. This helps keep the spine aligned and reduces pressure. maintain a neutral posture, but need a pillow that keeps their head level and not tilted too far forward or back. Stomach sleepers prefer thinner pillows that keep their head and neck at a comfortable angle. Pillows are available at a wide range of price points, so setting a budget before shopping can be helpful. Keep in mind that some materials are more expensive than others. A high-quality cooling pillow can range between $75 to $150 or more, which is more expensive than the average pillow. : A pillow provides additional support and relieves pressure and tension in the neck and shoulders. Pillows that conform to the shape of the head and neck help keep the spine aligned. Memory foam is well-known for its conforming nature, while latex also offers pressure relief. The quality of materials used in a cooling pillow determines its lifespan. Many cooling pillows are made with high-quality materials that are especially durable. This includes natural latex and foams that offer shape retention and support. As a result, cooling pillows often last longer than other pillows. For cooling pillows, a medium soft to medium firm feel is common.  Materials like wool, down, and shredded memory foam are often soft. Solid foam and latex pillows are more likely to be medium to medium firm. Buckwheat pillows and some foam options can be firm. When shopping for a pillow, personal preferences and sleeping position often determine which firmness level is the right fit. : Loft refers to the height of the pillow. Cooling pillows often have a medium to high loft. Some materials like shredded foam, down, and wool have a high loft but compress easily. Certain cooling pillows have an adjustable loft, meaning you can remove or add filling to change the height of the pillow. A higher loft is better for side sleepers, while back sleepers tend to prefer a medium loft. Stomach sleepers benefit from a low loft. A cooling pillow uses materials in its fill and cover to regulate temperature and dissipate heat. We’ll break down common fill and cover materials here. It should be noted that certain materials are highly conductive and draw heat away from the body. Others allow air to flow through them to dissipate heat. There are multiple options available, and certain pillow types will work better for some than others. Latex is made from rubber tree sap, which is harvested and processed using the Dunlop or Talalay method. Dunlop latex is heavier, with a dense bottom and resilient feel. Talalay latex requires more processing, with a homogenous and breathable result. Latex offers ample pressure relief and is more breathable than synthetic foam. Some heat retention is possible, but many cooling pillows use aerated latex to dissipate heat and encourage airflow. Memory foam is a viscoelastic polyfoam that responds to heat and pressure to conform closely. This results in a customized feel for sleepers and pressure relief for the head, neck, and shoulders. Memory foam pillows may retain heat and restrict airflow, so look for a cooling pillow that offsets this. Open-cell memory foam has better airflow. Memory foam can also be shredded to let air circulate, or infused with gel or copper to draw heat away from the body. Gel and copper are highly conductive materials that pull heat away from the body. These can be added to other fill materials, most often foam. Gel has a cool to the touch feel. Copper is antimicrobial. These materials prevent heat from building up in the pillow, but they often result in a higher price point. Buckwheat hulls are the shells of the buckwheat grain. The hulls have an open shape and create air pockets in the pillow. This prevents heat retention. The hulls are malleable and supportive. Buckwheat pillows may take some getting used to, as the hulls have a natural odor and are prone to making a rustling noise when moved. Wool is harvested from lambs and sheep. The natural fiber has a crimped shape that adds ample loft and airflow to a pillow. Wool acts as natural insulation, so it pulls heat and moisture away in warmer climates and retains heat in colder areas. A wool pillow is best for those who want year-round temperature regulation. Down alternative is often made with polyester or synthetic fibers that imitate the feel of down. This offers a vegan alternative to down, which is made with the down feathers of geese or ducks. Down alternative fill is less likely to retain heat than down. It is also more affordable. Natural cotton fibers are soft and breathable. There are several varieties of cotton, and the fibers can vary from short-staple to extra-long staple. Pima cotton and Egyptian cotton are types of extra-long staple cotton that are soft and breathable. Cotton naturally wicks away moisture for a cooling feel. This material is often used in covers as it increases airflow and is easy to clean. Phase-change materials control temperature by absorbing body heat and releasing it. These materials change from a liquid to solid state to regulate temperature. Textiles that incorporate phase-change materials are often used in cooling pillows to draw heat away from the body. Bamboo is a natural fiber that is moisture-wicking and lightweight. It is more absorbent than cotton, making it an ideal choice for hot sleepers who sweat throughout the night. Bamboo is breathable and increases airflow throughout the pillow. Many shoppers are drawn to cooling pillows for their temperature-regulating properties. These pillows reduce heat retention and are an important part of creating a comfortable sleep environment. However, due to the cooling properties and materials used, cooling pillows are more expensive. There are a few pros and cons shoppers should consider before purchasing a cooling pillow. Cooling pillows draw heat away from the body and prevent sleeping hot. Cooling pillows are made with durable materials that result in a longer lifespan. Tension in the neck and shoulders is relieved by cooling pillows that have a latex or form construction. Shredded foam, buckwheat, or wool fill can be removed or added to an adjustable pillow for a customized feel. Materials like latex, foam, and wool are often used in cooling pillows and resist common allergens. Cooling pillows have a higher than average price point due to the quality of materials used. Many cooling pillows are difficult to clean, especially if they have a solid foam or latex core that cannot be washed. Those who do not sleep hot may find a cooling pillow is unnecessary. : Materials used in cooling pillows may off-gas or have a natural odor. Hot sleepers especially benefit from cooling pillows, but there are also benefits for side and back sleepers. It is important to consider sleeping position and personal preferences when shopping for a pillow. A cooling pillow might not be right for everyone and there are special considerations that should be kept in mind. Hot sleepers need cooling bedding to prevent overheating. This allows them to sleep comfortably, as temperature and sleep quality are . A cooling pillow can help draw heat away from the body and provide a cooling surface for hot sleepers. A cooling pillow will also wick away sweat. need a higher loft pillow to keep the head elevated and neck aligned. Many cooling pillows have a higher loft that is suitable for side sleepers. Adjustable cooling pillows allow for additional fill and a higher loft. Back sleepers need a medium loft pillow that supports the head without letting it tilt too far forward or back. Most cooling pillows have the ideal loft and firmness for back sleepers. Materials like memory foam and latex contour to the shape of the head for proper support and alignment. Stomach sleepers need a low loft pillow. This keeps the neck at a comfortable angle. Some cooling pillows are adjustable, but most have a medium to high loft that is less than ideal for . Stomach sleepers often prefer a soft pillow and most cooling pillows are considered medium soft to firm. Cooling pillows often use synthetic foams or natural materials that prevent heat retention. Synthetic foam tends to off-gas, which causes a chemical smell in the pillow. This usually dissipates within a few days, but those who are sensitive to odors may notice it for longer. Materials like wool and buckwheat also have a natural odor that may be off-putting to sleepers with odor sensitivities. A cooling pillow is an essential part of a comfortable sleep environment, but it is just one component. Hot sleepers can take additional measures to stay cool throughout the night. Using breathable, lightweight bedding prevents heat retention. Natural materials like cotton, bamboo, and eucalyptus are ideal. These fibers are commonly used in cooling bed sheets, comforters, and duvets. Pay attention to thread count and weave to ensure the bedding allows air to circulate. A percale weave offers a crisp and cool feel for hot sleepers. Avoid heavy fabrics and synthetic materials that are not breathable. A cool room improves sleep quality. The is around 65 degrees Fahrenheit. Set the thermostat in this range, and use a fan to keep air circulating. Window shades can act as insulation, preventing hot air from coming in and cool air from escaping. There are plenty of mattress options that regulate temperature and prevent sleeping hot. The are often made with latex or gel-infused memory foam. A hybrid construction with coil support increases airflow throughout the mattress and can make a significant difference for hot sleepers. What you wear to bed plays a role in how well your body regulates temperature. Opt for natural, breathable fabrics like cotton and bamboo. Avoid heavier fabrics, thermal pajamas, or flannel pieces. If buying a new mattress is not in the cards, a mattress topper can be an affordable way to make your current mattress more comfortable. Toppers act as an additional comfort layer and can improve the temperature regulation of the mattress. Aerated or gel-infused foam, latex, and wool are all breathable mattress topper options.

With 14 pillow options to select from, choosing the best Tempur-Pedic for you could be challenging. Assessing the traits that make each model unique can help you find the pillow that will be most comfortable for your sleep position, comfort preferences, and support needs. What to Consider When Purchasing a Tempur-Pedic Pillow As many factors influence what makes a pillow ideal and comfort is subjective, one pillow is unlikely to feel ideal to all sleepers. The best way to determine what will feel most comfortable to you is usually focusing on specific factors that may affect your sleep experience. The following criteria frequently influence shoppers’ pillow purchasing. These same traits may also play a role in which Tempur-Pedic pillow you might like best. Tempur-Pedic pillows range in size from small, travel options to king size bed pillows. The size of the pillow influences how much room you have to move around and how well the pillow fits into your space. Most often, shoppers will want to select bed pillows that correspond to the size of their mattresses for the best fit. A pillow’s incline affects how much it elevates your upper body. More elevation may be beneficial for certain conditions, such as snoring and acid reflux. Customers shopping for a pillow with a notable incline usually purchase wedge pillows. Tempur-Pedic does not currently produce wedge pillows, and most of its models have a fairly consistent thickness throughout. Because of this, Tempur-Pedic’s options may not be ideal for sleepers looking for more elevation. A pillow’s shape affects how it supports your head and neck. Most of the pillows in the Tempur-Pedic line have a conventional rectangular shape, while others have a contoured design for ergonomic support. The company also produces some smaller travel pillows, including a u-shaped option. Heavier pillows typically have a firmer feel, while lightweight options are often plusher. Tempur-Pedic does not publicly list the weight of its pillows, however, so shoppers may not be able to assess this trait. Perhaps more importantly, the sleeper’s weight can also influence how they experience their pillow. Heavier individuals typically prefer firmer pillows for added support, while lighter people often favor a softer option for more cushioning. The right firmness level is critical to support. A pillow that is too firm could feel hard and/or lift the head and neck too far upward, while a pillow that’s too soft may not provide enough support. The ideal firmness varies based on the sleeper’s weight and preferred sleep position. On average, most sleepers are likely to favor an option with a medium feel. However, stomach sleepers and lightweight individuals may find a softer pillow comfortable, while heavier individuals often prefer a firmer feel. Tempur-Pedic produces pillows ranging from extra soft to extra firm, so there should be a suitable option available for virtually any kind of sleeper. Tempur-Pedic’s proprietary TEMPUR foam shapes to the sleeper to evenly distribute the force of their weight. Since all of its pillows contain this material, sleepers can expect notable pressure relief when they select the right size and firmness for their body type and sleep position. This may make it easier to maintain proper spinal alignment and . Pillow prices typically vary a great deal, with some starting at under $10 and others topping $1,000. Tempur-Pedic’s range from under $100 to around $200. Selecting a pillow that fits in your budget is important, but you may also want to consider the pillow’s longevity when making your purchase. A long-lasting pillow with a higher initial price tag may ultimately be more budget-friendly than a lower-priced option that you need to replace sooner. Quality materials often make the difference between a comfortable pillow you can use for years to come and a lumpy or unsupportive pillow you replace after a few months. A wide range of materials are used to craft pillows, and any of these options can be high-quality. Tempur-Pedic’s pillows are especially prized for their quality since they use the company’s popular proprietary memory foam, which tends to perform well and outlast many materials. Sleepers who are prone to overheating during the night often prefer a pillow that stays cool. Tempur-Pedic pillows typically have breathable covers that allow air to circulate. Several pillows in the line also use special cooling gel to reduce heat retention.

However, there are some subtle differences between designs that may be important to consider. About half of Tempur-Pedic’s pillow line is composed of standard, rectangular pillows commonly used for sleeping in bed. : Tempur-Pedic produces several contoured pillows engineered to ergonomically support the head, neck, and shoulders.

This material is responsible for the pillow’s cushioning, pressure relief, and support. A few Tempur-Pedic pillows include TEMPUR material along with additional components to adjust the feel, such as cooling gel, micro-cushions, or . Frequently Asked Questions About Tempur-Pedic Pillows Pillows that contain proprietary materials are typically more expensive due to the cost of their development and production. Tempur-Pedic pillows contain the brand’s proprietary memory foam. When coupled with the fact that Tempur-Pedic’s products are known for their quality, this explains the higher price point.

Learn more about our process You spend a lot of time in close contact with your pillow, so it’s important to choose a pillow made from safe and healthy materials. Organic pillows are one way to ensure this. In addition to their environmental and health benefits, organic pillows are often highly breathable and extremely durable. Many companies who produce organic products have a close relationship with their sources, giving back to the local communities or participating in other green initiatives. Organic wool and down are produced with improved animal welfare compared to traditional means. Whether they’re made of buckwheat, latex, wool, cotton, or other organic materials, organic pillows represent a choice that’s better for you and the planet. There’s a wide range of organic choices on the market. We’ll describe the differences between different types of organic pillows and discuss how to know if a pillow is really organic. We’ll also share our top picks for the best organic pillows available. Best Value – Best for Side Sleepers – Shredded Talalay latex and wool fill feel plush while limiting heat accumulation Use this SleepFoundation.org link for the most current discount on the Birch pillows Handmade in the U.S., the Birch Organic pillow combines the advantages of organic cotton, natural latex, and cruelty-free New Zealand wool certified by Wool Integrity NZ and the PGC Wrightson Wool Integrity Program. The Birch Organic Pillow is Greenguard Gold certified for being free of harsh chemicals, and the cotton is certified organic by the Global Organic Textiles Standard (GOTS). The pillow has a 2-inch gusset that helps it to keep its shape and maintain enough loft for side sleepers. The tufted organic cotton cover is very breathable and helps keep a dry, cool surface. Inside the pillow is a combination of shredded wool and Rainforest Alliance-certified Talalay latex. Both materials are naturally springy, durable, and breathable. Wool also serves as a natural fire barrier, and it helps regulate temperature thanks to its moisture-wicking abilities. The Birch Organic Pillow is made with natural materials that resist dust mites and mildew. The Birch Organic Pillow ships for free in the contiguous U.S. and is sold in queen and king sizes.

The pillow contains shredded latex that has earned certification from the Global Organic Latex Standard (GOLS), the same organization behind the GOTS. The fill feels plush and supportive, so you’ll receive ample cushioning for your head but shouldn’t sink too deeply into the pillow.

Organic pillows are any pillows made from organic materials such as latex, cotton, wool, kapok fibers, or buckwheat. Organic crops are grown without chemical pesticides, with farmers attempting to use less irrigation and produce less waste. Environmentally friendly and biodegradable, organic materials are increasingly gaining in popularity as consumers realize the impact their purchases have on the environment. What’s more, organic certification often goes hand-in-hand with improved quality of life in the places where the raw materials are sourced. As it’s virtually impossible for a customer to tell whether a finished product is organic or not, the USDA has established a set of regulations. In addition, there are several third-party organizations you can look to for assurance. The most commonly used are the Global Organic Latex Standard (GOLS) and the Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS), which we’ll discuss more in detail below. Shoppers should be wary of a product that claims to be organic but doesn’t hold any certification. Many companies advertise their products as “natural,” meaning the materials are not man-made. They are often biodegradable and less harmful to the environment than synthetic materials.  However, farmers may use pesticides and chemical fertilizers to grow their crops, and the end products may contain bleach, formaldehyde, chemical dyes, or chemical fire retardants. This is why organic materials are generally considered safer for your skin and less likely to provoke allergies. Within the world of organic pillows, you’ll see a wide variety of materials used. In general, you can count on organic materials to be more breathable and durable than synthetic pillows. That said, each material has its own specific benefits. In the following sections we’ll delve into the properties of different organic materials and how to choose the right organic pillow for you. What to Consider When Purchasing an Organic Pillow Your pillow is an important part of your sleep setup, supporting your head and providing a comfortable surface to lie on. In order to succeed at this, a pillow must have certain characteristics. Despite what pillow manufacturers may claim, there’s no one-size-fits-all formula for pillows. The ideal characteristics change from person to person depending on body type and preferred sleeping position. Organic products are particularly susceptible to greenwashing, with many companies making claims they can’t back up. Only by carefully analyzing the specs of an organic pillow can you be sure that it will deliver the benefits it promises. To provide full support, a pillow should fill the space between the head and neck and the mattress. Side sleepers tend to need a higher pillow to compensate for the breadth of the shoulders, while stomach sleepers need a flatter pillow to minimize twisting of the neck. If you’re unsure what loft is best for you, you may want to consider a pillow with adjustable fill. The organic industry has taken off in recent years, leading many companies to exaggerate their claims as an excuse to raise their prices. Certification from a trusted third-party organization can provide assurance that a product truly is organic. The most important job of a pillow is to support the head and neck, keeping them in line with the spine. A pillow that’s too soft, too thin, or too thick won’t provide adequate support and may lead to discomfort. Firmness level is not only a matter of comfort. A pillow that’s too firm may cause pressure points, but a pillow that’s too soft may fail to provide enough support. When considering pillow firmness, don’t forget to take the loft into account. A high but plush pillow will allow the head to sink in further, which ultimately reduces the loft. Pillows provide pressure relief in two ways: by minimizing pressure at contact points, and by reducing pressure build-up in unsupported areas. Materials such as plush latex, kapok fibers, and cotton contour more closely and tend to provide better pressure relief. The vast majority of pillows are made in the traditional rectangular shape, with some including a gusset around the sides to help maintain a higher loft. However, sleepers with neck pain or other problems may benefit from a cervical pillow designed to provide extra support by following the curves of the head and neck. Organic latex pillows are best for this, as the material can be formed into any shape. Organic materials tend to command a higher price, but it is possible to get an organic pillow without breaking the bank. If latex pillows and buckwheat pillows are out of your budget, you can also consider alternatives such as cotton or kapok fibers. Higher-priced options are often more durable, but most organic pillows will outlive those made with synthetic materials. For any people, “organic” is synonymous with “quality.” However, as always, it’s a good idea to check what exactly the pillow is made of, and whether it’s 100 percent organic or blended with other materials. Understanding the properties of different organic materials can also help point you to the right pillow for your sleeping style. One quality that many sleepers look for in a pillow is the ability to hug it or scrunch it into shape. Pillows made with fluffier fibers such as cotton or kapok lend themselves well to this, as opposed to solid latex pillows which are less moldable. Materials that allow room for airflow can help prevent heat build-up and keep a cooler sleep surface overnight. By nature, many organic materials fall into this category. Latex, buckwheat, kapok, cotton, and wool are all known for their temperature neutrality. Organic pillows can be made from a number of different materials, but most organic pillows share some common benefits and drawbacks. Organic production eschews the use of harmful pesticides and aims to minimize the use of water and other resources. Plus, organic products tend to be biodegradable. By eliminating the use of harsh chemicals, organic production is safer for the farmers and other workers involved in the production process. You can feel good about buying organic products for your loved ones, knowing that they don’t contain cancerous chemicals. Those who are sensitive to off-gassing smells usually prefer organic products as well. Most organic materials keep dust mites and mildew at bay. Organic materials tend to naturally do a much better job of regulating temperature, making them a good choice for . Many organic materials stand up better to repeated use, which helps to offset the high initial price. Strict regulations and certification costs mean that organic materials are more expensive to produce, and these costs are reflected in a higher price-tag for the consumer. Unlike synthetic foams that can be engineered to take on different properties, organic pillows are dependent on the natural properties of the materials used to make them. The organic market is a growing market, but some shoppers may still have trouble finding organic pillows in local brick-and-mortar stores. Common materials used in organic pillows include cotton, latex, wool, buckwheat, silk, down, and kapok. Both the cover and the fill should be organic in order for the pillow be considered 100 percent organic. Any materials that use chemicals in their manufacturing process, such as memory foam, are not considered organic. Cotton can be woven into fabric and used to make a breathable cover, or used in its fiber form for a soft and fluffy pillow filling. While regular cotton production is problematic due to its use of water and pesticides, organic cotton uses less resources and avoids harsh dyes and bleach. Looks for the GOTS certification in both the pillow cover and filling, which indicates at least 70 percent organic materials. is a springy, buoyant material favored by sleepers who like a breathable, extra-supportive pillow with moderate contouring. Natural latex is made from the milky white liquid of the rubber tree and can be processed in two ways, Talalay or Dunlop. Dunlop latex is usually the more sustainable choice, as Talalay uses more chemicals. Organic latex is regulated by the GOLS certification, which requires that the latex be at least 95 percent natural. You may also see “natural latex,” made with a portion of synthetic materials, or fully synthetic latex, which is made of petrochemicals. Used in both the cover and the fill of pillows, wool from sheep, lambs, and goats is one of nature’s most impressive materials. Its crimped fibers provide a springy, supportive feel that’s perfect for pillows, and the material does an excellent job of wicking moisture to keep you warm in the winter and cool in the summer. Although wool can pose ethical problems, there are organizations that seek to highlight proper animal welfare and establish a humane shearing process. Dried hulls naturally interlock to provide a firm and solid sleep surface. They are extremely breathable and offer great support, but some sleepers find they are too firm and make too much noise. They also tend to be among the more expensive models, and they may be too heavy to manipulate easily during the night. Spun by silkworms, silk is a fine, smooth, and expensive fiber that is sometimes used as a filler for high-end pillows. The fine duck and goose plumage used to make are prized for their incredible softness, although due to their high expense they are often blended with regular feathers to lower the price. Down isn’t always a very ethical choice, as it’s often obtained from live-plucked birds. The aims to ensure humane treatment of these animals, including rules against live plucking, force feeding, and other brutal practices. However, shoppers who object to avoid animal by-products or those with allergies may want to steer clear of down altogether. Made from the fibers of the kapok tree, kapok has a lofty feel that’s somewhat similar to down. Kapok production is considered more sustainable than other crops as it requires minimal irrigation or pesticides. Various third-party organizations attempt to regulate the organic bedding industry so that consumers can rest assured they’re purchasing a safe and ethical product. The following certifications are some of the most common, indicating either that a product is organic or that it was produced with minimal environmental impact and low levels of harmful emissions. : The best organic latex pillows are certified by GOLS, a process that identifies latex sourced from organic plantations and processed into a finished product containing at least 95 percent organic material. It’s virtually impossible to make entirely organic latex, as it requires a small amount of chemicals in order to be processed. : The Global Organic Textile Standard certifies that a finished product contains at least 70 percent organic fiber. It also guarantees that the product does not contain toxic dyes, and regulates the treatment of wastewater from the production process. : Working together with the USDA, the (NOP) ensures uniformity in the production of organic-labelled materials. For a crop or livestock to be , it must be produced using approved methods, avoiding the use of genetic engineering, antibiotics, toxic fertilizers, and other prohibited substances. Among other requirements, animals must be raised under humane conditions, with access to the outdoors, and must be fed organic food starting from the last third of gestation. The USDA does not directly certify non-food organic products, instead encouraging companies to obtain the GOTS label for the finished product. : GreenGuard certification indicates that a product is low in volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions, otherwise known as off-gassing. Standard GreenGuard certification enforces safe VOC levels to minimize indoor air pollution. There is also a stricter category, GreenGuard Gold, which guarantees extremely low or zero VOC emissions. : OEKO-TEX is an association of multiple research and testing institutes in Europe and Japan. The OEKO-TEX Standard 100 is an internationally recognized label awarded to products whose chemical levels fall within limits that are deemed to be harmless to human health. OEKO-TEX also awards other labels, among them the Made in Green label that ensures sustainability and ethical labor conditions. : The eco-INSTITUT is an internationally recognized organization based in Germany that tests for pollutants and emissions in mattresses and bedding. The best way to check if a pillow is truly organic is by checking to see whether all the components, from cover to fill, carry third-party organic certifications. The most recognized certifications are GOLS and GOTS, which certify organic latex and organic textiles, respectively. Organic pillows can cost anywhere from $50 to well over $200 depending on the materials used to make them. They are one of the more expensive pillow types, although certain organic pillows such as cotton, feather, or kapok pillows may be more affordable than latex, down, or buckwheat. Care instructions for organic pillows differ depending on the material, although many pillows have removable covers that can be machine-washed. Spot-cleaning is recommended for wool pillows. Pillows made with organic fibers like cotton and kapok can sometimes be machine-washed and dried on low temperatures, but this should be done carefully to avoid the pillow shrinking or forming clumps. Likewise, one-piece latex pillows may be able to be gently hand-washed as long as they are thoroughly dried. Buckwheat hulls, on the other hand, should be dried in the sun and never soaked in water or they will lose their properties. When in doubt about how to clean your organic pillow, always check the manufacturer’s care instructions. Organic pillows are widely available online, either directly from the manufacturer or through third-party websites that specialize in sustainable products. They are also available to a lesser extent in brick-and-mortar stores. Certain types of organic pillows, such as buckwheat, wool, or cotton-stuffed pillows, may be harder to find. Organic pillows are made with superior-quality materials that give them a longer-than-average lifespan. If properly cared for, some organic pillows can last for more than 5 years. In many cases, users can also purchase extra fill to liven up an older pillow and increase its lifespan. While organic pillows don’t off-gas in the typical sense, many new organic pillows do present a mild odor. This is most common with latex, buckwheat, and down pillows. In contrast to synthetic pillows, the odors from these materials shouldn’t be bothersome. However, they may provoke allergic reactions in those who are sensitive to the materials inside.

Teach yourself to sleep on your back — it’s worth it. Is sleeping on your back really the sleeping position of all sleeping positions? Maybe. It really depends on your body. For example, if you’re pregnant, lying on your back might cause more pressure and discomfort on your belly. Or if you have sleep apnea and back pain, this position might be one you want to completely avoid — even if the internet says it’s life-changing. But before you quit trying entirely, consider everything, every little thing, that might be getting in the way of achieving face-up snoozing. After all, sleeping on your back has many benefits worth training for, since it: helps chronic conditions by reducing pressure and compression avoid creases, wrinkles, and irritated facial skin Plus, there are many elements that make sleeping on your back far more nuanced than being able to lie there. How do your mattress, pillow, and sleep environment play into your sleep game? If you spend moments passing out watching Netflix or cuddling your partner, you might be training against yourself without realizing it — and sabotaging your body’s efforts for normal sleep. So before you completely roll over to sleep on your side — which — check out these tips and tricks I’ve used to drill instructions for sleeping on your back into my muscle memory. I had the worst sleep of my life when visiting my brother over Thanksgiving. He gave me his soft bed, which you’d expect to be relaxing, marshmallow heaven, except my butt kept sinking like a rock in a pond. I woke up sore and tired every morning because my lower back and leg muscles kept tensing in effort to stay afloat. I ended up on my side in the middle of the night to save myself — but never again. To this day, — but ideally, I’d sleep on a compressed surface so my muscles aren’t doing all the work at night. A good pillow for back sleeping may make your efforts worse if it’s over-elevating your head. Instead of buying that one good thing, make sure your sleep environment works together. For example, if you don’t have the expenses to get a mattress topper or a firmer mattress, you might not need a fancy pillow. A towel might do the trick. In college, I couldn’t choose my mattresses — but I could still adjust my neck’s elevation and support without a pillow. For three years, I , which combated useless mattresses and kept my body aligned without overextension. This trick helped my morning headaches and left my cheeks crease-free in the mornings, all for the cost of $0. These days, there are still 2 a.m. headaches that have me grabbing a towel and rolling it up for better sleep. : hypoallergenic, cover not included, can also be used for leg elevation : lifts torso by 7 inches, hypoallergenic, washable, and safe for infants : adjustable pillow made from memory foam 3. Get a pillow for under your knees or lower back If these steps haven’t worked and your mattress options are still slim, try putting a pillow under your knees. This will further help relieve the pain on your spine and may prevent your body from rolling over in efforts to reduce pressure. Not sure what pillow to buy? Lie flat and have a friend check the distance between your knees and the floor and maybe even your lower back and the floor. The pillow you want is all about supporting your body’s natural curves, so you might not have to go all out. You could even stack two flat pillows, although I wouldn’t recommend this for the lower back. Special support pillows, if workarounds don’t cut it : washable, organic cotton cover that can also be used for side sleeping : soft memory foam that fits under your upper and lower back, as well as under the knees : foldable pillow that can fit under knees, between legs, or for your calves Sleeping on your back doesn’t mean you have to keeping your arms by your side forever and legs straight forever. In fact, keeping your muscles stiff all night is probably counterintuitive. By spreading your arms and legs out, you’re also distributing your weight so that the pressure doesn’t build up on your joints. 5. Last resort: Build a pillow fortress to remind your body of your boundaries I read a tip advising sewing a tennis ball into the side of your pajamas to “gently” remind your body to not roll over — please don’t do that. That advice was formerly meant for folks who shouldn’t sleep on their back — don’t sew a tennis ball into the back of your PJs either — and it’s a generous assumption that you won’t wake up after a fist-sized ball has dug into your side. Instead, try adding pillows to either side of you. If you share a bed, having a pillow fort is a nice reminder to cuddly partners that sleep time is me time. This change won’t happen overnight, and it’s OK to quit I don’t sleep on my back every night. For a long time, I was having digestion issues and shifted to sleeping on my left side. There are also nights when I have insomnia and what position I’m in when I sleep is the least of my concerns — except stomach sleeping. Stomach sleeping is almost unanimously bad due to the strain it can cause on your body and pressure on your digestive system. Unless there’s no other position that works for you, then definitely sleep on your stomach for the sake of getting rest, but make sure you use the right pillows for your neck (a thin one) and pelvis (knee pillows will also work) to give your body support. As for those who really, really don’t want to lose out on back sleeping, you might also want to try a . Not only does this soothing smell help your brain switch gears to sleep mode, the knowledge that there’s something on your head is all your subconscious needs for you to stay still.

Learn more about our process Hotel bedding is synonymous with luxury. Since hotels need to accommodate a wide range of needs, preferences, and sleep positions, it should come as no surprise that most hotel pillows are as versatile as they are durable. The quintessential hotel pillow has mid-range firmness and loft, is allergy-friendly, and resists wear and tear. However, variations on this gold standard are also available to fit different sleep styles. One thing that remains consistent across virtually all hotel pillows is their luxurious feel, which balances plushness and support. Since hotel pillows are typically both comfortable and long-lasting, they can be an excellent choice for in-home use. Read on to learn more about how hotel pillows are constructed, where to buy them, and how to compare them.

The three firmness options are labeled as Plush, Mid-Plush, and Firm, which correspond to soft, medium, and firm respectively. Stomach sleepers can use the Plush option to add softness without a lot of loft. Side sleepers may prefer the extra support of the Firm pillow. Combination sleepers and those looking for a more versatile option might favor the Mid-Plush option. Each firmness also has a distinct build.

The Mid-Plush and the Firm use a dual-core design with supportive feathers in the center and soft down clusters in the outer layer.

Shipping and returns are free within the contiguous U.S. When buying a hotel pillow, there are certain criteria to take into account. Assessing your priorities and taking a close look at a pillow’s features can help you get the best hotel pillow for your needs and budget. “Universal comfort” or “for all sleep positions” are common buzzwords for hotel pillows. This typically means that the pillow has a mid-range firmness and loft, so it can accommodate most body types and position preferences. While these pillows may be comfortable for most individuals, that doesn’t necessarily mean they’ll feel ideal to you. Paying attention to specific criteria is the most effective way to judge whether a pillow will meet your unique needs and preferences. : Shoppers often select a pillow size that corresponds to their mattress size for a tidy look and convenient fit. However, some individuals may choose a smaller or larger option based on their personal preferences. Pillow loft affects how far the pillow lifts the head. For ideal spinal alignment, usually need a low-loft pillow or no pillow, typically require a medium-loft option, and generally need a medium- or high-loft pillow. However, these general guidelines can also be affected by firmness. For instance, a soft high-loft pillow may not support the head and neck any more than a firm low-loft option. Since hotel pillows are typically designed to accommodate as many sleepers as possible, they often have a medium loft. Pillows vary in shape based on their intended use. There are u-shaped pillows for travel, wedge-shaped pillows to elevate the head or legs, curved pillows for back support, and so many more options. Hotel pillows are designed for use in bed, so they tend to have the standard rectangular shape. The sleeper’s weight often affects how firm of a pillow they need. Heavier individuals often rely on a firmer pillow for support, while lighter people may prefer a softer pillow for more cushioning. Weight also affects how firm a pillow feels, so a firm pillow may feel soft or medium to someone who weighs more, and a soft pillow could feel medium or firm to someone who weighs less. A pillow’s firmness influences its supportiveness and plushness. Softer pillows may be ideal for stomach sleepers who don’t need much support, while firmer options are typically better for side sleepers who need to keep their necks aligned. Most standard hotel pillows have a medium to firm feel, but some manufacturers also produce soft hotel-style pillows.

A pregnancy pillow is a sleep accessory designed to support the changing bodies of expecting mothers, help them attain a comfortable resting position, and get more sleep. Pregnancy places a great deal of strain on the body, especially as the pregnancy progresses. Additional weight often stresses the back and joints, including the hips, knees, and ankles. This can cause aches and pains that make getting a full night’s rest difficult. Pregnancy pillows are specifically designed to accommodate the contours of the pregnant body and provide support where it’s needed most. These pillows can be found in many different shapes and sizes to accommodate each sleep position and help prevent aches and pains. The most common types include C- and U-shaped full body pillows that provide support to the entire body, and wedge pillows that can be used to strategically support a single area like the midsection or back. While a pregnancy pillow is not a necessity, it may be a suitable choice if you’re experiencing sleep disturbances as your pregnancy progresses. Sleep is important for your , especially when your body is hard at work supporting the . As your pregnancy progresses, good sleep can be harder to come by. Expecting mothers are often prone to symptoms such as back and joint pain, heartburn, and . These symptoms can worsen as you reach your . Getting comfortable at night is often key to being able to fall asleep and stay asleep. You can try to add extra cushioning with additional standard pillows, but a pregnancy pillow is specially designed to accommodate the shape of your pregnant body. If one or more of the many discomforts of pregnancy are keeping you from getting a full night of sleep, a pregnancy pillow is worth considering. But with so many choices, including different sizes, materials, and unusual shapes, it’s hard to know which is the right model for you. We’ll examine the most important factors to consider when choosing the best pregnancy pillow. What to Consider When Purchasing a Pregnancy Pillow Knowing exactly what to look for in a pregnancy pillow will largely depend on your own personal needs, including where you need support the most, but some properties are universal. Since bedding companies don’t alway use plain language to describe their products, it can be difficult to decipher the major differences between models. We’ll cover the most important factors to consider so that you can find a pregnancy pillow that works for you. Your preferred sleep position will come into play when choosing a pillow. While pregnant, sleeping on your left side is recommended by doctors. Stomach sleeping becomes nearly impossible as your stomach grows, and back sleeping can restrict circulation. Sleeping on your left side places the least amount of strain on your body. For this reason, the majority of pregnancy pillows are designed to make side sleeping more comfortable, including C-shaped and U-shaped pillows. The right pillow loft is critical to healthy spinal alignment, and it can also help with snoring. A model that is too thick might push the head up, while one that is too thin could allow the head to droop, either of which could contribute to airway constriction and increased snoring. The ideal loft depends primarily on body type and sleep position. Sleepers with broader shoulders and/or heavier heads usually need a thicker pillow to fill the space between their mattress and head and neck while providing adequate support, and those with narrower shoulders and/or smaller heads often need a thinner model for support without excessive lift. The amount of support a pregnancy pillow provides depends largely on its shape. Full body pillows can support multiple parts of your body and oversized models will essentially cradle you from head to toe. Smaller pillows like wedges may be firmer, but they only offer support to one area. Different pillow models will provide varying levels of firmness. Pillows made from polyester fiber fill tend to be softer and are a good option if you only need a bit of extra cushioning. Foam-based pillows are generally firmer and may provide additional support to the lower back and stomach. Pressure relief refers to how well a pillow molds to the shape of your body and alleviates pressure points. This is especially important for pregnant women dealing with chronic body aches. Pregnancy pillows generally fall into two main categories: body pillows and smaller support pillows. Body pillows, including C- and U-shaped pillows, are designed to offer support to the head, neck, abdomen, back, and knees. While body pillows can be quite bulky, they make side sleeping easier. In contrast, smaller support pillows, including wedge-shaped ones, are meant to provide concentrated support to a single area. Pregnancy pillows generally cost less than $100, but it’s important to remember that price isn’t the only factor that should be considered. While quality can sometimes correlate with price, many well-made pregnancy pillow options are available for under $50. If you’re on a limited budget, you may want to consider a smaller, less expensive support pillow, like a . Materials impact a pillow’s durability, breathability, level of support, and firmness. Polyester is the most common type of material used for both the cover and fill in pregnancy pillows. Polyester-based fabrics and fills are generally affordable, durable, and can come in many textures and levels of firmness. Foam is a good choice if you’re looking for a pillow that provides firmer support coupled with pressure relief. As your body changes during your pregnancy, it’s important to consider every level of comfort that your pillow can provide. Certain materials are more likely to help promote airflow to prevent you from overheating as you sleep. Polyester-based materials are often breathable, making them ideal for pregnancy body pillows. Memory foam is the most likely to trap heat, and tends to be more suitable for smaller pillows. You can find pregnancy pillows in all types of shapes. A pillow’s shape will determine the type of support it provides. Some shapes are designed to support your entire body from head to toe, while smaller models bolster specific areas such as the back or stomach. You’ll need to consider where you need support the most in order to choose the shape that’s best for you. We’ll take a closer look at the most common pregnancy pillow styles on the market. This style of pillow is long, thin, and curved. The C-shape is one of the most versatile styles of pregnancy pillows. It’s not very bulky and its shape allows you to arrange it in different ways depending on where you need support. You can lay it out lengthwise to create a full body pillow to cuddle while side sleeping, or fold it in half and use it to support your stomach, back, knees, or shoulders. Wedge pillows are the most compact style of pregnancy pillow. While they don’t offer full-body support, you can use these inexpensive pillows to strategically bolster various parts of your body. These are especially useful for providing support to your stomach and back. You can also couple one or more wedge pillows with a larger pregnancy pillow for additional support. U-shaped pillows are designed to cradle your entire body. With your head placed at the bottom of the U, this style of pillow provides secure support for your head and neck, as well as both sides of your body. Although rather bulky, the U-shape design still offers some level of versatility. In the early stages of pregnancy, you can sleep comfortably on your back and then transition to side sleeping with excellent support for your stomach, back, and knees. Inflatable pillows are typically the largest pregnancy pillows available and are designed to accommodate stomach sleepers. If you’re a lifelong stomach sleeper, having to suddenly change your sleep style on top of the other discomforts associated with pregnancy may be difficult. Inflatable pillows provide full-body cushioning with a hole in the center to fit your baby bump. Bedding companies can get creative when it comes to the shape of pregnancy pillows, so shoppers may come across unique shapes that don’t fit into any of the above categories. Other shapes include the teardrop, designed as a small, versatile support pillow, and the barbell shape, designed to promote side sleeping. Pregnancy pillows can differ significantly in their composition, including the materials used to make the cover and the interior filling. The type of material used will have an impact on the feel and performance of the pillow. Many snorers find relief with the right pillow since it can change their position. Lifting the head and neck often makes gravity work in the sleeper’s favor, allowing their throat muscles to relax without blocking the airway. We want you to get the best night’s sleep possible, which can be done under a medical professional’s guidance. Talk to your doctor for help determining the cause of your snoring and charting a course of action. Polyester fiberfill is a lofty material made from polyester. It is commonly used as a fill material in larger pregnancy pillows, as it provides soft, yet supportive comfort and ample airflow. Polyester fiberfill is also relatively inexpensive, hypoallergenic, and easy to clean. Memory foam is known for its excellent contouring properties. It molds to the curves of the body while providing support. However, some memory foam formulations can stifle airflow and retain heat. For this reason, memory foam is typically reserved for smaller pregnancy pillows like wedges. Polyfoam provides contouring and support but tends to be firmer and less conforming than memory foam. This can result in more robust support for the back or stomach. Smaller pregnancy pillows may be stuffed with microbeads. This material is made from small, round pieces of polystyrene and offers excellent contouring. Cotton is a breathable natural fiber that is easy to clean. It absorbs moisture and typically feels soft to the touch. Many higher-end pregnancy pillows feature organic cotton covers. Polyester is a synthetic fabric that’s highly versatile. Manufacturers can formulate polyester fabrics to have different textures as well as an elastic stretch, a good feature for larger pillow covers. Other Tips for Getting Better Sleep While Pregnant A pregnancy pillow may help you find a comfortable position and fall asleep more easily. However, many other factors impact your sleep quality, including your sleep position, sleep surface, overall sleep hygiene, and the temperature of your room. Many doctors recommend that expecting mothers sleep on their left sides, as they consider this sleep position to be the safest during pregnancy. Sleeping on your back can , while sleeping on your right side can place strain on your liver. Sleeping on your stomach becomes virtually impossible as the pregnancy progresses. There’s evidence that indicates that sleeping in a can help you fall asleep quickly. The body experiences a natural drop in core temperature in the evening as part of the circadian rhythm. Mimicking this effect by setting your thermostat to around 65 degrees may help you fall asleep faster. While a pillow will help improve your body positioning as you sleep, you’ll still want to ensure that you are sleeping on a supportive mattress. The tend to offer excellent pressure relief and a cool sleep surface that help prevent you from overheating during the night. Proper is one of the most significant ways you can improve your sleep. Establishing a nightly routine that helps you wind down and prepare for sleep may be beneficial for your sleep quality during pregnancy and postpartum. Frequently Asked Questions About Pregnancy Pillows Pregnancy pillows typically cost between $30 to $70. In comparison to , which often carry a price tag of $100 or more, pregnancy pillows are relatively inexpensive. This is beneficial, as you may only use this type of pillow for a short period of time during the later stages of your pregnancy. Smaller pregnancy pillow models tend to be less expensive, and you may be able to find wedge pillows for less than the average price. Larger models, such as full body pregnancy pillows, tend to be slightly higher in price. As price is not the only indicator of quality, keep in mind that you can still find excellent pregnancy pillows at affordable price-points. Some pregnancy pillows can be placed directly into the washing machine, but most come with a removable cover that you take off and wash. As with any type of bedding, it’s important to consider how easy a pregnancy pillow is to clean before you buy. Being able to place your entire pillow in the wash will ensure it’s cleaned thoroughly, but not all washing machines can accommodate the size of a pregnancy body pillow. Removable covers are ideal if you have a smaller washing machine, but they can be difficult to remove and put back on in the case of a larger or unusually shaped pillow. What kinds of pregnancy pillows are good for allergies? A pregnancy pillow that promotes airflow and is made from hypoallergenic materials such as down alternative, memory foam, or other synthetic fabrics will be the best for allergy sufferers. Allergies are typically caused by a such as dust mites, pet dander, pollen, or mold, and they can have a significant impact on how well you sleep. If you’re prone to allergies, make sure to find a pregnancy pillow that won’t aggravate the issue. Down and feathers tend to irritate existing allergies. Synthetic materials such as polyester and foam often work well for people with allergies. Some natural materials are also promoted as having hypoallergenic properties. A cover with a tight weave may help protect your pillow from absorbing allergens. Cleaning your pillow regularly can also help prevent the buildup of dust mites, pollen, pet dander, and mold.

This stretch targets the muscles in your upper back as well as any shoulder blade irritation or pain. Stand tall and open your arms out big and wide while taking a nice inhale. Exhale as you hug yourself (aw!), with right arm over left arm. Breathe deeply while gently pulling shoulders forward (don’t get tight and push your shoulders up).

This restorative is ideal for relieving back, neck, and shoulder tension. Get your Zen on and pretend you’re walking on the ceiling, because, you know, why not? Sit with your right side against a wall. Lie back on the floor while swinging legs up against the wall. It’s fine if your hips are against the wall or a few inches away — whatever distance is most comfortable. You can always toss a pillow under your hips if you want a boost or just some added comfort. Rest your arms however you’d like while you stay in this position for up to 5 minutes. This one is for those tight hips and inner thighs! Be gentle in this stretch and let your body lean into it (don’t force it). You’ll be going “ahhh” in no time. Sit up with spine and head aligned, bottoms of feet facing each other, and knees out to the sides. Grab the tops of feet, engage core, and gently lean forward at hips.

Press one hand into the floor and engage core as you reach your other arm over your head. Slowly bend torso to the side as you reach with the arm above your head.

Say goodbye to a tight booty, hips, and thighs. Lie faceup on the floor or your bed, keeping a nice flat back. Bend both legs and place right shin just above left knee (your legs will look like a 4). Grasp your left thigh with both hands, softly pulling knee toward chest. Hold for 20 seconds. You can do this 5 times on each side before coming back to the starting position. Keep it on the floor (or bed) for another easy lying-down stretch. This classic move targets your hips and lower back. Lie faceup with your legs extended.

This stretch gets your back muscles and shoulders loosey-goosey while also helping with pain and soreness. Kneel in front of a chair, a couch, or your bed. Make sure knees are placed right under hips. If you need to, you can grab a blanket or pillow for added support under your knees. Extend your spine as you bend at hips, folding forward.

You can repeat this up to 3 times. before a stretch is the difference between a good stretch and a great one — warm muscles get the best result.

Try to hold each stretch for at least 6–10 rhythmic, deep breaths. Intense nightly workouts can raise your body temp and keep you amped and stimulated — not exactly a bedtime goal.

Learn more about our process Mattresses are often promoted based on their plush, “cloud-like” feel, but for many people, the best sleep actually comes from a firm mattress. Even though it’s not usually thought of as luxurious, a well-built firm mattress can deliver a top-notch sleeping experience. People who sleep on their back and stomach are typically the biggest fans of firm beds. For these sleepers, a soft mattress can cause their lower back to sink out of alignment. In addition, sleepers over 230 pounds tend to prefer firmer mattresses that have more structural integrity and resist sagging. A firm mattress should offer enough support and comfort so you can wake up. Our top picks for the best firm mattress include various mattress types, but all of them deliver a firm feel high-end performance.  Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King Individuals who like the responsiveness of an innerspring People who like the feel of memory foam but worry about excess sink Pocketed coils move independently, providing targeted support Get $200 off + 2 Free Dream Pillows when you spend over $1,750 with code: SLEEPFOUND200 Helix fashions mattresses to fit the needs of specific sleepers, and the Plus is one of their key models for people who want a firm comfort feel. At the same time, it’s contouring top layers make it effective at relieving pressure for sleepers over 130 pounds. The comfort system of the Helix Plus is built with two separate foam layers. The topmost of those is Helix’s Memory Plus Foam, which provides the pressure relief that memory foam is known for but uses a firmer formulation by Helix that helps resist deep sink into the bed. The second part of the comfort system is a layer of latex-like polyfoam that adds responsiveness and supplements the firm feel. Under this is a transition layer of memory foam. The key component of the support core is a tall layer of pocketed innerspring coils. With their wider range of independent movement, these coils suppress the motion transfer that can be an issue on many spring mattresses. The coils are reinforced around the exterior to increase edge support. A thin layer of dense polyfoam sits at the bottom of the mattress to help absorb pressure and noise. Like many firm mattresses, the Plus is best for sleepers over 130 pounds, and is excellent for those over 230 pounds. Lighter side sleepers will probably want to avoid the Plus. Due to its breathable pocketed coil support core and firm foam layers, the mattress sleeps fairly cool, and it’s good motion isolation makes it a great choice for couples. The Plus comes with a 100-night sleep trial as well as the long-term protection of a 10-year limited warranty.  Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King All sleep positions (back, side, stomach, combination) Medium firm feel offers a versatile choice for many sleep preferences Quilted cover provides plushness, without excessive body sink Get $200 off a DreamCloud Mattress, no code necessary. The DreamCloud, a hybrid mattress with a quilted top and a thick profile, is a great medium firm (6) mattress that suits most sleepers. The quilted cover and memory foam comfort layer give this bed a somewhat-plush feel on top and provides some pressure relief, without compromising the bed’s firmness. The quilted top consists of a cashmere poly-blend cover and a foam filling. This gives the very top of the mattress a plush, breathable feel, while the lower layers are supportive and firm. Under this is a layer of gel-infused memory foam that provides extra pressure relief and traps less body heat than conventional memory foam. This is followed by a polyfoam transition layer and an individually-wrapped coil support core, which provides support and some ‘bounce’ to the bed, making it easier to move around on. With a medium firm feel and tons of supportive layers, the DreamCloud is capable of suiting just about any sleeper type, with the possible exception of side sleepers under 130 pounds. Since the biggest portion of the mattress is a breathable coil support core, the DreamCloud doesn’t trap too much body heat and sleepers cool throughout the night. It also performs well in categories such as pressure relief, edge support, and ease of movement, making it a versatile, all-around well-performing mattress. The DreamCloud comes at an average price-point for a hybrid mattress, which is impressive given it’s tall profile and quality materials. They offer an excellent guarantee, giving customers a 1-year sleep trial and a lifetime limited warranty.  Soft (4), Medium (6), Firm (7), Plus (8)  Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King People who tend to sleep or sit near the edge of the bed Customers who want the peace-of-mind of a lifetime warranty The WinkBed brings multiple assets to the table: standout edge support, a blend of bounce and cushioning, and a lifetime warranty. With a firm comfort level, it meets the needs of a wide range of people, especially back and stomach sleepers. The driving force behind the WinkBed’s performance is its coil-on-coil construction. The bottom coil layer is taller and is built with the springs arranged in zones for extra strength under the heavier areas of the body. Above this support core is a layer of micro-coils. Both sets of springs are individually-wrapped, meaning that they better respond to the body to reduce motion isolation. While the coils are a key design element of the WinkBed, the mattress also takes advantage of polyfoam sewn into a pillow top. The dense and firm foams give a modest degree of contouring that is just enough to help keep the spine aligned without making the bed too soft. Customers rave about the WinkBeds edge support as each of these interior components retain their structural integrity around the perimeter. The bounce from the coils makes it easy to move around on the WinkBed, including during intimate activities. The WinkBed comes with a 120-night sleep trial, so customers have the opportunity to try it out for an extended period in their own bedroom. The company shows their faith in the durability of their product by offering a lifetime warranty that covers defects in materials and manufacturing.  Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King, Split King Shoppers who are in the market for a customizable and flippable bed Side, back, and stomach sleepers who weigh at least 130 pounds Flippable design with customizable sleep surface on each side Responsive pocketed coils provide targeted support Save 30% on any Idle mattress with this code: NEWYEAR30 Many hybrids are relatively firm, but the Idle Hybrid’s customizable design sets it apart from other similarly constructed models. This flippable mattress is constructed with a sleep surface on each side. For either surface, you can choose between a medium firm (6) or firm (8) feel. Select the same firmness level for both sides and periodically rotate the mattress for added longevity, or choose a different feel for each side if you want more night-to-night versatility. The medium firm feel contours a bit more closely than the firm, but both offer great support. Regardless of which firmness levels you choose, both sides are constructed with three individual layers consisting of an adaptive polyfoam comfort layer and denser foam layers for added reinforcement. The support core, shared between both sides, is nestled between the foam layers. Thanks to steady airflow through the coil system and breathable foam layers, the Idle Hybrid sleeps quite cool. It is also easy to move across thanks to a firmer feel and should be responsive enough for sex. People who weigh between 130 and 230 pounds – side sleepers in particular – will probably prefer the medium firm feel, while those who weigh more than 230 pounds are more likely to find the firm feel more comfortable. Base your firmness configuration on how much conforming you prefer. Spanning 18 months in length, Idle Sleep’s trial period is one of the longest in the mattress industry and the Idle Hybrid comes with a lifetime warranty for extra peace of mind. Standard ground shipping is free for all customers in the contiguous U.S. These perks make the Idle Hybrid a cost-effective investment despite the mid-level sticker price.  20 Year - 1st 10 Year unlimited, 2nd 10 Year pro-rated  20 Year - 1st 10 Year unlimited, 2nd 10 Year pro-rated  Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King, Split King Sleepers who prefer the contouring feel of memory foam Open-cell memory foam and breathable cover help keep the mattress cool Amerisleep offers a wide selection of all-foam and hybrid mattresses, each one designed for a certain feel that makes it best suited to different body types and sleep positions. The AS1 is the company’s shortest and firmest mattress. Constructed with a comfort layer of dense memory foam over a thick polyfoam base layer, the mattress offers some light body-contouring and very strong support. These traits make the AS1 ideal for back and stomach sleepers, especially those weighing between 130 and 230 pounds. Many competing all-foam beds sink excessively for these individuals, but the AS1 delivers strong support to keep your body on an even plane. The mattress sleeps exceptionally cool, as well. The comfort layer is composed of open-cell memory foam that won’t trap too much body heat, while the bed’s firm (7-8) feel allows you to feel more airflow on the surface. Additionally, the mattress is encased in a breathable cotton-blend cover that helps the surface remain cool. We also recommend this mattress for couples and co-sleepers. The foam layers absorb movement and eliminate most motion transfer, which can reduce sleep disruptions, and the mattress is completely silent when bearing weight. Like other bed-in-a-box brands, Amerisleep provides free standard shipping for all customers in the contiguous U.S. The AS1 is backed by a 100-night sleep trial, as well as a 20-year warranty that covers defects in the mattress after the trial period ends.  Soft (2-3), Medium Firm (6), Firm (7-8)  Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, Split King, California King, Split Cal King People who like the feel of an innerspring mattress Get $200 off when you spend $1,000 or more at Saatva.com The Saatva mattress offers an appealing mix of firmness and pressure point relief, especially for stomach and back sleepers. Its hybrid, coil-on-coil construction promotes excellent performance and durability. The support core in the Saatva is a layer of 13 gauge Bonnell coils. In the 11.5-inch model, the coils are four inches tall; in the 14.5-inch model, they are seven inches tall. These thick coils offer a firm, stable foundation for the mattress, and the edges are buttressed with a high-density polyfoam encasement. Resting on top of these coils is a four-inch layer of pocketed micro-coils. These coils also enhance firmness and bounce, but their design allows them to provide more tailored compression to suit any individual person’s body. Above the two coil layers is a series of foams that are placed within a euro-style pillow top. One of these is a memory foam lumbar pad that can decrease pressure in the lower back, a common problem area for stomach and back sleepers. Firm layers of polyfoam round out the Saatva’s comfort system, creating more comfort without reducing the firm feel. After you’ve placed your order, Saatva works with you to coordinate free white-glove delivery that includes setup of the Saatva and removal of your existing mattress. You then have 180 nights to try it out with the option to return it for a refund minus $99 deducted for return pickup. The mattress comes with a 15-year warranty to cover potential defects.  Medium Soft (4), Medium Firm (6), Firm (7-8)  Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King, Custom Sizes Sleepers needing a combination of contouring and bounce People who weigh over 230 pounds in any sleeping position Sturdy innerspring core provides deep compression support Three foam layers offer a balance of mild contouring and above-average responsiveness Get 20% off a Brooklyn Bedding Mattress with code: sleepfoundation20 The Aurora Hybrid from Brooklyn Bedding is a mattress that reflects thoughtful design and execution with a diverse combination of materials that work together to provide a sleeping surface that is firm, supportive, and comfortable. The top layer of the Aurora’s comfort system is 1.5 inches of CopperFlex, a type of polyfoam that is infused with copper. The second layer is two inches of a latex-like polyfoam called TitanFlex. The final layer is one inch of gel-swirl memory foam. With this blend of foams, the Aurora offers mild contouring and motion isolation and above-average responsiveness. The support core has two components: an eight-inch layer of pocketed innerspring coils and one inch of high-density polyfoam. This support system fosters notable edge support and overall stability. Effective temperature regulation is a valuable feature of the Aurora. A phase change material (PCM) is used in the cover. This molecule is engineered to remain at a comfortable 88 degrees by either pulling in or dissipating heat as needed. The copper- and gel-infused foams and the coils also fight against heat retention. With its Firm model, the Aurora is a solid match for most stomach and back sleepers. It also has a thick comfort system that works well for side sleepers over 230 pounds, offering greater cushioning and reducing the risk of “bottoming out” through the foams and placing excess pressure on the coils. Brooklyn Bedding offers customers a sleep trial of 120 nights and includes a 10-year limited warranty for the Aurora that covers defects. Read our Full Brooklyn Bedding Aurora Review to learn more  Side 1: Firm (7) Side 2: Extra Firm (9)  Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King Those who put a premium on significant edge support One of the firmest feeling mattresses on the market Optional cooling top panel enhances temperature regulation Get 20% off a Brooklyn Bedding Mattress with code: sleepfoundation20 The Plank Mattress, designed and manufactured by the proven team at Brooklyn Bedding, is like a dream come true for people who want a firm mattress. The mattress is flippable, allowing customers to easily choose between a Firm and Extra Firm feel. The Plank is composed of four layers. When arranged for use on the Firm side, the top layer is .75 inches of fiber fill quilted into the cover. Next is two inches of a latex-like polyfoam known as TitanFlex that has light conforming and notable bounce. The next layer is the support core, which is 7 inches of high-density polyfoam. The final layer is 1.5 inches of fiber fill that is also quilted into the cover. These materials have limited heat retention, but the Plank is also available with an optional cooling top panel that has a phase change material (PCM) incorporated into it. The PCM holds a stable temperature by dissipating or retaining heat as needed over the course of the night. For people who know they want a firmer feel but want flexibility in terms of just how hard their mattress feels, the Plank’s reversible firmness design is a major selling point. It also provides well above-average edge support and is easy to move around on top of. Brooklyn Bedding backs the Plank with a 120-night sleep trial that lets you try out the mattress in your own home. The company also provides a 10-year limited warranty covering defects in materials and craftsmanship. Comfort is subjective, so there are no black-and-white rules about who should buy a firm mattress. Every sleeper should opt for the best fit for their needs and preferences. That said, there are general tendencies in terms of which people get the most benefit out of a firm bed. Two major factors that play into the optimal firmness level are body weight and primary sleeping position. People who weigh over 230 pounds often prefer a firmer mattress because it keeps them from sinking too deeply into the bed, which can harm spinal alignment and cause overheating. Back and stomach sleepers usually need a firmer feel to keep their abdomen and lumbar area from hyperextending, which can lead to lower back aches and pains. While there are exceptions, the table below provides an outline of the top mattress firmness level based on a person’s weight and main sleeping position. A person’s preferred sleeping position is closely tied to their ideal mattress firmness. can struggle with a mattress that is too firm because it can generate an uncomfortable impact at their main pressure points like the hips and shoulders. This is especially true for people under 130 pounds. generally benefit from a firmer mattress that keeps their midsection from sagging into a U-shape that can strain the lower back. have similar support needs as back sleepers but often prefer an even firmer bed so that it doesn’t feel as though they are being suffocated or swallowed by their mattress. , who move between positions during the night, can appreciate a firm mattress if they spend more time on their back or stomach. A firmer bed can also prevent feeling stuck in the mattress, making it easier to adjust positions during the night. Body type and body weight affect how a person experiences the feel of a mattress and should be taken into account when purchasing a firm mattress. The more that a person weighs, the more pressure they put on a mattress, so heavier people will sink more into any given bed. This means that people under 130 pounds tend to experience a firm mattress as very hard, but someone over 230 pounds may find it to have a comfortable amount of cushioning. Generally, as a person’s weight increases, so does their preference for a firm mattress. Buying a firm mattress online is both convenient and cost-effective. With a range of options to choose from and the ability to shop from home at your own pace, finding a great mattress is easier than ever. It might seem odd to buy a firm mattress without feeling it in-person first to actually know how firm it is. Because of this, online mattress companies provide generous return policies known as sleep trials. This lets you use the mattress for a set period of time, usually 100 nights or more, with hassle-free returns. The sleep trial allows you to try the mattress in your own home, which gives you a far better sense of whether it will work for you. Because there’s less overhead than with brick-and-mortar stores, it’s easy to find great deals for mattresses online. Mattress manufacturers frequently run promotions, and third-party sites, like SleepFoundation.org, often provide discounts or coupon codes to help you get the best price. Our site’s buying guides and reviews can also be a handy resource for finding the mattress that best fits your needs and budget. Shipping is almost always included in your purchase price, and some companies even include installation or offer it for an extra charge. Ordering is as easy as a few clicks, and payment with a credit card or methods like Paypal (on some sites) makes finalizing your order simple. Some retailers even offer financing programs as well. Shopping for a new mattress can be overwhelming. Complex marketing campaigns can draw attention away from some of the most important considerations, and as a consumer, it’s easy to get lost in the weeds. Stay focused on these factors that are most likely to impact how satisfied you’ll be with your purchase. The composition of a mattress is one of the most important factors driving its performance and durability. Each type has pros and cons, and identifying the type you’re most interested in can help you narrow the field for better comparison shopping. Read more about mattress types in the section below. Given how much you rely on your mattress to promote quality sleep, it’s a product worth investing in. Nevertheless, you have to work within your budget, so a key factor to consider is how much you can realistically spend on a new mattress and any related accessories you might need (such as a new bed frame, sheets, or pillows). If you share a mattress, good motion isolation can reduce the chances that you’ll be awoken by movement on another part of the bed. Firmer mattresses with less contouring usually transfer more motion, but the interior materials can significantly affect how much disturbance you’re likely to experience. A firm mattress can still provide pressure relief by offering sufficient cushioning of pressure points. A slight amount of give, especially when tailored to the body’s weight, can contribute to proper spinal alignment. Some mattresses make it easier to move around on the surface, which is especially important for anyone who wants to be able to effortlessly change their sleeping position or engage in intimate activities. Hybrid and latex mattresses tend to have the most bounce to facilitate movement. You want your firm mattress to have that same feel across the bed, allowing you to effectively use the whole surface area. Strong edge support also makes it easier to sit on the edge of the bed without feeling like it is collapsing under you. A mattress that retains heat can lead to a lack of sleep as you find yourself waking up in a sweat. If you tend to sleep hot, look for a mattress with materials that combat heat buildup. If you’re not sure how to narrow down the available options, a good starting point is focusing on the types of mattresses available. Each category of mattress has some shared characteristics of design and performance, but remember that there are exceptions. The type of mattress gives a sense of the likely feel, but the best information comes from digging into the details of any given brand and model. Definition: Hybrid mattresses have two key sections. The bottom section is the support core, which is built with innerspring coils. The top section is the comfort system, and it is made with one or more materials like foam, latex, micro-coils, wool, cotton, and polyester. More Than Just Firm: With a strong base of coils, most hybrids have a firmer feel and quality edge support, but the comfort system brings extra benefits. For example, comfort layers can improve pressure relief and motion isolation. Definition: An innerspring is made with one primary section, which is its innerspring support core. Unlike a hybrid, an innerspring has few materials that rest on top of the coils. Although there may be a thin amount of foam or fiber fill, it is usually not enough to strongly change the overall feel. Reliably Firm: The lack of a developed comfort system means that innersprings tend to have a firm to extra firm feel. While they tend to lack pressure relief and motion isolation, most innersprings are reliably firm. Definition: Latex is a rubber material that can either be harvested from sap from trees or produced chemically. A latex mattress is made with interior layers that are exclusively latex, and in mattresses, that latex is most often natural rather than synthetic. Pronounced Bounce: Latex can be designed to be different levels of softness, but it is almost always resilient and bouncy. A firm latex mattress makes it easy to move on the bed and often can provide mild pressure relief as well. Definition: In an airbed, the support core is an air chamber that can be inflated or deflated to change the firmness. The air level is controlled by a smartphone or remote. There may be one or more layers above the support core to create a comfort layer. Control Firmness at the Touch of a Button: No other mattress type provides as much control and flexibility as an airbed. With the push of a button, an airbed lets you make your bed feel harder or softer, allowing you to home in on your ideal firmness level. Definition: All of the layers of these mattresses are made with memory foam, polyfoam, fiber fill, or latex. Generally, the support core is high-density polyfoam, and one or more layers above serve as the comfort system. Added Pressure Relief: Foams, especially memory foam, are able to hug the body by compressing in response to the amount of weight applied to them. Even in an otherwise firm mattress, this boosts pressure relief, which can be particularly useful to side sleepers. Picking out a firm mattress is step one to getting your bed set up to perfectly suit your needs. Once you have the mattress, though, it’s worth putting some thought into a few accessories to optimize your bed. Your pillow helps to make sure that your neck is supported and in line with the rest of your spine. On a firmer mattress, the pillow won’t sink much into the bed, so you’ll notice more of the pillow’s loft. Pillows made with feathers, down, polyester, or shredded foam or latex offer more ability to manipulate the pillow to adjust its fit under your head, and this can be a big plus for side sleepers. Back and stomach sleepers usually need lower-loft pillows, so thin pillows or models with a zippered cover that let you remove fill can be a good option. When a pillow is made with one piece of foam or latex, the loft is more stable. These pillows can work well on a firm surface as long as the selected loft matches with the support needs of the head and neck. If you’re looking for a firmer feel but don’t want to spring for an all-new mattress, a topper can be a temporary solution. A topper usually has a thickness of one to three inches and goes above your existing mattress and under your sheets. It can be made of foam, latex, fiber fill, wool, or down. A topper provides an easy way to change the , but it won’t be as durable or reliable as a new mattress. In addition, if your existing mattress is sagging or showing signs of wear, that will drag down the performance of any topper placed on top of it. For this reason, a topper is most appropriate when you are on a tight budget or only need a minor or short-term adjustment. When it fits with an individual’s needs for comfort and spinal support, a firm mattress can definitely help prevent or reduce . Maintaining spinal alignment through the night can decrease stress on the back, so finding the right fit in a mattress — whether firm, medium, or soft — is important for anyone worried about pain. Be sure to take your weight and sleeping position into account when determining the best firmness for your specific pain. Consult your doctor or chiropractor for personalized results. If your mattress is still in good working condition, you can make it firmer by using a mattress topper. You’ll want to look for a topper that is firm and thick enough to noticeably change the comfort feel. If your mattress is wearing out or sagging, there’s not much you can do to make it firmer. In this situation, the best bet is to . In general, children’s mattresses should be Medium Firm to Firm depending on their . As children get older and have more pronounced pressure points, a Medium or Medium Firm mattress may provide more support and comfort. Some children’s beds are designed with a reversible firmness feature. In these beds, each side of the mattress has a different feel, allowing parents to simply flip the mattress to offer their children a firmness choice as they grow. A mattress can be too firm. Almost everyone would agree that sleeping on concrete is uncomfortable, and this extreme shows that cushioning is important. In addition, each sleeper has different needs, and for some people, a firm mattress can’t accommodate pressure points. Most side sleepers do best with Medium or Medium Firm mattresses, but there are exceptions. Some side sleepers just prefer more firmness, and those over 230 pounds often find that a firmer mattress offers sufficient cushioning without exaggerated sagging. A firm mattress won’t necessarily last longer than a soft mattress. All materials will start to wear out, meaning that even a sturdy, firm mattress will soften over time. Factors like design and quality of materials have much more bearing on durability than firmness. A firm mattress can cause back pain if it’s the wrong fit for any individual. If the firm feel creates impact at pressure points, it can be painful and throw off spinal alignment.

Polyester is quick-drying and can usually be machine-washed to keep the pillow fresh. Tempted by the benefits of a polyester pillow, but not sure whether it’s right for you? We’ll discuss everything you need to know to make the right decision, providing buyer advice as well as our recommendations for the best polyester pillows on the market today. Best for Side Sleepers – Use this SleepFoundation.org link for the most current discount on the Sobel At Home pillows The Sobella Pillow is made with a hypoallergenic virgin microfiber with a very fine denier of 0.9. This lightweight fill gives the pillow an initially plush feel, although it forms a firmer cradle to support the head as sleepers gradually sink into the pillow. The pillow is fairly plump, which makes it ideally suited to side sleepers who don’t need a firm pillow. It can also be used by back sleepers who prefer a higher loft. The cover is made of 100 percent cotton with a durable 300 thread count, decorated with a subtle geometric box design. Cotton is known for being one of the more breathable bed sheet materials, and this cover helps dissipate heat to keep a neutral temperature throughout the night. The pillow is sold in standard, queen, and king sizes. Sobella offers free shipping for customers in the continental U.S. Returns are accepted within 30 days of the order date, but customers are responsible for shipping costs. Use this SleepFoundation.org link for the most current discount on the Utopia Deals pillows Offered at a very attractive price point, the Utopia Premium Plush Gel Pillow is made of 100 percent polyester fiber. Utopia uses gel ball fiber, which has a soft, fluffy feel and tends to hold its shape without developing lumps or flattened areas. The pillow is squishy and can be molded to a certain extent to fit the desired shape. Despite its full shape, the pillow is quite soft and it doesn’t have a gusset. Most sleepers will find their head sinks in significantly, resulting in a low-to-medium loft that’s best-suited to stomach and back sleepers. The cover is made of cotton with a 240 thread count and sports a classic striped design. Hot sleepers should find the cotton allows generous airflow to keep the pillow cool. The pillow is mold- and mildew-resistant and can be machine-washed following the manufacturer’s instructions. When it starts to flatten, it can be easily fluffed up by putting in the dryer on no heat along with two tennis balls. The Utopia Deals Premium Plush Gel Pillow comes in queen and king sizes and is sold in packs of 2 or 8. People with sharp pressure points around their necks Contoured design delivers excellent head and neck support Use this SleepFoundation.org link for the most current discount on the Eli & Elm pillows The Cotton Side-Sleeper Pillow from Eli & Elm features a contoured U-shaped design that allows you to lie comfortably on your side without compromising your spinal alignment – a common source of pain and pressure points for people who primarily use this sleep position. In contrast, traditionally shaped pillows often create too much of a barrier between the head and neck, leading to alignment issues. While the pillow’s cover is made of a stretchy cotton and polyester blend, the fill is composed from a blend of shredded Talalay latex and polyester batting. The latex is soft yet springy to cushion and support the head, while the batting provides extra padding to keep the pillow from feeling too firm. This pillow offers adjustable loft, meaning you can add or remove the fill to increase or decrease the overall thickness. The Cotton Side-Sleeper Pillow is also a good option for hot sleepers thanks to its breathable cover and fill materials. To clean the pillow, remove the fill before washing and drying the cover in your household machines. Compared to other pillows with latex fill and adjustable loft, this model is very reasonably priced. Eli & Elm also offers free ground shipping for all orders. You may return the pillow if you aren’t satisfied within 45 days of the original order, even if you’ve used or cleaned it.  airfiber polyethylene insert 100% polyester inner pad and batting Use this SleepFoundation.org link for the most current discount on the airweave pillows The adjustable airweave Pillow is another model that can be adjusted for feel and loft. The core consists of two removable inserts made from airfiber, a proprietary polyethylene material. Polyethylene – which is also used to produce fishing line – gives the airfiber a firm feel, making this pillow more supportive than competing models with plusher core materials like polyfoam or memory foam. You can use one or both inserts for more reinforcement, or remove them both to create a softer feel. The interior also contains polyester batting that cushions the head and neck well, as well as a polyester sleeve for the inserts. The cover is composed of polyester fabric, as well. The airweave Pillow is a great choice for hot sleepers. The airfiber inserts have an interwoven design that promotes steady airflow to keep the pillow cool, and the cover fabric is also fairly breathable. Since the pillow has a relatively low loft even when both inserts are in place, it is best suited to back and stomach sleepers. The airweave Pillow’s relatively high sticker price reflects its innovative design and materials, but the company provides free shipping anywhere in the lower 48 states. You can return the pillow if you aren’t satisfied within 30 days of the original purchase, provided it is still in new condition. Polyester is a synthetic fabric that’s present in many linens, from clothing to bed sheets to upholstery. As polyester grew in popularity over the last century, it largely replaced cotton as a pillow filling. When it’s used in pillows, polyester is usually referred to as poly fiber or fiberfill. This describes the way it’s been spun out into airy, lightweight fibers that feel somewhat similar to cotton. Although not quite as soft as down alternative pillows, many people associate polyester pillows with the feel of a traditional feather pillow, at a much lower price-point. Polyester pillows are soft, lightweight, cuddly, and somewhat moldable. They compress well, and by adjusting the fill, they can be tailored to virtually any sleep position. Their affordability and versatility has led to them being one of the more common pillow types currently on the market. Polyester pillows usually have a cotton cover to enhance breathability. Now that we’ve discussed what a polyester pillow is and shared some of our top picks, we’ll go more in-depth about how to shop for a polyester pillow. Along with some general buyer tips, this guide covers the pros and cons of polyester pillows, as well as advice on who is best-suited to a polyester pillow. What to Consider When Purchasing a Polyester Pillow Many polyester pillows look similar at first glance, leading some manufacturers to make lofty and exaggerated claims to encourage buyers to choose their pillow above the rest. Having a basic understanding of the components that make up a pillow and how they affect its functionality can help you see past these claims and choose the pillow that’s best for you. Pillow loft refers to how thick a pillow is. Thicker pillows raise the head higher up off the mattress. They are best-suited to side sleepers, who need the extra lift to prevent shoulder pain and a cricked neck. Back sleepers tend to prefer medium-loft pillows that keep the head at a comfortable distance off the pillow, and stomach sleepers need hardly any loft at all. Polyester pillows can be made with any loft and are often adjustable. The amount of support a pillow provides is directly related to how high and how firm it is. Polyester pillows can be quite high, but they’re not usually very firm. This makes them unsuitable for sleepers who need extra head and neck support. While a pillow must be firm enough to maintain the head and neck aligned, a pillow that’s too firm can cause pressure points. This is especially true for side sleepers, who commonly experience pressure build-up on the ears. Generally, polyester pillows provide sufficient cushioning to alleviate this kind of pressure. Materials that conform more closely tend to provide better pressure relief. While poly fiber doesn’t attain the superior pressure relief of memory foam, it does a fairly good job of contouring to the head and neck in order to reduce pressure points. Pillow shape is not only a matter of aesthetics. Many pillows feature flared ends, raised areas, or other features that are meant to enhance support for the head and neck. Polyester pillows, however, usually have a traditional rectangular shape that allows even distribution of the fibers inside. Given that pillows usually need replacing after a few years, it’s tempting to buy the cheapest pillow available. However, a cheap pillow can wreak havoc on your back and neck and make it difficult to find a comfortable position. That’s not to mention the fact that cheaper pillows usually deteriorate faster, which means you’ll have to fork out money sooner for another one. The best policy is to do your research and try to find a pillow that offers good value for your money. Within pillow types, there can be vast differences in feel and durability depending on the quality of the materials. This also applies to polyester pillows, which often offer better longevity and enhanced features if you’re willing to pay just a little more. Moldability: Many sleepers prefer a moldable pillow that can be scrunched into shape to suit their sleeping position. Polyester pillows can be molded to a certain extent, but they tend to regain their original shape almost immediately. For those who sleep hot, temperature regulation is one of the most important features of a pillow. Luckily, polyester pillows score fairly well in this category, with a loose-packed construction that allows room for airflow. If you have serious problems staying cool at night, try choosing a pillow with a breathable cover and cooling technology such as gel infusions or phase-change material. Polyester pillows mimic the light, fluffy feel we associate with the feather pillows of our youth, but for a significantly more affordable price. However, the low price may come at the cost of support and durability. Polyester pillows tend to be the cheapest models on the market. In contrast to other pillow types, most polyester pillows can be machine-washed and tumble-dried. Due to their airy construction, polyester pillows don’t build up as much heat as other pillow types. Polyester pillows are lightweight and easy to move for sleepers who frequently shift positions. Those who suffer from pressure points should find that polyester pillows do a good job of cushioning sore spots. In many cases, users can add or remove fill to adapt a polyester pillow for any sleep position. Polyester pillows rarely present any odors when first unwrapped. Additionally, polyester is a hypoallergenic material, unlike feathers, , or . Poly fiber often shifts and flattens under weight, and sleepers may find the pillow fails to keep the head and neck aligned. Polyester is prone to clumping together, and users may find that the contents distribute unevenly and must be constantly re-fluffed. Polyester pillows are among the least durable pillows, and may need replacing as soon as 1 to 2 years after purchasing. Some polyester pillows rustle when moved, which may be a problem for sensitive sleepers. Polyester pillows leave plenty of room for dust mites, which can trigger allergies in some sleepers. Polyester is derived from petroleum and may be problematic for sleepers who are concerned with their impact on the environment. Polyester pillows can be successfully used by stomach, side, and back sleepers alike. They’re popular with sleepers who like a soft, fluffy pillow, as well as with those who are sensitive to smell. Polyester pillows are commonly favored by sleepers who fit the following categories: : By adjusting the fill of a polyester pillow, users can change the loft and, to some extent, the firmness level. In this way, sleepers can adjust the pillow to suit the high loft needed for side sleeping, or the lower loft needed for stomach and back sleeping. : Polyester pillows don’t off-gas like memory foam or polyfoam, nor do they give off strong smells as buckwheat or feather pillows are prone to do. This makes them a suitable choice for those who are sensitive to smell. : Poly fiber is inherently soft and fluffy, and most polyester pillows are on the plush side. This is good news for sleepers who prefer sinking into their pillow, as well as those who commonly suffer from pressure points in the ears or other sensitive areas. : Support is a weak point of polyester pillows, which tend to compress under the weight of the head. This makes it difficult to keep the head and neck aligned and can lead to and . It may also cause pressure points in the for side sleepers. : Polyester pillows are a haven for dust mites, which may aggravate allergy or asthma symptoms in susceptive individuals. : Polyester pillows may rustle slightly when you shift sleeping positions. This can cause sleep disruptions to people who are easily awakened. Unlike memory foam pillows that are produced in a variety of orthopedic shapes, polyester pillows are almost always rectangular. They are usually sold in one of the following sizes, although the exact dimensions may vary by manufacturer: At 20 by 26 inches, standard pillows are the smallest of the regular pillow sizes. They can be used not just on twin mattresses, but also on larger mattresses. Standard pillows are a good choice for anyone who prefers a smaller or more economical pillow. The less-common super standard or “jumbo” pillows are 20 by 28 inches long, just slightly longer than the standard size. The queen pillow is the most common type aside from the standard pillow. Measuring 20 by 30 inches, it’s perfectly suited to queen size mattresses and may occasionally be used on twin or full size mattresses. After queen size pillows, measurements take a significant jump in length. The king size pillow measures a hefty 20 by 36 inches and can accommodate sleepers who frequently roll from side to side while sleeping. The greater length of a king size pillow may also be helpful when sitting up in bed. Common specialty sizes include extra-long body pillows for side sleepers, square Euro sizes, and cervical pillows with unique shapes that are tailored to provide better support. Frequently Asked Questions About Polyester Pillows Polyester pillows have an average price range of $10 to $20, making them the cheapest pillows on the market. You may even find polyester pillows for less than $10. Where available, polyester pillows of more than $30 tend to have additional special features such as gel infusions that justify the price. Ease of care is one of the great advantages of polyester pillows, with most being machine-washable and dryable. Manufacturers may recommend using the gentle cycle and keeping it to low temperatures, although hot temperatures can be used in some cases to kill dust mites. Polyester dries fairly fast, but to prevent clumping and ensure even drying, it’s a good idea to add one or two tennis balls to the dryer. In cases where the pillow itself is not washable, the cover may be removable and machine-washable. Polyester pillows are easy to find, both online and in brick-and-mortar stores. When shopping online, you may be able to buy directly from the manufacturer, or through third-party websites such as Amazon. Take advantage of sleep trials, and don’t forget to take shipping fees into account when comparing prices. Polyester pillows have a below-average lifespan and usually need to be replaced every 1 to 2 years. The average lifespan of a pillow in general is 2 to 3 years, so while polyester pillows are less durable, the difference isn’t huge. You’ll know it’s time to get a new polyester pillow when you notice that the pillow begins flattening, losing support, and no longer responds as well to fluffing. Polyester pillows are adjustable to a certain extent. As they’re filled with hundreds of tiny fiber clumps, polyester pillows are quite amenable to being squished and hugged. Additionally, in many cases, users can open up the pillow to add or remove filling. This changes the loft and can make the pillow softer or firmer, although most polyester pillows will never get as firm as a buckwheat or latex pillow. Polyester pillows don’t emit a strong odor at first, and since most of them are machine-washable it’s easy to keep them odor-free. Because of this, plus the lack of natural allergens such as latex or down, they are a good candidate for most sleepers with allergies or those who dislike strong smells.

The Nectar mattress is proof that finding a great mattress doesn’t have to break the bank, and for that reason, it is our pick for the top value among the best mattresses on the market today. The appeal of the Nectar doesn’t just stem from its affordable price point. Its performance is impressive, powered by numerous layers of memory foam that relieve pressure across the surface of the mattress. The top three layers of the Nectar are all made with memory foam. The top two layers are each one inch and gel-infused. The topmost of these is quilted into the bed’s moisture-wicking Tencel cover. The third layer is three inches tall and made with Nectar’s Adaptive Hi Core memory foam. Each of these memory foam components has a slightly different feel on its own, but when combined, they provided the comfort system with solid motion isolation and contouring. A support core with especially high-density polyfoam — 2.2 pounds per cubic foot (PCF) — prevents uncomfortable sinking into the bed. The feel of the Nectar is Medium Firm (6), and with its conforming properties, this makes it a match with side sleepers, particularly those who weigh more than 130 pounds.

Customers who like to sleep or sit near the edge of their mattress rave about the stability of the WinkBed around its perimeter.

A major selling point of hybrid mattress design is the ability to harness the benefits of different materials while minimizing their downsides, and the fruits of that approach are evident in the DreamCloud, our pick for the best hybrid mattress. Its construction utilizes multiple types of foam along with innerspring coils to deliver a potent blend of characteristics including sound conforming, bounce, motion isolation, and temperature control. The DreamCloud starts with a layer of polyfoam quilted into the top of the bed’s cashmere blend cover. A two-tiered comfort system follows first with a layer of gel-infused memory foam. This layer keeps the body supported through modest cradling of heavier zones and pressure points. The next layer is a polyfoam that has slightly less contouring and more bounce, offering a welcome balance to the memory foam’s feel. The support core is made with individually-wrapped coils that are set up into zones to better adapt to the body and how its weight is placed on the mattress. The springs shore up stability at the edge and create notable bounce that enhances ease of movement across the whole mattress surface. A low-profile layer of high-density polyfoam goes underneath the coils to fortify the mattress and limit noise from the coils. A medium firm (6) feel can fit the needs of many sleepers and is often a top choice for side and back sleepers. The balanced performance serves most combination sleepers and couples as well.

While the traditional innerspring style has fallen in popularity, many sleepers still seek out its bouncy feel. For these shoppers, the Saatva is a top pick, especially because it supplements that bounce with dependable pressure relief. The top of the Saatva mattress utilizes several types of foam, including specialty polyfoam as well as a memory foam pad under the lumbar area. These foams are quilted into the euro-style pillow-top made with smooth and breathable organic cotton. Underneath the pillow top is a coil-on-coil interior design. The top layer of coils is four inches thick, and the coils are individually-wrapped to give them enhanced ability to tailor to the body and decrease motion transfer. The second coil layer forms the mattress support core, and it is either 4.5 or 7.5 inches depending on the model that you select. This layer uses hefty 13-gauge springs that are bolstered by a high-density foam encasement around the perimeter for better edge support. In this mattress construction, the two coils layers create responsiveness and make it easy to move on the bed while also lightly contouring to the body for pressure point cushioning. Plenty of airflow through the coils keeps this mattress cool through the night. Firmness options include Soft (3), Medium Firm (6), and Firm (7), allowing any customer to choose what best suits their preferences. Installation plus haul-away of an old mattress, known as White-Glove delivery, is included as is a 180-night sleep trial (with a $99 return shipping fee) and a 15-year warranty.  Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King Latex hybrids are best suited to sleepers who need extra support from their mattress and prefer a springy surface feel. The Awara is a standout model thanks in part to its construction, which includes a comfort layer of responsive Dunlop latex that measures 4 inches thick. The mattress has a medium firm feel and resists sagging quite well, making it particularly comfortable for back and stomach sleepers who weigh 130 to 230 pounds. The support core consists of individually pocketed coils that stabilize the mattress very well. The coils also promote air circulation to help the mattress maintain a comfortable core temperature, and the latex also sleeps fairly cool compared to foam. The surface features a Euro-top cover made of organic cotton and New Zealand wool for added breathability. Edge support is another major strength of the Awara. The coils reinforce the perimeter to provide push-back and minimize sinkage, so most people should feel secure sleeping near or sitting on the edges. Couples who prefer bouncy beds for sex should also be pleased with the Awara. The mattress is competitively priced for a latex hybrid, but the company offers free shipping to customers in all 50 states. Every purchase includes a sleep trial that allows you to test out the mattress for 365 nights before deciding to keep it, and you’ll also receive a lifetime warranty that covers structural defects for as long as you own the bed.  Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King Medium-firm feel and responsive foam helps relieve pressure points Get $135 off a Nolah Original Mattress with code: SF135 The Nolah Original, the flagship mattress from Nolah Sleep, is a mixed-polyfoam model that’s great for relieving pressure points in the back and hips. The Nolah Original is also relatively affordable compared to other foam-based mattress models. Comfort layers of Nolah Airfoam and high-resilience polyfoam offer a balance of support and conforming for optimal cushioning in areas of the body that need it the most. Airfoam is a proprietary foam that combines the conforming of memory foam and the responsiveness of higher-density polyfoam. A high-density polyfoam base layer reinforces the sleep surface, and a moisture-wicking cover allows the bed to sleep fairly cool compared to other foam-based mattresses. In terms of firmness, the Nolah Original is a Medium (5), which is one of the most popular settings for sleepers today. Due to its moderately conforming all-foam construction, the Nolah performs especially well in pressure relief and motion isolation, and fairly well across the board in our other performance categories. The Nolah Original comes at an average price point for a foam mattress, and Nolah guarantees it with a 120-night sleep trial and a nonprorated 15-year warranty.  Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King Pocketed coils and contouring foam layers create a balanced feel Standout performance for side sleepers with shoulder pain Get 15% off a Leesa Mattress with code: SLEEPFOUNDATION The Leesa Hybrid is a high-quality hybrid bed that offers a great all-around performance. This 12-inch mattress has five layers, the top three of which form the comfort system. The topmost layer is a latex-like polyfoam that offers a combination of bounce and contouring. The next layer memory foam that conforms to the body and isolates motion across the surface of the bed. Under this is an additional layer of transition polyfoam. The support core is composed of a pocketed coil system, which makes for a support and breathable bed base. While each foam layer in the comfort system has a distinct feel, they work in conjunction to give the Leesa the ability to reduce pressure and promote spinal alignment without causing sleepers to feel stuck in the bed. Meanwhile. the pocketed coil support core adds great overall support, edge support, and airflow. Leesa was an early riser in the online mattress industry, and the Leesa Hybrid has thousands of positive reviews from its years on the market. In addition, Leesa is a B-Corp, which means that a positive social impact is codified as part of its corporate charter.

The mattress is constructed with a thick comfort layer of adaptive polyfoam that contours to the body and alleviates pressure without hugging or sinking too much (a common complaint about memory foam). Transitional and base layers of denser polyfoam reinforce the top layer to maintain a flat, even surface for your body. The Mint Mattress should be a good option if softer all-foam mattresses don’t feel supportive enough. The top two layers are infused with graphite and cooling gel, which helps to draw heat away from the body and keep you cool. An antimicrobial protectant is also embedded in the cover. This material protects the mattress from bacteria and other contaminants that can be harmful to you and detrimental to the mattress. Couples should experience fewer sleep disruptions on the Mint Mattress too. The foams absorb movement and eliminate most motion transfer, and the mattress itself is completely silent. Given the sophisticated design and strong performance, the bed’s mid-range sticker price is quite reasonable. Tuft & Needle also offers free shipping throughout the contiguous U.S. The Mint Mattress is backed by a 100-night sleep trial and a 10-year warranty.

The Bear Mattress, with an all-foam design and Celliant cover, is just the ticket and takes the prize for the best mattress for athletes. Several components of the Bear Mattress design make it well-suited for people with an active lifestyle. The Celliant material in the cover promotes tissue and muscle recovery by reflecting heat from the body back as infrared energy, helping keep your body in top shape for physical exertion. The comfort system in the Bear also works to promote comfort and pain-free support. The top layer is two inches of memory foam with above-average contouring and pressure relief. The foam is infused with a graphite gel to reduce the chances that you’ll wake up from sleeping hot. The second layer of the comfort system is two inches of a transition polyfoam that works against excess sinking into the bed. The transition polyfoam is helped in that effort by the six-inch support core made of high-density polyfoam. The Bear has a Firm (7) firmness that offers a supportive feel that meets the needs of most sleepers. The best fit is among back sleepers and those who weigh over 130 pounds, though the bed’s blend of contouring and support makes it suitable for a wide variety of sleepers. Athletes and other customers can try out the Bear for 100 nights during a no-risk sleep trial. The interior mattress components have a 10-year warranty, and the Celliant cover has a 1-year warranty.  Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King People looking for a responsive surface that’s easy to move around and have sex on Premium natural materials at an affordable price point Sustainably sourced New Zealand wool naturally regulates temperature Made by Helix Sleep, the Birch mattress is a latex hybrid with a high quality construction and a medium-firm feel. The Birch has two comfort layers under an organic cotton cover. The first layer is made from a wool blend, a breathable material that wicks moisture away from the surface. The second layer consists of natural Talalay latex, a breathable and responsive foam that conforms moderately to the sleepers body. Under these layers is a substantial pocketed coil support core.

The AS5 is the company’s thickest, softest mattress and rates as a 4 on the 1-10 firmness scale, so most sleepers will receive close conforming from head to toe. Side sleepers in particular should find the AS5 comfortable because the memory foam comfort layer cushions the shoulders and hips, which in turn helps align the spine and reduce pressure in sensitive areas. The AS5 is also constructed with three layers of polyfoam to stabilize the mattress. These materials absorb movement very well, making the mattress a great option for people who wake up easily due to their sleep partner’s movements. The memory foam is also quite dense, ensuring a longer-than-average expected lifespan compared to similarly constructed all-foam models. If you’d like a little more support and responsiveness from your mattress without sacrificing pressure relief, the AS5 is also available as a hybrid model that swaps out the base polyfoam for a pocketed coil system. The hybrid is a bit more expensive than its all-foam counterpart. Compared to other memory foam mattresses, the AS5 has a fairly high sticker price, but Amerisleep will deliver it for free anywhere in the contiguous U.S. The sleep trial spans 100 nights in length, allowing you to test out the mattress for more than three months, and you’ll also receive a 20-year warranty.  Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King Luxurious pillow-top design at a reasonable price-point Use this SleepFoundation.org link for the most current discount on the Silk & Snow mattresses In recent years, Canada has become a major player in the “bed-in-a-box” mattress industry. The Silk & Snow Hybrid, which is also available to U.S. customers, is a standout Canadian model due to its luxurious design and affordable price-point. The mattress is constructed with a pillow-top cover infused with silver to protect against harmful bacteria, followed by comfort layers of adaptive polyfoam and memory foam that contour to the body and alleviate pressure. The support core consists of pocketed coils that are zoned to provide targeted support to the lumbar region of the lower back. The coils also provide great reinforcement along the perimeter, so most people won’t sink excessively when they sleep near the edges or get in and out of bed. Like many competing hybrids, the Silk & Snow model sleeps quite cool. The coils promote steady airflow to maintain a comfortable core temperature, and the foam layers don’t absorb too much body heat. Since the mattress has a medium firm (6) feel, it will be most comfortable for people who weigh at least 130 pounds. Compared to other hybrids, this model is very affordable, and ground shipping is free for all customers in provincial Canada and the lower 48 states. The Silk & Snow Hybrid is backed by a 100-night sleep trial and a 15-year warranty. Read our Full Silk & Snow Hybrid Review to learn more  Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King Sleepers who prefer the hugging feel of memory foam Proprietary phase change material absorbs and dissipates body heat Responsive comfort foam prevents excessive sinking Get 35% off a Cocoon Chill Mattress with code: SLEEPFOUND35 The Cocoon Chill comes in two firmness options: medium soft and medium firm. Regardless of which firmness level you choose, the cover of the mattress is made with a phase-change material that’s designed to draw heat away from your body. Both models also feature a memory foam comfort layer. Memory foam is known for its pressure relieving qualities, but it also helps with motion isolation. This means that you’re less likely to feel your partner moving around at night if you share the bed, which can be a benefit for couples. The medium soft model also contains a polyfoam transitional layer that offers further cushioning. Both models have a high-density polyfoam support core. The mattress’ all-foam construction best serves sleepers who weigh less than 230 pounds, as heavier sleepers generally require more support for proper spinal alignment. Side sleepers and sleepers under 130 pounds in particular appreciate the cradling contouring of the Cocoon Chill’s memory foam comfort layer. The bed is made in the U.S., and is backed by a 100-night sleep trial during which you can try out the bed and return it if you are not satisfied for any reason, with no mandatory break-in period. Sealy also offers free shipping to all 50 states and includes a 10-year full replacement warranty.  Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King, Split King Triangulex zoned support system reduces pressure on hips Specifically designed for sleepers with demanding lifestyles Ventilated cover and gel-infused foams keep the mattress cool The Zoma Mattress is an all-foam bed made with athletes in mind. Its zoned Triangulex memory foam provides targeted pressure relief and support for a great night’s sleep and enhanced muscle recovery. The mattress has a Medium (5 out of 10) feel. The Zoma is topped by a proprietary memory foam called Triangulex. This foam is zoned, meaning it features different three feels across different parts of the layer, ensuring pressure relief on the back and shoulders while the midsection remains supported. Under this layer is a layer of their Reactiv polyfoam, which is a more responsive foam that provides additional support and gives the mattress some ‘bounce’. At the bottom is a high-density polyfoam support core. The result is a somewhat-thick, 11 inch mattress that conforms closely to the sleepers body without allowing it to sink too deeply. Based on our performance tests, the Zomas’s key strengths are in pressure relief and motion isolation, which is a result of its close conforming foam construction. This makes it perfect for sleepers who experience back and hip pain, light sleepers, and couples. It also performs fairly well in edge support and ease of movement due to responsive polyfoam layers. The Zoma comes at a slightly below average price point for a memory foam mattress. The company offers a 100 night sleep trial and a 10 year warranty, and offers free shipping and returns to the contiguous US.  Medium (5), Medium Firm (6), Firm (7), Firm (8)  Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King Shoppers seeking a sustainable, eco-friendly design Sleepers looking for a mattress with plenty of bounce Handcrafted with certified organic latex, cotton and wool Available in hard-to-find sizes like split queen, split king, and split California king Get $100 off a PlushBeds Mattress with code: SF100 When built to a high standard, latex beds are a compelling choice, especially for people who like a bouncy mattress. With an eco-conscious focus in its materials, there’s no doubt that the PlushBeds Botanical Bliss is built to meet lofty standards. Natural latex is the driving force behind the Botanical Bliss; more specifically, the mattress employs multiple layers of organic, GOLS-certified Dunlop latex. In the 10-inch model, there are three Dunlop latex layers, each of which is three inches tall. Rounding out the mattress is a half-inch thick cover of wool and cotton that are both GOTS-certified. Sleepers who want a responsive mattress love the Botanical Bliss since latex generates a springy feel that makes it a breeze to switch sleeping positions or take part in sexual activities. Latex also sleeps cool, and the excellent temperature regulation is furthered by the breathable materials in the cover. Even with these features, this mattress can still conform enough to maintain spinal alignment for most sleepers. Two firmness builds are available — Medium (5) and Firm (7) — with side sleepers leaning toward the Medium and back and stomach sleepers toward the Firm. The latex layers within the mattress can be re-arranged to adjust the firmness even further, allowing for four possible firmness levels ranging from soft (3) to Firm (7). The Botanical Bliss is also offered in 9-inch and 12-inch versions that are still all-latex but with some variation in their layering. While the environmentally friendly materials in the Botanical Bliss push up its retail price, customers can normally find promotions to get a better deal. After purchasing, there’s a 100-night sleep trial to test it out. A free comfort layer exchange is also offered during the trial. The long-term warranty lasts for 25 years. Read our Full PlushBeds Botanical Bliss Review to learn more  Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King Extra firm feel prevents sagging and improves spinal alignment for heavy sleepers Zoned latex and coil layers provide targeted support The WinkBed Plus model is a mattress designed specifically for heavier sleepers, built to easily accommodate and properly support individuals who weigh 300 pounds or more. The WinkBed Plus is 13.5 inches tall and features a breathable, eucalyptus-derived Tencel cover.The mattress starts with a layer of high-density polyfoam that provides some cushioning and contours to the shape of the body, while resisting sagging and body impressions. The polyfoam is bolstered by a thick layer of zoned, open-cell latex. Latex provides moderate contouring to relieve pressure and has a strong reputation for durability, with its open-cell structure boosting airflow through the bed to help it sleep cool. The zoned design of the latex makes it firmer in areas that need added support like the hips and midsection, and softer around gentler spots such as the neck and shoulders. The support core in the WinkBed Plus is made of a sturdy layer of individually wrapped coils that are designed to increase airflow and help minimize motion transfer. The coils are well-fortified around the bed’s perimeter for excellent edge support. This layer is further zoned into three sections to provide increased levels of support for the body’s heavier areas. The WinkBed Plus has a thoroughly supportive firm (8) feel, making it a best fit for sleepers over 230 pounds, regardless of their preferred sleeping position. Sleepers who weigh under 230 pounds should still feel comfortably supported on the Plus, though side sleepers and those under 130 pounds will likely find it too firm for their needs. If you share the bed with a co-sleeper who weighs between 130 and 230 pounds, it may be worth going for the slightly softer firm (7) model of the WinkBed. The WinkBed Plus ships free to the contiguous U.S. It comes with a 120-night sleep trial with a 30-day break-in period, and is backed by a lifetime warranty. Unique airfiber material helps keep the mattress cool Even distribution of bodyweight for a more supportive feel Eco-friendly materials help reduce carbon footprint and waste Use this SleepFoundation.org link for the most current discount on the airweave mattresses While most mattresses fit well into one of the few common mattress categories, the airweave presents a brand new approach to mattress construction. The airweave is composed entirely of their proprietary airfiber material, which is an interwoven fibers that provides excellent support and breathability. Unlike foams, airfiber does not conform very closely to the sleeper’s body, providing a feeling more akin to sleeping ‘on’ the mattress rather than ‘in’ it. This makes the airweave an excellent choice for back and stomach sleepers, who tend to have their midsections sink too far into foam. Also unlike foams, airfiber consists of a ton of space, making it trap less body heat and sleep cooler. The cover of the mattress is made of a soft polyester. One of the largest innovations of the airweave is that the interior components can be removed from the cover and thrown into a washing machine. While other mattresses need to be spot cleaned, with the interior often being impossible to clean, users can keep this bed free of things like fluids, skin cells, and dust extremely easily. Also distinguished by eco-friendliness, airfiber is a made of recyclable plastic, which won’t end up in landfills like foam and spring mattresses. The airweave comes with a 100 night sleep trail and a 10-year limited warranty. They also ship free to the contiguous US. For more personalized mattress guides, check out the following pages: The Best Mattresses for Airbnb and Vacation Rental Properties The Best Tempurpedic Mattress for Stomach Sleepers Defining the ideal mattress is extremely subjective. Every sleeper has their own idea of the perfect firmness level. Optimal support and bounce can depend on a person’s sleeping position and body weight. The right mattress can also vary based on whether someone shares a bed, whether they sleep hot, and of course, their budget. Given all these factors, it’s impossible to say that there’s one single best mattress. For that reason, we’ve broken our top picks into individual categories so that you can find the best bets among specific mattress types and aspects of mattress performance. If you’re in the process of looking at mattress options, you might be wondering which category best suits you. Every mattress has pros and cons based on its construction, and while mattress manufacturers try to incorporate features to minimize drawbacks, those attempts don’t always work out. A great way to narrow down your options is to focus on these critical performance factors, considering which are most important to you and which mattresses best fit your priorities. There’s no getting around the bottom line; any mattress that you’re seriously considering has to fall within your budget. While price ranges can vary substantially, foam mattresses tend to be the most affordable with hybrid and latex beds typically costing more. For a mattress to give you support and comfort for a good night’s sleep, it has to be able to accommodate your body’s sleeping position. Medium Soft (4) to Medium Firm (6) tends to be best for side sleepers; Medium (5) to Firm (7) for back sleepers; and Medium Firm (6) to Firm (8) for stomach sleepers. All mattress types have benefits and downsides, and knowing the key differences between the types can help you boil down your options to those that are most likely to match what you’re looking for. A mattress with good contouring can tailor its cushioning to match the way that the body’s weight and pressure is distributed on the bed. Deep conforming is most often found in memory foam while latex and polyfoams provide more moderate contouring. If you want a mattress that serves your sleep needs and lasts for the long-term, then place a priority on top-notch components. Low-quality materials are inclined to wear out or underperform, so place an emphasis on a bed that doesn’t cut corners in its construction. A mattress should have the right level of firmness to keep you comfortable and seem inviting when bedtime rolls around each night. Your sleeping posture and weight can also impact the ideal firmness level. Pinch points and pain spots — including the hips, neck, shoulders, and lower back — need proper cushioning to keep you from waking up sore and achy. Materials with enough contouring and softness to accommodate these pressure points can facilitate spinal alignment, joint support, and overall comfort. On a mattress with poor motion isolation, it’s easy to be woken up by a partner moving on the other side of the bed. For that reason, motion isolation is an important consideration for couples. Foam mattresses tend to deliver the highest degree of motion isolation. If you want to move easily on a mattress, it’s helpful for it to have responsiveness and to resist excess sagging that can create a quicksand-like feeling. Ease of movement is good for combination sleepers and people with an active sex life. Latex and hybrid beds typically provide the most bounce for near-effortless movement. While it’s normal for a mattress to have its weakest point near its perimeter, that doesn’t mean that it has to feel unstable in that area. Hybrid and latex mattresses usually have the best edge support while foam beds are weaker in this category. If you’re worried about sleeping hot and waking up in a sweat, then a mattress with good temperature regulation can promote solid, consistent sleep. Because of how it closely hugs the body and retains heat, memory foam tends to sleep the hottest. Latex sleeps cool as do most, but not all, hybrids. A loud mattress can interrupt sleep and be a real bother. Coils in a mattress are the main cause of this, but modern hybrids tend to avoid significant noise. That said, foam and latex beds are the best bet for a noise-free mattress. Besides price, firmness is quite possibly the most important factor to consider in choosing a new mattress. While firmness isn’t an exact science, we try to use a consistent, 1-10 scale to explain how hard or soft a mattress feels. Mattresses at the far ends of the scale — such as 1-2 and 9-10 — are too hard or soft for most people, so these beds are rare. The most popular firmness is Medium (5) to Medium Firm (6) because it offers a more moderate and balanced feel that can work for a wide variety of sleepers. This is why most hotel beds are around this firmness level. One aspect of firmness is simple preference: some people just like the feel of a softer or harder bed. But it can also be heavily influenced by sleeping position and weight because these factors affect how a person puts pressure on a mattress. If you’re not sure of what firmness level is best for you, there are a few questions to consider to help select a mattress: If you find yourself wishing that your existing bed were harder or softer, it may be an indication of your firmness preference. If so, you have probably tried out Medium to Medium Firm. If you thought that mattress was too hard or soft, you can use that as a way to know what might work better in your home. If you really aren’t sure, you can take a visit to a retail mattress store. You should consider it a research visit with no need to make a purchase. During the visit, lie down on a few beds for an extended period (15 minutes or more) and take notes about which firmness level seems best to you. Are You Interested in a Reversible Firmness Design? Some mattresses have a design that offers firmness flexibility. For example, a flippable mattress with a different feel on each side offers a 2-in-1 construction that doesn’t lock you into just one choice. Remember, too, that when you shop online, you’ll almost always have a sleep trial of around 100 nights to try out a mattress with the option to return it. If you find that the firmness really doesn’t work for you, you won’t be stuck with a mattress you don’t like. When shopping for a mattress, some people may overlook just how critical it is to consider their sleeping position. Even a well-built, high-quality mattress may leave you unsatisfied if it’s not the right match for your sleeping position. The body’s widest areas are around the shoulders and the hips. When sleeping on your side, these joints press deeply into a mattress and can be significant pain points. In addition, if they sink in too much or not enough, they can wind up out of line with the rest of the body, putting serious pressure on the spine. , there are still sharp pressure points but less propensity to sink into a mattress. In order to get adequate cushioning, they usually need a softer, more conforming feel. , a Medium or Medium Soft feel is typically effective at offering pressure relief when on their side. , a slightly firmer feel is needed to keep the hips and shoulders from sagging too far into the comfort system. There’s a slight natural curve in the spine in the area of the lower back. This part of the body, known as the lumbar spine, has numerous flexible muscles that can get aggravated if they aren’t properly supported. When a mattress is too soft, the midsection can droop into the mattress, and if it’s too firm, the curve of the spine won’t be cushioned. In either case, there’s a risk of lower back pain, which is why most back sleepers need a Medium to Firm bed. , the best results usually come with beds on the softer side of the Medium to Firm range but that still don’t have pronounced sink. , Medium Firm or Firm mattresses typically offer the best balance of stability and cushioning for the lumbar area. , a firmer mattress is normally needed to prevent the midsection falling into a U-shape and out of line with the body. Stomach sleepers are at even greater risk than back sleepers of suffering from excess pressure on the lower spine. If their belly area sags into the bed, the dangerous U-shape can wreak havoc on their back. On top of that, stomach sleepers generally don’t want a mattress with too much hug because it can feel like they are suffocating or being swallowed up by the bed. , a mattress should still be firm, but a bit more give is workable since they don’t put as much pressure on the comfort layers. , a Firm mattress is generally the right level to avoid heightened pressure on the spine. , more firmness can hedge against the stomach pushing too far into the bed and contorting the lumbar spine into an uncomfortable position. People who switch up their sleeping position during the night are known as combination sleepers or sometimes “rotisserie sleepers.” At any body weight, they generally do best with a mattress that best matches their primary sleeping position. In addition, a responsive mattress provides combination sleepers without enough bounce to adjust their position without disruption during the night. For combination sleepers who share a bed, their partners value excellent motion isolation that keeps them from being disturbed when the combination sleeper shifts their position. One of the most useful tools we have for organizing the bevy of mattresses on the market is breaking them down by type. These types are defined by the interior construction of the mattress. Each type has certain benefits and is best suited for particular kinds of sleepers. At the same time, each type has potential downsides that should be considered as well. Reviewing each mattress type isn’t an attempt to determine that one is definitively better than another; instead, it’s a means of helping to decide which is the best option for you. One or more layers of micro-coils, foam, latex, and/or textiles Memory foam; may be supplemented by polyfoam, latex, and/or textiles One or more layers of polyfoam, latex, and/or textiles None or one or more layers of foam, latex, and/or textiles A hybrid has a coil-based support core and a thick comfort system made up of one or materials including micro-coils, memory foam, polyfoam, latex, wool, and cotton. $1,500-2,000 People who want a balanced feel; sleepers who want notable bounce; those who like an innerspring feel but need more pressure relief; most hot sleepers; people who want edge support. There are a diverse number of hybrids, so it can be harder to generalize about their performance. When they have more bounce, they may lack motion isolation and pressure relief. When they have lots of conforming, they may be prone to sleeping hot or having too much sink. These mattresses are made entirely with latex in the interior componentry. Natural latex is the most common type of latex used in mattresses sold online. $1,600-2,000 Who it’s Best for: People who want a mattress with lots of bounce; shoppers who prioritize a good mattress for sex; durability-focused customers; people who want only mild contouring. For some people, latex mattresses may be too bouncy or not have enough conforming. A higher price tag and a heavier, bulkier profile can be negatives as well. A memory foam mattress has a support core of polyfoam and a comfort system with a significant memory foam component. Other materials like latex or polyfoam may be used in the comfort system as well. Price Range: $900-1,500 People who want deep contouring; couples who need significant motion isolation; sleepers who want a noise-free mattress; anyone who prefers the feel of sleeping “in” the mattress. The deep hug and low responsiveness can cause some people to feel stuck in a memory foam bed, which can be uncomfortable and may restrict sexual activity. Memory foam has a tendency to heat up that can be a problem for hot sleepers. An all-foam mattress has no coil components. The support core is made with polyfoam, and the comfort system uses polyfoam, latex, and/or textiles like cotton and wool. $900-1,300 Sleepers who need solid pressure relief; people who want more motion isolation; customers who prioritize a silent mattress; shoppers who want some benefits of foam without the full-on effect of memory foam; value seekers. Some all-foam beds fall far short of the support offered by memory foam. In some cases, the comfort system layers can be too thin and prone to wearing out prematurely. Softer all-foam beds can be problematic for back and stomach sleepers. As with memory foam, heat retention and lack of responsiveness can be issues on some all-foam beds. An innerspring is built entirely or almost entirely with a coil-based support core. There is little or no comfort system to speak of, and any comfort layer is thin and made of textile fabrics or polyfoam. Price Range: $300-1,100 Budget shoppers; people who want to purchase a separate mattress topper; people who don’t have major pressure points; sleepers who want a firm, bouncy mattress. Considerations (drawbacks): Innersprings offer very little in the way of contouring and pressure relief, which is a problem for people with pronounced pressure points. These mattresses do little to isolate motion, reducing their utility for couples. Some innersprings are squeaky or creaky. In an airbed, the support core is a chamber that is filled with air. The amount of air can be changed to adjust the firmness feel in real time. A comfort system can include one or more layers and may include foam, latex, and/or textile fabrics. $2,000-2,400 Who it’s Best for: People who want maximum firmness flexibility; couples who want a different feel on each side. There are fewer airbed options on the market, and they tend to be the most expensive type of mattress. Depending on the design of the comfort system, airbeds may lack in pressure relief, motion isolation, responsiveness, and/or temperature control. Performance and feel are essential considerations when buying a mattress; however, they aren’t the only factors to consider. Getting familiar with a company’s policies can help avoid surprises after you’ve made your purchase. Fortunately, on the whole, online mattress shopping has made the industry more customer-friendly than ever. Nevertheless, you’ll want to take a close look at policies related to shipping, returns, warranties, and pricing when purchasing a mattress. For almost all mattresses sold online, free bed-in-a-box shipping is available in the contiguous 48 U.S. states. This means that the mattress comes compressed in plastic inside a box delivered to your doorstep. Once you bring the box to your bedroom and open the packaging, the bed expands to its full size. Lifting and setting up the mattress normally requires two or more people. Many manufacturers have White-Glove delivery services that send technicians to your home to set up the new mattress and take away your old one. For some beds, this service may be included for free while other manufacturers offer it at an extra charge. It may not be available in all geographic locations. Customers in Alaska, Hawaii, U.S. territories, and other countries may not have shipping options available to them for all mattress brands. It is always best for customers in these areas to check with the mattress company to find out about shipping availability, costs, and timeframes. To let customers try out a mattress, it’s normal for a mattress purchased online to come with a generous return policy known as a sleep trial. During the trial, you can initiate a return for a refund if you aren’t satisfied. The standard sleep trial is around 100 nights, but some last for a year or longer. In many cases, you’ll need to keep the mattress for up to 30 nights as a break-in period before you can ask for a return. In the majority of sleep trials, there are no return shipping fees, but there are exceptions. Charges for expedited or White-Glove delivery are not normally refundable. If you ask for a return, the mattress company may pick up the mattress from your home or work with you to find a nearby location for donation. A warranty provides protection against defects in the materials themselves or in the build, or workmanship, of the mattress. Warranties do not cover accidental damage from spills or drops, and they also don’t cover normal, expected wear-and-tear. When looking at the warranty, consider not just its length but also its terms. A non-prorated warranty offers more robust coverage that doesn’t change over time. A prorated warranty provides coverage that decreases the longer you’ve owned the bed. Though the fine print can be tedious, it’s worth reading through to know how much protection a warranty actually offers. When we’ve listed prices in this guide, we’ve focused on MSRP, also known as the retail or sticker price. But it’s important for customers to know that it’s rare to pay this full price when shopping for a mattress either online or in a physical store. There are almost always promotions or discounts that reduce your final price, sweeten the deal with freebies (like pillows or sheets), or both. Good deals are abundant online and will normally be clearly advertised on the websites of mattress manufacturers. That said, if you’re not seeing a promotion, you can check with third-party sites like ours for sale information, promo codes, and coupons.

Using a neck hammock or a neck traction sling is a great way by which you can easily stretch your neck at home for getting the traction benefits. Neck Hammocks are in fact gaining much popularity in recent years, due to the reason that they are extremely easy as well as affordable to use at home. Unlike others, a neck hammock basically works by pulling your head away from the shoulders. By relieving the pressure off from your neck muscles it provides instant relief to the aching muscles. The good thing about using this neck traction sling is it helps in expanding the space around your neck vertebrae to some extent which eventually helps in allowing better circulation (blood and oxygen) to the painful area. Although the above-mentioned method to make a DIY neck hammock at home (using a towel) sounds to be cheap and easy, we do not recommend using it due to safety concerns. If not done right this may lead to malfunctioning and can cause severe damages to your head and neck. Getting a professional neck hammock () is, therefore, the right neck stretcher by which you can safely stretch your neck without causing any risks.

With proper knowledge about using cervical traction at home, they can easily utilize it for getting permanent relief. When talking about the these are mainly of . Although these work differently, the main aim is to provide relief from the neck pain instantly within the shortest period of time. Let us look at these three types of at-home neck traction devices in detail so that you can choose the one that is most suited for your needs… These are also called as Air neck traction devices or neck traction collar. The device is inflated using the pump attached to it. To use it, it is wound around the neck region and slowly pumped to fill the air. Fill in the air until it stretches to a comfortable level. As the device gets strong, it shifts the weight from the neck downwards onto the shoulders. The pain reduces with the relaxing of the muscles and the decreasing pressure from nerves and the blood vessels as well. The discs also come in line so they can hydrate again. Advantages of using the air neck traction device are: Can be easily carried while traveling, while working, etc Can be used in any position, sitting, standing, lying down, walking, etc There are also some disadvantages of this device which are: The quality of these devices has to be checked properly before buying. As there are devices that wear out too soon and are of very poor quality you need to invest in a branded quality product. Sometimes the pressure applied is not accurate and can be a little too much for the neck and jaw areas. Posture Pump® for neck pain is of comparatively higher cost than the other two neck traction devices. Made up of highly durable high-quality medical materials, these devices are very well-built and powerful. It is said that they mimic the cervical traction that is done in a clinic and the treatment is very much similar to that given by the doctor. However, it is much more effective than regular neck traction devices. The person needs to lie down, fit the knobs by adjusting, hold the base of the skull and then let the straps be placed on the forehead. Once this is done correctly, slowly pump the air in, to let it tighten up to the required amount. Advantages of using the Posture Pumps devices are: The posture pumps are light, larger, and handy, sold in a case that is easy to carry These are said to give traction effects stronger than the other devices Their straps and head pads are also softer and comfortable for use These devices are more durable and work without any defect for a long time Unlike the other devices, they do not require a door and there is no fear of leakage as pillows are not used The device is safe inside the handy case it comes with when it needs to be carried anywhere The device is safe inside the handy case it comes with when it needs to be carried anywhere They take a little more space and the units are less portable These devices require a door for use, as the name suggests. Assembly is required as it has to be hung from a door’s back. The straps of the device need to be tied around the back of the person’s head and also the chin. Tighten the straps by using a cord or something that is available and suitable. Take care not to use anything that can hurt the neck (like a water bag). Advantages of using over the door traction device are: Place the straps correctly over a firm door and then tie it around the neck, this makes it easier to use. As the device plays its part, the person can sit comfortably on the chair doing his favorite reading, watching television, etc. There also major disadvantages of this device. They are not as portable as the air neck traction devices, as they need a door to be tied to. The person has to sit on the chair throughout and there is no choice to lean or lie down and relax. The correct stretch takes a little more time here and the chin has to take up most of the pressure from the traction. When compared to the air neck traction devices, these are not simple to use. Based on the above advantages and disadvantages you can choose the right type of cervical traction device that is most suited for your body needs and pain. Cervical Traction Contraindications and Precautions To Take The neck traction is contraindicated mostly in the patients who are suffering from the structural disease less important to rheumatoid arthritis, tumor or infection, acute injury process, or any condition which makes the movement contraindicated. In that situation, various other cervical traction contraindications are recommended to get relief from acute sprains, strains, and inflammatory conditions that may be aggravated with traction. Besides this, various forms of massage, devices, and medicines are recommended to treat the problem and ensure better health and safety. Osteomyelitis or bone infection is also a condition where experts do not suggest using cervical traction therapy for pain relief. As a slight pressure to the infected vertebrae region may cause weakness or fracture to the vertebrae bones this method should be avoided. Finally, cervical traction is not recommended to apply to the excessive joint motion or hypermobility which already exists in the cervical spine. Proper consultation and massage therapy are advised right to support the spinal vertebrae.

Causes of a Stiff Neck and How to Naturally Treat It A stiff neck can be, well, a real pain in the neck. It’s also one of the most common muscles aches both children and adults experience. Common triggers include poor posture, sports-related injuries, exercise-induced strains, repetitive work-related movements — even strenuous housework and landscaping can bring on a stiff neck. While the pain could arise from neck muscles, bones and ligaments, a stiff neck is usually a sign of overuse or straining in the neck muscles. () Neck pains often stem from the spinal cord and are caused by certain (usually temporary) changes in nerve signals. The neck is highly susceptible to stiffness, strains and tightness because of its mobility, range of motion and the vital role it plays in supporting the head through everyday movements. The intensity of a stiff neck depends a lot on the person and the cause of the pain. Some only experience mild, short-term pain while others deal with extreme soreness, tightness and trouble operating normally. As you’ll learn, a big part of stiff neck prevention involves , sleeping in a supportive position and reducing stress. Chances are your stiff neck can be resolved without the need for drugs or serious intervention. As a general rule, it’s best to seek medical attention if the stiff neck symptoms don’t go away after about one week. Look for other compounding symptoms to make sure an underlying illness, infection or medical condition isn’t to blame. Chiropractors can help find neck pain relief naturally by measuring the curve of your spine and providing targeted adjustments. An added perk is that chiropractors also show you helpful posture exercises you can work on at home. Chiropractors focus their attention on the health of your spine, aiming for proper alignment to reduce muscle tension and lower the chances for strains or sprains. Studies show that for every inch your head sticks out from its true center of gravity, your neck bears an extra 10 pounds of stress. It’s not uncommon for chiropractors to see patients with heads jutted two to three inches forward of true center of gravity. This adds an extra .  and spinal rehabilitation exercises teach you to develop proper posture of the neck, head and shoulders and can reduce pain while also increasing range of motion and overall quality of life. One National Institutes of Health study tested the effectiveness of different treatment approaches for lowering neck pain: either spinal manipulative therapy from a doctor of chiropractic care, pain medication (over-the-counter pain relievers, narcotics and muscle relaxants) or exercising. After 12 weeks, 57 percent of those who met with chiropractors and 48 percent who followed an exercise program reported at least a 75 percent reduction in neck pain. At the same time, only about 33 percent of the people in the medication group experienced the same improvements. And the relief continued for those not using drugs. After one year, 53 percent of the drug-free groups continued to report at least a 75 percent reduction in neck pain compared to just 38 percent of the group taking medication. () Regular exercise is important for keeping stress hormones under control, improving muscle strength, lowering inflammation, helping you sleep better and supporting a healthy body weight. All of these things reduce the risk for further injuries and are some of the biggest . Inactivity can lead to a weakening of the muscles around the neck that hold the head in place, while physical activity helps circulate oxygen to the soft tissues throughout the spine, which promotes healing. However, the key is safely exercising to reduce the risk for muscle strains or sprains. If you’ve experienced injuries in the past, it’s a good idea to talk to your doctor or physical therapist to get advice on the best types of exercises for you. You can also work on improving range of motion in the neck by practicing this simple,  exercise at home. (Just avoid doing this exercise on your own if you feel lots of pain). Start by sitting up tall on a chair and avoid hunching over. Place your left hand behind your head and gently pull it at an angle diagonally toward your knee. Stretch the muscle in this manner for five to 10 seconds, then relax the muscle for five to 10 seconds. Deepen the stretch by slowly pulling your head toward your chest in the direction of your knee until you reach a new ending point. Repeat two or three times, but back off if stiffness worsens. Following exercise, make sure to make it a priority to (which means seven to nine hours a night for most adults). Give yourself enough time to recover with proper , and limit repetitive motions that you notice increase pain. Take a break from exercise for several days if you feel a lot of pain, and when pain subsides start to stretch the neck gently to speed up healing. () When it comes to the best sleeping positions for stiff necks, sleeping on your side is the most highly recommended by doctors. If you choose to sleep on your back, try to keep your knees slightly bent upward by using pillows underneath your knees for support. Sleeping on your side keeps the spine in the best alignment, but be sure not to curl yourself up too much. A pillow between the knees in a side-sleeping position is also helpful. You can use a small rolled-up hand towel right under the neck for added support with your pillow if it helps. () High levels of make muscles more susceptible to pain and injury — not to mention inflammation weakens your bones and joints while also reducing range of motion and your ability to naturally heal injuries. If your overall range of motion, strength and flexibility are compromised, you face a higher risk of neck problems. Inflammation can also make it harder to recover from injuries. You can help control inflammation and speed up your ability to heal by eating a nutrient-dense diet filled with . This means eating less “empty calories” like added sugar, , chemically sprayed crops, refined grain products, alcohol and packaged snacks. An anti-inflammatory diet includes healing foods, such as: green leafy veggies; healthy fats, including extra virgin olive oil and coconut oil; sources of protein like cage-free eggs, grass-fed meat and wild-caught fish; and and (such as cultured veggies and yogurt). 5. Manage Stress and Pain with Natural Muscle Relaxers Excessive stress leads to tension around the neck, shoulders and head. This pain causes even more stress, creating a vicious cycle. During the first 72 hours you experience pain, ice the neck using homemade or store-bought ice packs several times per day. Follow this with targeted heat therapies after the first three days to treat neck muscle pain. Exercising, professional massages, treatments and using essential oils at home are also natural that are beneficial for treating nerve-related problems. Heating and massaging painful areas help relax muscles, loosen up tight tissue, increase blood flow and even increase the production of painkilling, calming chemicals we naturally produce. These include , the same feel-good chemicals unleashed during exercise. For a safe, pain-reducing treatment you can make at home using essential oils, try this  that includes peppermint essential oil and carrier oils. It penetrates stiff muscles and reduces inflammation. Other important factors to reduce bodywide inflammation include using natural ,exercising, avoiding too much alcohol and caffeine, and saying no to smoking and recreational drugs. Stiff neck symptoms usually dissolve within a couple of days but might last longer, sometimes for several weeks. Neck pain could also wax and wane, becoming worse again with sudden movement, stress or bad sleep. The most common signs and symptoms of a stiff neck include: trouble moving the neck without pain (especially when rotating the head side to side or rolling the neck down and toward the chest) loss of range of motion, including difficulty placing the chin on the chest (many flexibility tests advise you to rotate your neck to check for range of motion; you should be able to rotate the head approximately 90 degrees and to bend the neck approximately 45 degrees to the side) Wondering if your stiff neck is more than just an inconvenience and something to truly worry about? While there are some circumstances in which a stiff neck can be a symptom of a more serious, underlying health issue (such as an infection), the majority of the time this isn’t the case. Most episodes of short-term (acute) neck pains or neck stiffness are caused by muscle strains, sudden movements to the spine or head, stress, and muscle tension caused by other issues. () The most common causes of a stiff neck (or other neck pains) include: fast, usually repetitive movements of the cervical spine, such as during exercise, lifting objects around the house, or when driving and jerking the neck suddenly muscle strains around the neck and shoulders; these are most often caused by poor posture that affects the cervical spine (including while working, holding the neck in an abnormal position to talk on the phone, when reading or doing leisurely activities, exercising, or sleeping) () underlying cervical problems: including /herniated disc, cervical degenerative disc disease, osteoarthritis/, or bone spurs high levels of stress or anxiety; this causes increased muscle tension and inflammation, plus  itself often causes it to worsen! high levels of inflammation caused by a combination of a , poor diet, smoking and toxin exposure in some cases, underlying health conditions that cause an inflammatory response, like infections such as or rarer neurologic diseases like ,  and posterior fossa tumors can cause a stiff neck. () Other symptoms such as a high fever, headaches, persistent along the spine, nausea or vomiting, and fatigue/sleepiness mean you should consult your doctor to rule out other conditions. Poor posture affects how the spine and neck muscles work. Straining in the neck muscles is by far the most common cause of a stiff neck. Neck pain often develops from pulling certain muscles abruptly, soft tissue sprains, slouching and injuries to the levator scapula muscle (a thin muscle located at the back and side of the neck, just below the upper part of the ). () The levator scapula muscle is responsible for connecting the upper part of the shoulders to the top of the cervical spine. It’s specifically controlled by the cervical nerves numbered “C3 and C4” and helps rotate the head from side to side, plus tilts the head backward or forward by raising or lowering the shoulders. Poor posture (hunching or slouching) is one of the leading contributors to sprains or strains in the muscles around the neck. The neck muscles can easily become stiff if posture is poor over a period of time and the cervical curve is impacted (which is responsible for the vertebrae of the neck). This is known as “forward head posture,” which pulls the entire spine out of alignment and leads to many painful symptoms. Some of the most common reasons forward head posture develops? Often the heavy use of handheld devices, such as cell phones, portable video games, laptops and tablets/e-readers, causes a person to gaze down slightly and strain muscles that hold the head. Sleeping on a pillow that is too high or too flat or that doesn’t support your head can also twist the neck and cause you to wake up with stiffness. Poor posture, or , not only contributes to stiff necks, but can also cause many other symptoms that reduce someone’s quality of life: fatigue, headaches, trouble breathing/asthma due to compression of the lungs, disc compression/bulging discs, (pain of the jaw), altered blood flow, , digestive problems due to oxygen deficits and even fibromyalgia. () Improper posture also triggers stiff necks because it can contributes to torn or ruptured discs, a condition that causes the cushiony material inside the disc to leak out and press against a nerve of the spinal cord. In addition to stiff necks, this can cause headaches, dizziness and shoulder pain. () Psychological stress is another factor that negatively affects overall health status and often causes muscle pains. The levator scapulae muscle raises the shoulders and works statically in times of stress, since the shoulders respond to emotional and physical tension, increasing straining on the neck. The stress response (often referred to as the ““) is activated even without us knowing when we feel emotionally disturbed, causing the body’s muscles to tighten in an attempt to protect the body from harm. Neck pains, stiffness or tension can follow an episode of nervousness, anxiety, fear, fatigue and elevated stress — but whatever you don’t try to “crack” or roll the neck to solve this, since this can make the problem worse. () Studies show that stiff necks and shoulders are major somatic complaints among hard-working, adults (including many sleep-deprived Japanese workers who report low qualities of life and often show above-normal levels of stress hormones). One study looked at the connection between perceived stress and stiff neck and shoulders and found that perceived stress led to both mental impairments in quality of life and also physical complaints. () Final Thoughts on Stiff Neck Causes & Natural Treatments While definitely a pain, a stiff neck is usually the result of straining or overusing your neck muscles. Luckily, lifestyle adjustments and natural remedies can go a long way in soothing a stiff neck. Go-to, drug-free stiff neck remedies include converting to a side-sleeping position, adopting an anti-inflammatory diet, exercising, visiting a chiropractor and correcting posture. Chronic stress, fast, repetitive movements, spending too much time looking down down at a screen and underlying back problems are all common causes of a stiff neck.

Learn more about our process Based in Los Angeles, Sleepgram was founded in 2016 with the goal of producing affordably priced premium products. The company’s initial focus was its flagship product, the Sleepgram Pillow. The product line has since expanded to include other sleep accessories, including a knee pillow, weighted blanket, and other bedding. We’ll focus on the Sleepgram Pillow, which has a unique three-in-one design. Two separate inserts can be used independently within an outer cover for a soft or medium feel, or they can be combined for a firm feel. The inserts contain polyester microfiber fill engineered to replicate the fluffy softness of down. The washable cover consists of cotton with a polyester fabric lining, crafted to resist allergens and bacteria. We’ll examine the Sleepgram Pillow’s construction, performance, pricing, and policies to help you decide whether this customizable option is right for you. Use this SleepFoundation.org link for the most current discount on the Sleepgram pillows The Sleepgram Pillow stands out with a customizable design that allows owners to adjust its firmness level and loft. Since it offers flexibility, most sleepers are likely to rest comfortably on at least one of the three firmness levels. This may make it an excellent fit for sleepers who are unsure of their ideal firmness and those whose preferences may change over time. While it’s rare to find a pillow that excels in all performance categories, the Sleepgram Pillow earns solid marks across the board. These factors impact the comfort, durability, and value of a pillow, and the Sleepgram’s ratings indicate that it should perform well in the areas that often matter most to sleepers. Additionally, Sleepgram has customer-friendly policies, including a 100-day sleep trial and a lifetime warranty. If you’re unsure if the pillow is right for you or you’re concerned about durability, these policies may give you extra peace of mind. Overall, this pillow is a strong option for virtually any sleeper, regardless of their sleep position, weight, and personal preferences. The Sleepgram Pillow features a cotton cover with polyester microfiber fill. The three-in-one design results in an adjustable loft and firmness that makes it customizable to the sleeper’s needs. Both standard/queen and king sizes are available. typically average between $20 and $30, with high-quality options frequently costing close to $80 or more. The Sleepgram falls toward the higher end of this price range. It acts as three pillows in one with separate components to allow owners to adjust the feel. As a result, it may offer a better value than many lower-priced models. Price differences between pillows are typically a result of their materials and construction. The added materials and complexity of the Sleepgram Pillow’s three-in-one design may justify the higher price-point for some shoppers. Sleepgram also offers frequent promotions, along with discounts if you purchase multiple pillows at a time. While customers may purchase a lower-priced pillow to save money initially, higher-priced options may be a better investment in the long run if they are more durable. Each pillow performs differently based on its materials, construction, and quality. Customers often look for certain traits in a pillow, and judging a model based on these factors can help you find the best option for you. Our testers awarded the Sleepgram Pillow high scores across most of our performance categories, reflecting its broad appeal, well-rounded features, and flexible design. The Sleepgram’s greatest strengths may be its moldability and lack of odor. Its plush fill is easy to manipulate into the position of your choice, and the polyester and cotton construction should be virtually free of odors. Temperature control is the Sleepgram’s biggest drawback, as polyester may retain some heat. However, the cotton cover is designed to help keep the surface a more comfortable temperature, and this layer should be breathable enough to allow some heat to dissipate. The Sleepgram Pillow has a durable construction that should give it an average lifespan of at least 2 to 3 years. The outer cover of the Sleepgram Pillow can be washed to reduce the buildup of dust mites, and the pillow can be fluffed to help it retain its loft. That said, polyester microfiber fill has a tendency to flatten over time, especially with continued use. With three firmness variations in just one pillow, versatility is one of the Sleepgram’s greatest strengths. There are two inserts: one with a soft feel and one with a medium feel. They can be used separately within the cover, or placed together for a firm feel. This allows owners to change the firmness of their pillow as often as they like. Like most down alternative pillows, the Sleepgram should regain its shape when you fluff it. While the fill could bunch or flatten over time, the three-part construction enables owners to revise their configuration and fluff each insert separately if the pillow starts to lose its shape. The Sleepgram’s down alternative polyester microfiber fill is highly moldable. Sleepers should be able to fluff or bunch the pillow to get the shape and feel they prefer. Its three-in-one design provides additional flexibility since you can simply add or remove inserts to alter the feel of the pillow. The plush microfiber fill mimics the feel of down, with similar cushioning properties. Sleepers shouldn’t expect a close hug like that of a memory foam pillow. Instead, the Sleepgram has a cloudlike fluffiness that gently cradles the head and neck. The Sleepgram Pillow may not be particularly cooling, but it should remain a comfortable temperature for most sleepers. Its temperature-regulating properties come from its outer layer, which is constructed of breathable cotton. This helps air circulate throughout the pillow. However, the inserts may retain some heat because of their polyester fill. The Sleepgram has little to no odor, so it may be ideal for sleepers who are sensitive to smells. Since the outer layer is machine-washable, you can freshen up the surface as needed. This can help prevent odors from developing over time. The Sleepgram Pillow can be adjusted to have a soft, medium, or firm feel. Users can use one or both inserts with the outer cover to adjust the overall loft and firmness. As a result, the Sleepgram Pillow can accommodate most sleep positions and body types. usually need a thicker, firmer pillow than those who favor other sleep positions. For proper spinal alignment, the pillow loft should be approximately equivalent to the width of the shoulder so that it fills the area between the bed and the neck without forcing the head too far upward. The Sleepgram Pillow’s adjustability makes it especially appropriate for side sleepers from all weight groups. Those who weigh under 230 pounds may get the support they need from the medium insert, but some individuals may benefit from using both inserts for more firmness and loft. With both inserts in use, the firm Sleepgram should offer support for side sleepers who weigh over 230 pounds. Back sleepers usually need a low to medium loft pillow to help keep their spines aligned. A pillow that is too thin could put pressure on the neck and exacerbate , while one that is too thick may force the chin up towards the chest and lead to neck discomfort. Since the Sleepgram Pillow is adjustable, most should be able to find a configuration that is comfortable for them. Individuals who weigh under 230 pounds may prefer to use the soft insert, while back sleepers who weigh more than 230 pounds could comfortably use any of three options. : Using a pillow that is too thick could tilt a stomach sleeper’s head at an uncomfortable angle and strain their neck. Many use a thin pillow or no pillow at all. With all three pieces combined, the Sleepgram Pillow will be too thick and firm for the vast majority of stomach sleepers. However, using the soft insert alone should provide a bit of plushness without so much loft as to put significant pressure on the neck.

Learn more about our process Back sleeping is the second most common sleeping position behind side sleeping. When searching for the best mattresses for back sleepers, proper spine alignment is probably the most crucial factor. In order to achieve this, a mattress must provide support to the hips and shoulders without putting too much pressure on them. Thus, an even sleep surface with some conforming but no sagging is usually the best bed for back sleepers. To provide ideal support for back sleepers, a mattress must have the right firmness — and sleepers of different body types tend to have different requirements. Average-weight back sleepers often favor a medium to medium-firm feel. Lightweight individuals may prefer a softer option, while heavyweight sleepers often appreciate a firmer model. With so many mattresses to choose from, selecting the best mattress for your sleep needs and preferences can seem complicated. In this guide, we’ll try to simplify the shopping process by sharing our top picks for the best mattresses for back sleepers and explaining criteria that can affect a back sleeper’s comfort.  Soft (2-3), Medium Firm (6), Firm (7-8)  Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, Split King, California King, Split Cal King Individuals who want to select the firmness and thickness of their mattress Dual-coil system and foam lumbar enhancement support proper spinal alignment Advanced hybrid design balances support and pressure relief Get $200 off when you spend $1,000 or more at Saatva.com The Saatva is a hybrid mattress with a dual coil system, foam comfort layers and a plush-pillow top. The bed comes in three firmness options, which can accommodate back sleepers of different weights.While back sleepers usually favor a medium or medium-firm feel, this varies between weight groups. The Saatva’s hybrid design balances support and pressure relief. A Euro pillow top with an organic cotton cover uses polyfoam to cushion the surface of the bed. A thin layer of memory foam near the midsection of the bed cradles and supports the sleeper’s hips. A layer of pocketed coils within the comfort system contours to the sleeper’s body without restricting airflow. Since the coils are individually pocketed, very little motion is transferred between them, minimizing disruptions to co-sleepers. Finally, a layer of Bonnell coils acts as the mattress’s support core. These coils give the mattress bounce and stable support. The Saatva comes in three firmness options: soft (2-3), medium-firm (6), and firm (7-8). It also comes in two thickness options: 11.5 inches and 14.5 inches. Since back sleepers often favor firmer mattresses, Saatva’s firm option may be a particularly good match for back sleepers who weigh over 130 pounds. Sleepers under 130 pounds may prefer the soft or medium-firm model for extra conforming. The Saatva Mattress comes with free White Glove delivery, in which a team comes to unpackage and setup the mattress. Saatva also provides a 180-night trial period and a 15-year warranty for the Saatva Mattress.  Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King People who are easily awoken by noise or motion transfer when their sleep partner changes position Medium-firm, all-foam construction is well suited to back sleepers Phase change material cover helps to dissipate body heat, keeping the mattress cool Get 35% off a Cocoon Chill Mattress with code: SLEEPFOUND35 The all-foam Cocoon Chill conforms closely to the sleeper’s body, relieving pressure while supporting a back sleeper’s natural spinal alignment. The mattress’s construction also gives it exceptional motion isolation, temperature regulation, and noise control. The Cocoon Chill’s mattress cover uses phase change material, which is engineered to dissipate heat while remaining cool to the touch. While all-foam mattresses frequently trap heat against the sleeper’s body, this innovative cover helps the Cocoon Chill sleep cooler than most all-foam mattresses on the market. A memory foam comfort layer adjusts to the sleeper’s body shape and position. This can help relieve pressure while providing a comfortable hugging feeling that many sleepers enjoy. Next, a layer of polyfoam prevents the sleeper from sinking in against the support core. The support layer uses firm polyfoam crafted to provide a durable base for the mattress. The Cocoon Chill comes in two firmness options: medium-soft (4) and medium-firm (6). The medium-firm version has a particularly good balance of support and conforming for back sleepers, especially those who weigh under 230 pounds. Sealy provides a 100-night trial and 10-year limited warranty for the Cocoon Chill.  Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King Gel-infused memory foam and cooling cover prevent overheating The Bear Hybrid stays temperature neutral due to its coil layer and cover material. Eight inches of pocketed coils allows for airflow through the mattress all night. The cover is made with Celliant fibers, which absorb body heat. In addition to keeping sleepers cool, Celliant fibers are thought to transform body heat into infrared energy, which is then transmitted back to the sleeper to aid in physical recovery. Medium-firm is the only firmness level the Bear Hybrid mattress is available in. As a result, this mattress tends to work better for light and average-weight sleepers. Sleepers who weigh over 230 lbs. might find that the Bear Hybrid doesn’t provide them enough support. The Bear Hybrid is a quiet mattress, but it doesn’t isolate motion as well as some all-foam mattresses. The motion transfer won’t bother most sleepers, but very sensitive sleepers who share a bed might be aware that they can feel motion when their partner moves. This mattress has above-average durability, so it should last for several years. Customers can order the Bear Hybrid online. The mattress ships to all 50 US states for free and comes with a 100-night sleep trial and 20-year partially prorated warranty. Customers may opt for white glove delivery and old mattress removal, but both come with a fee. Anyone wanting to return or exchange their Bear Hybrid under the sleep trial must wait until after a 30-night break-in period.  Soft (4), Medium (6), Firm (7), Plus (8)  Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King Couples who want a springy surface without a lot of motion transfer Reinforced midsection prevents sagging around the hips and lumbar Tencel cover and coil system help keep the mattress cool With four firmness options, the WinkBed can closely match the needs and preferences of most back sleepers, regardless of their weight group. Back sleepers who weigh under 130 pounds might gravitate towards the medium-soft or medium-firm options. Back sleepers who weigh between 130 and 230 pounds may prefer the firm version. Back sleepers who weigh over 230 pounds may find the firm or the Plus most comfortable. The firmness options are medium-soft (4), medium-firm (6), firm (7-8), and Plus (7-8). While the medium-soft, medium-firm, and firm mattresses share similar constructions, the Plus varies in several key areas. All the firmness options share a few features. A Tencel cover wicks away heat to help the sleeper stay cool and comfortable. A reinforced midsection promotes better spinal alignment by preventing excessive sagging around the midsection. To accomplish this, a foam enhancement adds support to the lumbar region, and the coil support core is zoned to be sturdier around the hips. The coils are also pocketed to limit motion transfer while allowing air circulation. This coil support layer also creates an exceptionally stable edge, which may allow sleepers to use more of the mattress surface. The three softest models of the WinkBed use a comfort system constructed of three main layers: a layer of polyfoam, a layer of gel polyfoam, and a layer of pocketed microcoils. This system balances conforming and breathability. The Plus option uses a comfort system of a layer of high-density polyfoam and a layer of latex to contour to the sleeper’s body without excessive sinkage. This design lends to the mattress’s durability, resisting impressions more than many sleep surfaces. Additionally, the individually-pocketed coils are banded together in groups of four to bolster the mattress’s support. The WinkBeds provides a lifetime warranty and a 120-night sleep trial with the WinkBed Mattress.  Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King Adaptive polyfoam provides excellent contouring, without the “sink” of memory foam Open-cell polyfoam improves breathability and airflow Progressive support system adds extra support where it’s needed most Use this SleepFoundation.org link for the most current discount on the Tuft & Needle mattresses Our next top pick for back sleepers is the Mint Mattress from Tuft & Needle. This model is constructed with 5 inches of adaptive polyfoam over a support core of high-density polyfoam. Polyfoam contours to the body without sinking like memory foam, so back sleepers can lie on the material without feeling loss of support beneath the lower back, waist, and other areas of the body where people tend to carry a disproportionate amount of weight. The Mint Mattress offers a medium firm (6) feel, so back sleepers who weigh up to 230 pounds should feel adequately supported. The mattress delivers good contouring and spinal alignment for side sleepers, as well. The top two layers of the mattress consist of open-cell polyfoam that has been infused with graphite. As a result, the mattress sleeps fairly cool – especially compared to other all-foam models – and should be comfortable for people who tend to run hot in bed. We also recommend the Mint Mattress to couples because the foams absorb movement and prevent too much motion from spreading across the surface, minimizing disturbances for co-sleepers. The antimicrobial protection embedded into the cover fabric is a unique feature that’s designed to ensure a long lifespan for the mattress. While slightly more expensive than Tuft & Needle’s flagship model, the Mint Mattress still carries a reasonable price-point. The company provides free ground shipping within the contiguous U.S., and backs the mattress with a 100-night sleep trial and a 10-year warranty.

It uses a flippable design that allows sleepers to select between a firm and an extra-firm side. This may appeal to back sleepers looking for an even, stable sleep surface. Both sides of the mattress use a quilted top for cushioning. While the firm side uses a thicker quilted layer, the extra-firm side pairs a thin quilted layer with a layer of polyfoam for deeper support and less cushioning. A high-density support core reinforces the mattress and stabilizes both the firm and the extra-firm sleep surfaces. Because of the mattress’s firmness and lack of conforming, it does not retain as much heat as most all-foam models. However, people who tend to sleep hot may benefit from an optional cooling top panel that’s available for an extra charge. This cooling panel uses phase change material engineered to cool on contact to further dissipate heat and promote a cool night’s sleep. The Plank’s firm side rates between 7 and 8 on the 10-point firmness scale, while the extra-firm side rates between 9 and 10. This rating makes the Plank one of the firmest mattresses on the market. Because the Plank is exceptionally firm, it may be best suited to back sleepers who weigh over 130 pounds. Most sleepers will likely favor the firm side of the mattress, though some sleepers who weigh over 230 pounds may prefer the added support of the extra-firm side. Brooklyn Bedding offers a 10-year warranty and a 120-night trial period for the Plank Mattress.  Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King People who prefer the feeling of sleeping “on” a mattress to sleeping “in” a mattress Bouncy, responsive feel of latex combines with deep support of zoned coil system Above-average durability, and a 25-year limited warranty Use this SleepFoundation.org link for the most current discount on the Avocado mattresses The Avocado Mattress is a hybrid model that pairs latex and pocketed coils to create a bouncy, resilient surface that cradles back sleepers while preventing them from sinking in too deeply. The mattress cover contains organic cotton and wool, which help regulate temperature by wicking heat and moisture away from the sleeper’s body. A vegan version of the mattress replaces the wool with additional cotton. The Avocado’s comfort layer uses natural Dunlop latex, which conforms moderately. A pillow-top version of the mattress adds an extra layer of Dunlop latex to soften the surface and add extra cushioning and pressure relief. A support layer of pocketed coils gives the mattress more bounce while permitting air circulation making for a cool and responsive mattress. This layer is zoned with extra support under the midsection to promote better spinal alignment for back sleepers. The edge is also reinforced, which may enable sleepers to use the full surface of the mattress without feeling like they might roll off. A final base layer of latex supports the coil system. The Avocado Mattress is firm, rating between 7 and 8 on the firmness scale. The pillow-top version has a medium-firm feel, rating around 6. The Avocado Mattress can provide exceptional support for back sleepers who weigh over 130 pounds. Back sleepers who weigh less than 130 pounds may prefer the added cushioning of the pillow-top version. A 25-year limited warranty and a one-year trial period come with the Avocado Mattress.  Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King Couples looking for a balance of bounce and motion isolation Hybrid design offers conforming with minimal sinkage Balanced construction with coils and dual-layer comfort system Medium-firm feel is well suited to a variety of sleepers Get 15% off a Leesa Mattress with code: SLEEPFOUNDATION The Leesa Hybrid pairs a dual-layer comfort system with a pocketed coil support core to create a balanced feel with bounce, pressure relief, and contouring that can help promote proper alignment for back sleepers. The two-part comfort system starts with a layer of polyfoam. This foam conforms to the sleeper’s body, while holes throughout the surface allow body heat to dissipate. Next, a layer of memory foam contours more deeply to relieve pressure in the shoulders and hips. A polyfoam transition layer prevents the sleepers from sinking into the mattress’s core. The support layer is constructed of pocketed coils. Since these coils can move independently, they provide more targeted support and transfer minimal motion between coils, minimizing sleep disruptions. The coil layer also gives the Leesa Hybrid a bouncier, more responsive feel. Finally, another layer of polyfoam acts as the base of the mattress. The Leesa Hybrid has a medium-firm feel, rating at a 6 on the firmness scale. This firmness can provide most back sleepers with a balance of support and conforming, but it is especially appropriate for sleepers who weigh under 230 pounds. A 100-night trial and a 10-year limited warranty come with the Leesa Hybrid. A person’s sleep position not only plays a role in whether or not you wake up with aches and pains, but can influence your health and likelihood of medical conditions. Back sleeping isn’t the most common sleep position in the United States, but it has some distinct benefits. When sleeping on your back, your body is naturally centered over your spine, which makes it easier to maintain proper spinal alignment. reports that back sleeping may also reduce the risk of developing wrinkles or breakouts on your skin and can alleviate lower back pain for some sleepers. While back sleeping has some clear benefits, it isn’t ideal for all sleepers. Those who suffer from sleep apnea or are prone to snoring may find their conditions aggravated by sleeping on their backs. People who suffer from acid reflux or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) may also notice increased symptoms when sleeping on their back, especially for sleepers with stomach fat that puts extra pressure on their stomachs. Additionally, pregnant women often find that sleeping on their backs can contribute to back pain due to the extra weight in their midsections. Spinal alignment refers to how well the spine lines up to its natural shape. When you’re standing, proper spinal alignment is synonymous to good posture. In sleepers, a well-aligned spine is harder to spot, but it’s just as important. Maintaining good spinal alignment overnight can help reduce aches and pains, contributing to a better night’s sleep. Because of this, the suggests that regardless of sleep position, sleepers should try to line up their ears, shoulders, and hips to maintain proper spinal alignment. Back sleepers have an advantage when it comes to spinal alignment. A back sleeper’s body is already centered over their spine. So long as a mattress provides enough support to the shoulders and mid-section, preventing them from sinking to deepy, back sleepers should be able to maintain this healthy alignment. Improper alignment can contribute to aches and pains. If a mattress does not balance contouring and support to help the sleeper maintain proper alignment through the night, their muscles may work overtime to try to improve the body’s alignment. Since these muscles can’t fully relax, the sleeper may awaken with more aches and pains. If you’re not sure whether your mattress is giving you the right combination of contouring and support to promote good alignment, consider whether you are waking up with aches and pains. If you wake up with aches and pains that get better over the course of the day, your mattress may not be giving you the support and contouring you need. The right mattress can help you maintain proper spinal alignment effortlessly and awaken with fewer aches and pains. Which Mattress Firmness is Best for Back Sleepers? A mattress’s firmness can affect how comfortable the mattress feels to an individual, how much contouring it provides, and how supportive it is. A 10-point firmness scale is commonly used to rate mattress firmness. In this scale, 1 is the softest mattress and 10 is the firmest. Mattresses on either end of the spectrum are uncommon, with most models falling between 3 and 8. When you’re shopping for a mattress, paying attention to its firmness rating can give you a better idea of how it will feel to you. Most individuals between 130 and 230 pounds prefer a medium or medium-firm mattress. Average-weight back sleepers usually gravitate towards the firmer end of this range since they do not require as much conforming as side sleepers. Sleepers who weigh under 130 pounds do not apply as much force on a mattress, so any mattress is likely to feel firmer to them. Because of this, back sleepers in this range often prefer a medium-soft model. Individuals who weigh over 230 pounds need more support than other weight groups. Too soft of a mattress may cause their hips to sink in excessively, misaligning the spine. These sleepers frequently favor a medium-firm or firm mattress to give them extra support. Comfort preference is subjective, and it’s impossible to guess how a mattress will feel to an individual. However, understanding firmness ratings and which rating tends to work best for your weight group and sleep position can give you an excellent starting point to finding the ideal firmness for you. Below, we’ll describe the major types of mattresses on the market and explain what they have to offer back sleepers. While individual models may have notable differences based on their materials, quality, and construction, there tend to be some similarities between models of the same type of mattress. Understanding the key benefits and features that are common for each type of mattress may clarify which type is best for you. Hybrid models fuse components of two or more other mattress types. The comfort layer most often consists of memory foam, polyfoam, or latex, though it may also contain wool, microcoils, or other materials. A hybrid mattress’s support core uses coils, like a traditional innerspring mattress. A hybrid mattress’s comfort layer is generally engineered to conform to the sleeper’s body for pressure relief. The coil support core usually gives even support, which can help promote proper spinal alignment for back sleepers. A substantial support core of coils serves as the main component of an innerspring mattress. Innerspring models may also have thin comfort layers. While these comfort layers may provide some cushioning, they usually are not substantial enough for contouring and pressure relief. High-quality innerspring mattresses usually have even support that can help keep a back sleeper’s spine straight. Thin comfort layers may cushion the sleeper’s pressure points, but they generally are not thick enough to allow a back sleeper’s midsection to sink in too deeply. Latex mattresses are traditionally constructed of multiple layers of latex foam, which may be natural, synthetic, or a blend. Talalay latex is usually lighter and springier. It is commonly used in comfort layers. Dunlop latex is generally denser and more durable, making it a popular choice for both comfort and support layers. While memory foam compresses directly beneath the sleeper’s body, latex spreads the compression over a wider area. This cradles the sleeper without excessive sinkage, creating a balance between cradling and support that may make back sleepers feel like they are floating on the bed. Airbeds get their name from the air chambers they use to support the sleeper. Depending on the model, these air chambers can be emptied or filled using a pump, remote control, or app. Airbeds may also include comfort layers, though these are usually relatively thin. Comfort layer materials may include memory foam, polyfoam, latex, wool, and/or cotton. Since the air chambers can be filled or emptied to change the feel of the mattress, back sleepers can adjust an airbed to get as close as possible to their ideal firmness. Some models also allow sleepers to adjust each side of the bed independently, which may make them a good choice for partners who have different firmness preferences. Most foam mattresses are constructed of multiple foam layers, which usually include memory foam, polyfoam, or a combination of the two. Some foam mattresses may also include other materials, including latex, wool, and/or cotton. Softer foams are traditionally used in the comfort layers to contour to the sleeper, while firmer support foams prevent them from sinking in too deeply. All-foam models tend to shape to the sleeper’s body, providing a close hug that relieves pressure points. Firmer models give less hug, but they still usually contour enough for pressure relief. Back sleepers who like to sink into their mattress more may appreciate this close conforming. Accessories can be the finishing touch to make your sleep surface more comfortable. The right accessories can help reduce discomfort and promote quality sleep. While you might upgrade your accessories when you purchase a new mattress, sleepers on a budget may replace them as a lower-cost alternative to replacing their mattress. While the right mattress can keep most of the spine aligned, the sleeper’s pillow is responsible for continuing that alignment into the neck and head. Because sleepers rely on their pillow to support their necks and heads, the wrong pillow can contribute to back and neck pain. Pillow loft refers to how thick a pillow is. A pillow with too much loft may force a back sleeper’s head towards their chest. A pillow with too little loft may hyperextend the neck. frequently benefit from a medium-loft pillow that supports the head, neck, and shoulders without lifting them up too far. Back sleepers often prefer memory foam or latex pillows that cradle the head to help them maintain proper alignment. While many back sleepers favor a medium-loft pillow, those with medical conditions aggravated by lying flat may prefer a wedge pillow to elevate the upper body. Sleepers who suffer from sleep apnea, acid reflux, or frequent snoring may benefit from this extra lift. Many back sleepers also place a small pillow beneath their knees. suggests that this may help relieve back pain by supporting the natural curvature of the back and reducing stress on the spine. A mattress topper is an extra layer that rests on top of the mattress to adjust the feel of the surface. While a mattress topper won’t completely overhaul your existing mattress, it may make it more comfortable. Because mattress toppers are usually less expensive than purchasing a new mattress, they can be a convenient and affordable way to modify the sleep surface and try out different materials. Memory foam, polyfoam, and latex toppers can give you an idea of how a mattress that uses these materials might feel without the commitment of replacing your existing mattress. Thickness varies between toppers. Thinner toppers can offer some cushioning, slightly adjusting the feel of the mattress. Thicker toppers modify the feel more significantly and can relieve pressure to a greater extent. While mattress toppers can add some cushioning and contouring, they do not provide all the benefits of a new mattress. Most notably, they do not usually provide significant support. If a back sleeper’s hips are sinking in too deeply in their existing mattress, a mattress topper is unlikely to resolve the issue. A mattress topper also will not make up for a mattress that is in bad condition or is sagging. However, a mattress topper may be a good choice for back sleepers who feel their mattress is a little too firm or who are experiencing pressure points. What Mattress Features Are Important For Back Sleepers? While many mattress companies claim their models are comfortable for all sleep positions, back sleepers have unique needs. Focusing on the most important mattress features can help you find a mattress that supports your spine while cushioning your pressure points. Below, we’ll detail key factors to consider when selecting the best mattress for back sleepers. The build of the mattress can influence how it feels, how much it contours to the body, and how well it supports spinal alignment. Each type of mattress has different potential benefits and drawbacks. Understanding how these constructions influence the feel of a mattress may make it easier to find a model that provides enough support and contouring for your body type. Many mattresses contour to the body, adjusting to each sleeper’s unique shape. This can help support a back sleeper’s spinal alignment while relieving pressure points. Mattresses vary in how much contouring they provide, and sleepers differ in the level of contouring they prefer. Quality materials may impact how comfortable a mattress feels and how well it holds up over time. Mattress sagging is often a problem for back sleepers, and high-quality materials frequently resist sagging better than lower-quality alternatives. A mattress’s firmness influences how much the sleeper sinks in. Back sleepers often favor slightly firmer mattresses than their side-sleeping counterparts. This is because back sleepers require enough support to maintain the natural alignment of their spines. Too soft of a mattress may cause a back sleeper’s hips to sink in too far, while too firm of a mattress may not allow their hips to sink in far enough. Pressure relief is closely linked to contouring. When a mattress contours to a sleeper’s body, it distributes their weight more evenly. This can take the pressure off heavier body parts, like the hips and shoulders. While back sleepers do not usually suffer from as sharp of pressure points as side sleepers, they may still appreciate a mattress that cradles their hips.

Learn more about our process Hip pain is a common concern that can affect the quality and comfort of sleep. Discomfort can stem from a wide range of issues, including arthritis, bursitis, tendinitis, injuries, and more. If you’re suffering from hip pain, you should consult a doctor for a diagnosis and treatment options. However, if your hip discomfort is worse when you wake up in the morning, your mattress could be a contributing factor. A pressure-relieving, supportive bed may help improve and comfort for a more restful night. If your mattress is sagging or otherwise damaged, replacing it may be a good option. However, a new mattress can be pricey, and this expense may be difficult to justify if your bed is still in good condition. A mattress topper can adjust your sleep surface at a fraction of the cost. Toppers act as extra comfort layers that sit on top of the bed to change its feel. For many individuals, this modification may help reduce hip discomfort. How a topper will affect your hip pain may depend on the causes of your discomfort, the firmness of your existing mattress, and your sleep position, among other factors. We’ll break down important aspects to consider when deciding if a mattress topper is right for you. We’ll also highlight some of the best options on the market today. Best Overall – Most Support –  Best Value – Best Pressure Relief – Breathable design and gel-infused memory foam for cooling Use this SleepFoundation.org link for the most current discount on the Viscosoft mattress toppers Combining affordability and comfort, the ViscoSoft Select High Density Mattress Topper may be an excellent budget-friendly option for hip pain sufferers looking for pressure relief. This 3-inch thick topper uses memory foam that feels simultaneously plush, dense, and supportive. The foam absorbs motion while remaining whisper-quiet to reduce nighttime disturbances when one partner moves. The gel infusion is intended to transfer heat away from the sleeper, while perforations help circulate air so that the heat can dissipate. A bamboo rayon cover further helps with temperature regulation. This material is breathable, moisture-wicking, and quick-drying to stay cool and comfortable. A mesh bottom panel allows additional airflow while preventing slippage. Corner straps also help anchor the topper in place. Owners can remove and machine wash the cover to keep the sleep surface clean. The Select High Density Mattress Topper has a medium feel that rates around 5 on the 10-point firmness scale. This firmness level should accommodate most sleepers, including partners with different body types and position preferences. However, it may be most comfortable for individuals who weigh between 130 and 230 pounds and back sleepers. Side sleepers who weigh under 130 pounds may prefer a bit more plushness. Pressure relief, temperature regulation, motion isolation, and noise control are some of the Select High Density Mattress Topper’s greatest strengths. That said, it lacks the bounce couples often prefer for amorous activity. Shoppers can select between the six standard mattress sizes, in addition to queen short. The Select High Density Mattress Topper comes with a 60-day return policy and a 3-year limited warranty. Use this SleepFoundation.org link for the most current discount on the Molecule mattress toppers Thanks to the Molecule AirTEC Mattress Topper’s advanced materials, ample airflow helps keep the sleep surface cool despite the topper’s close-conforming pressure relief. This topper uses a unique three-layer design. Combined, these layers total 3 inches thick. The top layer uses 1 inch of MolecularFlo memory foam that molds to the body like traditional memory foam to take pressure off the hips and shoulders. However, this material is engineered to have more airflow than traditional memory foam, which helps heat dissipate even when the topper is compressed. Next, a 1-inch layer of AirTEC adds air circulation through its matrix of open cells. It is crafted to replicate the buoyancy and responsiveness of latex while enhancing pressure relief for heavier parts of the body, like the hips. The final layer uses 1 inch of RecoveryFlo polyfoam to support proper spinal alignment and limit sinkage. The cover contains a blend of polyester, polyethylene, and elastane. Cooling fibers within the material are designed to help regulate the temperature by conducting heat away from the sleeper. With its medium (5) feel, the Molecule AirTEC Mattress Topper should accommodate most weight groups and sleep positions, but it may be especially comfortable for side sleepers. Stomach sleepers who weigh more than 230 pounds may struggle to maintain their spinal alignment due to the potential for sinkage around their hips and abdomens. The Molecule AirTEC Mattress Topper earns high marks for its conforming properties, temperature regulation, motion isolation, and noise control. While it has a more buoyant feel than many memory foam toppers, some couples may still prefer a more responsive surface for sex. The Molecule AirTEC Mattress Topper is CertiPUR-US certified. It comes with a 30-night trial period and a 5-year limited warranty.  Body sensors and Active Grid temperature control system Those who enjoy the contouring of their current mattress Advanced temperature control system uses water to heat and cool mattress surface Each side of the topper can be controlled individually Use this SleepFoundation.org link for the most current discount on the Eight Sleep mattress toppers With subtle cushioning and high-tech temperature regulation, the Eight Sleep Pod Pro Cover can help you maintain your ideal body temperature without restricting the contouring of your mattress. The Eight Sleep Pod Pro Cover is not a topper that aims to adjust the firmness or contouring of your bed significantly. Instead, a thin layer of foam adds some cushioning, which could make a sleeper’s hips slightly more comfortable while still allowing them to enjoy the pressure-relieving properties of the bed below. Instead, temperature regulation is the topper’s main feature. A hub for water comes with the topper. To adjust the temperature of the sleep surface, the owner activates the hub to send water through a thin contouring layer. Each side of the topper is a separate zone so that partners can set different temperature preferences, which range from 55 to 110 degrees. To sense your current temperature and help you reach your ideal level, sensors within the topper track your biometrics. Owners can download the accompanying app to adjust their temperature settings, track their sleep time, review their heart and respiratory rates, and more. This topper acts as mattress encasement, meaning it covers both the top and bottom of the bed. A zipper connects the top and bottom components, and adjustable straps allow owners to finetune the fit by tightening the cover as needed. It should accommodate mattresses between 10 and 16 inches thick. Shoppers can select between full, queen, king, and California king sizes. The Eight Sleep Pod Pro Cover is returnable within the first 30 days, and a 2-year warranty protects the purchase. Those who awaken easily when their partner moves during the night Sleepers looking for both pressure relief and support Use this SleepFoundation.org link for the most current discount on the Tempur-Pedic mattress toppers The Tempur-Pedic TEMPUR-Topper Supreme combines pressure relief and spinal support to help cradle the hips without putting a strain on the spine. This balance comes from the topper’s 3 inches of proprietary TEMPUR memory foam, which was originally engineered by NASA. TEMPUR responds to heat, pressure, and shape to conform to the body and redistribute its weight, thereby taking pressure off critical areas like the hips. The topper is wrapped in a quilted polyester cover that is removable, washable, and designed to be resistant to allergens, dust mites, and mold. The TEMPUR-Topper Supreme’s medium (5) feel can add plushness to a mattress that’s too firm without skimping on the support. This makes it appropriate for virtually all weight groups and sleep positions, though stomach sleepers who weigh over 230 pounds may benefit from a firmer topper for extra support. Because of its notable contouring, the TEMPUR-Topper Supreme may be particularly suitable for side and back sleepers. Thanks to the high-quality TEMPUR material, the TEMPUR-Topper Supreme should be durable, conforming, motion isolating, and quiet. Like most memory foam, though, it could retain heat and lack the responsiveness couples usually prefer for sex. The TEMPUR-Topper Supreme comes with a 10-year limited warranty that protects against defects. Use this SleepFoundation.org link for the most current discount on the The Company Store Legends Hotel Ultimate Down Featherbed mattress toppers With gentle cushioning and a low price-point, the Company LoftAIRE Down Alternative Mattress Topper may appeal to hip pain sufferers on a budget. The Company LoftAIRE Down Alternative Mattress Topper consists of synthetic fill encased in a cotton shell. While it won’t have the hug of foam, the fluffy fill can add cloudlike cushioning to your bed. The topper is relatively thin, measuring approximately 1.25 inches thick. This should allow sleepers to enjoy the pressure relief of their existing mattress but with a more pillowy surface feel. The cotton shell is breathable, so heat can escape to help keep the sleeper cooler throughout the night. Since it cushions without significantly altering the feel of the bed, this topper should be comfortable for most sleepers regardless of their body type and position preferences, as long as their mattress balances pressure relief and support. The additional padding may be comfortable for those with hip pain, but if their mattress is much too firm, the light cushioning alone may not make a major impact. Unlike foam toppers, the Company LoftAIRE Down Alternative Mattress Topper can be machine washed and dried for a fresher sleep surface. It is available in twin, twin XL, full, queen, and king sizes. A 90-day trial period allows customers to try out the topper at home and return it should they decide it isn’t the best option for them. Owners can also take advantage of a lifetime guarantee that protects against defects, like stitching coming undone.  Medium Soft (Comfort) Medium Firm (Support) People who value both pressure relief and spinal support Extra support in targeted areas encourages spinal alignment Extra cushion around the hips and shoulders provides pressure relief Use this SleepFoundation.org link for the most current discount on the Amerisleep mattress toppers With zoned firmness levels for targeted support and softness, the Lift by Amerisleep Mattress Topper eases pressure around the hips while still supporting the spine. The Lift by Amerisleep Mattress Topper uses 3 inches of Bio-Pur memory foam. This material is specially engineered for greater breathability and responsiveness than traditional memory foam, while still providing its popular pressure-relieving hug and motion isolation. The enhanced airflow may make this topper better for hot sleepers than many memory foam options, while couples may appreciate the responsiveness for amorous activity. HIVE technology enhances the topper’s pressure relief and support. The topper features hundreds of hexagons that vary in their spacing to adjust the feel. Closely-spaced hexagons give the head, back, and feet extra support to help promote healthy spinal alignment, while the hexagons under the shoulders and hips are farther apart to let these key areas sink in for standout pressure relief. A breathable, soft-to-the-touch, zippered cover comes with the Lift by Amerisleep Mattress Topper. Special grip technology on the bottom of the cover is designed to help the topper stay put by using gentle friction that prevents shifting, without causing wear on the surface of the mattress. Two firmness options are available: Comfort and Support. The Comfort option has a medium soft (4) feel, while the Support model is medium firm (6). Side sleepers and those who weigh under 130 pounds will likely prefer the Comfort, while the Support may be more appropriate for stomach sleepers and those who weigh more than 230 pounds. Back sleepers and those who weigh between 130 and 230 pounds may enjoy either option depending on their personal preferences. A 5-year warranty protects against certain defects, including indentations over 0.75 inches deep. Whenever you modify your sleep surface, it’s important to find the right product to enhance the quality and comfort of your sleep. For those with hip pain, choosing the ideal items may be even more important. Some mattress toppers may ease your pain, while others could exacerbate it. The best mattress topper for hip pain should make your bed more comfortable without a full mattress replacement. Weighing the most important factors may help you find the right option for you. What to Consider When Purchasing a Mattress Topper for Hip Pain Many manufacturers may say that their toppers relieve pressure or ease discomfort, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that these options are ideal for your hip pain. Various factors can influence how a topper will feel to you. Focusing on specific criteria rather than marketing claims can help you hone in on the best model for your needs and preferences. Contouring may be particularly important to hip pain sufferers. Since the hips are often where more weight is concentrated, pressure can accumulate here when you lie down. A topper that molds to the sleeper’s shape helps distribute body weight to relieve pressure. While we don’t recommend making a purchasing decision based solely on price, it is an important factor to consider. Toppers are available at a wide range of price-points, so most customers will likely be able to find an option that fits within their budget. Shoppers should also aim to differentiate between price and value. A low-priced option may not be a good value if it is also low-quality, as it is more likely to have a shorter lifespan. Similarly, a high-priced model could be a good value if its quality, performance, and durability are superior. Sleeping position can affect hip pain and influence which topper may be best for you. We’ll explain the connection between sleep position and hip pain in more detail, but in general, side sleeping and stomach sleeping may exacerbate hip pain. While side sleepers usually prefer a thicker, softer topper to counteract this effect, stomach sleepers may look for a thinner, firmer model. Since a topper’s components affect its comfort, durability, and overall performance, quality materials are beneficial. For those with hip pain, this may be particularly true. Lower-quality materials tend to be more prone to developing lasting indentations that jeopardize their contouring and support, so they may no longer provide the same level of pressure relief that hip pain sufferers usually prefer. While toppers made of quality materials typically cost more, it may be more affordable in the long run to invest in one high-quality topper, rather than buying a lower-quality model you have to replace more often. The best mattress toppers for hip pain often conform closely to the sleeper’s body, which can cause heat to build up. Memory foam is particularly susceptible to heat retention. This may be uncomfortable for those who are already prone to sleeping hot. Many toppers combat this tendency with foam engineered for enhanced breathability, cooling covers, gel infusions, perforations for ventilation, and/or advanced cooling materials. Latex, polyfoam, fiber, and down/feather toppers generally have better temperature control than most traditional memory foam toppers, but they may also include enhanced to accommodate hot sleepers. Finding the ideal firmness level can help provide a more comfortable night’s sleep for those with hip pain. A topper that is too firm may lead to more pressure buildup around the hips, while one that is too soft could allow the hips to sink in too far, potentially contributing to both hip and lower back discomfort. The optimal topper firmness will depend on your weight, sleep position, and mattress. Most toppers are usually medium to medium firm because these options have broad appeal. However, sleepers who weigh less than 130 pounds and those who sleep on their sides may prefer a slightly softer surface. Those who weigh more than 230 pounds or who sleep on their backs could favor a . The thickness of the topper influences the extent to which you’ll notice the feel of the bed underneath. Thinner toppers start around 1 inch high. These options alter the feel a bit, though the sleeper will most likely continue to notice the contouring and support of the mattress beneath it. Thicker toppers can measure up to 4 inches deep, which may significantly alter the feel of the existing mattress. People who have hip pain that’s aggravated by a mattress that’s significantly too soft or too firm may prefer a thicker topper, while those looking for a little extra cushioning may benefit from a thinner option. Pressure relief is typically closely linked to contouring. When a topper lets the hips sink in a bit, it helps reduce some of the pressure that would ordinarily accumulate. Since pressure can exacerbate hip pain, many sleepers prefer to select a topper with strong pressure-relieving properties. Sleep position is often directly linked to hip pain. Some positions increase pressure on the hips, which can contribute to discomfort. Taking your sleep position into account when selecting a mattress topper can help you find the right mixture of support and pressure relief. For side sleepers, the hips often sink deeply into the bed. This can cause pressure points to develop. Finding the ideal topper thickness and firmness may be the ticket to sleeping comfortably. If your mattress is close to your optimal firmness but doesn’t have quite enough contouring, a thinner model may suffice. If your mattress is much too firm, a thicker topper may give your hips more room to sink in before reaching the bed. A medium topper should be suitable for many side sleepers with hip pain, but individuals who weigh under 130 pounds may need a softer option in order to experience cradling. Those who weigh more than 230 pounds may need a firmer option so that they don’t sink in too deeply. Back sleeping is usually the position most conducive to healthy spinal alignment, and it may help relieve hip pain for some individuals. Ideally, a topper should cradle the hips and support the lower back. A medium topper may strike this balance for many sleepers, though individuals who weigh less than 130 pounds often prefer a softer option and those who weigh more than 230 pounds may favor a firmer model. The optimal thickness will depend on how significantly the sleeper wants to alter their sleep surface. Extra weight around a sleeper’s abdomen and hips can pull their midsection too deeply into the bed when they sleep on their stomachs. Most often, this results in lower back pain, but it could also contribute to discomfort in other areas, like the hips and neck. To prevent excessive sinkage, stomach sleepers usually need a firmer topper. If their mattress is too soft, a firm, thick model may enhance its support. However, stomach sleepers looking for a softer sleep surface might select a thin topper so that they won’t sink in too much before they reach the support of the mattress. For many with hip pain, combination sleeping is a comfortable solution. It carries the potential benefits and drawbacks of the other positions, but when discomfort occurs, the sleeper can simply change positions. Combination sleepers may prefer to select a topper that’s best suited for their most frequent position. If they favor multiple positions equally, a mid-range firmness and thickness should accommodate them. These sleepers should also consider how well the mattress topper facilitates movement, as materials like latex help make it easier to change positions throughout the night. The type of mattress topper you should choose will depend on your personal preferences, existing mattress, and what is likely to feel best for your hip pain. With so many potential causes of hip pain, there’s no one-size-fits-all solution. We’ll explain the most common options to help you weigh the potential pros and cons. Polyfoam toppers use a synthetic foam that contours to the body to reduce pressure buildup around the hips. This material has an open-cell structure that allows air to circulate so that it doesn’t stay trapped against the body. Polyfoam toppers are often among the most affordable, which may give hip pain sufferers a chance to decide whether a topper will help ease their discomfort without a huge financial commitment. Like polyfoam, memory foam is a synthetic material that adjusts to the sleeper’s shape. However, memory foam is typically denser and more expensive. While it tends to be slower to respond to changes in pressure and more likely to retain heat, its close-conforming hug combines contouring and support to relieve hip pressure while promoting proper spinal alignment. Some also include gel infusions designed to help pull heat away from the body, and/or other special features for enhanced temperature control. Most use natural latex, which is formulated from the sap of rubber trees. Synthetic and blended options are also available, though less common. While a latex topper should conform to the body to relieve pressure from the hips, it spreads the compression over a wider surface than memory foam. This may promote a floating sensation rather than a hug, which can make it easier to change positions if your hip becomes uncomfortable. Latex is more breathable and buoyant than most traditional memory foam, so it may satisfy hot sleepers and couples looking for a more responsive surface for sex. Down and add cushioning more than contouring. They can provide a soft surface for sore hips, but they won’t redistribute the sleeper’s weight to the same extent as polyfoam, memory foam, and latex. If the existing mattress provides good contouring and support, a feather or down topper may make the bed even more comfortable for those with hip pain. Down alternative options are also available, which mimic the feel of down. Like feather and down toppers, a wool model can cushion the surface of the bed, but it is unlikely to add notable contouring or support. However, wool has strong temperature regulation, transferring heat away when the sleeper gets too warm and insulating when the sleeper gets chilly. Wool also wicks away moisture to help keep the sleeper drier and more comfortable if they sweat during the night. Because of this, a wool topper may be a good option for hip pain sufferers with a mattress that sleeps too warm, or those who simply want extra cushioning. Frequently Asked Questions About Mattress Toppers and Hip Pain Are soft or firm mattress toppers better for hip pain? Either a soft or firm option may be appropriate for hip pain depending on your weight, sleep position, and existing mattress. Lighter individuals do not sink into a topper as deeply as those who weigh more, so people who weigh less than 130 pounds may need a softer model for enough pressure relief to ease aching hips. Individuals who weigh more than 230 pounds may prefer a firmer topper to prevent them from sinking in too deeply. Without the right balance of contouring and support, a mattress could aggravate hip pain. On a mattress that is too firm, pressure accumulation around the hips could cause more discomfort. A mattress that is too soft may not provide enough support, causing your muscles to tense in an attempt to maintain proper spinal alignment. Many conditions can cause hip discomfort, but if your pain is worse when you wake up and fades throughout the day, your bed may play a role. Knowing is often critical to reducing sleep discomfort. Sagging and lasting impressions may diminish the bed’s support, thereby triggering hip pain. While a topper can be used to adjust your existing bed, it cannot repair a broken or sagging mattress. In these cases, it may be wise to consider upgrading your mattress to one that will help relieve . While an ill-fitting mattress could be the root cause of your hip pain, a wide range of medical conditions can also contribute to nighttime discomfort. Various types of , including osteoarthritis (OA), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis, septic arthritis, and juvenile idiopathic arthritis, can all cause hip pain. Osteoarthritis is perhaps the most common, and it has been shown to . Other medical conditions, including and , can also contribute to hip pain. While some of these are less common, talking to your doctor about your symptoms can help you get a diagnosis and a clearer action plan. What else can I do to help reduce hip pain at night? Changing your sleep position or using additional accessories may help provide hip pain relief. Depending on what’s causing the pain, a sleeper might simply roll over to reduce hip discomfort during the night. Rotating positions regularly helps limit the drawbacks from any one position. Many hip pain sufferers find the most relief lying on their backs. However, those who have pain in just one hip might also lay on their sides with the affected hip facing upward to prevent pressure buildup. The right sleep accessories could also help reduce hip pain. A that supports your head and neck to keep the spine aligned may help your muscles relax for reduced discomfort. Pillows can also be beneficial for other parts of the body. Side sleepers might place a pillow between their to help keep the hips aligned. A can provide extra support while preventing twisting that could put the hips out of alignment. Back sleepers might use a pillow under their knees to take pressure off their lower backs. Some hip pain sufferers may also benefit from an , which allows you to shift positions quickly and easily to accommodate changing needs and preferences. Raising the head and legs slightly and sleeping on the back typically relieves pressure on the lumbar region and hips, allowing the muscles to relax fully. Many adjustable bases even have a “zero gravity” setting specifically designed for optimal pressure relief.

Reviewed By: Flip flops are a convenient way to keep your feet cool in the summertime. But not all flip flops are pain-free. When you choose a pair, see how they bend. If you can bend them in half, don’t buy them. They should only bend at the ball of the foot where your foot naturally bends. Also look for pairs with arch support, and be sure your toes don’t bend over them—that can lead to injuries. Whatever pair you choose, don’t walk in them for too long. Long walks in flip flops can cause plantar fasciitis, a tenderness and/or inflamed pain in your heel. Along with many conveniences, smartphones have brought with them a few health problems. Some people who use their smartphones heavily have found problems in their thumbs and necks. These conditions are called “text thumb” and “text neck.” Have you noticed your thumb popping and snapping when you bend it? Does it hurt? You may have text thumb. The kind of repetitive motions you use to click, drag, swipe, and drop can cause this painful condition. In serious cases the thumb may even get locked into a curling position. If your thumb has lost mobility from smartphone use, your doctor may recommend cortisone injections. When injected into a stiff area, cortisone reduces inflammation, which also reduces pain in most cases. When treated, text thumbs can be restored to full mobility about 80% of the time. As we get older it’s common to develop shoulder, neck, and lower back pain. But these symptoms are now being seen in younger people who spend too much time hunched over while absorbed in their smartphones. By dropping your head to look down at your phone, your head puts far more pressure on your neck—as much as 60 pounds of force. To relieve text neck, your best hope may be to focus on good posture. Do you stand and sit up straight? If not, focus on keeping your spine in line. Try holding your phone up to your face rather than bending your neck to see the screen. And if the problem keeps happening, shoulder extensions are a simple stretch that can ease your pain. For some, sitting on a fat wallet can aggravate hips and buttocks. The pain refers to piriformis syndrome, sometimes called “fat wallet syndrome” or “wallet butt.” About 1 in 5 people have a sciatic nerve—the largest in the body—that cuts through the small piriformis muscle that extends from the tailbone to the hip bone. They are more likely to develop this problem. This painful problem is treatable. About 80% of wallet pain-sufferers find relief from ice, rest, over-the-counter pain medicines like ibuprofen, and in some cases prescription muscle relaxers. Stretching and strengthening the muscles in that area can also be helpful, and these techniques can be learned through physical therapists or from your doctor. If those treatments fail, shots of botulism, steroids, or lidocaine hydrochloride can also be effective; consult your doctor before getting treatments. Your drive to work can be a pain in the neck. Over time, all those hours on the road add up. It can lead to necks overstretched in awkward positions and out-of-place neck joints. There are a few ways to deal with this painful problem. The first is to adjust the way you sit when driving. Pitch your seat forward so that your head actually rests in the headrest, and your neck is centered above your hips. Use both hands to steer, too, as using only one can twist your neck and shoulders. Stretching can help, too. You can even do some stretching in the car. Try pushing your head back into the car’s headrest and holding it there for 30 seconds at a time. Or try pulling your head forward as far as you can go while keeping your chin parallel with the ground for about five seconds at a time. Shrugging your shoulders toward your ears can work, too. A few of these stretches a day can help take some of the pain out of your commute. Are your video games hurting your health? When the Nintendo Wii was first introduced in 2006, patients started appearing in doctors’ offices with a variety of injuries to their necks, wrists, arms, and shoulders. Collectively, these cases came to be called “Wiiitis.” Other injuries have included bruises, black eyes, and cuts on the hand. Not long after this video game system was released, other manufacturers followed suit, leading to more injuries. Doctors are advised to ask their patients what games they are playing, and for how long. As it turns out, many of video game injuries run parallel to the sports they imitate. In the worst cases, these injuries can even be life-threatening. One woman who fell from her sofa playing Wii Tennis developed a serious accumulation in her lungs, for instance. A man fractured his spine while swinging the controller too intensely. On the whole these systems are considered relatively safe, but clearly it is important to follow the recommended safety procedures. Among them, make sure you have a clear area to play in, and warn those who aren’t playing not to walk into the playing area. There’s a headache-triggering chemical lurking in aged cheese. Your body breaks down the amino acid tyrosine into tyramine after you eat sharp cheddar or some well-aged parmesan. That seems to have a tendency to bring on migraines for those who suffer from them, though some studies dispute this. Cheeses thought to bring on headaches include: If you think this might be causing your headaches, consider keeping a migraine journal. Make a note when you eat a food that could be causing your migraines, including how much you ate, when you ate it, whether you experienced symptoms, and how bad they were. Over time you should be able to recognize a pattern. When you’re inactive for long stretches, the muscles that protect your spine can become weak. One study found that men who laid in bed all day for eight weeks had noticeable weakened spine muscles. The same thing happens if you park in front of your TV set for hours at a time. Back and neck pain are aggravating conditions for many people. While sometimes people have a sense of what’s causing this pain, often they are left baffled. Paying attention to the way you sit can help improve many of these cases. If you want to make improvements while you sit, remember these tips: Change position frequently. Muscles long at rest are more prone to stiffness, strain, and pain. Get up and stretch now and then. If it’s been more than an hour since you got up, get up! Moving around can keep muscle pain away. you are seated or reclining, avoid twisting at your spine. Consider investing in a lumbar pillow or other cushion. Redistributing your weight can help. Even your baby, despite his or her adorable ways, could be causing you pain. Some women develop a shooting pain in their wrists and thumbs known as DeQuervain’s tendonitis, also known as “baby wrist.” It’s a repetitive stress injury caused by lifting your baby with fatigued wrists drooped toward the ground, and some dads experience it, too. The problem is exacerbated in new mothers. Tendons tend to loosen and relax near the time of childbirth to give women greater flexibility. Plus the fluid they retain during pregnancy can make tendons chafe and swell. That plus picking up a baby over and over can lead to pain. Wrist braces and cortisone injections can help reduce the inflammation and swelling of baby wrist. Laptops make life a lot easier most of the time. But carrying them from place to place can make things more difficult for your back, shoulders, and elbows. Muscle pain caused by laptop cases slung over the shoulder or worn on the back are fairly common. One study of nearly 400 laptop-wielding students found that more than 75% complained of shoulder pain. More than 35% also complained of elbow pain Solving this problem may require a new case, but not necessarily. If you stuff unnecessary laptop accessories and other items into your case, just clearing out those things could solve your problem. As a rule of thumb, don’t carry more than 10% of your body weight. If that doesn’t do the trick, consider replacing the case. If your shoulders hurt, investing in a bag with a broad shoulder strap with padding could help. There are also rolling options available with wheels. Does your head ache after a day wearing a ponytail? There’s actually a medical term for this: “ponytail headache syndrome.” This disorder doesn’t affect everyone, but those who experience it know this can be a painfully frustrating type of discomfort. Ponytail headache syndrome seems to be a type of allodynia. Allodynia, which is associated with fibromyalgia, causes normal sensations to be perceived as painful. Some with allodynia might experience pain from even a light touch on the arm. There are a few ways to deal with ponytail headache syndrome. One is to make sure you get a good night’s sleep—lack of sleep can cause you to perceive pain more intensely. Another is to reduce stress for the same reason. You can also wear your hair more loosely of course. But if you are set on your tight hairstyle, consider taking ibuprofen when you style your hair. Also, at some point during the day, let your hair down. Even one minute of relief can make a difference at the end of the day. For migraine sufferers, many things can trigger intense pain. Certain smells can set them off, for example. This seems to be the case in 25% to 43% of all those who suffer from migraines. One study found that the odor most likely to trigger a headache was perfume, followed by paint, gasoline, and bleach. Other offenders include fried foods, cleaning products, exhaust, onions, and cigarette smoke. It only takes a few minutes for a given smell to send headache sufferers reeling. That’s why learning what smells trigger your headaches is important. Whether or not certain smells trigger them, people with chronic migraines are more likely than others to be offended by smell. Researchers tested 50 people who get migraines and 50 who don’t to determine how sensitive they were to a variety of smells. Out of migraine sufferers, 42 were bothered by odors, while only nine non-sufferers were bothered. Depending on how your spine is curved, you could be causing a lot of stiffness and pain in your back and neck while you sleep. Stomach-sleepers are the most likely to throw their spine out of alignment, but it can happen for back-sleepers and side-sleepers too. To relieve this type of pain, you need to pay close attention to your sleep position. If you sleep on your back, make sure the normal curve of your spine is maintained. If you sleep on your side, be sure the portion of your spine that crosses into your neck remains even with the portion that goes through your ribcage—a big, firm pillow helps. If you’re a stomach-sleeper, switch! Stomach sleeping is tied to the most cases of back and neck pain because sleeping on your stomach forces you to turn your head in an awkward way, which often causes pain. Does your head hurt after you drink? There are two times when alcohol can cause a headache. The first is right after you drink—about 30 minutes to 3 hours after, to be specific. The second is the morning after when the hangover starts. It doesn’t seem to matter what type of alcohol you drink. Red wine is frequently accused, but studies show the variety doesn’t much matter. How much you drink could make a difference, though. Instead of the type of alcohol, it seems to be the alcohol itself—ethanol—causing head-pounding pain. About a third of migraine-sufferers seem to be triggered by alcohol. But drinking can bring on tension and cluster headaches, too. Been awhile since you last ate? Feeling a little nauseas, with a thumping headache? That’s common. When you skip a meal, diet too rigorously, or fast, your body’s glucose level drops. Glucose is the sugar that keeps your body functioning, and when your blood-sugar level drops, you tend to feel fatigued, weak, shaky, and sometimes headachy. Compared to most headache triggers, the solution for hunger headaches is very simple—eat! Specifically, you should try to find a high-protein meal with complex carbohydrates to give your body the fuel it needs to function normally. Eventually nearly everyone experiences some amount of back pain. One of the common sources of this is lifting without proper technique. Most of this pain can be avoided, fortunately, once you know the movements and positions more likely to leave your back in agony. When you need to lift something, pay attention to your posture. Your posture should be as neutral as possible. Avoid: Always lift with your legs, and not your back. This is because the muscles in your legs are stronger and can manage a greater burden than your back muscles can. Keep your shoulders square. If an object is too heavy and you sense back pain on the horizon, get a friend, family member, or coworker to help divide the load. Do you feel stiffness and pain in your neck and back after work? Millions of people do. But you don’t have to agonize every day at the office. A big part of the solution is to say no to slouching. Sadly many people don’t know what it takes to maintain a good posture throughout the workday. To make sure your spine is properly aligned at work, pay attention to your posture. Keep your feet flat on the floor. Sit so that your weight is distributed across your buttocks, not your tailbone. Also, make sure you’re not straining to look up or down at your computer monitor-keep it at eye level. For more tips tailored to your work situation, get in touch with your human resources department. Find out if ergonomic tips have been designed for your work situation, and follow them. Is your eye in pain? Strangely enough this usually isn’t a problem with your eye. Most eye pain is actually caused by headaches. To make matters more complicated, one of the problem that starts with your eyes can cause headaches: eyestrain. If you have vision problems, you may find yourself straining to see clearly and with focus. Sometimes this is a matter of being nearsighted, farsighted, or suffering from astigmatism. Sometimes it means your eyes aren’t properly aligned. This kind of strain happens after long stretches spent staring at a single point, like you do when you stare at your phone or computer screen, or a book or magazine. If eye problems are causing your headaches, make sure your glasses are fitted with the proper prescription. If they are and the pain continues, talk to your eye doctor about further remedies. Have you ever heard someone complain that their joints hurt when the weather shifts? It’s not a myth—pain from weather changes really do happen. There are three weather changes that can make your joints ache: pressure changes, temperature drops, and humidity. When the barometric pressure changes, this can indicate a storm is about to move through. It can also mean your joints are in pain. It’s not so important where the pressure stands at a given moment—the changes in pressure are what seem to cause the pain. This may be because your tendons, bones, and muscles expand and contract as the pressure shifts. When the thermometer drops, joint pain tends to rise. It’s not well understood why this happens, but it could involve the thickness of your joint fluid. Joints have fluid that keep them lubricated, and cold weather makes this fluid thicker, which could lead to stiffness. This problem is worse when it’s wet outside, as cold weather and high humidity have been shown to cause more pain than either by itself. When you lift weights, soreness comes on the next day and can last for four or five days. Why is this? Lifting heavy weights actually damages your muscle fiber. That triggers an inflammatory response that makes your pain receptors more sensitive afterwards. This is known as delayed-onset muscle soreness, or DOMS. The pain is worse, though, when you start a particularly intense routine. Anyone who works out intensely enough will experience DOMS. The thing is, after you get used to a routine over time, the soreness decreases. Your pain receptors seem to be less sensitive after weight lifting as your body becomes more accustomed to a workout. But what if you never get used to a routine? If you work out infrequently, you are dooming yourself to the same soreness again and again. Those pain receptors never have time to grow accustomed to the inflammation that comes with weight training. So if you find yourself intensely sore after each workout, consider hitting the weights more often. It’s not often talked about, but many new mothers and fathers are in for a lot of physical pain in the first few years. That tiny bundle of joy you carry from place to place gets bigger and bigger. As your baby grows, so does the burden placed on your shoulders and neck. When you need to lift your child, lift with your legs, not your back. Don’t favor one arm over the other—this can put strain on your dominant shoulder. When you’re carrying your baby, keep your shoulders back and stand nice and tall. This helps distribute the extra weight around your body and can help prevent pain and even injury. Nursing mothers should be especially careful to avoid staring down at their infant while breast or bottle feeding. Of course you can look at your baby, but stretch out your shoulders as you do, and take breaks. This can help you avoid a common neck pain associated with new moms. Ever wake up with an ache in your jaw? A lot of people grind their teeth at night, and this can leave your jaw aching painfully the next day. If you are grinding your teeth while you sleep, you may have other symptoms, such as insomnia, headaches, ear aches, anxiety, and depression. If you have jaw pain, it may be caused by grinding teeth, or it may not. A doctor can assess you for other potential causes, including infections, ear problems, TMJ problems, and dental issues. If you are grinding your teeth, you will be encouraged to take daily steps to relieve the problem. These may include reducing stress, sleeping enough, drinking enough water, and avoiding gum and hard, chewy foods like nuts, steaks, and hard candies. Have you ever had a headache during sex? Sex headaches are real, and they come in two types. The first is a dull, gradual ache that worsens as you approach climax. The second is an intense, pounding headache that occurs at or near orgasm. These headaches are usually not a cause for concern, but they may indicate other health problems. Usually they come in clusters over the course of a few months and then go away for awhile. Some people actually find that sex relieves their headaches, but whether this is likely depends on the type of headache you tend to experience. About 60% of those who have experienced sexual activity during a migraine attack report relief from their headache. Some with cluster headaches also find that sex relieves their pain, though the percentage is smaller—a little over 35%. Everyone experiences stress sometimes. Stress is the feeling we get when the body goes into its “fight or flight” response. It may be triggered by an argument with a loved one, getting stuck in traffic, or anything else that your body perceives as a threat. When your body reacts to a threat, several changes take place. One is that your heart starts beating faster. Another is that your muscles get tense—ready to fight or run. That’s great if the threat is a physical one like a dangerous animal. But in modern life most of our stressors are not like this. In fact some of our stressors last months or even years, which can lead to chronic stress. If you’re chronically stressed out, those tense muscles can leave your body aching all over. If you recognize yourself in that scenario, you need to find a way to reduce your stress in order to feel good again. Different forms of relief work better for different people. Some find that intense exercise helps them relax. For others yoga or tai chi may work better. Meditation, deep breathing, massage, and other therapies work better for others. Finding the right way to destress can help ease the overall body pains you may be experiencing. Some forms of pain are more serious than others. You need to see a doctor emergently if you experience any of the following: Chronic pain can also be cause to see a doctor, particularly if it deprives you of your sleep, your work, or activities with family or friends. If your pain doesn’t fall into these categories, you may decide to treat it yourself. If that’s the case, consider your over-the-counter pain relieving options. Drugs like ibuprofen, aspirin, and naproxen are useful for various minor pains. Be careful – do not exceed the recommended doses as too much pain medicine can be toxic or even lethal.

Learn more about our process The right mattress can greatly improve symptoms associated with acid reflux and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Both conditions cause stomach acid to flow into the esophagus, causing irritation and pain. Symptoms usually grow worse after lying down, making it difficult for sufferers to fall asleep.

Along with an adjustable bed, people with acid reflux typically benefit from using a mattress designed for side sleepers. These mattresses provide extra cushioning at pressure points like the hips and shoulders. Wondering what type of mattress is best for acid reflux pain?

With so many models on the market today, choosing the best mattress for acid reflux can be a daunting task. This section explores some of the most important features to consider when you’re shopping for a mattress to help with acid reflux. Read on to learn how variables like firmness level, contouring, and pressure relief play a part in nighttime reflux relief. While some mattress companies rely on gimmicks or deceptive language to drum up business, it’s easy to cut through the hype by focusing on a few key factors. By prioritizing the following aspects in a mattress, you’re more likely to purchase a quality product that meets your needs. : While a good mattress typically represents a significant financial investment, nearly everyone must stick to a certain budget or spending limit. Keep in mind, the most expensive mattress isn’t always the best, and many provide excellent results. : Nobody wants to replace their mattress only a year or two after buying it. Mattresses made with quality materials are more durable, perform better, and are less likely to need before their warranty is up. : Firmness is one of the most important features to consider while mattress shopping. Although preferences vary considerably between individuals, certain body types tend to benefit more from certain firmness levels. Firmer mattresses generally offer more support, while softer models provide greater contouring. : Firm, supportive mattresses usually offer the most pressure relief. The best mattress for and acid reflux promotes better spinal alignment and provides targeted support at the hips and shoulders. : Mattresses with a reinforced perimeter offer greater edge support and a larger usable sleep area. Strong edge support also prevents sleepers from rolling off the edge of the bed. : This term refers to a mattress’ body-conforming properties. The right amount of contouring cradles pressure points while preventing the sleeper from sinking into the mattress’ support layer. Generally, all-foam mattresses offer more contouring than hybrid or innerspring models. : Individuals who tend to often prioritize temperature regulation, seeking out mattresses like hybrid models, which provide greater breathability than all-foam versions. Many mattresses also use special fabrics and fillers, such as copper or gel, to create a cooler sleep surface. : This factor is especially important for couples, and for individuals seeking a mattress to use with an adjustable bed frame. Mattresses with more bounce typically allow for greater ease of movement, while sleepers tend to sink into contouring foam surfaces. In contrast, coil-based models provide more bounce. : Most mattresses fall into one of several categories, which are based on construction, materials, and function. Each mattress type comes with certain benefits and drawbacks, which we shall explore further below. What Type of Mattress is Best for Preventing Acid Reflux? Most mattresses currently on the market fall into one of the following categories. While mattresses within each category tend to display many of the same features, it’s important to remember that no two models or brands are alike. Every mattress includes slightly different materials, construction, and features. Let’s see what each type of mattress has to offer. combine the best features of innerspring and all-foam mattresses and features fewer of the drawbacks of each type. They consist of a pocketed coil-based support core topped by a multilayered comfort system. The comfort system may feature latex, memory foam, or a combination of the two. Ideal for side sleepers, hybrids typically offer more contouring and pressure point relief than innerspring models while providing more support than the average all-foam mattress. They also tend to sleep cool, thanks to a pocketed coil system that absorbs and disperses body heat. Once the most common type of mattress on the market, feature a coil-based core and a fabric cover, with little or no comfort or transitional system. They are often more difficult to ship than other types. With more comfortable options available today, very few companies continue to produce innerspring mattresses. When available, innersprings tend to be among the least expensive options. These models are made entirely from natural or synthetic latex rubber, or a mixture of the two. Natural latex is derived from rubber tree sap and processed using either the Talalay or Dunlap methods. Talalay latex typically creates a lighter and softer mattress, while Dunlap latex tends to be firmer and more durable. Latex’s moderate contouring cushions side sleepers’ pressure points without too much give or sink. Instead of coils, latex, or foam, an airbed’s support core consists of multiple air-filled chambers, which may be filled or deflated to the sleeper’s liking with a built-in pump. The pump is often controlled by a smartphone app or remote control. These fully adjustable mattresses may also contain materials like foam or latex. allow users to customize their sleep experience, targeting key areas for acid reflux sufferers like the upper body. Sleepers can adjust the mattress to suit ever-changing preferences and pain levels without disturbing their partner. These mattresses feature multiple layers and types of foam, such as memory foam and gel-infused foam. Instead of pocketed coils, they rely on a strong polyfoam core for support. Memory foam offers deep contouring and soothing pressure relief, making all-foam models great for side sleepers. While these mattresses tend to offer less support than hybrid or innerspring models, their flexibility makes them ideal for use with adjustable bed frames. Also known as GERD, acid reflux is a chronic condition that can have a dramatic impact on sleep quality. The condition may also lead to disorders such as sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, and chronic insomnia. When patients with acid reflux sleep or lie down, stomach acid flows up into the esophagus, causing heartburn, regurgitation, and coughing fits. Over time, untreated reflux may increase the risk of developing ulcers, long-term complications, and even certain cancers. While a variety of over-the-counter and prescription medications exist to treat acid reflux, most sufferers find that they need to make lifestyle changes to find relief from their condition. Because symptoms often worsen at night, many individuals with acid reflux must learn to sleep in a different position. Often, they must also purchase a new mattress and/or bed frame specifically designed to help alleviate their symptoms. Back and stomach sleeping may aggravate reflux, and doctors often recommend that individuals with GERD sleep on their sides. In addition, sufferers often benefit from sleeping with their heads slightly elevated, or about six inches. This prevents stomach acid from flowing back up the esophagus. For this reason, GERD patients often use adjustable bed frames, which allow sleepers to switch between prone and upright positions. Adjustable beds may also help with related issues, like snoring and sleep apnea. With or without an adjustable base, the wrong mattress type or model can make acid reflux worse in the long run or lead to other complications. For example, an overly firm mattress may cause back pain in side sleepers, especially those under 130 pounds, while deep contouring all-foam models might not support heavier sleepers enough to prevent reflux. In addition, some thicker or denser mattresses may not work well with adjustable beds. Your sleeping position can relieve or worsen acid reflux symptoms, snoring, and back pain. Generally, people with GERD and acid reflux are encouraged to sleep on their left sides. Wondering why? Keep reading to find out how sleeping position can affect acid reflux and trigger other types of pain. Back sleeping is generally the worst position for individuals with acid reflux and GERD, and sufferers who sleep on their backs tend to struggle with worse and more prolonged symptoms. Sleeping on one’s back allows acid to freely move up from the stomach and into the esophagus, where it can linger for extended periods of time, damaging the esophageal lining. The position is particularly dangerous for individuals with excess abdominal fat, as the additional weight on the stomach may push acid up the esophagus with stronger force. While side sleeping can be hard on the hips and shoulders, it’s also the best position for acid reflux and spinal alignment. Exactly which side you sleep on, however, can make a big difference in symptom reduction. Experts usually suggest that sufferers sleep on their left side, which positions the stomach directly below the esophagus and makes it more difficult for acid to flow upward. Thanks to gravity, any stomach acid that does enter the esophagus can quickly flow backward without causing any lasting damage. In contrast, lying on the right side places the stomach at an angle, allowing the stomach to leak acid directly into the esophagus. In this position, leaked acid tends to linger in the throat for extended periods of time, worsening symptoms and potentially leading to complications. Like back sleeping, stomach sleeping creates prime conditions for severe GERD and acid reflux. The position permits acid to flow freely up the esophagus, without the aid of gravity to force it back down. In this position, stomach acid lingers in the food pipe much longer than usual, exacerbating symptoms. Many stomach sleepers also struggle with back pain. Sleeping on the stomach places most weight on the center of the body, causing pressure to build along the spine, neck, and lower back. This pressure, in turn, can lead to tingling or numbness in the extremities and other parts of the body. Over time, stomach sleeping may also cause neck pain, or even herniated discs. As we’ve seen, some sleeping positions combat acid reflux better than others. While most experts would advise against sufferers sleeping on their stomachs or backs, there are some benefits to changing positions frequently throughout the night. Because they rarely allow pressure to build up at one point or another, combination sleepers often avoid some of the musculoskeletal issues associated with stomach or back sleeping, like back and neck pain. Changing positions may also improve circulation issues. Last Things to Consider with a Mattress for Acid Reflux Ready to go mattress shopping? Here are just a few more things to consider before you make a final purchase. The best mattress for acid reflux pain isn’t always the most expensive one. If you’re on a tight budget, prioritizing reflux-relieving mattress features can help narrow down your choices. For example, you may want to develop a list of mattresses for side sleepers, or adjustable models, and explore the least expensive options in each category. Your insurance provider may also cover part or all of the cost. Different body types benefit from different types of mattresses and firmness levels. While most people with acid reflux are told to sleep on their sides, heavier side sleepers may still need a firmer mattress than side sleepers under 130 pounds. Typically, larger individuals need extra support at the shoulders and hips, while lightweight side sleepers often prefer soft, contouring sleep surfaces like all-foam mattresses, which cradle pressure points. A queen-size mattress typically costs $1,000 or more. However, the best mattress for acid reflux is an investment that can save you plenty of money — and sleepless nights — in the years to come. The right mattress can reduce reflux, snoring, and reliance on antacids, leaving you feeling better in the long run and potentially cutting back on costly visits to the doctor. Before you make your final purchase, be sure to review the mattress’ warranty, sleep trial information, and return policy. Many companies offer a sleep trial that begins after a certain initial break-in period, and most offer some kind of warranty. However, warranties are often contingent on the type of foundation the mattress is used with. If you plan to use your new mattress with an adjustable bed, be sure that this type of use is covered in the warranty. What Type of Mattress is Best for Preventing Acid Reflux?

While white tends to be the standard bath pillow color, you can find a few colorful options that may better fit your decor. Gel bath pillows are often filled with a blue or green gel that you can see through the material of the cover Style, material, and size are all factors that affect the price of bath pillows. You can find them in a range of prices from $5 to $60 or more. On the cheaper end, you'll often find small pillows that provide some comfort but little to no neck support.

4088850a-9eb2-4131-8467-b4b56ae19c4a,"Can Periods be the Cause of Neck, Back and Head Pain? The specific cause of neck, back or head pain is not still objectionable. And it is certain that it occurs during the periods, as one of the main symptoms of it. Moreover, during the period such pains may appear as a part of body pain in some women. Nevertheless, it can also be possibly said that the periods and the periodic bodily changes can be the real cause to induce such pains. Most women tell that instead of a pointed, remarkable pain, menstrual pain undergoes more like a tedious discomfort. Menstrual pain in the body feels unusual and is different than the pain that arises elsewhere on your body. Discomfort and soreness in the lower abdomen or back is the added issue which is normal. The pain for women may last for some time during the periods and may vanish automatically after few days. It has been seen that neck and shoulder pain before period (premenstrual neck pain) also arises in many, which lowers down slowly after 3-4 days. A woman’s body produces a particular quantity of hormones at different times during the menstrual cycle. This can cause many changes in the body. The varying stages of hormonal changes in the body prior to your periods may also cause physical as well as an emotional alteration.  It is because of the changes in the uterus region during the menses. Therefore, when the uterus contracts, the head and back pain emerges as a side effect along with neck and shoulder pain (which are less common). With so many dissimilar possible causes of pain in women, it can be intricate to locate the real origin of the body pain. In order to find out the reason, you may carry out a bodily test as well as arrange an analytical test. If symptoms are common to many possible causes, one should analyze the nature and spot of pain as well as the moment it occurs that can guide a physician in the right track. Head and neck pain are some of the general types of painful conditions. The causes of neck pain and headache differ, and state of affairs varies from severe to compassionate. Some kind of neck pain and back pain are delicate, but for a temporary state. Other types may become constant, long-lasting or chronic. It can be more than a predictable remedial period. Neck pain in women can usually appear due to disorders caused by tissues in the neckline. Neck pain in women sometimes also appears with a headache. And headache usually occurs from mental tension. This tension is generally seen in women during conditions such as Suggestions for Getting Relieve from Neck and Back Pain during Periods As such there are many things that can provide menstruation pain relief to women. You just need to look for the best ones that work for you. Here are a few tips that following which can help you in avoiding the neck, back, and head pain during the menstruation. Applying a mustard pack over the cervical region for ten minutes can also relieve the pain instantly. The major property of mustard is attracting the blood cells and creating heat as well as irritation at the area where it is applied. Thus when applied on the neck region mustard creates much heat and little irritation which gradually slows down and relieves the pain totally. The other plus point in applying the mustard pack is it removes the swelling if any present in the neck area. Making the mustard pack at home for relieving the neck and shoulder joint pain is easy. For this, you can make a fine powder of normal mustard seeds and mix it with hot water to make a fine paste out of it. Then apply this paste above the painful area to get the fast relief from the pain. Additionally, you can also consider making a bandage with black coffee for the neck sprain during periods, which will help you a lot. A great way to ease the neck and back pain during the menstruation is to change the sleeping position. If required, buy some that will provide the necessary support to your body while resting and thus prove highly efficient for you in such conditions. Sometimes soft bed also causes neck and back pain during the periods. Do check out that you get the most comfortable bed which is good for you in all conditions including the periods. Keep your upper body strong, while doing heavy works so that you lessen the strain on your neck. It will prove beneficial to lessen the strain temporarily. Make sure that your work postures are proper to keep your neck and backline healthy. Avoid lifting heavy materials and overhead activities during your periods. If you are suffering from chronic neck or back pain problems due to heavy breasts, then buying the and to improve posture is a wise decision. Trying the neck exercises for cervical pain on a regular basis will also help in keeping the muscles and ligaments in your neck region healthy during irregular periods and menopause. These exercises can easily make your neck, upper back and shoulder muscles become less prone to getting any injury or damage fast. Following are the 5 best-recommended neck pain exercises that can help you out most: Try to relieve the emotional stress as well as physical stress to ease the neck and back pain. This is one most important remedy which will help you keep away from all sorts of pain. Meditation is one of the best ways to control your stress. This is an act of awareness or transformation of mind which aims at improving the mind power and in controlling one’s thoughts. Meditation simply means awareness. One can be in a meditation state while performing prayers, while worshiping, while sitting still and relaxing the mind, etc. To meditate is usually a practice through which one trains his/her mind for bringing the consciousness and silence of the mind. It helps in developing better concentration, memory and mind power. It mainly helps in getting free from all the negative thoughts by bringing in the positive thoughts slowly and steadily in mind and body. The most important thing to concentrate while meditating is to “watch your breath”. Be completely focused on the thoughts you are getting while breathing deeply. As mentioned before, menopause can also be a cause of neck and head pain for lots of women. Hot flashes which are one of the most common symptoms of the menopausal transition are really uncomfortable. The worst is these hot flashes can last for a few months to even years. Using ice therapy is, therefore, one of the best remedial measures for the neck muscle pain relief during menopause (before as well as after the menopause). This will also help ease your muscles even in the acute stage. The ice therapy acts in a way to improve the inflammatory reactions and thereby reduces the joint pain to the maximum. Various forms of ice therapy that can be used for neck pain during menopause include ice cube massage over the neck OR (or frozen bag) application on the neck. 6- Use Herbal Products Instead of Pain Relief Medicines Products such as lavender oil or simply smelling lavender perfumes relieve the neck pain which mainly occurs because of the menses stress and over usage of the cervical joint. Herbal products such as lavender, menthol, camphor, etc. stimulate the brain receptors and relax the sensory nerves mainly over the head and neck area and thus relieve the persistent neck, back and shoulder pain effectively. Also, there are many types of herbal creams, available for the neck sprain relief and inflammation. A high-quality cream or any such product is easy to apply and can help you wonderfully in treating the pain quickly without any side effects. This is one of the best options and can be used anywhere and at any time you want for getting severe neck pain relief. Irregular periods and menopause are the two painful conditions that may cause varied problems for women. Headache, back pain, neck pain, etc are some of them. If the above remedies for neck pain during the period do not work for you, make sure that you visit your doctor so as to get them treated as soon as possible.

eb083ed4-0771-4529-b51a-c164d897b13b,"Your Posture While Breastfeeding Actually Matters. Here’s Why — Starting your breastfeeding journey is an exciting time for you and baby. But poor posture while nursing can quickly become a big pain in the neck. With the possibility of sore and cracked , , and , there’s a lot to figure out as you perfect your breastfeeding routine. So it’s not surprising that breastfeeding posture falls to the bottom of the priority list — if you’re even aware of it at all. is a super important part of one’s well-being and can have a huge effect on your day-to-day life. Poor posture can cause back and neck pain, headaches, and even low energy levels. There are you can do to fix common posture issues caused by prolonged sitting, poor shoe choice, and even scrolling through Instagram. But many new moms are unaware that they’ve developed breastfeeding posture habits to begin with, and aren’t sure how to fix them once they realize it. your baby introduces a new set of habitual movements that can throw your body into imbalance and cause aches and pains. Many breastfeeding women experience neck pain, mid back pain, and tension headaches from incorrect breastfeeding posture, but don’t have the knowledge or resources necessary to correct it and restore balance to their bodies. “Not fixing your breastfeeding posture can have a dramatic implication on your [postpartum] recovery,” says , PT, DPT, founder and owner of and . Howald says improper breastfeeding posture often negatively impacts rib positioning, which can not only delay pelvic floor recovery postpartum, but also worsen and make it harder to lessen the appearance of that postpartum belly. “Where our ribs are [positioned] has a lot to do with how our diaphragm functions, which has a lot to do with healing your pelvic floor. If your diaphragm isn’t lined up well because of poor rib positioning, you won’t be able to automate your system [and strengthen your pelvic floor],” she says. With the amount of feedings needed for your baby (or babies!), you might spend in a position that puts unnecessary stress on your body. And unfortunately, the longer it takes you to correct the habit, the longer you might feel aches and pains — even after you finish breastfeeding. Howald recommends getting started with the proper breastfeeding posture as soon as possible to prevent any stubborn imbalances from forming. Here’s what she recommends as an ideal setup for you and your little one: Scoot your butt all the way back on the chair or couch. If you can’t touch your feet to the floor with your butt all the way back, use a pillow for extra support. Keep your shoulders relaxed and away from your ears. Bring your baby to your breast rather than bending over to bring your breast to your baby. Howald recommends using a breastfeeding pillow to achieve this. If the pillow doesn’t bring your baby close enough, you may need to use an extra towel or pillow to tilt your baby’s head toward your breast. We know it’s hard, but avoid staring down at your babe the entire time. Too much neck flexion puts a lot of stress on your neck and back. Instead, try to keep your head neutral or even incorporate a simple neck extension exercise. Keep in mind that it’s really important that you’re actually able to relax while feeding, which Howald says can only be achieved with the proper setup. “[Your muscles] shouldn’t be so tense. It’s all about the setup — where the pillow is, having a rolled up towel that you can stick underneath one side so that your posture is mainly done through the setup. Taking the time to set this up correctly can put your body so much more at ease,” she says. What else can I do to avoid aches and pains caused by breastfeeding? Howald stresses the importance of strengthening your back, shoulder, and neck muscles to truly combat the pain that can come with breastfeeding. “During pregnancy, we’re already pulled forward because of the weight of the baby in the front. So when you go to breastfeed postpartum, the shoulders are still rounded forward,” she says. “Muscles are all about a length-tension relationship. If a muscle is too stretched out, it will spasm and burn, which is what a lot of breastfeeding moms feel.” So while many new moms feel the urge to stretch out the burning and spasming muscles in their back and neck, the actual problem likely comes from a lack of strength. “I could go to a chiropractor, I could have a massage therapist massage my back, and my back will still hurt because the muscles still have a poor length-tension relationship. They’ve been overstretched and overworked,” she says. If you’re expecting or already a breastfeeding mom, here are some example exercises Howald recommends for strengthening your neck and back and safeguarding your body from pain associated with breastfeeding. It can take 4 to 6 weeks of building muscle before you see the benefit of , so stick with it to start finding relief! Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, keeping a slight bend in your knees. Bend over at your waist, engaging your core and keeping your back straight and head neutral. Engage your shoulder blades, anchoring them down and back. (This makes sure you’re not using your upper trap muscles to carry the weight). Keeping your arms straight, raise your arms up to make the letter ‘T.’ Pro tip: If you can’t keep your form with weights in your hand, drop ’em! Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, keeping a slight bend in your knees. Bend over at your waist, engaging your core and keeping your back straight and head neutral. Engage your shoulder blades, anchoring them down and back. Start with your arms hanging straight down in front of you and then bend your elbows to lift the dumbbells up toward your side. Stop when the dumbbells reach your waist, squeezing through your shoulder blades. Pro tip: Keep your elbows close to your rib cage throughout the whole movement. This exercise will follow the same directions as above, but alternating the row one arm at a time. Lie down on your side and hold a dumbbell in the hand of your top arm. Engage your shoulder blade by anchoring it down and back. Keeping your arm glued to your side, raise the dumbbell up toward the ceiling by rotating your arm. When you reach the top of the exercise, give your shoulder blade an extra squeeze. Pro tip: You can use a rolled up towel under your elbow for extra support. For a more in-depth look at exercises you can do to strengthen your body for breastfeeding (and basically all of motherhood), check out Howald’s and workout guides. Before starting any new exercise or training program — particularly if you’ve recently given birth, are currently pregnant, or have underlying conditions — you should speak with your OB or a doctor. “There are so many physical and emotional challenges that go into being a new mother that are so unexpected, so knowing what you can control going into motherhood to ease tension on your body is so valuable,” says Howald. Proper can make a world of difference for new moms trying to find relief from back and neck pain. It’s important to start implementing these techniques as soon as possible after birth to prevent any longer lasting imbalances from forming. If you’re having trouble finding relief or have already stopped breastfeeding and have chronic pain, consider visiting a physical therapist in your area to address your specific needs. By committing to just a few minutes of targeted strength exercises each day, you’ll soon be on the road to full . Ruby Thompson is a health and wellness writer and enthusiast.

Learn more about our process Every mattress is built for a certain body type. How thick and firm the bed is, the materials used to make the comfort and support layers, foam density, coil gauge – all of these attributes can make a mattress feel more comfortable for people with certain body types, and less so for others. If you weigh more than 230 pounds, a medium firm or firm mattress that conforms less and provides strong support will probably be the most comfortable option. You’ll notice we say “probably” – firmness preferences are subjective. A heavy person might prefer an ultra-soft pillow-top mattress, extra-firm tatami mat, or another bed with a different feel instead. We make general recommendations based on feedback from sleepers in different weight groups, but ultimately you are the best judge of the most comfortable mattress for your body. We’ve shared our picks for some of the best mattresses for heavy people. These selections are based on ratings and reviews from verified mattress owners, as well as our own product research. Further down, we’ll detail the best mattress firmnesses, thicknesses, and materials for heavy people. You’ll also find an overview of basic mattress types, along with a look at pillows, toppers, and other bedding accessories for people who weigh more than 230 pounds. For the purposes of this page, we are talking about individuals who weigh 230 pounds or more. Although we use the term heavy for brevity and convenience to describe sleepers, we do not use weight categories such as “average” or “overweight” as they can be misleading and dependent on the individual. We use 230 or more pounds as a practical standard of size when discussing how mattresses interact with sleepers’ bodies. We have found that individuals who weigh more than 230 pounds will have similar needs for a mattress in terms of firmness, thickness, and other factors with small individual variations.  Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King Shoppers looking for a mattress that offers zoned support Zoned latex and coil system provides enhanced support for shoulders, hips and back Sleeps cool, due to breathable latex and coil support core The WinkBed Plus is a mattress primarily designed for heavy people. The mattress is built with a high-density polyfoam comfort layer and a transitional layer of responsive latex. This latex layer is zoned with different firmness levels to support your shoulders, lower back, and hips while cushioning the lighter areas of the body. This ensures even contouring and weight distribution without excessive sagging. The WinkBed Plus’s pocketed coils are also zoned, with thicker low-gauge coils reinforcing the perimeter while thinner high-gauge coils offer more comfortable support for sleepers. This results in excellent edge support, meaning that most people should feel stable when sleeping or lying near the edges, and when getting in and out of bed. The mattress is a great choice for hot sleepers, as well, thanks to its breathable latex layer and steady airflow through the coils. We recommend the WinkBed Plus to anyone who weighs more than 230 pounds regardless of their normal sleep position. The comfort layers cushion and conform closely enough to ensure better spinal alignment and adequate pressure relief for side sleepers, while back and stomach sleepers receive a comfortable balance of body-contouring and even support. The bed’s zoned layers also provide excellent support for stomach sleepers who weigh 130 to 230 pounds. Other sleepers may find the mattress a bit too firm. The WinkBed Plus has an affordable price-point compared to other hybrid models. The company will also ship for free anywhere in the contiguous U.S. The mattress is backed by a 120-night sleep trial and a lifetime warranty.  Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King Hybrid construction offers strong pressure relief performance Gel-infused foam and breathable cover prevent overheating Get $200 off a DreamCloud Mattress, no code necessary. The DreamCloud is a hybrid mattress that combines layers of memory foam and polyfoam to provide significant pressure relief for heavier sleepers. The mattress is wrapped in a soft, breathable cashmere poly-blend cover, with a layer of polyfoam quilted into the top. A second layer of gel-infused memory foam draws excess heat away from the body, allowing it to dissipate before it builds up. Multiple foam layers in the comfort system provide a luxurious feel that acts as a thick barrier between the sleeper and the support core. The bed’s core is a base of strong, individually wrapped coils that provides the robust support that heavier sleepers need. The DreamCloud’s foam layers and coil support core create a blend of contouring and pushback that works well for sleepers over 230 pounds, regardless of their preferred sleeping positions. The perimeter of the bed is reinforced for added edge support, allowing sleepers to make use of the entire surface. The support core presses into a final layer of foam to absorb some impact and contribute further to the bed’s stability. The mattress has a balanced, versatile medium firm (6) feel that suits the needs of heavier sleepers as well as lighter ones. Sleepers of a wide variety of body types and sleeping positions should find the DreamCloud comfortable, making it a solid choice for couples with vastly different needs. The DreamCloud comes with free shipping to locations within the contiguous U.S., while paid shipping is available to Alaska and Hawaii. The mattress comes with a lengthy 365-night sleep trial after a 30-day break-in period, and is backed by a lifetime warranty.  Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King Helix Dynamic Response Foam balances conforming, responsiveness and support Quality coils and high-density foam for above-average durability Get $200 off + 2 Free Dream Pillows when you spend over $1,750 with code: SLEEPFOUND200 Part of Helix’s newest hybrid mattress line, the Helix Plus is the brand’s only model geared primarily toward heavy and/or tall people. Comfort layers of latex-like Helix Dynamic Response Foam and memory foam create a balance of body-conforming and responsiveness. This results in above-average pressure relief without too much sink for sleepers who weigh more than 230 pounds. A high-density foam transitional layer and thick pocketed coils also offer extra support. Thanks to its deep comfort layers, the Helix Plus isolates and eliminates motion transfer much better than many competing hybrids. The coils are reasonably quiet, as well. These attributes make the mattress a good option for co-sleepers who are easily awakened by their sleep partner’s movements. The bed’s materials are also fairly durable. You can expect the Helix Plus to perform for at least seven years, which is a longer-than-average lifespan for a hybrid model. The Helix Plus is sturdy and supportive enough for any sleeper who weighs more than 230 pounds regardless of their normal sleep position. The balanced contouring is also suitable for many back and stomach sleepers who weigh between 130 to 230 pounds. However, people who weigh less than 130 pounds – especially side sleepers – will probably find the mattress too firm. Compared to other specialty hybrids for heavy people, the Helix Plus has a very affordable price-point. Helix also offers free ground shipping within the contiguous U.S., along with a 100-night sleep trial and 10-year warranty for the mattress.  Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King, Split King People looking for a responsive mattress with zoned support Thick hourglass coils provide deep compression support Get $200 off when you spend $1,000 or more at Saatva.com, no code necessary Introduced in 2019, the Saatva HD is one of the newest mattress models designed primarily for heavy people. The mattress has a comfort layer made of Talalay latex, a material that offers natural responsiveness and durability. The latex is also zoned to cradle your head, neck, and legs while reinforcing the shoulders, back, and hips. This ensures minimal sagging around the midsection – a common issue for sleepers who weigh more than 230 pounds. The Saatva HD feels firm, but it includes a foam-padded pillow-top layer for those who need a bit of extra surface cushioning. The support core consists of hourglass coils made of recycled steel. The coils have a low gauge of 12.5, meaning that they are fairly thick, and they are encased in high-density foam for added support along the perimeter. This results in less sinkage when you sit or sleep near the edges, which can be particularly beneficial for heavy people who feel less stable on beds with weaker edge support. The coils also promote steady airflow to help keep the mattress cool. Additionally, the latex is fairly breathable and will not trap as much heat as foam. As is the case with other mattresses geared toward heavier individuals, the Saatva HD may feel too firm and not conform closely enough for some people who weigh less than 230 pounds – especially side sleepers. The responsive surface, while great for sex, may not isolate enough motion for couples, either. The Saatva HD is somewhat expensive compared to other hybrids. However, Saatva offers free White Glove delivery for all mattress orders. This service includes in-home assembly and old mattress removal at no extra cost. The Saatva HD is backed by a 120-night sleep trial and a 15-year warranty.  Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King Medium firm feel, without the sag of all-foam mattresses High-airflow coil layers and ventilated foam for better temperature regulation Get 15% off a Leesa Mattress with code: SLEEPFOUNDATION The Leesa Legend is another great option for larger people thanks to its robust construction. The mattress contains comfort layers of polyfoam and memory foam over a transitional layer of pocketed minicoils, as well as thick pocketed coils and a base layer of high-density foam for extra reinforcement. This coil-on-coil design delivers exceptionally strong support, but the Leesa Legend has a medium firm (6) feel and shouldn’t feel excessively stiff for people who weigh at least 130 pounds. Temperature regulation is another strong point of this mattress. Both coil layers generate steady airflow to help the Legend maintain a comfortable core temperature, and the top foam layer is ventilated for added surface cooling. The foam and minicoil layers also absorb a good deal of motion to reduce transfer and prevent people from waking up when their partner moves in bed or gets up during the night. Very few hybrids provide this level of motion control. The contouring comfort layers provide ample cushioning for the shoulders and hips, which can improve alignment and decrease pressure for side sleepers. Back sleepers can also rest comfortably on the Legend without sinking too much thanks to the sturdy coil layers. As a luxury hybrid, the Leesa Legend is competitively priced, but Leesa will ship the mattress for free to customers in all 50 states. You’ll receive a 100-night sleep trial with your purchase, along with a 10-year warranty.  Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King Pocketed coils provide excellent stability and edge support Latex hybrids are typically suitable for people who weigh more than 230 pounds because they provide more stability and responsiveness than the average mattress. The Awara Mattress is a standout thanks in part to its comfort layer, which measures 4 inches thick and delivers excellent support. This model’s pocketed coils also reinforce the mattress quite well – especially along the perimeter. The Awara Mattress excels at temperature neutrality, as well. The latex won’t absorb too much body heat, and the pocketed coils generate steady air circulation to help keep the mattress cool. Additionally, the cover is made from a breathable blend of organic cotton and moisture-wicking New Zealand wool. Those who tend to sleep hot should find this mattress quite comfortable. Given its high-quality construction and the natural durability of latex, the Awara Mattress should perform for at least eight years before a replacement is needed. This expected lifespan is much longer than average. And because latex is also more responsive than foam, the mattress should appeal to those who prefer springier surfaces and couples who enjoy bouncy beds for sex. The price-point of the Awara Mattress is on par with the average latex hybrid, but the company provides free shipping to all 50 states. You’ll receive a sleep trial with your purchase that allows you to test out the mattress for up to 365 nights before deciding to return it or keep it, along with a lifetime warranty for added peace of mind.  Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King People who like sleeping on very responsive mattresses Proprietary TitanFlex foam has latex-like responsiveness Solid temperature regulation due to high-airflow coil design Optional cooling top panel with phase-change material Get 20% off a Brooklyn Bedding Mattress with code: sleepfoundation20 The Titan by Brooklyn Bedding is specifically designed for sleepers who weigh more than 230 pounds. The bed is constructed with layers of gel-infused memory foam and a second layer of TitanFlex foam, which has latex-like responsiveness for added bounce. These components, along with foam-reinforced pocketed coils, give the mattress a very firm and supportive feel. Heavy sleepers should experience comfortable conforming and pressure relief without sinking too deeply into the mattress. We also recommend the Titan for hot sleepers because the coils promote steady air circulation to help the mattress maintain a comfortable temperature. If you sleep exceptionally hot, then you may want to consider a specialty cover made of phase-change material for your Titan. This component keeps the surface very cool regardless of how hot you feel. However, please note that this add-on will increase the mattress price. The Titan also isolates motion fairly well compared to other hybrids, making it a good option for co-sleepers who experience movement-related disruptions, and the mattress offers great responsiveness for sex. Although the mattress provides excellent support for people who weigh more than 230 pounds, it will likely feel too firm for those who weigh 230 pounds or less. This is especially true for side sleepers, many of whom feel more comfortable on softer mattresses with extra padding for their shoulders and hips. The Titan has a very affordable price-point compared to other mixed-foam hybrids. Brooklyn Bedding ships the Titan for free to all 50 states, and backs the mattress with a 120-night sleep trial and a 10-year warranty.  Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King, Split King Adaptive polyfoam layers provide above-average pressure relief Coil support layer promotes steady airflow, keeping the mattress cool Save 30% on any Idle mattress with this code: NEWYEAR30 The Idle Hybrid stands out from competitors due largely to its reversible design. Both the top and bottom sides feature sleep surfaces, and owners can switch from one surface to the other simply by flipping over the mattress. Each side is constructed with a comfort layer of adaptive polyfoam that conforms evenly to the body, followed by two denser polyfoam layers to prevent you from sinking too deeply into the mattress. A shared support core of pocketed coils provides added stability and reinforcement. Idle Sleep offers two firmness levels for the hybrid, medium firm (6) and firm (8). You can choose the same feel for both sides, allowing you to periodically rotate the mattress and extend its overall lifespan, or select a different firmness level for each side if you’d rather switch between two different feels. Both firmness options provide great support, but the medium firm feel is better suited to sleepers who want a bit of body-contouring as well. The coil layer promotes steady air circulation to help you and the mattress stay cool. The coils also ensure sturdy edge support, meaning the perimeter won’t sink too much when you get on and off the bed, and that you and your partner can use the entire mattress (as opposed to just the midsection). Thanks to a responsive surface feel, most couples will also find the mattress suitable for sex. Idle Sleep provides an 18-month sleep trial, which is much longer than the average trial period, and the mattress comes with a lifetime warranty for extra peace of mind. All customers in the contiguous U.S. receive free ground shipping with their order.  Side 1: Firm (7) Side 2: Extra Firm (9)  Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King Reversible design with firm and extra firm options The contouring feel of foam, without excessive sinkage Get 20% off a Brooklyn Bedding Mattress with code: sleepfoundation20 The Plank by Brooklyn Bedding is a reversible mattress designed for people with firm preferences. One side of the bed has a firm feel, while the other side is extra firm. This makes the Plank best suited to sleepers over 230 pounds who tend to find all-foam mattresses too soft and prone to excessive sinkage. To adjust the firmness, simply flip the mattress onto its other sleep surface. While both are fairly firm, each side of the Plank offers a distinct feel. The firm side is constructed with fiber padding, along with 2 inches of latex-like TitanFlex foam that contours to the body while remaining noticeably responsive. Thanks to strong support around the midsection, this side is best suited to back and stomach sleepers who weigh at least 130 pounds. Heavy side sleepers may also find this side comfortable, but its lack of cushioning may lead to added pressure on sensitive areas for some. We recommend the extra firm side for back and stomach sleepers looking for extra support around the lower back and hips. Like other all-foam mattresses, the Plank may absorb and trap body heat, causing the mattress to sleep hot. You can select a special cover made of phase-change material for the mattress. This component helps the surface remain cool and comfortable regardless of your body temperature. The Plank is a high-value mattress thanks to its low price-point and strong performance. Brooklyn Bedding will also ship the mattress for free to all 50 states. Lastly, the Plank is backed by a 120-night sleep trial and a 10-year warranty. What Mattress Firmness Is Best for Heavy Sleepers? Mattress firmness is measured using a 1-10 scale, with 1 being the softest and 10 being the firmest. Most beds sold today fall between 3 (soft) and 8 (firm). Firmness preferences are subjective, but most heavy people find medium firm (6) and firm (7-8) mattresses most comfortable. The materials provide some body-contouring and pressure relief but the body won’t sink too much. An extra (9-10) may be the better option for those who want a flush, practically non-conforming sleep surface. In addition to body type, sleep position is another factor that can affect which firmness you prefer. If you’re a , you’ll probably need more cushioning to align your spine and alleviate pressure, whereas back and need less padding and more support to avoid lower back and hip pain. Which Mattress Thickness Is Best for Heavy Sleepers? What type of mattress is best for heavy sleepers? That depends on a lot of factors. For example, the thickness (or profile) can affect how a mattress feels for sleepers who weigh more than 230 pounds. Mattresses sold today fall into three profile categories: Beds that measure thick are considered Beds that measure thick are considered Beds that measure thick are considered While the thickness of a mattress itself doesn’t necessarily determine the feel of a mattress, a higher-profile mattress has more room for layers and materials that affect the feel of a bed. For example, while a low-profile mattress has to be firm enough to prevent sleepers from sinking into the support core, high profile mattresses allow for substantial comfort layers on top of the support core, allowing for a soft mattress that’s still supportive. Thus, most specialty mattresses designed for heavier sleepers are medium- or high-profile in order to provide the support and specific feel their intended to have. That being said, some firmer low-profile mattresses are preferred by heavy sleepers. Which Mattress Features Are Important for Heavy Sleepers? Mattress features can strengthen and stabilize a mattress, resulting in even support and comfortable conforming for sleepers who weigh more than 230 pounds. Some mattress brands tout their models with misleading descriptions, claiming the beds offer “universal comfort” or are suitable for people of any body type. Here’s the truth: each mattress model is constructed with materials that make the bed a better fit for different kinds of sleepers. Rather than marketing claims from mattress brands, heavy sleepers should focus on the following attributes when choosing a new bed. If you prefer closer body-conforming and more pressure relief, then you might want to opt for a memory foam or all-polyfoam mattress. All-latex beds also offer decent contouring, as do with adjustable firmness levels. Hybrids and innersprings are better if you want more support and stability. Responsiveness, also referred to as the ‘bounce’ of the mattress, is one of the most important factors in whether it works for heavy sleepers. Non-responsive mattresses, usually made of memory foam or polyfoam, tend to produce a feeling of being ‘stuck’ in the mattress from excessive sinkage. Responsive mattresses, which are often  of a hybrid, latex, and innerspring construction, allow for better ease-of-movement across the surface. This can be especially relevant when having sex. For any given sleeper, ideal contouring should be close enough to reduce pressure along the shoulders, spine, and hips without sagging excessively. Beds that conform very closely often lack strong support, and this can lead to uncomfortable sinking for sleepers over 230 pounds, so moderate to minimal contouring is usually a good compromise. Medium-profile or high-profile mattresses tend to provide better support for heavy sleepers. Shorter beds may sag too much beneath the sleeper’s midsection, leading to an uncomfortable sinking feeling. However, beds thicker than 12 inches commonly have soft to medium feels due to their extra padding layers, and may not be supportive enough. All-foam mattresses with medium-density or high-density comfort layers sag less for heavy people than models with low-density layers. The same is true of organic and natural latex versus blended and synthetic latex. Thick coil systems in hybrids and innersprings are also important for overall stability and longevity, especially around the edges. For sleepers who weigh more than 230 pounds, beds that offer the best compromise of contouring and support usually have medium firm to extra firm feels. Softer beds – while often ideal for people who weigh less than 230 pounds – tend to sink too much for heavy people. Heavy sleepers tend to experience pressure build-up in the shoulders, hips, and other areas on mattresses that don’t support the body properly. Pressure relief is somewhat tied to sleep position. Side sleepers often experience more pressure because this position does not naturally align the spine as back or stomach sleeping does. Most mattresses sold today fall into one of five categories: hybrid, innerspring, latex, airbed, or foam. Despite some minor variations and notable outlier models, the mattresses in each category share consistent features, characteristics, performance ratings, and price ranges. Hybrids are constructed with comfort layers of memory foam and/or latex over a pocketed coil support core. They are designed to cushion and conform to the body, but the coils usually give the surface a fairly supportive and responsive feel. Hybrids usually perform for six to seven years and have an average price range of $1,600 to $2,000. Hybrid mattresses are a happy medium for many heavy sleepers because they offer the contouring and pressure relief of foam and latex beds, along with the strong support and consistent temperature neutrality of innerspring mattresses. Hybrid models with thicker coils usually provide the best stability if you weigh more than 230 pounds. Most innersprings have relatively thin polyfoam comfort layers and a support core with non-pocketed Bonnell, offset, or continuous wire coils. Some have transitional minicoils, as well. Innersprings don’t conform very closely, and they feel responsive and bouncy. The average innerspring lasts for five to seven years and has a price-point of $900 to $1,100. Innersprings usually feel very stable because their coil support cores are considerably thicker than the comfort layers. Sleepers over 230 pounds remain on an even plane. You won’t sink very much, and you’ll experience little to no added pressure. Most innersprings promote steady airflow to help you sleep cool, too. Latex is produced from the sap of rubber trees. The material is naturally responsive. It also contours to sleepers, but usually not to the same extent as foam. Latex is very durable, as well, and all-latex beds have a lifespan of at least eight years. The average price range for these mattresses is $1,600 to $2,000. Latex won’t deteriorate and lose its shape as quickly as foam. This means better support and less sink over time, especially if you weigh more than 230 pounds. The material’s contouring ability is great if you want pressure relief without the body hug. Airbeds are designed with adjustable air chambers in their support cores. Owners can add or release air from the chambers to change the firmness of the mattress. Airbeds may also have foam, memory foam, and/or latex comfort layers. The average airbed costs between $2,000 to $2,400 and will perform for at least eight years if properly maintained. The major asset of airbeds is their firmness selection. Many of these models can be adjusted for soft or firm feels, along with a lot of different levels in between. Some are also engineered for dual-firmness with distinct feels on both sides of the bed. If your comfort preferences fluctuate from night to night, You should consider an airbed if your comfort preferences fluctuate from night to night, but be warned: these mattresses are generally very pricey. Foam beds may have polyfoam and/or memory foam comfort and transitional layers, along with a support core of high-density polyfoam. These beds tend to conform more closely and alleviate pressure better than other mattress types. The comfort layers also absorb and isolate motion transfer for couples, and the beds are virtually silent. Foam beds are the best choice if you like close conforming, or if you experience pressure points in your shoulders, back, and hips. Heavy sleepers should choose a foam mattress that feels firm and supportive enough for their body, and will conform without sagging too much. The Ideal Sleeping Environment for Heavier Sleepers In addition to choosing the right mattress, you can optimize your sleep environment with certain bedding accessories. These include pillows, mattress toppers, and a suitable support system for your bed. often take a backseat to mattresses when we talk about comfort and support, but they’re a crucial component of your bedding setup. The right pillow can support the spine, alleviate pressure, and improve sleep quality and duration. The wrong pillow, on the other hand, can lead to added discomfort along the neck and shoulders, and may also contribute to spinal misalignment. You should consider several factors when shopping for a pillow. Arguably the most important variable is loft, or thickness. Pillows may be , , or . The pillow should pad the areas between your head, neck, and shoulders to support your spine. For this reason, the best pillow loft for a given sleeper primarily depends on their sleep position, as shown in the table below. The pillow fill and density are also crucial. Fill refers to the material used to pad the pillow’s interior, and these materials vary in terms of head and neck support. Some resist sinking and feel fairly stable, while others conform closely for more of a cradling sensation. Density – measured in pounds per cubic foot (PCF) – refers to how compact and heavy the fill material feels. High-density memory foam, for instance, will maintain a fuller shape and provide better support than foam with a medium or low density. Memory foam pillows may contain a single piece of memory foam. These pillows tend to be fairly dense and will maintain their shape fairly well, especially pillows with denser foam. Other models contain shredded memory foam. Shredded foam does not feel as firm or dense, but owners can usually add or remove foam to adjust the loft and improve support as needed. Feathers are coarse outer plumage found on ducks and geese, while down is the softer inner plumage from the same animals. These pillows generally feel very light and soft, and they do not provide strong support for the head, neck, and shoulders. As a result, you may not feel as comfortable on feather/down pillows if you weigh more than 230 pounds. Buckwheat pillows are filled with hulls, the hard outer shells of buckwheat kernels. These pillows feel exceptionally firm and offer strong, long-lasting spinal support. Their loft can be adjusted by adding or removing hulls, as well. Polyfill pillows include those with down alternative, a polyester material designed to mimic the softness and lightness of authentic down. These pillows are a bit more stable than their natural counterparts but still tend to sink a bit. Another polyfill variety is interlocking polyester, which is designed to retain a fuller shape. A mattress topper is a cushioning layer placed on top of a mattress surface to change the bed’s overall feel. Most toppers are designed to make mattresses feel softer, but some feel fairly firm and can be used on soft beds. Toppers usually measure 2 to 5 inches thick. They can be made from materials such as memory foam, latex, convoluted (egg-crate) polyfoam, wool, and feathers/down. You may benefit from a topper if your mattress offers good support but feels a bit too firm for your liking. Alternatively, a firmer topper may be useful if your mattress is excessively soft. Using a topper is a cost-effective way to adjust the firmness of a mattress compared to buying a new bed altogether. That said, toppers do not provide as much pressure relief due to their lower profiles. They are also less durable than mattresses, making them a somewhat temporary solution. You can choose from different support systems for your bed. A traditional box spring features a wooden frame with steel springs and a cloth cover, which is placed on top of a bed frame. Box springs support mattresses with a flush surface so the mattress won’t sag, and the springs absorb shock from you and the bed. This makes them ideal for . Box springs provide decent stability for heavy sleepers, provided they’re well-made. Foundations usually consist of a fabric-encased frame with slatted sides and a flush surface. They do not contain steel coils like box springs, but their surfaces tend to feel firmer and offer adequate support for any mattress type. Foundations are also placed on a bed frame with the mattress on top. Platform beds feature a wooden or metal frame with evenly spaced slats to support the mattress, rather than a flush surface, along with legs and center support bars. Slat dimensions are crucial for platform beds because heavier mattresses will sag between the cracks if the slats are too widely spaced, resulting in loss of support and less durability. This problem may be compounded if you weigh more than 230 pounds. Platform beds with properly spaced slats, however, can offer the same support as box springs and foundations.

Learn more about our process Every mattress is built for a certain body type. How thick and firm the bed is, the materials used to make the comfort and support layers, foam density, coil gauge – all of these attributes can make a mattress feel more comfortable for people with certain body types, and less so for others. If you weigh more than 230 pounds, a medium firm or firm mattress that conforms less and provides strong support will probably be the most comfortable option. You’ll notice we say “probably” – firmness preferences are subjective. A heavy person might prefer an ultra-soft pillow-top mattress, extra-firm tatami mat, or another bed with a different feel instead. We make general recommendations based on feedback from sleepers in different weight groups, but ultimately you are the best judge of the most comfortable mattress for your body. We’ve shared our picks for some of the best mattresses for heavy people. These selections are based on ratings and reviews from verified mattress owners, as well as our own product research. Further down, we’ll detail the best mattress firmnesses, thicknesses, and materials for heavy people. You’ll also find an overview of basic mattress types, along with a look at pillows, toppers, and other bedding accessories for people who weigh more than 230 pounds. For the purposes of this page, we are talking about individuals who weigh 230 pounds or more. Although we use the term heavy for brevity and convenience to describe sleepers, we do not use weight categories such as “average” or “overweight” as they can be misleading and dependent on the individual. We use 230 or more pounds as a practical standard of size when discussing how mattresses interact with sleepers’ bodies. We have found that individuals who weigh more than 230 pounds will have similar needs for a mattress in terms of firmness, thickness, and other factors with small individual variations.  Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King Shoppers looking for a mattress that offers zoned support Zoned latex and coil system provides enhanced support for shoulders, hips and back Sleeps cool, due to breathable latex and coil support core The WinkBed Plus is a mattress primarily designed for heavy people. The mattress is built with a high-density polyfoam comfort layer and a transitional layer of responsive latex. This latex layer is zoned with different firmness levels to support your shoulders, lower back, and hips while cushioning the lighter areas of the body. This ensures even contouring and weight distribution without excessive sagging. The WinkBed Plus’s pocketed coils are also zoned, with thicker low-gauge coils reinforcing the perimeter while thinner high-gauge coils offer more comfortable support for sleepers. This results in excellent edge support, meaning that most people should feel stable when sleeping or lying near the edges, and when getting in and out of bed. The mattress is a great choice for hot sleepers, as well, thanks to its breathable latex layer and steady airflow through the coils. We recommend the WinkBed Plus to anyone who weighs more than 230 pounds regardless of their normal sleep position. The comfort layers cushion and conform closely enough to ensure better spinal alignment and adequate pressure relief for side sleepers, while back and stomach sleepers receive a comfortable balance of body-contouring and even support. The bed’s zoned layers also provide excellent support for stomach sleepers who weigh 130 to 230 pounds. Other sleepers may find the mattress a bit too firm. The WinkBed Plus has an affordable price-point compared to other hybrid models. The company will also ship for free anywhere in the contiguous U.S. The mattress is backed by a 120-night sleep trial and a lifetime warranty.  Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King Hybrid construction offers strong pressure relief performance Gel-infused foam and breathable cover prevent overheating Get $200 off a DreamCloud Mattress, no code necessary. The DreamCloud is a hybrid mattress that combines layers of memory foam and polyfoam to provide significant pressure relief for heavier sleepers. The mattress is wrapped in a soft, breathable cashmere poly-blend cover, with a layer of polyfoam quilted into the top. A second layer of gel-infused memory foam draws excess heat away from the body, allowing it to dissipate before it builds up. Multiple foam layers in the comfort system provide a luxurious feel that acts as a thick barrier between the sleeper and the support core. The bed’s core is a base of strong, individually wrapped coils that provides the robust support that heavier sleepers need. The DreamCloud’s foam layers and coil support core create a blend of contouring and pushback that works well for sleepers over 230 pounds, regardless of their preferred sleeping positions. The perimeter of the bed is reinforced for added edge support, allowing sleepers to make use of the entire surface. The support core presses into a final layer of foam to absorb some impact and contribute further to the bed’s stability. The mattress has a balanced, versatile medium firm (6) feel that suits the needs of heavier sleepers as well as lighter ones. Sleepers of a wide variety of body types and sleeping positions should find the DreamCloud comfortable, making it a solid choice for couples with vastly different needs. The DreamCloud comes with free shipping to locations within the contiguous U.S., while paid shipping is available to Alaska and Hawaii. The mattress comes with a lengthy 365-night sleep trial after a 30-day break-in period, and is backed by a lifetime warranty.  Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King Helix Dynamic Response Foam balances conforming, responsiveness and support Quality coils and high-density foam for above-average durability Get $200 off + 2 Free Dream Pillows when you spend over $1,750 with code: SLEEPFOUND200 Part of Helix’s newest hybrid mattress line, the Helix Plus is the brand’s only model geared primarily toward heavy and/or tall people. Comfort layers of latex-like Helix Dynamic Response Foam and memory foam create a balance of body-conforming and responsiveness. This results in above-average pressure relief without too much sink for sleepers who weigh more than 230 pounds. A high-density foam transitional layer and thick pocketed coils also offer extra support. Thanks to its deep comfort layers, the Helix Plus isolates and eliminates motion transfer much better than many competing hybrids. The coils are reasonably quiet, as well. These attributes make the mattress a good option for co-sleepers who are easily awakened by their sleep partner’s movements. The bed’s materials are also fairly durable. You can expect the Helix Plus to perform for at least seven years, which is a longer-than-average lifespan for a hybrid model. The Helix Plus is sturdy and supportive enough for any sleeper who weighs more than 230 pounds regardless of their normal sleep position. The balanced contouring is also suitable for many back and stomach sleepers who weigh between 130 to 230 pounds. However, people who weigh less than 130 pounds – especially side sleepers – will probably find the mattress too firm. Compared to other specialty hybrids for heavy people, the Helix Plus has a very affordable price-point. Helix also offers free ground shipping within the contiguous U.S., along with a 100-night sleep trial and 10-year warranty for the mattress.  Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King, Split King People looking for a responsive mattress with zoned support Thick hourglass coils provide deep compression support Get $200 off when you spend $1,000 or more at Saatva.com, no code necessary Introduced in 2019, the Saatva HD is one of the newest mattress models designed primarily for heavy people. The mattress has a comfort layer made of Talalay latex, a material that offers natural responsiveness and durability. The latex is also zoned to cradle your head, neck, and legs while reinforcing the shoulders, back, and hips. This ensures minimal sagging around the midsection – a common issue for sleepers who weigh more than 230 pounds. The Saatva HD feels firm, but it includes a foam-padded pillow-top layer for those who need a bit of extra surface cushioning. The support core consists of hourglass coils made of recycled steel. The coils have a low gauge of 12.5, meaning that they are fairly thick, and they are encased in high-density foam for added support along the perimeter. This results in less sinkage when you sit or sleep near the edges, which can be particularly beneficial for heavy people who feel less stable on beds with weaker edge support. The coils also promote steady airflow to help keep the mattress cool. Additionally, the latex is fairly breathable and will not trap as much heat as foam. As is the case with other mattresses geared toward heavier individuals, the Saatva HD may feel too firm and not conform closely enough for some people who weigh less than 230 pounds – especially side sleepers. The responsive surface, while great for sex, may not isolate enough motion for couples, either. The Saatva HD is somewhat expensive compared to other hybrids. However, Saatva offers free White Glove delivery for all mattress orders. This service includes in-home assembly and old mattress removal at no extra cost. The Saatva HD is backed by a 120-night sleep trial and a 15-year warranty.  Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King Medium firm feel, without the sag of all-foam mattresses High-airflow coil layers and ventilated foam for better temperature regulation Get 15% off a Leesa Mattress with code: SLEEPFOUNDATION The Leesa Legend is another great option for larger people thanks to its robust construction. The mattress contains comfort layers of polyfoam and memory foam over a transitional layer of pocketed minicoils, as well as thick pocketed coils and a base layer of high-density foam for extra reinforcement. This coil-on-coil design delivers exceptionally strong support, but the Leesa Legend has a medium firm (6) feel and shouldn’t feel excessively stiff for people who weigh at least 130 pounds. Temperature regulation is another strong point of this mattress. Both coil layers generate steady airflow to help the Legend maintain a comfortable core temperature, and the top foam layer is ventilated for added surface cooling. The foam and minicoil layers also absorb a good deal of motion to reduce transfer and prevent people from waking up when their partner moves in bed or gets up during the night. Very few hybrids provide this level of motion control. The contouring comfort layers provide ample cushioning for the shoulders and hips, which can improve alignment and decrease pressure for side sleepers. Back sleepers can also rest comfortably on the Legend without sinking too much thanks to the sturdy coil layers. As a luxury hybrid, the Leesa Legend is competitively priced, but Leesa will ship the mattress for free to customers in all 50 states. You’ll receive a 100-night sleep trial with your purchase, along with a 10-year warranty.  Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King Pocketed coils provide excellent stability and edge support Latex hybrids are typically suitable for people who weigh more than 230 pounds because they provide more stability and responsiveness than the average mattress. The Awara Mattress is a standout thanks in part to its comfort layer, which measures 4 inches thick and delivers excellent support. This model’s pocketed coils also reinforce the mattress quite well – especially along the perimeter. The Awara Mattress excels at temperature neutrality, as well. The latex won’t absorb too much body heat, and the pocketed coils generate steady air circulation to help keep the mattress cool. Additionally, the cover is made from a breathable blend of organic cotton and moisture-wicking New Zealand wool. Those who tend to sleep hot should find this mattress quite comfortable. Given its high-quality construction and the natural durability of latex, the Awara Mattress should perform for at least eight years before a replacement is needed. This expected lifespan is much longer than average. And because latex is also more responsive than foam, the mattress should appeal to those who prefer springier surfaces and couples who enjoy bouncy beds for sex. The price-point of the Awara Mattress is on par with the average latex hybrid, but the company provides free shipping to all 50 states. You’ll receive a sleep trial with your purchase that allows you to test out the mattress for up to 365 nights before deciding to return it or keep it, along with a lifetime warranty for added peace of mind.  Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King People who like sleeping on very responsive mattresses Proprietary TitanFlex foam has latex-like responsiveness Solid temperature regulation due to high-airflow coil design Optional cooling top panel with phase-change material Get 20% off a Brooklyn Bedding Mattress with code: sleepfoundation20 The Titan by Brooklyn Bedding is specifically designed for sleepers who weigh more than 230 pounds. The bed is constructed with layers of gel-infused memory foam and a second layer of TitanFlex foam, which has latex-like responsiveness for added bounce. These components, along with foam-reinforced pocketed coils, give the mattress a very firm and supportive feel. Heavy sleepers should experience comfortable conforming and pressure relief without sinking too deeply into the mattress. We also recommend the Titan for hot sleepers because the coils promote steady air circulation to help the mattress maintain a comfortable temperature. If you sleep exceptionally hot, then you may want to consider a specialty cover made of phase-change material for your Titan. This component keeps the surface very cool regardless of how hot you feel. However, please note that this add-on will increase the mattress price. The Titan also isolates motion fairly well compared to other hybrids, making it a good option for co-sleepers who experience movement-related disruptions, and the mattress offers great responsiveness for sex. Although the mattress provides excellent support for people who weigh more than 230 pounds, it will likely feel too firm for those who weigh 230 pounds or less. This is especially true for side sleepers, many of whom feel more comfortable on softer mattresses with extra padding for their shoulders and hips. The Titan has a very affordable price-point compared to other mixed-foam hybrids. Brooklyn Bedding ships the Titan for free to all 50 states, and backs the mattress with a 120-night sleep trial and a 10-year warranty.  Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King, Split King Adaptive polyfoam layers provide above-average pressure relief Coil support layer promotes steady airflow, keeping the mattress cool Save 30% on any Idle mattress with this code: NEWYEAR30 The Idle Hybrid stands out from competitors due largely to its reversible design. Both the top and bottom sides feature sleep surfaces, and owners can switch from one surface to the other simply by flipping over the mattress. Each side is constructed with a comfort layer of adaptive polyfoam that conforms evenly to the body, followed by two denser polyfoam layers to prevent you from sinking too deeply into the mattress. A shared support core of pocketed coils provides added stability and reinforcement. Idle Sleep offers two firmness levels for the hybrid, medium firm (6) and firm (8). You can choose the same feel for both sides, allowing you to periodically rotate the mattress and extend its overall lifespan, or select a different firmness level for each side if you’d rather switch between two different feels. Both firmness options provide great support, but the medium firm feel is better suited to sleepers who want a bit of body-contouring as well. The coil layer promotes steady air circulation to help you and the mattress stay cool. The coils also ensure sturdy edge support, meaning the perimeter won’t sink too much when you get on and off the bed, and that you and your partner can use the entire mattress (as opposed to just the midsection). Thanks to a responsive surface feel, most couples will also find the mattress suitable for sex. Idle Sleep provides an 18-month sleep trial, which is much longer than the average trial period, and the mattress comes with a lifetime warranty for extra peace of mind. All customers in the contiguous U.S. receive free ground shipping with their order.  Side 1: Firm (7) Side 2: Extra Firm (9)  Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King Reversible design with firm and extra firm options The contouring feel of foam, without excessive sinkage Get 20% off a Brooklyn Bedding Mattress with code: sleepfoundation20 The Plank by Brooklyn Bedding is a reversible mattress designed for people with firm preferences. One side of the bed has a firm feel, while the other side is extra firm. This makes the Plank best suited to sleepers over 230 pounds who tend to find all-foam mattresses too soft and prone to excessive sinkage. To adjust the firmness, simply flip the mattress onto its other sleep surface. While both are fairly firm, each side of the Plank offers a distinct feel. The firm side is constructed with fiber padding, along with 2 inches of latex-like TitanFlex foam that contours to the body while remaining noticeably responsive. Thanks to strong support around the midsection, this side is best suited to back and stomach sleepers who weigh at least 130 pounds. Heavy side sleepers may also find this side comfortable, but its lack of cushioning may lead to added pressure on sensitive areas for some. We recommend the extra firm side for back and stomach sleepers looking for extra support around the lower back and hips. Like other all-foam mattresses, the Plank may absorb and trap body heat, causing the mattress to sleep hot. You can select a special cover made of phase-change material for the mattress. This component helps the surface remain cool and comfortable regardless of your body temperature. The Plank is a high-value mattress thanks to its low price-point and strong performance. Brooklyn Bedding will also ship the mattress for free to all 50 states. Lastly, the Plank is backed by a 120-night sleep trial and a 10-year warranty. What Mattress Firmness Is Best for Heavy Sleepers? Mattress firmness is measured using a 1-10 scale, with 1 being the softest and 10 being the firmest. Most beds sold today fall between 3 (soft) and 8 (firm). Firmness preferences are subjective, but most heavy people find medium firm (6) and firm (7-8) mattresses most comfortable. The materials provide some body-contouring and pressure relief but the body won’t sink too much. An extra (9-10) may be the better option for those who want a flush, practically non-conforming sleep surface. In addition to body type, sleep position is another factor that can affect which firmness you prefer. If you’re a , you’ll probably need more cushioning to align your spine and alleviate pressure, whereas back and need less padding and more support to avoid lower back and hip pain. Which Mattress Thickness Is Best for Heavy Sleepers? What type of mattress is best for heavy sleepers? That depends on a lot of factors. For example, the thickness (or profile) can affect how a mattress feels for sleepers who weigh more than 230 pounds. Mattresses sold today fall into three profile categories: Beds that measure thick are considered Beds that measure thick are considered Beds that measure thick are considered While the thickness of a mattress itself doesn’t necessarily determine the feel of a mattress, a higher-profile mattress has more room for layers and materials that affect the feel of a bed. For example, while a low-profile mattress has to be firm enough to prevent sleepers from sinking into the support core, high profile mattresses allow for substantial comfort layers on top of the support core, allowing for a soft mattress that’s still supportive. Thus, most specialty mattresses designed for heavier sleepers are medium- or high-profile in order to provide the support and specific feel their intended to have. That being said, some firmer low-profile mattresses are preferred by heavy sleepers. Which Mattress Features Are Important for Heavy Sleepers? Mattress features can strengthen and stabilize a mattress, resulting in even support and comfortable conforming for sleepers who weigh more than 230 pounds. Some mattress brands tout their models with misleading descriptions, claiming the beds offer “universal comfort” or are suitable for people of any body type. Here’s the truth: each mattress model is constructed with materials that make the bed a better fit for different kinds of sleepers. Rather than marketing claims from mattress brands, heavy sleepers should focus on the following attributes when choosing a new bed. If you prefer closer body-conforming and more pressure relief, then you might want to opt for a memory foam or all-polyfoam mattress. All-latex beds also offer decent contouring, as do with adjustable firmness levels. Hybrids and innersprings are better if you want more support and stability. Responsiveness, also referred to as the ‘bounce’ of the mattress, is one of the most important factors in whether it works for heavy sleepers. Non-responsive mattresses, usually made of memory foam or polyfoam, tend to produce a feeling of being ‘stuck’ in the mattress from excessive sinkage. Responsive mattresses, which are often  of a hybrid, latex, and innerspring construction, allow for better ease-of-movement across the surface. This can be especially relevant when having sex. For any given sleeper, ideal contouring should be close enough to reduce pressure along the shoulders, spine, and hips without sagging excessively. Beds that conform very closely often lack strong support, and this can lead to uncomfortable sinking for sleepers over 230 pounds, so moderate to minimal contouring is usually a good compromise. Medium-profile or high-profile mattresses tend to provide better support for heavy sleepers. Shorter beds may sag too much beneath the sleeper’s midsection, leading to an uncomfortable sinking feeling. However, beds thicker than 12 inches commonly have soft to medium feels due to their extra padding layers, and may not be supportive enough. All-foam mattresses with medium-density or high-density comfort layers sag less for heavy people than models with low-density layers. The same is true of organic and natural latex versus blended and synthetic latex. Thick coil systems in hybrids and innersprings are also important for overall stability and longevity, especially around the edges. For sleepers who weigh more than 230 pounds, beds that offer the best compromise of contouring and support usually have medium firm to extra firm feels. Softer beds – while often ideal for people who weigh less than 230 pounds – tend to sink too much for heavy people. Heavy sleepers tend to experience pressure build-up in the shoulders, hips, and other areas on mattresses that don’t support the body properly. Pressure relief is somewhat tied to sleep position. Side sleepers often experience more pressure because this position does not naturally align the spine as back or stomach sleeping does. Most mattresses sold today fall into one of five categories: hybrid, innerspring, latex, airbed, or foam. Despite some minor variations and notable outlier models, the mattresses in each category share consistent features, characteristics, performance ratings, and price ranges. Hybrids are constructed with comfort layers of memory foam and/or latex over a pocketed coil support core. They are designed to cushion and conform to the body, but the coils usually give the surface a fairly supportive and responsive feel. Hybrids usually perform for six to seven years and have an average price range of $1,600 to $2,000. Hybrid mattresses are a happy medium for many heavy sleepers because they offer the contouring and pressure relief of foam and latex beds, along with the strong support and consistent temperature neutrality of innerspring mattresses. Hybrid models with thicker coils usually provide the best stability if you weigh more than 230 pounds. Most innersprings have relatively thin polyfoam comfort layers and a support core with non-pocketed Bonnell, offset, or continuous wire coils. Some have transitional minicoils, as well. Innersprings don’t conform very closely, and they feel responsive and bouncy. The average innerspring lasts for five to seven years and has a price-point of $900 to $1,100. Innersprings usually feel very stable because their coil support cores are considerably thicker than the comfort layers. Sleepers over 230 pounds remain on an even plane. You won’t sink very much, and you’ll experience little to no added pressure. Most innersprings promote steady airflow to help you sleep cool, too. Latex is produced from the sap of rubber trees. The material is naturally responsive. It also contours to sleepers, but usually not to the same extent as foam. Latex is very durable, as well, and all-latex beds have a lifespan of at least eight years. The average price range for these mattresses is $1,600 to $2,000. Latex won’t deteriorate and lose its shape as quickly as foam. This means better support and less sink over time, especially if you weigh more than 230 pounds. The material’s contouring ability is great if you want pressure relief without the body hug. Airbeds are designed with adjustable air chambers in their support cores. Owners can add or release air from the chambers to change the firmness of the mattress. Airbeds may also have foam, memory foam, and/or latex comfort layers. The average airbed costs between $2,000 to $2,400 and will perform for at least eight years if properly maintained. The major asset of airbeds is their firmness selection. Many of these models can be adjusted for soft or firm feels, along with a lot of different levels in between. Some are also engineered for dual-firmness with distinct feels on both sides of the bed. If your comfort preferences fluctuate from night to night, You should consider an airbed if your comfort preferences fluctuate from night to night, but be warned: these mattresses are generally very pricey. Foam beds may have polyfoam and/or memory foam comfort and transitional layers, along with a support core of high-density polyfoam. These beds tend to conform more closely and alleviate pressure better than other mattress types. The comfort layers also absorb and isolate motion transfer for couples, and the beds are virtually silent. Foam beds are the best choice if you like close conforming, or if you experience pressure points in your shoulders, back, and hips. Heavy sleepers should choose a foam mattress that feels firm and supportive enough for their body, and will conform without sagging too much. The Ideal Sleeping Environment for Heavier Sleepers In addition to choosing the right mattress, you can optimize your sleep environment with certain bedding accessories. These include pillows, mattress toppers, and a suitable support system for your bed. often take a backseat to mattresses when we talk about comfort and support, but they’re a crucial component of your bedding setup. The right pillow can support the spine, alleviate pressure, and improve sleep quality and duration. The wrong pillow, on the other hand, can lead to added discomfort along the neck and shoulders, and may also contribute to spinal misalignment. You should consider several factors when shopping for a pillow. Arguably the most important variable is loft, or thickness. Pillows may be , , or . The pillow should pad the areas between your head, neck, and shoulders to support your spine. For this reason, the best pillow loft for a given sleeper primarily depends on their sleep position, as shown in the table below. The pillow fill and density are also crucial. Fill refers to the material used to pad the pillow’s interior, and these materials vary in terms of head and neck support. Some resist sinking and feel fairly stable, while others conform closely for more of a cradling sensation. Density – measured in pounds per cubic foot (PCF) – refers to how compact and heavy the fill material feels. High-density memory foam, for instance, will maintain a fuller shape and provide better support than foam with a medium or low density. Memory foam pillows may contain a single piece of memory foam. These pillows tend to be fairly dense and will maintain their shape fairly well, especially pillows with denser foam. Other models contain shredded memory foam. Shredded foam does not feel as firm or dense, but owners can usually add or remove foam to adjust the loft and improve support as needed. Feathers are coarse outer plumage found on ducks and geese, while down is the softer inner plumage from the same animals. These pillows generally feel very light and soft, and they do not provide strong support for the head, neck, and shoulders. As a result, you may not feel as comfortable on feather/down pillows if you weigh more than 230 pounds. Buckwheat pillows are filled with hulls, the hard outer shells of buckwheat kernels. These pillows feel exceptionally firm and offer strong, long-lasting spinal support. Their loft can be adjusted by adding or removing hulls, as well. Polyfill pillows include those with down alternative, a polyester material designed to mimic the softness and lightness of authentic down. These pillows are a bit more stable than their natural counterparts but still tend to sink a bit. Another polyfill variety is interlocking polyester, which is designed to retain a fuller shape. A mattress topper is a cushioning layer placed on top of a mattress surface to change the bed’s overall feel. Most toppers are designed to make mattresses feel softer, but some feel fairly firm and can be used on soft beds. Toppers usually measure 2 to 5 inches thick. They can be made from materials such as memory foam, latex, convoluted (egg-crate) polyfoam, wool, and feathers/down. You may benefit from a topper if your mattress offers good support but feels a bit too firm for your liking. Alternatively, a firmer topper may be useful if your mattress is excessively soft. Using a topper is a cost-effective way to adjust the firmness of a mattress compared to buying a new bed altogether. That said, toppers do not provide as much pressure relief due to their lower profiles. They are also less durable than mattresses, making them a somewhat temporary solution. You can choose from different support systems for your bed. A traditional box spring features a wooden frame with steel springs and a cloth cover, which is placed on top of a bed frame. Box springs support mattresses with a flush surface so the mattress won’t sag, and the springs absorb shock from you and the bed. This makes them ideal for . Box springs provide decent stability for heavy sleepers, provided they’re well-made. Foundations usually consist of a fabric-encased frame with slatted sides and a flush surface. They do not contain steel coils like box springs, but their surfaces tend to feel firmer and offer adequate support for any mattress type. Foundations are also placed on a bed frame with the mattress on top. Platform beds feature a wooden or metal frame with evenly spaced slats to support the mattress, rather than a flush surface, along with legs and center support bars. Slat dimensions are crucial for platform beds because heavier mattresses will sag between the cracks if the slats are too widely spaced, resulting in loss of support and less durability. This problem may be compounded if you weigh more than 230 pounds. Platform beds with properly spaced slats, however, can offer the same support as box springs and foundations.

c8c98a32-3643-4f54-b64a-fdb5f796a065,"Can Allergy Cause Headache, Joint Pain Or Neck Pain? Allergic conditions are now in full action, and people all over the world (including me and you) are searching for the tips to abolish it so that we can keep ourselves and our family free from it. Basically, allergy is an abnormal immune reaction to a normal substance. It may be food, plant, or animal that your body visualizes as a harmful obstacle. These obstacles are said to be allergens. As a reaction, your body secretes a chemical substance called histamines into the veins and arteries which induces some sort of allergy to the body. Problems such as headache, sore throat, stuffy nose, watery eyes, runny nose, sinus, hives, sneezing, and cough are common allergy symptoms that are often seen. These allergic indications are becoming the real health challenges for all of us and should be better prevented than cured. If not controlled allergic reactions can even cause symptoms like joint pain, neck-shoulder pain, and migraine headache. Now the real question arises that; How could allergies, acid reflux, joint pain, and headaches all be related? Yea, of course, it is through the Brain stem. The brain stem is basically an elongation of the brain (present as a stem-like part) which extends down in the upper cervical spine and gets connected to the spinal cord. This is the real part of our body that connects/relates all the conditions prevailing in the body. Tips for Getting Rid of Allergies Headache Back and Neck Pain Every one of us, have already suffered from a headache, may be mild or severe. There are also certain people who suffer from severe head pain, the whole day long. Migraine is a kind of severe headache which occurs at an average rate of 1-2 times a month and may last from 2 hours to 2 days. The connection between migraine and allergy is, its a chemical reaction to an allergen, which annoys the blood vessels. Some usual triggering factors for migraine are changes in serotonin metabolism, low magnesium level, food allergies, hormonal imbalances, and stress. A migraine headache can be a severe problem for many which makes the body inactive to do any kind of job while creating the feeling of discomfort and annoyances. Allergy symptoms are most of the time aggravated during the allergy season such or spring season when the pollen counts are high in the environment. Some may suffer from mild symptoms such as sneezing or headache which gets treated on it’s with some home remedies. However, there are many who suffer from major issues such as sinusitis, joint pain, swelling, inflammation, fatigue, respiratory or breathing problems, etc. If not treated soon these may cause wreak havoc on your body. But before getting the right treatment method, you should try to figure out the real cause of the problem. Simply saying you should identify the triggers and the real allergies that are causing you’re the joint pain or any other symptoms. Although bad weather is the main reason for allergies and joint pain, there can be various other allergens that can be causing the problems in your body. These may include mold, pets and dogs, food (such as wheat, milk, gluten, nuts, etc.) and others. Knowing the real cause of allergy is important due to the fact that, best possible treatment options for allergies and joint pain can be figured out after knowing the reason for allergy. It may not be hard to believe for you that allergies can cause mild to severe headache problems in individuals. But would you ever believe that allergies can cause tension which can result in joint pains such as back, neck, and shoulder pain? For sure the above-mentioned statement is correct, as headache acts as a bridge between the allergy and . In simple words, severe headaches can radiate down to other body parts making the body much painful. Allergy arising from any sources may make our mind stressful due to which headache may be caused. Such a headache will make our body feel discomfort from the surroundings. And as such tension arising from these many sources may lead to neck pain also. The pain in the neck occurs when the neck gets tighten and get cramped. The typing work on the computer for prolonged hours is one of the most prominent reasons for such pains in the joints or cervical region. Especially when the typing position is not comfortable, it causes strain and may result in neck joint pain and headache along with weird back pain. And even worse can happen, if you are sitting and working with a window open in your room, during the spring season. Spring allergies can aggravate joint pain in your body no matter while you are sleeping or working in your room. Tips for Getting Rid of Allergies Headache Back and Neck Pain In the United States, it has been seen that people suffer most from allergies during the spring season when the pollen counts are quite high. This is the season when flowers start budding and trees start blooming. These seasonal allergies can also be referred to as hay fever and there are many different factors that affect the intensity as well as the duration of allergy season (and thus allergy symptoms). As said above, you should best get aware of the conditions and environmental conditions that are making you allergic, before actually trying the preventive or curative methods. One of the best ways to avoid allergy symptoms such as joint pain is by staying indoors during the peak allergy time (mid-day or afternoon). In case you need to go out, take the shower after you are being to outdoor conditions. People who are allergic and need to work outdoors may consider wearing the filter mask which will prevent allergies and hence painful conditions. Adding a good humidifier and a purifier into your room can also help in staying away from all the allergic conditions, especially caused due to airborne allergens. You may consider buying a good humidifier with purifier combo which serves both the purposes i.e. filtering and humidifying the air in the room. Proper awareness about the diet, the food, or drink which makes us allergic will help to reduce the effect of allergic disorders. Certain foods, drinks, illnesses, and working without proper glasses may cause allergic conditions in the body which in turn results in neck, back, ear, or head pain. However, doing your work in a way that refreshes your body and mind will reduce the tension and stress. And thus reduces the associated problems. Effective medications (both over-the-counter as well as prescription required) for treating and controlling the allergy symptoms are often recommended by the doctor. These may include antihistamines, nose sprays, etc. Over the counter drugs such as Tylenol and Advil can work great in case you are suffering from mild joint pain due to allergy. Cold and hot packs (for ice and heat therapy) can be tried out if inflammation, swelling, or muscle cramps exist. In a few severe cases, the doctor may also recommend physical therapy for relaxing the joint pain and for strengthening muscles around the joints. Do not forget to visit your doctor well in advance so that you can get the best allergy relief treatment ready for you to prevent the conditions before you actually get allergic to the conditions. This all, in turn, reduces the chances of getting headaches, migraine, and neck pain also. Besides the above, you may take a few other precautionary measures for avoiding allergy problems and joint pain due to allergies. These include: Bathing and washing your hair with a quality shampoo each day for removing the pollens from your skin and hair. Washing your bedding, pillow covers, and cleaning the mattress thoroughly once in a week. Use hot soapy water for effective cleaning. Wear sunglasses when going outdoors to avoid pollens entering from eyes. Use face-mask if possible. Overall, you can experiment with one or more of the above tips to relieve the deep pain in your joints. Talk to your doctor soon, if required to avoid the allergies and hence pain.

Learn more about our process Side sleeping is one of the most popular positions, but it carries some potential drawbacks. For many individuals, the biggest problem is pressure accumulating around their hips and shoulders, which can contribute to aches and pains. A mattress that’s too firm can add to the issue, while a mattress that’s too soft could let a side sleeper’s hips and shoulders sink in too deeply and put a strain on the spine. While is one potential solution, side sleepers can adjust the feel of their sleep surface to better meet their needs without investing in an entirely new bed. Mattress toppers are a convenient and affordable solution.

Side sleeping is more likely to create pressure points than other positions. Most people carry a disproportionate amount of weight in their shoulders and hips, causing these areas to sink somewhat deeply into the mattress. This can interfere with spinal alignment, leading to added pressure points. For this reason, side sleepers need more padding and reinforcement for their shoulders and hips. Sleep surfaces that feel too soft usually sink excessively for side sleepers, while overly firm surfaces with less cushioning can also produce aches and pains. If you sleep on your side and experience discomfort because your mattress either feels too firm or does not provide enough support, then a topper with your ideal firmness level can alleviate these aches and pains. A mattress topper can make your bed more comfortable, but to do so, you must find the right topper for your preferences, needs, and sleep style. We’ll explain what criteria to consider as you shop. What Side Sleepers Should Consider When Purchasing a Mattress Topper There are several factors to consider when you purchase a mattress topper. While all of these apply regardless of your sleep position, we’ll highlight special considerations for side sleepers so that you can rest more comfortably in your preferred position. : Toppers typically use memory foam, polyfoam, latex, feathers, down alternative, or wool. Any of these options may be appropriate for side sleepers depending on their existing mattress and how they hope to modify their sleep surface. Side sleepers looking for more contouring and pressure relief may prefer a memory foam, polyfoam, or latex model. These materials shape to the sleeper’s body while providing support, making them popular with side sleepers. has the closest hug, but it’s also the most likely to retain heat. Polyfoam usually conforms less closely but with added breathability. spreads out the compression more for a floating feel, and it adds a bit of bounce. , down alternative, and wool toppers add cushioning more than contouring. They can make the sleep surface plusher and more breathable, but they may not give the support and cradling many side sleepers prefer. However, if your mattress contours well, a topper made of one of these materials may be a nice addition. : The price of a topper often reflects its quality and materials. There are plenty of budget-friendly options available for less than $100, in addition to luxury choices that exceed $1,000. The vast majority of toppers will fall somewhere in the middle. The sticker price of higher-end items may be a turnoff for some shoppers, but you should keep in mind that a more expensive topper may ultimately be a better value if it doesn’t need to be replaced as soon. :Side sleeping usually puts more pressure on the hips and shoulders because these areas are wider. A topper can help relieve this pressure by distributing the sleeper’s weight more evenly. Taking this into account can help you find an option with the right thickness, firmness, and materials to work with your sleep position and current mattress. : Quality is paramount, potentially affecting both the comfort and longevity of your topper. High-quality options tend to resist long-term impressions and other signs of wear for continued comfort with regular use. While quality materials usually cost more, their durability may make them a better value overall. : Side sleepers usually prefer a slightly softer sleep surface than back and stomach sleepers. are subjective, but there are some things to consider to help you select the best feel for you. If your existing mattress is too firm for you, you may want a topper that is slightly softer than the bed itself. Similarly, if your mattress is too soft, you may prefer a firmer option. We would expect most sleepers who weigh under 130 pounds to prefer a soft to medium soft topper, those who weigh between 130 and 230 pounds to like a medium to medium firm option, and individuals who weigh over 230 pounds to gravitate towards a medium firm to firm topper. :Mattress toppers usually measure between 1 and 4 inches thick. The thickness of a mattress topper will determine how significantly it alters the sleep surface. Thinner toppers traditionally adjust the feel slightly, while thicker options provide a more notable change. Side sleepers with a mattress that is too firm often prefer a thicker topper with enough room to cradle their hips and shoulders. If the mattress is only a bit too firm, however, a thinner topper may do the trick. : Since side sleeping can lead to sharp pressure points, pressure relief is often the main factor side sleepers look for in a topper. For optimal pressure relief, a topper must redistribute the side sleeper’s weight so that it is spread across the surface rather than being focused around the widest parts of the body. Materials that contour to the sleeper, like memory foam, polyfoam, and latex, usually provide the best pressure relief, making toppers with these materials common choices for side sleepers.Weight also plays an important role in pressure relief. Sleepers who weigh under 130 pounds don’t sink in as deeply, so they may need a softer topper to enjoy contouring. Those who weigh over 230 pounds might prefer a firmer option so that they don’t sink in as much. What Else Can Side Sleepers Do to Improve Their Sleep? In addition to using a topper with your optimal firmness level to adjust the feel of a mismatched mattress, side sleepers can improve their alignment and alleviate pressure in other ways. The ideal pillow for side sleepers will keep the head and neck level with the spine. Pillow loft, or thickness, is an important consideration here. High-loft pillows that elevate the head and neck often interfere with spinal alignment. The same is true for low-loft pillows that cause the head to fall back too far. Most side sleepers prefer medium-loft pillows, which generally measure 3 to 5 inches thick. Some pillows offer an adjustable loft, meaning you can add or remove the fill as needed to reach your desired thickness. These pillows may be the best option if you aren’t sure about your ideal loft. Your hips and lower back should be level with the head, neck, and shoulders to ensure even alignment and prevent pressure points from building up. This can be an issue for side sleepers because sleeping with one leg on top of the other can cause the lower back and hips to sink lower into the mattress. Placing a pillow between the legs often helps improve alignment and reduces pressure in the process. What Else Can Side Sleepers Do to Improve Their Sleep?

Bad sitting posture in chairs not having a good ergonomic design is the root cause of many backaches and problems in seniors. To compensate it, one can go for good seat cushions and soft lumbar pillows which help in aligning the spine posture thereby giving a relaxed feel. Sitting in a chair for a long time without seat cushions can lead to constricted movement as it gives pressure on the spine, hips and pelvis area. Choosing and using a correct seat cushion or lumbar support cushion is the right choice to get rid of the troubles in back and hips. Apt use of seat cushions or lumbar support pillows improves the posture while sitting thereby prompting good flexibility and less stress on the muscles. It also avoids the formation of bend in the spine and ensures hip joints are in proper alignment. Moreover, when sitting straight in proper posture, naturally the spine gets aligned properly and emotionally it gives a majestic and confident feeling. Seat cushions are not heavy and are easily portable. They can be carried anywhere to the office or during a vacation to different places. Its size is adaptable to any kind of chair. It is compact and occupies less space and comes with a handle too for easy hold. Bad posture while sitting in a normal chair can lead to restricted flow to blood to neck, legs, back, and pelvis. Blood being the carrier of good nutrients, vitamins, oxygen, etc, when not circulated well can lead to stiffness and muscle cramps. When the cushion is used as a support, it not only gives mobility but also elevates the height from ground level to a certain extent, thereby giving control over sitting and getting up firmly. In this way, it also aids in avoiding any mishaps causing damage. The question of whether one is sitting for a long time or a short time in wheelchair will not arise as the seat cushions will give good comfort and firm grip giving a soothing feeling. Most of the lumbar support pillows and seat cushions are economically priced. Its cost is very meager when compared to the benefit of avoiding frequent back pain from bad posture. Sciatic pain is normally caused due to the compression of the sciatic nerve from the lower back that runs through the buttocks and legs. An ergonomically designed seat cushion will definitely alleviate the sciatic pain by giving proper alignment to the spine and takes the pressure off the sciatic area. When the compression pressure gets lifted, it gives time for the sciatic nerve to heal and gives a relaxing experience. No wonder, one may say goodbye to the turmoil caused by sciatic pain forever as the posture gets corrected by seat cushions. Coccyx vs. Donut Cushions: Which Is More Effective? In general, there are two types of orthopaedic tailbone pillows that can be used to treat coccydynia or tailbone injury. These are: Although both of them offer relief to the pain caused by coccydynia, which one proves to be more effective is the real question we need to address. These are basically designed to relieve the pain from your coccyx. It helps in easing the pain caused in the lower spinal discs and lower back. Available in options like memory foam, the gel, and the air coccyx cushion, these can be installed in your seat at home, office, wheel chair or a car. Much like the above ones, these doughnut cushions (or the ring cushions) differs mainly in its shape. It serves the same purposes as coccyx cushions and are effective in releasing the stress from the tailbone. Due to its ring shape its also effective for people suffering from conditions such as hemorrhoids, bruising, and enlarged prostates. Especially you will find them much effective when you want to seat down for longer periods of time. Overall, both these types are effective in relieving the tailbone pain and pain in the coccyx area. It’s just a matter of personal preference. You should choose the one that seems more comfortable for you and your specific condition. Tips for Selecting the Correct Lumbar Support Cushion Following points can be taken into consideration while selecting the lumbar support cushion At present, there are various different styles and shapes of seat cushions available on the market. These are like “V” shape “U” shape, ring design, wedge, and few more. While all these styles serve similar purposes the style you choose should be most comfortable for your body. Depending on the use and time frame for which you will be using them, you should choose the most versatile option. In most of the cases, it’s best to choose the one that comes with a hole in the center (like a donut) or a gap on the side (like coccyx pillow) as it takes off the pressure from the tailbone very easily. A person can be of small or tall or medium height, and the versatile lumbar support cushion’s prominent role is to support the lumbar region exactly as per the person’s body type. So, it is important to choose the thickness of the cushion according to your height. Seat cushions for wheelchair are meant to support your tailbone so that you feel comfortable while seating. These are presently made with different materials and may have various different fillings. Depending on how much you are investing, you may get a longer lasting premium quality made with memory foam or a cheap made (with some cotton filling) that does not provide you much support. Its always good to choose the one that comes with higher-density memory foam since it works best to support your spinal area and tailbone. It is pertinent to note whether flexible straps are there in lumbar cushion support to suit chairs of different sizes. Make sure the straps get attached or clipped to the back of the chair to give firmness to the cushion so that it’s position won’t get altered easily during movements or any jolts while sitting and getting up. Buy a lumbar support cushion with detachable cover and even more great to buy with an additional detachable cover. The spare cover can be used while the used cover is put for washing. Due to wear and tear, it has to be washed once in a few days to keep it clean. What is Military Neck & How To Fix It Naturally With Best Pillows and Exercises?

Learn more about our process Soft mattresses are great for sleepers who weigh under 230 pounds and prefer a plusher surface. The soft feel allows sleepers to sink in more, providing extra conforming that can help relieve pressure points. While soft mattresses can offer a comfortable night’s sleep, a mattress can also be too soft. A mattress that is too soft may allow a sleeper’s hips and shoulders to sink in too deeply. This can overcompress the foam, creating more pressure points around the hips and shoulders. It can also lead to improper spinal alignment, which may place strain on the spine. When , customers don’t have the benefit of being able to lie on a mattress while they’re shopping. Relying on the 10-point firmness scale is the easiest way to judge whether a mattress matches your firmness preference.

The Nolah Signature’s support core uses high-density polyfoam to provide a sturdy base for the comfort layers. The Nolah Signature Mattress comes with a lifetime warranty and 120-night sleep trial. Read our Full Nolah Signature Review to learn more  Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King Get 15% off a Leesa Mattress with code: SLEEPFOUNDATION The Leesa Original is an all-foam bed that has become a staple of the online mattress industry. Simple and affordable, the Leesa provides that quintessential memory foam feel, and is softer than the average all-foam bed. The comfort layers of the Leesa consists of two different foam layers. The first is polyfoam, and the second is memory foam. These two foams conform closely to the sleeper’s body, which eases pressure on the back and shoulders while providing a sensation of being hugged by the mattress. The support core is made of high density polyfoam, and serves as a base that prevents sleepers from sinking too deep into the mattress. Like most memory foam beds, the Leesa provides great pressure relief and prevents motion from transferring across the surface, making it a good option for both people with pain-related issues and couples. The Leesa Original has a medium (5 out of 10) firmness, making it most ideal for side and back sleepers under 230 pounds. One of the biggest selling points of the Leesa is its price point, which is below average for a memory foam mattress — especially one of this quality. Additionally, Leesa offers a 100-night sleep trial and 10 year warranty. They ship for free to all 50 US states, and offer White Glove Delivery for an additional fee.  Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King Sleepers looking for an all-foam bed that conforms to a moderate extent Use this SleepFoundation.org link for the most current discount on the Tuft & Needle mattresses Due to its medium firm (6) feel, the Mint Mattress from Tuft & Needle is a bit firmer than our other top picks and may not conform as closely. However, the mattress is constructed with a 3-inch comfort layer of adaptive open-cell polyfoam that offers ample cushioning for side and back sleepers who weigh up to 230 pounds. Transitional and support layers of denser polyfoam reinforce your body to prevent you from sinking too much – a common complaint regarding softer mattresses. The top two layers are infused with graphite and gel, both of which have cooling properties to help draw heat away from your body. Open-cell polyfoam is also fairly breathable on its own, so overall the mattress should sleep noticeably cooler than many competing all-foam models. Additionally, the cover is embedded with antimicrobial protectant to stave off bacteria and other harmful contaminants that can decrease the quality of your mattress and shorten its lifespan. Couples should experience fewer sleep disturbances on the Mint Mattress too. The foams absorb movement and reduce transfer quite well, and the bed does not make any noise. The Mint Mattress has a sticker price that is on par with the average all-polyfoam model. Tuft & Needle offers free ground shipping anywhere in the contiguous U.S., and backs the mattress with a 100-night sleep trial and a 10-year warranty.

Two comfort layers of adaptive polyfoam and a memory foam transitional layer deliver close contouring. Side sleepers receive ample cushioning for the shoulders and hips, which promotes even spinal alignment and alleviates pressure points throughout the body. Back sleepers who weigh less than 130 pounds should also be able to rest comfortably without sinking too much. Temperature neutrality is a major strength of the Idle Gel Plush. While many all-foam beds retain body heat to a bothersome degree, this mattress is constructed from breathable foams and also features a cover made from IceCool fabric. These features allow the Idle Gel Plush to sleep very cool compared to its competitors. Couples should also experience fewer sleep disturbances because the mattress nearly eliminates motion transfer and does not produce any noise. Idle Sleep provides an 18-month sleep trial for the mattress. This is quite long compared to the standard trial period, which typically runs 90-100 nights. The Idle Gel Plush is also backed by a lifetime warranty and all customers in the contiguous U.S. receive free ground shipping.  Soft (4), Medium (6), Firm (7), Plus (8)  Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King People who want a sturdy edge to make fuller use of the mattress surface Those who want a responsive mattress that conforms to their body shape Unique coil-on-coil design balances responsiveness and conforming The WinkBed Mattress comes in four firmness options: soft (4), medium (6), firm (7-8), and Plus (7-8). While all four of these options use a hybrid design, the exact construction varies slightly between models. The soft, medium, and firm mattresses have a Euro-pillow top, which is quilted with gel-infused foam engineered to pull heat away from the body. Underneath the Euro-pillow top, the WinkBed’s comfort system also includes a layer of pocketed microcoils. The microcoils allow for extra cooling airflow. The Plus version of the mattress uses polyfoam and zoned latex in its comfort system. Each firmness option uses a zoned coil support layer. The coils are pocketed to allow them to move independently of each other, while the zoning provides targeted support and softness to help align the spine. The soft version of the mattress uses a 5-zone coil system. The medium and firm models use a 7-zone system. The Plus uses a 3-zone system. The WinkBed’s support layer also includes a sturdy, reinforced edge to increase the usable surface area of the mattress. The WinkBed Mattress comes with a lifetime warranty and a 120-night sleep trial.  Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King Innovative Celliant fiber cover is designed for sleepers with active lifestyles Adaptive polyfoam layer cushions and contours, without sinking The Bear Hybrid has a medium firm (6) feel, resulting in solid support for people who weigh 130 pounds or more, but the comfort layer is constructed from adaptive polyfoam that cushions and contours to the body. This allows the mattress to provide good overall stability without feeling too stiff. Transitional polyfoam reinforces the comfort layer to prevent sagging, while a support core of pocketed coils creates a responsive surface feel and prevents deep sinkage across the sleep surface. The Bear Hybrid’s Celliant fabric cover is another strong selling point. This innovative material is designed to absorb heat from your body, convert it into infrared energy, and transmit it back into you through your skin. This process can aid with recovery after burly workouts or physically demanding days on your feet. Cellians fabric sleeps quite cool, as well. Since the mattress is considered medium firm, it is best suited to people who weigh 130 pounds or more. That said, back and stomach sleepers weighing less than 130 pounds may also find the Bear Hybrid comfortable because these positions generally require more support and less contouring. Compared to other hybrids, this model’s sticker price is quite reasonable. Bear also offers free ground shipping anywhere in the lower 48 states. The mattress is backed by a 100-night sleep trial, as well as a warranty that covers structural defects for 20 years after you make your purchase.  Medium Soft (4), Medium Firm (6), Firm (7-8)  Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King, Custom Sizes Sleepers looking for a balance between contouring and bounce Phase-change cover offers good temperature regulation Thick foam comfort layers deliver contouring without excessive body sink Get 20% off a Brooklyn Bedding Mattress with code: sleepfoundation20 The Brooklyn Bedding Aurora is a hybrid model that pairs multiple layers of foam with a coil support core. This construction combines the benefits of both foam and innerspring mattresses. The Aurora’s two comfort layers cradle to the sleeper’s body, relieving pressure. The foam also isolates motion to a significant extent, so sleepers might notice when their partners change position during the night. Because the Aurora uses pocketed coils in its support core, the coils can move independently of each other, further reducing the spread of motion across the surface of the mattress. The coil layer also gives the mattress bounce and edge support. While foam comfort layers have a reputation for trapping heat, the Aurora fights that trend with phase change materials that make the mattress cool to the touch. The innerspring layer is breathable, allowing more airflow to further dissipate heat. The Brooklyn Bedding Aurora is one of our picks for the best soft mattresses, but it comes in three firmness options to accommodate more needs and preferences. It is available in medium-soft (4), medium-firm (6), and firm (7-8). The Aurora comes with a 10-year warranty and a 120-night sleep trial.

The Puffy Lux is an all-foam model that has the close conforming that many sleepers look for in a soft mattress without skimping on the support needed to promote proper spinal alignment. The Puffy Lux has two layers in its comfort system. The top layer is constructed of Cooling Cloud Foam, a visco polyurethane foam. This layer has a gel-infusion to help wick away heat and promote a cooler night’s sleep. The second layer uses Dual Cloud Foam, which is engineered to soften under a sleeper’s pressure points while supporting the body. The Puffy Lux’s transition layer uses Climate Comfort foam, which is crafted to resist shrinking or expanding when the room temperature fluctuates while preventing sleepers from sinking in against the support core. The support core uses firm polyfoam to stabilize the sleep surface. The mattress cover is stain-resistant and washable for easy cleaning. The Puffy Lux has a medium feel, rating around 5 on the 10-point firmness scale. While it is designed to adapt to all sleep positions, the Puffy Lux’s exceptional contouring may make it particularly appealing to side sleepers looking for pressure point relief. Puffy provides a 101-night sleep trial and a lifetime warranty for the Puffy Lux mattress. CertiPUR-US Certified to be free of harmful chemicals Use this SleepFoundation.org link for the most current discount on the Zotto mattresses The Zotto Mattress is a memory foam bed that uses multiple layers of foam to provide a strong blend of pressure-relieving comfort and full-body support. The bed has a medium firm (6) feel that is well-suited to a wide variety of different kinds of sleepers. Each foam is specialized to add a unique benefit to the bed. Zotto’s foams are all CertiPUR-US certified to be made without a number of harmful chemicals, as well as ozone depleters. The Zotto Mattress starts with a top layer of responsive, yet cushioning proprietary polyfoam. This polyfoam is then bolstered by a layer of memory foam, which redistributes a sleeper’s weight around their pressure points for thorough comfort. Although memory foam has a reputation for trapping heat, the Zotto uses cooling, gel-infused foam technology and a breathable design to draw excess heat away from sleepers and allow it to dissipate before it builds up. A transitional polyfoam layer is built to lend the bed additional bounce and pressure relief, while acting as a buffer to keep sleepers from sinking into the support core. The bed’s core is constructed from durable, high-density polyfoam, adding sturdy pushback to keep most sleepers comfortable and supported throughout the night. The entire mattress is wrapped in a smooth polyester cover. The Zotto Mattress ships for free to the contiguous United States. The bed is backed by a 100-night sleep trial as well as a 10-year limited warranty. Soft mattresses usually appeal most to and those who weigh under 130 pounds. Lightweight sleepers exert less force on a mattress than heavier sleepers, which means firmer mattresses often don’t compress enough to provide lightweight sleepers with cradling and pressure relief. When a mattress is too firm, side sleepers are particularly prone to pressure buildup in their hips and shoulders. A soft mattress will allow a side sleeper’s hips and shoulders to sink in more, promoting better spinal alignment. Back and stomach sleepers below 130 pounds who like a plusher surface may also enjoy a softer mattress. However, since back and stomach sleepers often prefer a slightly firmer feel, a soft mattress may not be as important for back and stomach sleeper. Back and stomach sleepers frequently need extra support to prevent their midsections from sinking in too deeply. The right soft mattress should be able to support the sleeper and add plushness. Sleepers who weight between 130 and 230 pounds who prefer a plush feel may also enjoy soft mattresses. This is especially true of side sleepers, who may suffer from sharp pressure points on an overly firm mattress. Some side sleepers weighing more than 230 pounds may also appreciate the hug of a soft mattress, though sleepers in higher weight groups may experience excessive sinking in the hips and shoulders, which could place a strain on the spine. Sleep position is one of the key factors that affects how an individual interacts with a mattress. The position a person sleeps in influences which parts of the body press against the mattress. It can also impact the amount of pressure placed on the spine. Soft mattresses are usually most compatible with side sleeping. When an individual sleeps on their side, the widest parts of their body (their hips and shoulders) put the most pressure on the mattress. For pressure point relief, a mattress must have sufficient cushioning in these regions. To promote proper spinal alignment, the mattress must also have enough support to prevent the hips and shoulders from sinking in too deeply. Soft mattresses are not usually as conducive to back and stomach sleeping. Back and stomach sleepers often require more support to prevent their midsections from sinking too far into the mattress. Some soft mattresses may give sufficient support for these sleep positions, especially if they contain zoned layers. Many back and stomach sleepers favor a slightly firmer feel. While individuals from any weight group may enjoy a soft mattress, sleepers who weigh under 130 pounds usually gravitate to this feel more than other weight groups. Sleepers who weigh less put less pressure on the surface of a mattress. Firmer mattresses may not have enough give to allow lightweight sleepers to sink in, which may put the spine out of alignment and cause the sleeper to suffer from more severe pressure points. Softer mattresses generally provide more conforming for lightweight sleepers, relieving pressure points and encouraging better spinal alignment across all sleep positions. Shopping for a mattress online can be incredibly convenient and allow you to compare multiple models quickly and easily. However, without trying the mattress in person, customers don’t always know how to anticipate what the mattress will feel like. Paying attention to the firmness rating can give shoppers a clearer idea of how a mattress might feel. Reading customer reviews will also give extra insight. Many direct-to-consumer mattress companies offer sleep trials during which customers can return their mattress for a refund of the purchase price. Before , we encourage customers to take a company’s trial period and return policies into account. With so many mattresses available online, deciding where to shop may be the first big obstacle in the mattress-buying process. Some shoppers like to start by looking at well-known brands like Casper, Leesa, Nectar, Purple, Saatva, and Tuft & Needle. Deciding what mattress features you prioritize can help narrow your options. From there, reading mattress reviews can further refine your search. Some mattresses will offer additional options like different heights, different firmnesses, White Glove delivery, or optional add-ons. After you add your selection to your cart and proceed to checkout, you will generally be asked to input your contact and shipping information and pay via credit card. Many mattresses run limited time promotions throughout the year, so you might find discounts or offers for a free item with your mattress purchase at any time. However, some of the best deals usually fall on holiday weekends around Martin Luther King Jr. Day, President’s Day, Memorial Day, Fourth of July, Labor Day, and Black Friday. To save additional money shopping for a mattress online, you might check for special offers through your credit card or a cash back program like Rakuten. Some companies may use confusing words that distract customers from more important considerations. For instance, some companies may describe a mattress as “more comfortable” or “the most comfortable.” However, since comfort is subjective, this may not be true for everyone. Similarly, shoppers may be drawn to proprietary materials with appealing names. Some of these materials are unique, but their presence doesn’t mean one mattress is inherently superior to another. Focusing on the following considerations can give shoppers a clearer idea of how a mattress may affect their sleep experience. Mattresses use different materials that significantly affect their feel and performance. Some materials naturally lend well to a soft mattress, but construction matters, so even materials that are frequently firmer (like Dunlop latex) can be used to craft a soft mattress. Materials also contribute to performance across all other categories including motion isolation, pressure relief, edge support, and cooling properties. Mattress prices run the gamut, ranging from just a few hundred dollars to several thousand dollars. options can put more money in your pocket for other sleep accessories like mattress toppers and pillows. However, some may last longer. Balancing a mattress’s price point with its benefits can give you a clearer idea of whether it is a good value for your money. Motion transfer occurs when movements on one part of the bed spread across the surface of the mattress. A mattress that absorbs motion may prevent a sleeper from feeling the movement when their partner changes position during the night. Pressure points frequently occur where a sleeper’s body makes contact with the mattress. Mattresses with more contouring often relieve these pressure points by cradling the body for even support and cushioning. Edge support refers to the sturdiness of a mattress’s perimeter. When a sleeper nears the edge of a mattress without a strong edge, the compression may make it feel like they could accidentally roll off the edge. People may also have a harder time getting into or out of a mattress with weak edges since sitting on the edge may not feel secure. A sturdy, reinforced edge may allow sleepers to use the mattress surface more fully. Some mattresses tend to trap heat against a sleeper’s body, while others wick it away. Sleepers who tend to may prioritize mattresses with cooling features and extra airflow to promote a . Below, we’ll detail the most common mattress types. All mattress types offer a soft option, but the materials and build can affect the overall sleep experience. While some features and characteristics tend to be consistent between different models within one type category, individual models vary quite a bit due to design, materials, and build. Hybrid mattresses combine a significant comfort system with a coil support core. The composition of the comfort system varies between models, but many contain layers of cotton, wool, polyfoam, memory foam, latex, microcoils, and/or a combination of several different materials. Hybrid models often combine the best traits of innerspring mattresses and latex or foam mattresses. The coil layer usually gives hybrids more bounce, breathability, and edge support than most all-foam or all-latex models, while the substantial comfort layers provide more contouring, motion isolation, and pressure relief than most innerspring models. Innerspring mattresses are generally considered more traditional than foam, latex, or hybrid models. An innerspring mattress’s most notable component is its metal coils. Some innerspring mattresses may also have a thin layer of cotton or foam for extra softness, but the coil layer is the most significant factor impacting the sleep experience. Innerspring mattresses are often lower-priced than other mattress types, so they may appeal to shoppers on a budget. All-latex mattresses can be constructed of synthetic latex, natural latex, or a blend of the two. There are two main types of natural latex: Dunlop latex and Talalay latex. The different processes used to craft these types of latex lead to differences in their feel and performance. Dunlop is usually denser and more durable, while Talalay is usually bouncier and more breathable. Latex traditionally contours enough to relieve pressure points. However, rather than compressing exclusively under the weight of the sleeper, the compression is spread out over a wider surface area, which may make the sleeper feel like they are floating on top of the mattress rather than sinking into the mattress. Airbeds contain air chambers that can be filled or emptied to adjust the firmness of the bed. Modern airbeds often include remotes or apps to adjust the bed easily, while others may use a hand crank. Materials vary between models, but they may include thin comfort layers of memory foam, polyfoam, latex, cotton, and/or polyester. The support cores frequently use PVC, rubber, and/or polyurethane. Airbeds are easy to adjust, allowing sleepers to change the feel based on their preference, even if that varies between nights. However, since most airbeds have a thin comfort layer, it might not be possible to achieve the plush feel some sleepers look for from a soft mattress. All-foam mattresses are generally crafted of multiple layers of foam, which may include memory foam, polyfoam, or a combination of the two. Latex may also be included in some all-foam models. Memory foam and polyfoam generally compress directly under a sleeper’s weight rather than spreading the compression across a wider area. Because of this, most soft all-foam models conform closely to the sleeper’s body, creating a hugging sensation. This can help relieve pressure points. The right sleep accessories can complement your soft mattress to create a plush and . You can use these accessories to adjust the feel of your existing mattress or fine-tune the feel of a new mattress. Since soft mattresses tend to allow sleepers to sink in more deeply than they would on a firmer mattress, sleepers may require a softer, lower-loft pillow. or too lofty may lift the head up beyond the point of proper alignment and put more pressure on the neck. Side sleepers may benefit from a medium-loft pillow. Due to shoulder width, a side sleeper’s head usually needs more support to keep the spine properly aligned. Ideally, side sleepers should aim to find a pillow that fills the gap between their neck and the mattress without lifting the head or neck up beyond the point at which the spine is straight. Back sleepers may prefer a pillow on the lower end of the medium range. The goal is still to fill the gap between the neck and mattress, but this gap is not as large with back sleepers, so they usually do not need as lofty of a pillow as side sleepers. Stomach sleepers usually prefer the thinnest pillows or no pillow at all to avoid placing added pressure on the neck. Explain how a mattress topper can help those looking for a different feel on a mattress they already own. Be sure to explain that this is not a long term solution and won’t give all the benefits of purchasing a new mattress, but may help with minor adjustments. A mattress topper can be an affordable way to adjust the feel of your current mattress. Mattress toppers generally aren’t a long-term solution to an uncomfortable mattress, and they do not provide the same benefits as a new mattress. However, toppers can tweak the feel of the mattress and provide some extra plushness. If your existing mattress is too firm, a thicker topper will likely provide a more noticeable change than a thinner topper. However, sleepers looking for a subtler variation may prefer a thinner topper. Mattresses often soften naturally as they age, so the feel may change on its own over time. Adjusting your mattress foundation may also contribute to the feel. Using a box spring may make a memory foam mattress feel firmer, so removing the box spring may soften the feel. If you have a hybrid or innerspring model, using a box spring may make it feel softer. Before adjusting your foundation, review the information from the manufacturer so that you don’t risk voiding the warranty. If you sleep on a memory foam model, increasing the temperature in your bedroom may soften the mattress slightly. Using a mattress topper, especially a thicker topper, can soften the sleep surface. An excessively soft mattress can lead to . If a mattress is too soft to support your hips and shoulders properly, they may sink in too deeply. This can place additional pressure on your spine. A mattress that is too soft can cause hip pain. Soft mattresses compress under the hips to conform to the sleeper’s body. If the mattress is too soft, it could overcompress, and create pressure points. Whether or not a soft mattress is good for your back will depend largely on your weight and sleep position. Soft mattresses can support proper spinal alignment for most sleepers who weigh under 130 pounds and some side sleepers who weigh over 130 pounds. However, they might not provide enough support for sleepers over 230 pounds, which could lead to back strain. 5. When can my baby start sleeping on a soft mattress? Babies should not sleep on soft mattresses due to rebreathing and suffocation risks. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that infants sleep on a firm sleep surface that complies with their guidelines. 6. Is a hard or soft mattress better for back pain? Depending on your weight and sleep position, either a soft or firm mattress may be better for back pain. Soft mattresses provide more conforming, which may promote better spinal alignment for sleepers who weigh under 130 pounds, especially those who sleep on their sides. However, individuals who weigh over 230 pounds, particularly those who sleep on their stomachs or backs, may benefit from a firmer mattress that supports their midsections and prevents them from sinking in too deeply. Memory foam mattresses may be either firm or soft depending on their construction. Foams can be produced in a wide range of firmness levels, and materials can be layered to create a firm or soft surface.

Best Overall – Best Pressure Relief – Best Cooling – Made of natural materials, the Birch Plush Organic Mattress Topper provides eco-friendly comfort. Use this SleepFoundation.org link for the most current discount on the Birch mattress toppers Eco-conscious consumers may appreciate the Birch Plush Organic Mattress Topper’s all-natural construction, which combines Talalay latex, organic cotton, and organic wool. The cover uses organic cotton, which is soft to the touch and slightly stretchy, so that it can move with the latex core for optimal contouring. The breathability of the cotton cover helps circulate air and dissipate heat.  A layer of wool enhances the breathability and moisture-wicking properties while acting as a natural fire retardant. Talalay latex makes up the main body of the topper. This material is derived from the sap of rubber trees and formulated to produce a durable, buoyant foam. Like memory foam, latex shapes to the body to relieve pressure, but it spreads out the pressure over a wider area to create a floating sensation, rather than a hug. Natural latex also resists dust mites, allergens, and microbes. With its medium (5) firmness and 3-inch thickness, the Birch Plush Organic Mattress Topper should modify the sleep surface more noticeably than many toppers on the market. The Birch Plush Organic Mattress Topper holds several certifications pertaining to the purity and safety of its materials, including GOTS and OEKO-TEX certifications. Sleepers have a 100-night trial period to decide if this topper is right for them. A 10-year limited warranty provides recourse for qualifying defects.  People who suffer from pressure-related aches and pains  Those who are easily awoken by noise or motion when their partner moves Proprietary material in the Tempur-Pedic TEMPUR-Topper Supreme results in close-conforming pressure relief. Use this SleepFoundation.org link for the most current discount on the Tempur-Pedic mattress toppers The Tempur-Pedic TEMPUR-Topper Supreme conforms closely to the body to evenly distribute the sleeper’s weight. This helps prevent excessive pressure from building up around key areas, like the hips and shoulders. To do this, the topper uses 3 inches of proprietary TEMPUR memory foam. Originally engineered by NASA, this material responds to heat and weight to mold to the body for exceptional pressure relief and support. A quilted polyester cover encases the topper. It is resistant to mold, allergens, and dust mites, and it can be removed and washed to freshen up the sleep surface. As a medium topper rating around 5 on the 10-point firmness scale, the TEMPUR-Topper Supreme should add plushness and conforming to a mattress that’s too firm. It is particularly suitable for side and back sleepers. Some stomach sleepers will also sleep comfortably, but those who weigh more than 230 pounds may sink in too deeply for proper support. Memory foam, including TEMPUR material, typically isn’t optimal for sex because its close conforming can inhibit movement, but some couples may enjoy the extra traction. This material is also prone to retaining the sleeper’s body heat, so some may feel too warm during the night. However, the TEMPUR-Topper Supreme earns high marks for its conforming, durability, motion isolation, and noise level, which may make it ideal for sleepers with sharp pressure points and those who tend to wake easily if their partner moves. A 10-year limited warranty policy offers a repair or replacement should an eligible defect arise.  1” RestoreFlo 2.5 PCF Memory Foam 2” RecoveryFlo 1.65 PCF Transitional Polyfoam A phase change cover and open cell comfort layer keep the Molecule Triple Zone Mattress Topper cooler than most memory foam toppers. Use this SleepFoundation.org link for the most current discount on the Molecule mattress toppers Thanks to its advanced materials, the Molecule Triple Zone Mattress Topper can help keep hot sleepers cool and comfortable throughout the night. The cooling properties start at the surface, with a polyester cover containing phase change material that responds to your temperature fluctuations to help cool you down when you overheat. Next, a 1-inch layer of RestoreFlo memory foam contours to the body without the heat retention of most traditional memory foam. This layer’s open cell structure permits cooling airflow, while a gel infusion actively transfers heat away from the sleeper. A 2-inch base layer of RecoveryFlo polyfoam gives targeted support for better spinal alignment using a three-zone design. Since this layer is convoluted, air can circulate easily. This topper totals 3 inches thick. It has a firm feel, rating at a 7 on the 10-point firmness scale. As a result, it may be ideal for individuals who weigh over 130 pounds and those who favor a firmer feel. The topper should accommodate all sleep positions, but it is particularly suitable for back and side sleepers. Its all-foam construction can improve the conforming, motion isolation, and noise level of many mattresses, while its enhanced cooling features can aid in temperature regulation. However, couples looking for a bouncier surface for sex may prefer a more responsive model. The Molecule Triple Zone Mattress Topper holds CertiPUR-US certification for meeting durability, content, and emissions standards. This topper comes with a 30-night trial period and a 5-year limited warranty.  Sleepers who change positions a lot during the night The Boll & Branch Mattress Topper combines wool, cotton, and polyester to give any sleep surface a luxurious pillow-top feel. Use this SleepFoundation.org link for the most current discount on the Boll & Branch mattress toppers The Boll & Branch Mattress Topper is crafted to emulate the feel of a pillow-top, adding a touch of luxury while helping to extend the life of the mattress. Wool, polyester, and organic cotton give the Boll & Branch Mattress Topper a soft, lightweight loft. Thanks to the use of cotton and wool, the topper wicks away moisture and permits ample air circulation to reduce the likelihood of a sleeper overheating. Windowpane quilting prevents the fill from shifting, and 1-inch thick elastic corner straps anchor the topper in place. At 2 inches thick, the Boll & Branch Mattress Topper fine-tunes the feel without obstructing the support of the mattress. It acts as a pillow-top, with a medium soft (4) feel that is plush but not conforming. This may not be ideal for sleepers who suffer from sharp pressure points, but it could be the perfect solution for those who want enhanced breathability and a bit of cushioning. Because the Boll & Branch Mattress Topper doesn’t hug the body like foam models, it may also be appropriate for couples who still want the bounce and responsiveness of their mattress for sex. At the same time, feeling your mattress through the topper could mean you might notice some motion transfer emanating from the bed. Customers can take advantage of a 30-day trial period and return the Boll & Branch Mattress Topper if they’re not satisfied. The Leesa Mattress Topper balances conforming and support to cradle the sleeper’s curves regardless of their sleep position. Use this SleepFoundation.org link for the most current discount on the Leesa mattress toppers The Leesa Mattress Topper’s all-foam construction gives it some of the most popular traits shoppers typically look for in a topper, including conforming and motion isolation. This 2-inch thick topper consists of adaptive polyfoam. Like memory foam, it cradles the body to relieve pressure points, but it tends to respond more quickly to changes in pressure for greater ease of movement. Polyfoam also has an open cell structure that allows more air circulation than most memory foam, which helps it retain less heat. That said, the close conforming of the Leesa Mattress Topper may cause it to sleep warm for some. A knit fabric cover wraps around the outside, and it can be removed and washed for easy cleaning. The Leesa Mattress Topper should absorb vibrations and muffle any motion transferring across your mattress while remaining whisper-quiet. It conforms exceptionally well for notable pressure relief, but this hug could be unfavorable to amorous activities for some couples. Due to its medium (5) feel, the Leesa Mattress Topper is likely to soften the surface of a mattress that’s too firm. Depending on the existing bed, this topper should be comfortable for all sleep positions regardless of the individual’s weight. However, side sleepers with a mattress that’s significantly too firm may prefer a thicker topper. The Leesa Mattress Topper comes with a 30-night in-home trial and a 1-year limited warranty. Both cozy and breathable, the Sleep & Beyond myTopper adds year-round plushness and comfort to your sleep surface. Use this SleepFoundation.org link for the most current discount on the Sleep & Beyond mattress toppers The Sleep & Beyond myTopper uses wool fill, which helps the sleeper maintain a comfortable temperature in winter and summer alike. Wool is well known for its temperature-regulating properties. When the sleeper’s temperature rises, wool helps transfer heat away, but it also insulates when temperatures drop. Since wool absorbs sweat and wicks it away from the body, sleepers should stay dry and comfortable throughout the night. A cotton percale cover enhances the topper’s breathability and moisture control. The myTopper measures 1.5 inches thick and has a medium soft (4) feel. This should help cushion pressure points and make the surface of the bed plusher without excessive sinkage, so it is likely to be appropriate for any sleep position and all weight groups. While the myTopper cushions the surface of the bed, regulates temperatures, and shouldn’t hinder sexual activity, it may not relieve pressure to the same extent as many foam toppers. Sleepers with sharp pressure points caused by sleeping on a mattress that’s too firm may prefer a different model. Additionally, while it may dampen vibrations from the mattress, it’s unlikely to isolate motion significantly. The myTopper is hypoallergenic and machine-washable. Sleep & Beyond provides a 5-year warranty on the product. Unused, unwashed toppers in their original packaging can be returned within the first 45 days. While you may spend hours researching mattresses before making a purchase, a topper may seem like a more straightforward decision. However, since it alters the feel of the bed, it can be just as important despite being less of a financial commitment. Many of the same factors you would consider when selecting a mattress are also important to assess when looking at a mattress topper. What to Consider When Purchasing a Queen Mattress Topper We’ll detail some of the main factors to consider when purchasing a mattress topper. Which aspects are most important will depend on your personal preferences and existing mattress, but considering all of them gives you a more complete idea of a topper’s potential pros and cons. Companies may try to make it seem like their topper is perfect for all sleepers, regardless of their preferences. This usually just means that the topper falls towards the middle of the firmness and thickness range that most individuals prefer. While such a topper is likely to be comfortable for many sleepers, it may not be ideal for you depending on your unique preferences and sleep style. Queen size toppers range greatly in price, depending on their materials. Convoluted polyfoam and fiber toppers tend to be the most affordable, memory foam and latex toppers usually fall towards the center of the average price range, and high-quality down toppers tend to be the most expensive. Your sleep position plays a major role in your pressure points and spinal alignment, so it’s important to consider when selecting a topper. Side sleepers often need the most pressure relief because of the width of their hips and shoulders, so they may prefer a thicker topper that cradles their curves. Back sleepers generally need the right balance of support and contouring to let their hips dip in without sagging, so they may gravitate towards a topper with a medium firmness and thickness. Since stomach sleepers usually need more support to keep their spines well aligned, a thinner and/or may be best. While toppers can use a wide range of materials, the quality of those components may ultimately be more important than the type of material. Quality can affect both comfort and durability. A high-quality topper should retain its shape for years to come, while a lower-quality option may go flat or develop impressions. Since you may end up replacing a low-quality topper sooner, a high-quality option may be a better overall value even though it will likely cost more upfront. If your existing mattress tends to trap heat, a can counteract this effect to help you maintain a more comfortable temperature. A topper with cooling properties may also be an ideal choice for those who live in warm climates or who tend to sleep hot. Some toppers use advanced materials designed for cooling, like phase change materials, while others rely on breathable components like cotton, wool, and latex to allow heat to escape. While most mattress toppers fall around medium on the firmness scale, options are available to suit different needs and preferences. Sleepers with a mattress that’s too firm and those who favor a cloudlike feel may like a softer model, while those who weigh more than 230 pounds or who have a mattress that’s too soft may find a firmer option more supportive. Toppers usually measure between 1 and 4 inches thick. The thickness of a mattress topper influences how much it will alter the feel of the bed. Thinner toppers can tweak the feel without obstructing the support of the mattress. Thicker options often modify the surface to a greater extent, altering its pressure relief, support, motion isolation, and more. Sleepers often experience pressure buildup around their hips and shoulders, which can contribute to aches and pains. Some toppers redistribute pressure to help reduce this discomfort. A topper’s pressure relief depends on several factors. The thickness of the topper plays a big role. A thin topper may add a bit of pressure relief, while a thicker option will likely provide more. Selecting the right firmness for your sleep position and body type can give you the combination of support and contouring necessary to balance pressure relief and spinal alignment. The type of mattress topper that’s best for you will depend on your sleep position, preferences, and existing mattress. Several varieties are available, each with potential pros and cons. Polyfoam toppers typically relieve pressure and reduce motion transfer while being budget-friendly. Since polyfoam is usually more breathable than memory foam, these toppers may be a good option for those who sleep hot but like the feel of foam. The main drawback is often durability. High-quality polyfoam should have a longer lifespan, but lower-quality options could break down or develop indentations quickly. are popular for their close-conforming pressure relief that sleepers often compare to a hug. In addition to exceptional contouring, they usually absorb vibrations so that motion doesn’t transfer across the surface of the bed. However, this material’s slow response to changes in pressure could restrict movement and be less conducive to sex. Traditional memory foam also frequently traps heat against the sleeper’s body, though some toppers use gel-infused foam designed to transfer it away for a cooler night’s sleep. spread compression over a wider area than polyfoam or memory foam, relieving pressure with more of a floating sensation than a hug. Natural latex is especially prized for its quality, durability, and sustainability. Toppers made of latex tend to be more breathable than memory foam models, making them a good option for hot sleepers. Latex also has a natural buoyancy that makes it easier to move around on, which may be beneficial for amorous activity. Feather and down toppers typically contain materials from geese and/or ducks. Down is the layer of fine plumage under a bird’s exterior feathers. This material is typically light, soft, and fluffy, but it can be quite expensive. usually have a sturdier, more supportive feel. While some people feel feather or down toppers are plush and luxurious, they could trigger allergies, allow motion transfer, make a rustling noise, and/or emit a natural odor. Toppers made of wool usually cushion the surface of the bed while adding temperature-regulating properties. Wool transfers heat away when it’s warm and insulates when it’s cold for year-round comfort. It also wicks away moisture to keep the sleeper dry if they sweat overnight. Despite their cushioning, however, wool toppers may not provide the cradling some sleepers want for pressure relief. Frequently Asked Questions About Queen Mattress Toppers Queen mattress toppers typically cost between $50 and $200. However, budget models start around $15 and high-end options can be over $1,000. The materials, construction, and brand can all impact the cost of the topper. How to clean your mattress topper will depend on its construction. It’s always best to follow the manufacturer’s care instructions to avoid damage. Many toppers can be spot cleaned should a stain occur. Others have removable, washable covers, and some fiber and wool models can be machine washed. If you’re concerned with protecting your topper from damage, you might also consider investing in a . Mattress toppers may last for just one year or over 10 years, depending on their quality and construction. In general, a quality mattress topper should last about half as long as a mattress, so typically 3 to 4 years.

Soft mattress toppers offer an extra layer of comfort to soften your current mattress. We’ll discuss the most important factors that you need to consider when shopping for a mattress topper. What to Consider When Purchasing a Soft Mattress Topper If you’re not sure what to look for, searching for a new can be overwhelming. It doesn’t help that bedding companies often use misleading marketing jargon when describing their products. This can add to the confusion and distract shoppers from the factors that are most important. Since each sleeper will have different needs and preferences, there is not a one-size-fits-all approach to selecting a mattress topper. That said, most shoppers will want to consider several factors prior to making a purchase. We’ll break down price, firmness, quality of materials, and other considerations to help you find the right fit. Purchasing a mattress topper is often more affordable than buying a new mattress altogether. Setting your budget will help you narrow down the list of possible brands and models to consider. Mattress topper prices will vary based on the topper’s materials and construction, but soft toppers can be found at a wide range of price-points. Although often overlooked, your sleeping position is one of the most important factors to take into consideration when shopping for a mattress topper. Even if you’re certain that you need a soft topper, your sleep style will still dictate just how soft your sleep surface should be. You’ll also need to keep in mind the firmness of your current mattress. Side sleepers often need a softer, more conforming sleep surface, due to the added pressure that this position puts on the shoulders and hips. Back sleepers are likely to benefit from a medium to medium firm surface, while stomach sleepers tend to prefer a firm surface to help keep the hips and spine aligned. A topper’s materials will have a significant impact on its softness and how it performs. The softest toppers tend to be pillow-tops featuring lofty materials such as down, feathers, or polyester microfiber fill. These materials can flatten over time, but high-quality fill and construction can help improve a soft topper’s durability.

Latex toppers are durable, but often lack the deep contouring of memory foam toppers. If you tend to sleep hot, you may want to consider a cooling mattress topper. Since soft mattress toppers often conform closely, they can restrict airflow around the body. Materials like are particularly susceptible to heat buildup, but some foam mattress toppers incorporate gel infusions or phase change material engineered to offset any heat retention.  Natural materials such as latex and wool may help regulate your body temperature during the night.

A topper rated soft (2 to 3) or medium soft (4) will provide a more plush sleep surface, often with better contouring. Mattress toppers tend to be between 1 and 4 inches thick. The thicker the topper, the more it will change the feel of your current mattress. A thinner mattress topper will offer sleepers some cushioning without significantly altering the feel of their existing mattress. Thicker toppers are ideal for sleepers who want to make more substantial changes to their sleep surface, particularly in terms of firmness, pressure relief, and motion isolation. Pressure relief refers to how well a topper cradles the contours of your body to alleviate pressure in areas such as the hips and shoulders. typically offer sleepers significant pressure relief, though latex and polyfoam models are also worth considering. Mattress toppers come in a wide variety of sizes, materials, and firmnesses options. To find the right mattress topper for you, you’ll need to consider your unique comfort preferences, body weight, and preferred sleeping position. The material you choose will have a significant impact on your topper’s comfort. We’ll break down potential benefits and drawbacks to consider for each type of mattress topper. Memory foam is a specially formulated material originally designed by NASA. It’s highly contouring for excellent pressure relief.

Polyfoam is a versatile type of foam commonly used in mattress toppers. Higher density polyfoam often provides a firmer sleep surface, but there are plenty of soft polyfoam mattress toppers on the market.

Due to their additional length, twin XL toppers are useful for modifying a single bed for an adult or one side of a California king bed for couples with different comfort preferences. Not all brands that carry mattress toppers offer the twin XL size, so shoppers may find their choices are limited. When comparing available models, shoppers should consider factors that may affect performance, like firmness, thickness, and quality of construction. We’ll break down these and other factors to help shoppers find the right fit. What to Consider When Purchasing a Twin XL Mattress Topper Shopping for new bedding isn’t always straightforward. Mattress companies often market their products to appeal to as many shoppers as possible, but each person has unique needs and preferences. Focusing on your distinct priorities, in addition to performance factors, will help you find a twin XL mattress topper that best suits your needs. The average twin XL topper costs between $75 and $250. A higher price often means better materials, but the topper with the highest price-point isn’t always the best choice. Many high-quality, comfortable mattress toppers can be found in the middle and lower end of the average price range. Customer reviews can be a useful resource for deciding whether a certain topper represents a good value for the price, though shoppers should keep in mind that these reviews are subjective. Your preferred sleep position will impact the level of firmness you need from your mattress topper. Side sleeping often causes pressure points to develop, but a softer topper may help cushion the hips and shoulders while supporting proper spinal alignment. Back and stomach sleepers usually need a firmer topper to prevent the midsection from sinking in too deeply. Most mattress toppers are designed to create a softer sleep surface, but this will depend on the firmness of the topper and your existing mattress. A topper’s materials will affect how it performs in terms of pressure relief, durability, and temperature regulation. A is often ideal for pressure relief, but some can sleep hot and develop impressions over time. However, many companies engineer their foam mattresses and accessories to improve upon these weaknesses. Open-cell and gel-infused foams are designed to help a mattress topper sleep cool, while higher density foams may offer better durability. are often highly durable and breathable. Many mattress toppers are designed with cooling properties. If your current mattress retains heat, a can help keep you cooler at night without the need to buy a new mattress. Gel-infused foam, open-cell foam, and breathable, natural materials are intended to help fight heat buildup, wick away sweat, and keep sleepers more comfortable throughout the night. The ideal firmness level will depend on your current mattress. The majority of mattress toppers come in a soft, medium soft, or medium firmness level. These toppers are often designed to provide additional pressure relief by softening a firm mattress. If your current mattress is too soft, a may be a suitable option to provide additional support. Mattress toppers typically measure between 1 to 4 inches thick. Keep in mind that thicker toppers will have a larger impact on comfort, as they can substantially alter the firmness of the sleep surface. Thinner toppers can be used to slightly adjust the existing mattress without affecting the amount of support it provides. How well your sleep surface hugs the contours of your body will determine how much pressure relief it provides for the hips and shoulders. If your current mattress is too firm, a conforming mattress topper may help provide much-needed pressure relief. Your sleep position and body weight can impact how much pressure relief you need. A soft topper may provide excellent contouring for a sleeper who weighs under 130 pounds, while someone over 230 pounds will likely require firmer support. The right mattress topper for you will largely depend on your comfort preferences, personal needs, and budget. Mattress toppers are available in a variety of different materials, each with its own set of advantages and disadvantages. One of the most widely available types of mattress toppers, polyfoam toppers are affordable and versatile.

However, long term durability can be an issue with some foam-based toppers. offer closer contouring than polyfoam models. Although this results in excellent pressure relief, it also means that memory foam has a tendency to trap body heat. Memory foam toppers may include special features, such as gel infusions or breathable covers, that are designed to help prevent heat retention. tend to sleep cool while still offering excellent pressure relief. Latex is buoyant and responsive, making it easier to move around on your sleep surface. However, latex toppers are often more expensive than other models. Feather and down toppers are luxury options that add softness to the sleep surface. Down toppers can give your mattress a plush, pillow-top feel, but they do not offer much in the way of pressure relief or additional support. High-quality down can also be expensive. are often more affordable than down toppers, and they tend to have more structure. Wool mattress toppers provide a soft, cushioning comfort layer that helps regulate temperature and wick away moisture. Wool is an excellent insulator and incredibly durable. Similar to other natural materials, wool tends to be more expensive than foam-based toppers.

We’ll cover everything you need to know about selecting the best cooling mattress topper, including our top picks and recommendations on choosing a mattress topper based on material, body type, preferred sleep position, and more. Best Overall – Best Memory Foam – Best Pressure Relief – Best Natural Latex – Use this SleepFoundation.org link for the most current discount on the Viscosoft mattress toppers Made with 3 inches of memory foam, the Viscosoft Select Memory Foam Mattress Topper cradles the body and offers superior pressure point relief.

Sleeping cool has become a major buzzword in the mattress industry, and all the marketing jargon about the latest technologies and state-of-the-art materials can be overwhelming. This guide will help you to cut through the hype and help you find the best cooling mattress topper for you. What to Consider When Purchasing a Cooling Mattress Topper There are a lot of choices to sort through when buying a cooling mattress topper. From price to material, cooling properties to sleeping position, here are some of the most important factors you should keep in mind while you search. The most straightforward way to maintain temperature neutrality is by using materials that allow for airflow, thus carrying the heat away from your body. Some mattress toppers accomplish this with the use of naturally breathable materials, like latex or open-cell foams and cotton or wool covers. Others feature a convoluted or aerated design that increases air circulation.For materials that are inherently prone to retaining heat, manufacturers must resort to other tactics. These include charcoal, graphite, gel, or copper infusions designed to transport heat away from the body. Some mattress toppers incorporate phase-change materials, which regulate temperature by absorbing, storing, and releasing heat.For people who run very hot at night, it might be worth investing in a topper that allows you to control the temperature at the touch of a button. These active cooling toppers work by heating or cooling air or water and pushing it through the mattress to actively control the surface temperature.A few mattress manufacturers make toppers that are cooler in certain areas, such as the core. This can have the added advantage of alleviating aches and pains. The price of a mattress topper can vary widely depending on materials and quality. Cooling polyfoam mattress toppers start at less than $100, but you can expect to pay several hundred dollars for a latex topper, and even more for sophisticated devices with cooling tubes. That said, if the added price means better longevity or reduced air conditioning bills, it might pay off in the long run. Since your mattress topper goes on top of your mattress, it’s important to choose a topper with the right firmness to accommodate your body type and sleeping position. Side sleepers usually opt for a plusher surface that reduces pressure points, so they may need a thicker topper to form a cradle for the hips and shoulders. Stomach sleepers should be fine with a firmer, thinner topper, while back sleepers fall in the middle of the spectrum. Latex and wool toppers offer the best longevity, and you can expect them to last around 3 to 4 years on average.In contrast, a low-quality memory foam topper can develop permanent body indentations before the year is out. Higher-density polyfoam or memory foam toppers will last longer than their lower-density equivalents, but they will also usually trap more heat. Fiberfill and are fairly high-maintenance and require regular fluffing in order not to lose loft over time. You can usually expect these to last around 2 to 3 years. Since a mattress topper can’t add support to a sagging mattress, the main reason people purchase mattress toppers is to adjust the firmness level of a mattress. In general, lighter sleepers and side sleepers are best suited to a plusher topper, while stomach sleepers and heavier individuals are best suited to a firmer topper.Mattress firmness plays a crucial role in heat retention, as a softer surface allows the body to sink in further and causes more heat to build up around the sleeper. The heavier the sleeper, the more they will sink into the mattress, leading to increased heat retention. If you find you run hot, you may want to consider getting a firmer mattress topper. Mattress toppers tend to measure between 2 and 4 inches thick. People who exert more pressure on the mattress, such as heavier sleepers and side sleepers, should look for a thick mattress topper that can handle this extra weight without bottoming out. Memory foam is usually acknowledged as the best material for pressure relief due to its close-conforming abilities. However, if you overheat with memory foam, a latex mattress topper may do the trick. Latex can have pressure-relieving properties similar to memory foam, but it’s more breathable and forms a looser cradle around your body. Most toppers on the market today are made of memory foam, polyfoam, or latex, each of which offers its own advantages. You may also see mattress toppers stuffed with wool, which wicks moisture away from the body to keep you cool when it’s hot and warm when it’s cold. Memory foam is a popular material for mattress toppers because it offers superior pressure relief and motion isolation. Unfortunately, memory foams, particularly high-density memory foams, have traditionally been known for trapping heat. Modern-day cooling memory foam mattress toppers get around this by infusing the memory foam with charcoal, copper, graphite, or other substances that draw heat away from the sleeper. Open-cell and convoluted polyfoam mattress toppers are designed to improve airflow, allowing body heat to escape from the sleeper instead of building up on the surface of the mattress. Polyfoam has the added advantage of being the cheapest topper material. The downside is that polyfoam toppers will eventually develop permanent body indentations. Natural latex is a breathable, open-cell material that is prized for its durability and sustainability. Latex tends to keep sleepers “on” and not “in” the mattress, preventing heat build-up around the body. While natural latex toppers can be expensive, they maintain decent temperature neutrality and are much less likely to develop body indentations compared with synthetic latex or other foams. Many latex toppers are “ventilated” with pincore holes that allow for better air circulation. Many manufacturers use gel infusions, gel beads, or a top layer of gel in an effort to stem heat retention in memory foam or fiberfill toppers. As we will discuss in the next section, the jury is out on whether or not this is actually an effective cooling technique. Frequently Asked Questions About Cooling Mattress Toppers While they may help a memory foam topper sleep somewhat cooler at first, cooling gel mattress toppers don’t always manage to keep a neutral temperature all night long. The gel may also lose potency over the years.There are two principal ways by which gel is used to help memory foam sleep cooler. Thermal gels are cool to the touch, whereas phase-change gels regulate heat by absorbing and redistributing it to maintain a constant temperature. While these techniques can stave off heat retention for a while, many sleepers find that the mattress eventually warms up anyway. However, a cool gel memory foam mattress topper may help keep the temperature low long enough to help you drift off to sleep. In a nutshell, if you sleep hot but have your heart set on memory foam, then a gel memory foam topper might be the way to go. But for people who sleep very hot, it’s usually better to avoid memory foam altogether. Cooling mattress toppers have varying degrees of success depending on the type. Materials like latex, wool, and open-cell or aerated foams can help disperse heat, but they won’t actively cool the mattress. Phase-change material goes an extra step by using a chemical reaction to keep the surface cool to the touch. For people who are very sensitive to temperature changes, the best solution might be a mattress topper that actively works to control the temperature via water or air channels. What’s the difference between a mattress pad and a mattress topper? Mattress pads are relatively thin and are primarily meant to protect against spills and stains, whereas mattress toppers are usually several inches thick and are designed to change the feel of a mattress.Mattress pads often contain some kind of padding like wool, cotton, fiberfill, or down. While this can add some plushness to a mattress, this is not their main purpose. Mattress toppers usually come in the same materials you would expect from a mattress comfort layer, such as memory foam, polyfoam, latex, wool, or down. A mattress topper can’t fix an old, sagging mattress, but it can change the feel of a mattress that’s too firm or too plush. This is a cost-effective way to obtain a different firmness level without investing in a whole new mattress. The sheets you use definitely play a role in maintaining temperature neutrality. Linen, cotton, and bamboo are all naturally breathable and will help fight heat retention. In terms of weave, stay away from flannel sheets and choose sheets with a breathable percale weave. Some synthetic fabrics also use technology such as phase-change material to keep you cool. It’s important to remember that the temperature of your sleeping environment is a product of many factors including your mattress and/or topper, sheets, ambient temperature, , and your own personal body heat.

Both the Layla Pillow and Layla Mattress are known for their copper infusions, which are intended to promote cooling and reduce odor. The company sells two pillow models: the original Layla Pillow, also called the Layla Kapok Pillow, and the Layla Memory Foam Pillow. The Kapok Pillow gets its name from its natural fiber fill from the Kapok or Ceiba tree. Kapok fiber is ultra silky and the primary reason the Layla Kapok Pillow is more luxurious and expensive than the Layla Memory Foam Pillow. Both pillows contain shredded memory foam, but the Layla Kapok Pillow uses a mix of that foam and Kapok fibers, while the Memory Foam Pillow consists of a mix of memory foam and polyester. Both of these pillows are also adjustable. A zipper in the cover allows sleepers to open the pillow and add or remove fill to suit their needs. As a result, Layla pillows work well for a variety of sleepers. The two pillow models vary in their initial firmness level, with the Layla Kapok starting out medium soft and the Layla Memory Foam coming with a medium firm feel. Focusing specifically on the Layla Kapok Pillow, we’ll share details about the pillow’s materials and construction and analyze how it performs for different types of sleepers. Finally, we’ll discuss Layla’s policies related to shipping, returns, and warranty.

Only our testers who weigh over 230 pounds and sleep on their stomachs felt this model wasn’t right for them. Layla sells two pillows: the Layla Kapok Pillow and the Layla Memory Foam Pillow. Both pillows contain shredded memory foam fill. The Kapok Pillow also has silky, natural Kapok fibers mixed in with the foam, and the Memory Foam Pillow adds polyester fibers to the fill. Neither Layla pillow comes with options beyond the pillow’s size. Both pillows are adjustable, however. Sleepers may adjust each pillow’s firmness and loft by unzipping the cover and adding or removing fill. Both arrive overstuffed to give owners more options. While the Layla Memory Foam Pillow uses a breathable, polyester cover, the Kapok Pillow’s cover is a mixture of polyester, viscose, and poly/lycra with CuTEC yarn. CuTEC yarn is infused with copper fibers, which are intended to reduce odors and pull heat away to keep the surface cooler. Polyester,Viscose, Poly/Lycra Woven with CuTEC Yarn Pillow prices fall across an incredibly wide range. That said, the average memory foam pillow costs between $50 and $60. Both Layla pillows are considered luxury pillows and sell for prices above this average. The Kapok Pillow sells at a higher price-point than the Layla Memory Foam Pillow because it contains Kapok fibers. These natural fibers cost more than polyester fiber, the fill added to the Layla Memory Foam Pillow. Differences in cover materials also contribute to the price variation between the Layla Kapok Pillow and Memory Foam Pillow. The Kapok’s cover has yarn infused with copper woven into it, which is designed to promote cooling and reduces odors. The Layla Kapok Pillow rates well across all categories. Thanks to its shredded memory foam fill, the Layla Kapok Pillow is highly moldable and relatively conforming. Sleepers can fluff the pillow into the shape they prefer, and it will lightly hug the head and neck. Although the Layla Pillow tends to retain its shape, it feels very different from a molded memory foam pillow. The shredded memory foam and Kapok fibers make the pillow’s shape more malleable. As an adjustable model, the Layla Kapok allows sleepers to add or remove fill. Doing so modifies the loft and the firmness level, making the pillow attractive to a wide variety of sleepers. Copper-infused yarn woven into the Kapok Pillow’s cover is engineered to help with both odors and temperature neutrality. The Layla Kapok Pillow has above-average durability, so customers can expect it to last a few years. Since it contains memory foam, the pillow might emit a slight odor when it’s new. The Layla Kapok Pillow is more durable than the average shredded memory foam pillow due to its construction and high-quality materials. Sleepers can expect it to last at least a couple of years, if not more. Customers do not have multiple firmness or loft options available when purchasing the Layla Kapok Pillow. That said, the Kapok Pillow is an adjustable model The case can be unzipped, and sleepers may add or remove fill to adjust the pillow’s loft and firmness. As a result, the Kapok Pillow works well for a variety of sleepers. Sleepers generally don’t have to worry about the Layla Pillow becoming too flat. It tends to retain its fluffy shape fairly well thanks to its extra fill and unique blend of shredded memory foam and Kapok fibers. Because the pillow uses shredded memory foam, it doesn’t maintain as rigid of a shape as molded memory foam models. Shredded memory foam and silky Kapok fibers make the Layla Pillow easy to mold. Sleepers can fluff the pillow or flatten it to create the shape they prefer. Moldability is especially useful for side sleepers, who sometimes want a pillow to have an indent where they lie their head. The Layla Kapok Pillow is moderately conforming. Since it contains shredded memory foam, sleepers will feel a bit of a hug as the pillow contours to the head and neck. The Kapok Pillow isn’t as ultra conforming as some other memory foam pillows, however, giving it more of a cloud-like, floating sensation. Sleepers who want to feel like they fully sink into their pillow might opt for another memory foam model. The Layla Kapok Pillow sleeps cooler than many memory foam pillows. Although memory foam tends to trap heat, the Kapok Pillow is constructed in a way that helps it remain temperature neutral by allowing air to circulate between the fill fibers. An infusion of copper in the pillow’s cover is also designed to promote cooling. Because the Layla Kapok Pillow contains memory foam, it has a slight smell upon opening. This odor is due to off-gassing and is common with synthetic foam pillows and mattresses. The odor is about average for this type of pillow and doesn’t bother most people. If you leave the pillow in a well-ventilated area, most smells should dissipate within a few days. Because the Layla Kapok Pillow is adjustable in terms of loft and firmness, it is suitable for a variety of sleep positions. Nearly all our sleep testers rate the original Layla Pillow well. However, those with different position preferences and body weights might have unique concerns when considering purchasing the Layla Pillow. rate the Layla Kapok Pillow most highly. Those weighing less than 230 pounds give the pillow especially high marks thanks to its plush feel and adjustability. Most find that the pillow’s loft is high enough to promote spinal alignment when lying on their sides, though some smaller individuals may prefer to reduce the fill level. The Kapok Pillow’s moldability also works in a side sleeper’s favor, allowing them to manipulate it to fit the space between their neck and the mattress while cradling the head. also rate the Layla Kapok Pillow positively. Those who weigh less than 230 pounds might prefer the pillow after they’ve removed some fill to adjust the loft so that the pillow keeps the spine aligned without forcing the head towards the chest. Back sleepers weighing over 230 pounds don’t rate the pillow as highly as individuals from other weight groups. Since they will likely sink into the mattress more, they may prefer a pillow with a lower loft and firmer feel to support their spinal alignment. : Many rate the Layla Kapok Pillow favorably, although they don’t give it as high of marks as those who prefer other sleep positions. Since the Kapok Pillow arrives with a fairly high loft, most stomach sleepers will find more comfort after removing fill. However, stomach sleepers weighing over 230 pounds may be better served by firmer pillows with lower lofts since the Layla Kapok’s medium soft feel may not be very supportive.

Learn more about our process Reducing pain requires that the body have time to recover. Sleep is a critical time for physical recuperation, but unfortunately, many sleepers find that their mattress actually contributes to hip and lower back pain. If an old mattress is wearing out, it may no longer provide enough support, or if its firmness level isn’t well-suited to the sleeper, it may exacerbate pressure near the hips. A mattress upgrade can be a positive step in preventing and reducing hip pain. It can unlock the power of quality sleep and improve overall wellness. But with so many mattresses to choose from, many shoppers find themselves overwhelmed and unsure about how to find the best match for their needs. If you don’t have time to dig into the nitty-gritty details, you can cut straight to the chase and find our top picks listed in the following table and described in-depth below. For those with more time to investigate, the rest of our guide covers the vital things to know when shopping for a mattress to try to relieve hip pain.  Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King Customers who want to support an environmental cause with their purchase Supportive foam transition layer and core limiting sinkage to promote alignment Motion-absorbing all-foam construction reduces the spread of vibrations Get $135 off a Nolah Original Mattress with code: SF135 The Nolah Original takes advantage of the company’s specialty AirFoam to offer customers a mattress with a well-rounded performance that effectively cushions the hips and midsection. The Nolah Original is 10 inches tall, and the top layer utilizes Nolah AirFoam. This polyfoam material is crafted to have a feel that blends the best of both memory foam and latex. It offers notable conforming, allowing the mattress to give extra comfort at the hips for people who sleep on their side. At the same time, the AirFoam is responsive and keeps you from feeling stuck in the mattress. It doesn’t retain as much heat as memory foam, and it is able to isolate most motion to minimize nighttime disruptions from a partner getting into or out of bed. Beneath the AirFoam is a 1-inch layer of transition polyfoam and then a support core of seven inches of high-density polyfoam. The three total layers of foam combine to give the Nolah Original a Medium feel that has considerable appeal for many side sleepers and most people under 130 pounds. Nolah offers a 120-night sleep trial, so you have plenty of time to try it out at home. The mattress comes with a 15-year warranty.

The DreamCloud is a memory foam hybrid mattress with a layer of polyfoam quilted into its cashere poly-blend cover. It is built onto a 14-inch profile, making it much thicker than average, and offers a medium firm (6) feel that is ideal for those who weigh over 130 pounds. Pressure relief is another key strength of the DreamCloud. The comfort system features several types of foam, including gel-infused memory foam. These materials hug and cushion the body without sagging beneath the sleeper’s heavier areas, such as the shoulders and hips. The DreamCloud also offers excellent edge support, due in part to a high-density foam encasement around the individually-wrapped coils to reinforce the sleep surface and prevent sinkage from occurring where people normally sit. The mattress sleeps fairly cool, as well, thanks to strong air circulation through the coils. And unlike most other hybrids – particularly those with latex – the DreamCloud is relatively light and easy to lift and move. The DreamCloud’s price-point falls beneath the average hybrid model.

This material contours to the body and evenly distributes your weight much like memory foam, but without the signature “hugging” sensation. Adaptive polyfoam also tends to sink less and sleep cooler, and its more responsive feel produces a light bounce when you get in and out of bed. This makes the Idle Gel Foam easier to move across than many of its memory foam competitors. The mattress also contains transitional and support layers of high-density polyfoam, which stabilize the mattress and prevent you from sinking too much. Side sleepers who weigh 130 pounds or more should receive ample cushioning for their shoulders and hips to ensure even spinal alignment and fewer pressure points throughout the body. For back and stomach sleepers, the Idle Gel Foam maintains an even surface without sinking excessively around the midsection. Comparatively, softer all-foam beds typically do not provide enough support for back or stomach sleepers in this weight range. The Idle Gel Foam is also a good choice for couples because it absorbs most motion and does not produce any noise. Idle Sleep’s 18-month sleep trial is among the longest in the mattress industry, so you should have more than enough time to decide whether to keep or return the Idle Gel Foam.

WinkBeds developed AirCell foam as an alternative to traditional memory foam, which gets softer as it heats up, causing sleepers to sink excessively into the bed. The AirCell foam is composed of innumerable air pockets that allow for better ventilation but that can still compress and contour to relieve pressure. The AirCell foam makes up a key element of the comfort system of the GravityLux. Above it, 2 inches of gel-infused polyfoam are quilted into the cover. Below the AirCell foam is a layer of transition polyfoam with seven zones to provide tailored support to each part of the body. As a result, the hips get extra cushioning, and the spine can stay well-aligned. The support core is made with high-density polyfoam, and the cover is a smooth and breathable Tencel fabric.

Enter the Layla mattress, which provides customers a two-for-one firmness design. The Layla is built to provide a distinct firmness feel on each side. One side is rated as medium soft, and the other is firm. No matter which side you use, the layer directly under your body is made with memory foam that can cushion the hips and other pressure points. As you might expect, there is considerably more contouring on the medium soft side. Both of the memory foam layers are infused with copper, a material that is known for being antibacterial. Some customers also report that the copper-infused foam does not build up as much heat as traditional memory foam. On the medium soft side, the layer of memory foam is 3 inches thick and has a density of 3.5 pounds per cubic foot (PCF). Underneath it is a 2-inch layer of polyfoam with a density of 1.65 PCF that is zoned for reinforcement under parts of the body with more weight, including the midsection. Underneath that layer is 4 inches of high-density (1.5 PCF) polyfoam that serves as the mattress support core. The bottom layer is 1 inch of copper-infused memory foam, and this is the layer that faces up when the mattress is being used on the Firm side. The Layla’s dual-firmness feel works for sleepers of many positions, and its price point adds to its appeal.

Hip pain can have a profound effect on a person’s life. The hip is one of the , and hip problems can interfere with mobility and the ability to carry out day-to-day tasks. Unfortunately, hip problems affect a significant number of Americans. In one study, nearly between the ages of 65 and 74 reported suffering from recent hip pain. of adults over 45 have evidence of hip degeneration on imaging tests, making them more susceptible to hip pain. Athletes frequently deal with this issue as an estimated have chronic hip pain. One consequence of hip pain can be . Discomfort can make it harder to get settled in bed, and hip pain has been found to be associated with sleep fragmentation and difficulty sleeping on three or more nights per week. Stress and anxiety can be provoked by pain, further affecting sleep. To make matters worse, lack of sleep can make a person more inclined to perceive pain, contributing to a of discomfort and sleeping problems. All is not lost, though, because in many cases there are direct steps that can be taken to address both pain and poor sleep. However hip pain arises — acute or chronic, irregular or consistent — it’s helpful to learn more about what causes it and what can help relieve it. Hip pain can occur as a result of a wide range of medical conditions. Some people experience hip pain as a short-term issue while others deal with it over an extended period of months or years. The pain can be felt in the hip, which may be indicative of a problem , or around the hip, such as in the buttock or thigh, which is more often associated with issues in the surrounding tissue. Some hip pain is also “referred” from other parts of the body, which means that the problem does not originate directly in or around the hip itself. The following sections describe some of the most common causes for hip pain; however, this is not an exhaustive list. Because of its effects on quality of life and the possibility that it is connected to a larger health concern, it is important for anyone with hip pain to review their symptoms with a doctor. Osteoarthritis (OA), commonly referred to as just arthritis, is the degradation of cartilage in a joint that leads to inflammation, pain, and deterioration of the bone. OA of the hip is a serious problem, especially among older adults, and it usually worsens slowly over time with additional wear-and-tear. Cartilage cannot be regenerated, so is normally focused on managing pain and enhancing mobility through lifestyle changes, physical therapy, and medications. In more severe cases, it may be treated surgically with a procedure like hip replacement. People with OA of the hip are generally advised to avoid activities that can exacerbate pain or stiffness, so having a mattress that adequately cushions the joint and that contributes to stable, healthy alignment of the body can be beneficial. Though less common, other types of arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), septic arthritis, and juvenile idiopathic arthritis, can also . Direct physical harm to the joint can inflict pain on the hip. Bruising, dislocation, and fracture are examples of injuries that can occur from falls or other impacts. Older adults, who suffer more falls, are at a higher risk of these types of hip problems. People with a condition of thinning bones called osteoporosis are also more prone to hip fractures. Other physical injuries that can affect the hip include strains and sprains of muscles like the hip flexor or hamstring; bursitis, which is inflammation of the fluid-filled sacs around the hip; tendonitis, which is inflammation of nearby tendons, including in many cases the iliotibial (IT) band that goes along the outer leg from near the hip to the knee; and labral tears, which affect the cartilage around the hip joint. Athletes are at an elevated risk of these types of hip problems because of repetitive use and/or overuse of the joint during training and competition. With almost all of these physical injuries, it’s important not to aggravate the problem with excess pressure or poor posture. Sleeping on a mattress that is too soft may cause the body to sink out of alignment, straining the tissue around the hip. Sleeping on a mattress that is too firm may generate sharp impact at the joint itself. Nerves carry signals between the brain and the body, and if they become compressed or damaged, it can stimulate feelings of burning, numbness, and pain. Pinched nerves may cause a type of pain that radiates from one part of the body to another, such as sciatica, which radiates along the sciatic nerve that runs from the lower back into the upper legs. In a condition called meralgia paresthetica, pressure on the nerve that runs to the skin of the thigh can lead to pain, including around the outer part of the hip. In sacroiliitis, the sacroiliac (SI) joints, which connect the pelvis and spine, are inflamed, which can induce radiating pain felt in multiple areas, including the hips. Treatment for pinched nerves often involves medication and efforts to eliminate the nerve compression. This can require avoiding certain activities, postures, or positions, and a proper mattress that matches a patient’s body’s needs may play a part in preventing compression in areas with a pinched nerve. While less common than arthritis, physical injury, and pinched nerves, a handful of other conditions can cause hip pain. Some infections can take root in the bones and joints, causing pain in and around the hip. Different types of cancer can spread to the bones, including in the hip, causing pain and bone degeneration. Leukemia, a type of cancer affecting blood cells, can also be associated with pain, including hip pain in some cases. A lack of blood supply to the bones can cause decay of bone tissue, known as osteonecrosis or avascular necrosis, that results in tiny breaks in the bone and eventual bone collapse. These issues tend to be related to broader health problems that are less likely to be tied to posture or sleeping position. Most hip pain is not caused by these serious problems, but it is important to review hip symptoms with a doctor who can best diagnose their most likely cause. Sleeping position can affect whether a person experiences hip pain. Each sleeping position creates areas of vulnerability, and sleepers are wise to account for these when buying a mattress. put the most pressure on their shoulders and hips, since these joints bear more weight and have direct impact with the mattress. If a mattress is too firm, it won’t accommodate these areas, potentially causing joint pain and throwing the spine out of alignment. If a mattress is too soft, these pressure points will sink in too deeply and fall out of line with the rest of the body. tend to have the greatest vulnerability around the pelvis and lower back. Most people carry more weight around the abdomen, and on a soft mattress, that area can sink in deeply, contorting the lower back in a U-shape that can induce pain around the entire midsection. For this reason, stomach sleepers tend to do best with a firm mattress that has just enough contouring to cushion the pelvis. are at risk of pain in the lumbar spine. A mattress that is too firm can’t account for the natural curvature of the lower back, but a mattress that is too soft will cause them to sink into a U-shape (similar to the risks for stomach sleepers). Improper positioning can cause muscle aches and nerve compression. Consequently, back sleepers generally prefer with low-to-moderate contouring to cushion the pelvis and shoulders. Body shape and weight should be considered along with sleeping position. People who carry more abdominal weight and sleep on their back or stomach are at an elevated risk of bad posture on a soft mattress. People who weigh under 130 pounds don’t sink as much into a mattress and can benefit from a plusher feel compared to people who have a higher body weight. A mattress can contribute to hip pain if it doesn’t give your body the right amount of support. If you have sharp pressure points, it can cause irritation or even pinched nerves. In addition, if your alignment at night is out of whack, your muscles and other tissues can’t truly relax, generating stress and interrupting bodily recovery. Many factors can contribute to pain, and it’s not always possible to pinpoint just one cause. As a result, it may be a challenge to know for sure if your hip pain is related to your mattress. If you find that the pain is worse when you get out of bed and gets gradually better during the day, it may be a sign that your mattress is part of the problem. Sometimes, a worn out mattress is a large contributor to hip pain and other types of pain. After years of use, mattresses will develop permanent impressions in the foam, sagging in the coils, and other signs of wear that can significantly diminish the amount of support a mattress provides. If you experience any of the following signs in addition to your hip pain, it’s likely time for a new bed: You notice impressions, lumps, sagging, rips and tears, or other signs of wear in your bed You tend to roll to the center of the mattress while sleeping You find the couch or other places to sleep more comfortable than your own bed. It’s been more than seven years since you’ve purchased a new mattress You can’t remember the last time you purchases a new mattress. The average mattress lasts from 6-8 years, but mattress lifespan varies depending on the quality and materials it’s made of. Cheap memory foam and innerspring mattresses can last as little as four years, while higher-quality hybrid and latex models can last as many as nine or ten. Whether your hip pain is a direct result of your mattress or not, an old mattress isn’t helping. Most online mattress companies offer sleep trials, which allow you to try the mattress for at least 100 days before committing it. We recommend making use of this to help ease your hip pain. The type of support that you get from a mattress is determined largely by the type of mattress that you use. Five types of mattresses are on the market, and each has pros and cons. The following sections introduce these mattress types, but it’s important to note that performance isn’t uniform within each category. While there are consistent features, the performance of any given mattress will depend on the specifics of its construction, which can vary even within a mattress type. The construction of a hybrid starts with its support core, which is made from innerspring coils. In modern hybrids, these are usually pocketed coils. Above the coils are a thick comfort system built with one or more layers. Those layers can include micro-coils, memory foam, polyfoam, latex, and other textile materials. The inclusion of distinct components allows a hybrid to offer some of the best characteristics of other mattress types. The coils improve responsiveness and protect against excess sagging, and the comfort layers provide conforming to relieve pressure and support the spine. A coil-based layer is the central component of an innerspring mattress. In the past, innersprings were the most common type of mattress available. These offerings have either no comfort system at all or at most thin layers of materials like foam, cotton, or polyester. Most hip pain sufferers won’t get enough support from an innerspring alone, but by combining an innerspring and a mattress topper, they can essentially arrange their own hybrid-type mattress to fit their preferences. With the lower cost of innersprings and toppers, they may save money in the process. The components of a latex mattress are made with its namesake material. Latex, a type of rubber, can be produced using sap cultivated from rubber trees (natural latex), or it can be made synthetically (SBR latex). For mattresses sold online, natural latex is much more common and is made with either the Talalay or Dunlop process. Latex is a bouncy material, which means that these mattresses are easier to move on and generally don’t permit excessive sink. At the same time, they have the ability to compress to suit the body’s weight, conforming to protect the hips and minimize impact at pressure points. An internal air chamber forms the support core of an airbed. Air is added or removed using a pump that is controlled by a remote or a smartphone app. The comfort system above the air chamber can be minimal or robust and may include foam, latex, and/or other textiles. Max Adjustability: Airbeds offer the ability to easily adjust the firmness level, which means that a different feel for your bed is available in an instant. If hip pain flares up, you can make the bed softer to reduce impact, or if you need to sleep on your back or side, you can add air to make the bed firmer. A foam is designed with all of its internal layers made of either memory foam, polyfoam, latex, or a textile like cotton, polyester, or wool. There are no innerspring coils in a foam mattress. Foams with more contouring and responsiveness tend to be used in the comfort system. Foam mattresses, especially those that utilize memory foam, tend to provide excellent pressure relief because of the material’s ability to conform and give proportional cushioning based on how the body’s weight is distributed across the mattress. This reduces pain points and bolsters spinal alignment. If you’ve identified that your current mattress is contributing to hip pain, you’re likely ready to make a change. But at the end of the day, you have to be able to afford a mattress upgrade, and some people may worry that it’s just not in their budget. Even if you aren’t able to splurge on a luxury mattress, you can still find relief. You can make the most of your spending with the following tips. People who are looking for a mattress online are often surprised by how many affordable options are available. While buying a mattress online might have seemed strange even just 10 years ago, it has become commonplace today and is consistently growing in popularity. Part of the reason for this popularity is competitive pricing. Most online companies sell directly to consumers, cutting out the middleman and eliminating the overhead of costly retail stores. These savings get passed on to shoppers, reducing sticker prices for most beds sold online. In addition, competition between sellers means that promotions and discounts are available to offer deals below the retail pricing. Another benefit to shopping online is that you can take your time and fully research your options. In your living room, there’s no pushy salesperson looking over your shoulder, so it can be a much more pleasant and low-pressure shopping experience. In this context, it’s much easier to compare different options and seek out the best mattress for the money. A common concern when buying online is that you can’t lie down on the bed before making a purchase. While it’s true that you can’t feel out a mattress through your computer, detailed descriptions and reviews online give a solid idea of what to expect for any given model. Furthermore, virtually every online mattress comes with a sleep trial that lets you use the mattress at home with the option to return it for a full refund. These no-risk sleep trials usually last for 100 nights or more, and if you decide to make a return, most companies will even come and pick the mattress up from your home. Shipping is almost always free and uses the “bed-in-a-box” method. The mattress is compressed inside plastic packaging and mailed to your doorstep in a box. You simply need to move the box to your bedroom, cut away the packaging, and let the bed retake its original size. You can usually sleep on this new bed immediately or at the latest within a few hours. Shipping the mattress in this way has no effect on its quality or durability, and it eliminates the cost and hassle associated with traditional mattress delivery and installation. Dozens of brands have an online presence, and that includes many of the major mattress companies that originally built their reputation in brick-and-mortar stores. But no matter whether you’re intrigued by a new mattress brand or a long-time industry player, you can expect to find plenty of quality, affordable options online. Even if you conclude that a brand new mattress isn’t in your budget, that doesn’t mean you’re out of options. A mattress topper, which goes above your current bed, is another product that switches up the feel of your bed and often comes with a lower price tag. As the name indicates, a mattress topper sits on top of your existing mattress and under your sheet. It is held in place by straps, an elastic band, or by your fitted sheet. Mattress topper thickness usually ranges from one to four inches, and most of the time they are made with only one type of material. Memory foam is among the most popular materials in mattress toppers. It is known for its contouring, allowing the topper to cradle the hips and relieve other pressure points to improve spinal alignment. Polyfoam and latex toppers with slightly less contouring can also work to reduce hip and other pain. While it’s more affordable, a topper won’t offer all the advantages of a new mattress. It won’t have the coordinated design and layers of a complete mattress, so you may not get all the benefits of materials like latex or memory foam. In addition, if your current mattress is sagging or suffering from other wear-and-tear, a topper won’t fix it; instead, the topper will just sag right along with your old bed. Overall, a topper can be a useful stepping stone, letting you try out sleeping on a different material. It can also help with pressure relief in the short-term, buying time until your budget allows you to invest in a new mattress. Depending on the cause and nature of your hip pain, you can try to change your sleeping position. For example, if you’re a side sleeper dealing with a bruise or inflammation, sleeping on your back or side, or at the very least avoiding the injured side, may help fight pain. If you’re a back or stomach sleeper with a soft mattress and can’t afford a new bed, you can try switching to side-sleeping. may be better at cushioning pressure points, including your hips, and keeping your lower back aligned. Giving a new sleeping position a shot is worth a try, but it won’t always pan out. Many people involuntarily move back to their traditional sleeping position during the night, and in those cases, a long-term sleeping position change may fail to take hold. Additional Sleeping Accessories for Sleepers With Hip Pain Along with your mattress, a number of accessories, such as pillows and a bed frame, help shape your sleeping experience. If you don’t have the budget for a new mattress, you can invest in these lower-cost accessories to try to reduce hip pain. Or if you want to fully step up your bedroom, you can get a new bed frame and pillows along with a brand new mattress. By itself, the wrong pillow can throw off alignment and have a snowball effect on the rest of your spine, including on the lower back area that can radiate pain to the hips. Keeping your head and neck supported and in line with your body is an important part of getting deep, restorative sleep. The ideal type and size of pillow depends in part on the feel of your mattress. For example, on a plush mattress, your body is likely to sink in more than your head, which means that your neck could hyperextend if the pillow is tall (high loft). General recommendations for the combination of firmness and pillow loft are listed in the table below Sleeping position also plays into the best pillow for any given person. The width of the shoulders means that have a greater gap between their head and the mattress, making a taller pillow a better fit. Back sleepers want less loft, but a pillow that is too thin may be insufficient for support and can contribute to snoring. Stomach sleepers generally need a very thin pillow to avoid hyperextending the neck. Pillows can help provide comfort and support when used in other ways besides just to support the head. When dealing with a physical injury, a light, thin pillow may help cushion any sensitive areas including the hips. Side sleepers who pull their legs upward often benefit from the use of a pillow between their knees. Some side sleepers also like a body pillow that can keep their torso from twisting, which can strain the muscles around the lower back and hips. Back sleepers can try putting a pillow underneath their knees to take some pressure off of the lumbar area. Depending on their mattress firmness, stomach sleepers may use thin pillows under the abdomen or chest to promote alignment. The base that your mattress sits on can affect its overall performance. If the bed frame or base is weak or poorly designed, your mattress may start to sag prematurely, reducing the support you need to combat hip pain. When choosing a new bed base, it is essential to check with the mattress manufacturer about recommended options. If you don’t use the proper foundation, it may detract from performance and void the mattress warranty. An intriguing option for many people with hip and is an adjustable base. These frames are equipped with motors and a remote that allow you to raise and lower the head and foot of the bed. Some adjustable bases offer heat and massage options as well. The benefit of an adjustable base is that you can modify your body’s positioning to improve alignment and comfort. For example, back sleepers may slightly raise the head and the legs to decrease pressure on the lower back and hips. A pressure-relieving “zero gravity” setting is available on many adjustable bases. Not all mattresses are compatible with an adjustable base. Some innersprings are vulnerable to damage if you try to bend them in this way, and some foam or latex mattresses may wear out more quickly if compressed by an adjustable frame. For this reason, it is vital to check with the mattress maker before buying and using this kind of bed base. When you get started shopping for a new mattress, you may find yourself confronted with a dizzying array of brands, models, and marketing jargon. Sorting out what’s truly important can be a struggle, but failure to do so can lead you astray, causing you to wind up with a mattress that exacerbates your hip pain. To keep things simple, focus on certain key factors when considering your options. These can narrow your list down to just a few models that you can investigate in detail to make a final purchase. As we explained in a previous section, mattress type is a major indicator of likely performance. If you want more conforming to cushion your hips, more bounce to make it easy to move in bed, more firmness adjustability, or any other performance characteristic, look for the mattress category that best suits that preference. Not all parts of the body need the same cushioning, and this principle drives zoned material construction. Coils or foams can be made to have more give under certain parts of the body, such as the shoulders and hips. Materials with lots of conforming, like memory foam, produce a similar effect through their proportional compression and body cradling. If you want a mattress that is durable and helps relieve pain, it’s important to look for quality components in all layers of the mattress. Low-quality materials in even just one layer can be a weak link that drags down the bed’s overall performance. The right comfort level is a critical part of making sure that a mattress fits with your body and sleeping position. It’s also necessary so that your mattress is welcoming and puts you in the right mindset to drift off to sleep at bedtime each night.

701fe0f4-d0aa-43fc-afbf-4a33faada6cc,"Experts agree that getting good sleep is one of the single best ways to maintain and improve our health. A mattress is a huge factor in our ability to sleep well, yet many people overlook its importance and keep using a mattress that fails to provide enough support and comfort. A new mattress can be a sizable investment, but taking this step can unlock your ability to sleep better. As with any major purchase, you want to make sure that you choose wisely. To help you get a handle on how to choose a mattress, we break down the key information piece-by-piece. With this guide, you’ll have the knowledge to find a with the right firmness and features to suit your needs and deliver great sleep night after night. If you’re just getting started looking for a new mattress, you’ve probably noticed that the number of options can be dizzying. A helpful way to get your bearings is to start by thinking about mattress types. Almost all mattresses can be identified as one of five types — foam, innerspring, hybrid, latex, or airbed. Innersprings are the most well-known and traditionally were the mainstay in homes nationwide. In recent years, though, other mattress types have surged in popularity. These other mattress types have expanded their reach primarily by offering a more dynamic performance. They’ve also become more affordable and accessible with the growth of the online mattress industry. Knowing the basics about each of these types can serve as a foundation upon which you can continue your search for the best mattress. : These mattresses are made entirely with foam and no coils. They tend to provide above-average contouring to the body, pressure relief, and motion isolation, making them a good fit for side sleepers and couples. Among foams that are used in these mattresses, memory foam is the most well-known. : An innerspring mattress has a coil-based support system and few other layers. While the coils offer some support, innersprings often lack in pressure relief. Their sleeping surface is bouncier and has limited motion isolation. With a lower price point, these are more popular among budget shoppers. : Hybrids have two central elements: an innerspring support core and a substantial foam comfort system. The comfort layers can include foam or latex, and sometimes will even include a shorter layer of coils (called micro-coils). These mattresses provide a blend of bounce and contouring with low heat retention and can be a good fit for sleepers in any position depending on exactly how they are built. : When all of the layers of a mattress are made with latex rubber, some call it an all-latex or true-latex mattress. For simplicity’s sake, we just use the term latex mattress. These offer top-notch bounce and durability with moderate contouring. When made with natural and organic latex, they are a top pick among eco-conscious shoppers. : Airbeds are built with an air chamber as their support core. A pump — controlled by a smartphone or remote — is built into the mattress to add or remove air with the push of a button, giving sleepers the utmost in firmness flexibility. Couples love airbeds because each side can be set to a different firmness level. Comfort is subjective, which means that it’s critical to find a mattress that feels right to you. Firmness describes how hard or soft a bed feels. To compare options, we use a 1-10 firmness scale. It isn’t perfectly scientific, but it does help convey how a mattress feels and who it may be best suited for. Sleepers under 130 pounds; side sleepers under 230 pounds Sleepers between 130 and 230 pounds; side sleepers over 230 pounds Side sleepers over 230 pounds; back and stomach sleepers over 130 pounds While the chart lists who most frequently benefits from a particular firmness level, remember that comfort is subjective. Some people just prefer a softer or a firmer mattress or may have other factors — such as back or hip pain — that influences what mattress feels right. If you’re not sure what firmness level is right for you, there are a few ways to help identify what might be the best fit: Consider your weight and sleeping position to narrow down a range. Reflect on whether you’ve found yourself wishing for a harder or soft mattress when using your current mattress at home or if you’ve recently stayed at a hotel. For reference, most hotel mattresses are Medium to Medium Firm, which have the widest overall appeal. Visit a local mattress store as a research mission and try out some beds. Make sure to stay on a mattress for at least 10-15 minutes to really evaluate what’s comfortable. There are myriad potential causes of back pain, but an unsupportive mattress is one factor that should not be underestimated. In people without back problems, proper support may prevent pain from arising, and in people who already have back issues, the right mattress may help with cushioning and comfort. Choosing the best mattress for back pain means considering the nature of that pain alongside other mattress needs and preferences. Some back pain is short-term and comes on suddenly. This is known as . Other times, the pain persists over a long period of time and is known as . Back problems can start out as acute, such as from an injury, and . A person with acute back pain may need only temporary relief from their mattress. This may mean using extra pillows or adjusting their sleeping position. For chronic back pain, more significant steps may be needed, such as choosing a mattress that is or . Finding the right levels of comfort as well as pressure relief can help keep the spine properly oriented during sleep. The optimal mattress may also depend on where a person experiences back pain. Lower back pain affects the bottom five vertebrae (L1-L5) in the lumbar area. It is the most common type of back pain and one of the leading reasons why Americans visit their doctor. This back region is vulnerable to bending and twisting that can harm the muscles and the spine itself. Spending too many hours in a bad sleeping position can cause lower back aches. For side sleepers, this can arise if the shoulders and hips aren’t supported, throwing the whole spine off-kilter. For back and stomach sleepers, it may occur because of a mattress that is too soft or too firm, putting pressure on the natural curvature of the lumbar spine. In general, side sleepers should look for Medium Soft to Medium Firm mattresses that can cushion their impact points. Back and stomach sleepers should look for Medium Firm to Firm beds that have only light conforming. are far less common. The anatomy in these regions is more stable, reducing the likelihood of sprains and strains from twisting movements. Pain in these areas can be tied to more serious problems and should be checked out by a doctor. In some cases, poor posture can create undue tension in the middle or upper back. A pressure-relieving mattress that contributes to spinal alignment can reduce the risk of this kind of pain. Having a quality pillow with the right amount of loft can also ensure that the neck and upper spine have adequate support. What position are you in when you normally tuck in to fall asleep? And in what position do you find yourself when you wake up? The answers to these questions can provide key insight to help choose a mattress. The parts of your body that need more support in order to maintain spinal alignment vary based on your sleeping posture. For that reason, choosing a mattress to suit your sleeping position can boost comfort and help avoid aches and pains. Back sleepers put the greatest pressure on their lower back. If a mattress is too soft, the torso can sink in more deeply than the upper back and lower body, and this U-shape can create strain. If a mattress is too firm, there won’t be any accommodation of the slight curve in the lower back. As a result, back sleepers do best with a Medium Firm to Firm mattress with light to moderate contouring. Side sleepers have sharp pressure points where the body is the widest, most notably at the shoulders and hips. On a too-soft mattress, those points will dip out of line with the rest of the spine. On a too-firm mattress, they will feel the impact at those points and be prone to misalignment. Consequently, side sleepers do best with Medium Soft to Medium Firm mattresses. Stomach sleepers are like back sleepers and put the most pressure on the lumbar spine. They usually do best with a Firm mattress that can keep them out of a U-shape and that won’t feel suffocating when lying face-down on the mattress. Combination sleepers find themselves in more than one position through the night. They typically should choose a mattress based on the position they spend the most time in. If there’s no primary position, Medium Firm offers the best bet across the sleeping positions. These sleepers should also look for a responsive mattress that facilitates easy movement on the bed. Like sleeping position, body shape and weight influence the choice of the best mattress to provide spinal support, comfort, and other important features. With a lighter profile, people who weigh under 130 pounds don’t sink as far into a mattress. To get sufficient contouring, they often benefit from a softer mattress, especially if they sleep on their side and/or have pronounced pressure points. Innerspring mattresses tend to be a poor fit, and foam or hybrid beds are compelling options. People between 130 and 230 pounds can generally follow our suggestions for mattress firmness based on sleeping position in the previous section. Foam, hybrid, and latex mattresses are all solid options and can be selected based on their specific features and designs. will sink further into a mattress, especially near heavier parts of the body, which can risk throwing off spinal alignment. These sleepers usually have better results with mattresses that are a bit firmer to help avoid that risk. A responsive mattress is easier to move on top of, and this can be valuable to people over 230 pounds because it reduces the chances of feeling stuck in the bed. Latex and hybrid options tend to be the most responsive. Durability is important to sleepers of any weight, but people over 230 pounds can cause more wear in the top layers of a mattress. For this reason, sleepers with a higher body weight often opt for a mattress with a thicker comfort system that uses high-density materials. It’s not just weight that affects how to choose the right mattress. People with broader shoulders or hips may need a softer mattress with more contouring, especially if they are side sleepers. People over six feet tall should look closely at mattress dimensions to ensure that they can stretch out comfortably. As the piece of furniture that’s virtually guaranteed to get the most use, a mattress is a serious investment in your comfort. At the same time, it can be a serious investment financially, and pricing is a central factor to consider when buying a mattress. A useful exercise for most shoppers is to think about their overall bedroom budget. This includes a new mattress and any other accessories that may be needed, such as new pillows or bedding. The price range for mattresses stretches from extremely low-cost, low-quality models all the way up to six-figure designer beds. Looking past these outliers, most mattresses cost between $600 and $2,000. Casper Original ($995) Tuft & Needle Original ($595) Tempur-Pedic ProAdapt ($2,999) WinkBed ($1,599) Dreamcloud ($1,299) Brooklyn Bedding Aurora ($1,699) Avocado ($1,399) PlushBeds Botanical Bliss ($2,999) Zenhaven ($1,899) Sleep Number c2 ($999) Sleep Number p6 ($2,899) Saatva Solaire ($2,695) Mattresses with more features and robust design frequently carry a higher price tag, but this doesn’t mean that a costlier mattress is always better, which is welcome news to people shopping on a budget. A handful of factors can play into mattress pricing: Some types of materials, such as latex, frequently just cost more. In addition, the use of high-end, hand-crafted, organic, or otherwise specialty materials can push up the price of a mattress. The way a mattress is built can affect its price. In general, taller mattresses that have more layers come with a higher cost. Like most consumer products, some brands, especially those that aspire to be luxury brands, charge more. If the mattress and its components are made in the USA, it likely will be more expensive than a mattress made overseas. Buying online normally means a lower price, but there are opportunities to get a good deal in mattress stores, too, especially for savvy negotiators. For people who are worried about the cost of a new mattress, there are a few points to keep in mind. First, there are great values to be found throughout the mattress price range. Second, the prices we’ve listed above are MSRP, or in other words, the sticker price. It’s rare for customers to pay that price because , promotions, and discounts are abundant. For example, many brands run sales on holidays such as Labor Day, Memorial Day, , and . If you shop online, deals are typically offered right off-the-bat. Third, though it can be a big expenditure, getting a great mattress is worth it. An optimal mattress will not only pay off in terms of your health, but with better durability, you won’t have to spend on a mattress again for years. Good sleep is vital for children. Kids need more hours of sleep than adults, and sleeping well is important during all stages of childhood development. Outfitting their bed with a quality mattress is a central part of making sure that children get the sleep that they need. Knowing how to has quite a bit of overlap with choosing a mattress for an adult, but there are meaningful differences to take into account. One key difference is that safety is a greater concern when shopping for beds for children, especially infants who sleep in cribs. Assuring that the mattress meets safety guidelines is of the utmost importance. Another difference is the size of the bed. Unlike adults, children can outgrow a bed, so it is necessary to think about the most appropriate size mattress based on a child’s age and their expected growth. Depending on how old a child is, they may be able to use a smaller size (Twin or Twin XL) of a bed designed for adults. In other cases, parents may prefer a mattress built specifically for children. Choosing from the pool of beds available to adults means a wider selection of mattress types, models, and brands. The cost of a mattress for kids can be another point of divergence. Many beds for kids are smaller and thinner, and the reduced amount of materials can make them less expensive. However, there are some beds for children that are designed with lots of extra features and can carry a price tag similar to that of an adult mattress. There are several essential elements of choosing a crib mattress. Any crib mattress purchase should start . Key aspects of crib mattress safety include: Assuring that the crib mattress meets standards from the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) that relate to limiting exposure to lead and other compounds. Checking that the crib mattress meets CPSC size guidelines for use in a full-size crib. That means a minimum of 27.25 inches by 51.25 inches. The thickness should not be greater than six inches. Choosing a firm crib mattress as this can reduce the risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). Keeping the mattress clear of soft objects, including toys, blankets, and pillows. Loose and soft items can pose a risk of suffocation and SIDS and should not be kept in an infant’s crib. Beyond safety, there are other factors to review that relate to the convenience and usability of a crib mattress: : Messes are almost inevitable on a crib mattress, so a design that makes it easy to keep clean is a big plus. For example, some crib mattresses are made with either a waterproof cover (generally made of vinyl) or a waterproof backing. Many parents find these features make cleanup much simpler. : You likely will need to lift the crib mattress for cleaning, which for some parents provides a strong point in favor of lighter mattresses, such as those made of foam. : Foam and innerspring options are available and can both be used to create a firm sleeping surface. Some companies also make crib mattresses out of specialty materials or components, including some that are produced with an eco-conscious focus. : This design gives each side of the crib mattress a different feel. As your child gets older and doesn’t need quite as much firmness, the mattress can just be flipped over, helping you get more longevity out of your purchase. If your budget can’t accommodate a new mattress, you can consider a mattress topper as an alternative. This approach won’t be as effective or long-lasting, but it can be a useful step if replacing your current mattress isn’t an option. A topper sits on top of your current bed and goes underneath the fitted sheet. It can change the feel of your mattress and is most useful if your main focus is on adjusting the firmness level. Some toppers may be able to add contouring, motion isolation, or bounce in relation to your old bed as well. Most toppers are one to four inches thick and made with only one material. Examples of materials used in toppers include memory foam, polyfoam, latex, down, cotton, polyester, and wool. Each of these materials brings certain benefits and downsides. To choose a mattress topper, it’s useful to reflect on many of the same elements that play a part in choosing a new mattress: When reviewing those factors in the context of mattress toppers, make sure to think about your existing mattress because it will work along with the topper to affect the overall feel of your bed. For example, if you have a bouncy innerspring, be aware that it will still transfer motion even with a memory foam topper. Ultimately, if you choose to buy a topper, it’s important to be realistic. A topper won’t last as long as a whole new mattress, and it can’t revive a bed that’s already worn out. Putting a topper on a bed that is worn out and sagging will just mean that the topper quickly starts sagging as well. Should Mattresses Be Placed Directly on the Floor?

The comfort layers can include foam or latex, and sometimes will even include a shorter layer of coils (called micro-coils). These mattresses provide a blend of bounce and contouring with low heat retention and can be a good fit for sleepers in any position depending on exactly how they are built. : When all of the layers of a mattress are made with latex rubber, some call it an all-latex or true-latex mattress. For simplicity’s sake, we just use the term latex mattress. These offer top-notch bounce and durability with moderate contouring. When made with natural and organic latex, they are a top pick among eco-conscious shoppers. : Airbeds are built with an air chamber as their support core. A pump — controlled by a smartphone or remote — is built into the mattress to add or remove air with the push of a button, giving sleepers the utmost in firmness flexibility. Couples love airbeds because each side can be set to a different firmness level. Comfort is subjective, which means that it’s critical to find a mattress that feels right to you. Firmness describes how hard or soft a bed feels. To compare options, we use a 1-10 firmness scale. It isn’t perfectly scientific, but it does help convey how a mattress feels and who it may be best suited for. Sleepers under 130 pounds; side sleepers under 230 pounds Sleepers between 130 and 230 pounds; side sleepers over 230 pounds Side sleepers over 230 pounds; back and stomach sleepers over 130 pounds While the chart lists who most frequently benefits from a particular firmness level, remember that comfort is subjective. Some people just prefer a softer or a firmer mattress or may have other factors — such as back or hip pain — that influences what mattress feels right. If you’re not sure what firmness level is right for you, there are a few ways to help identify what might be the best fit: Consider your weight and sleeping position to narrow down a range. Reflect on whether you’ve found yourself wishing for a harder or soft mattress when using your current mattress at home or if you’ve recently stayed at a hotel. For reference, most hotel mattresses are Medium to Medium Firm, which have the widest overall appeal. Visit a local mattress store as a research mission and try out some beds. Make sure to stay on a mattress for at least 10-15 minutes to really evaluate what’s comfortable. There are myriad potential causes of back pain, but an unsupportive mattress is one factor that should not be underestimated. In people without back problems, proper support may prevent pain from arising, and in people who already have back issues, the right mattress may help with cushioning and comfort. Choosing the best mattress for back pain means considering the nature of that pain alongside other mattress needs and preferences. Some back pain is short-term and comes on suddenly. This is known as . Other times, the pain persists over a long period of time and is known as . Back problems can start out as acute, such as from an injury, and . A person with acute back pain may need only temporary relief from their mattress. This may mean using extra pillows or adjusting their sleeping position. For chronic back pain, more significant steps may be needed, such as choosing a mattress that is or . Finding the right levels of comfort as well as pressure relief can help keep the spine properly oriented during sleep. The optimal mattress may also depend on where a person experiences back pain. Lower back pain affects the bottom five vertebrae (L1-L5) in the lumbar area. It is the most common type of back pain and one of the leading reasons why Americans visit their doctor. This back region is vulnerable to bending and twisting that can harm the muscles and the spine itself. Spending too many hours in a bad sleeping position can cause lower back aches. For side sleepers, this can arise if the shoulders and hips aren’t supported, throwing the whole spine off-kilter. For back and stomach sleepers, it may occur because of a mattress that is too soft or too firm, putting pressure on the natural curvature of the lumbar spine. In general, side sleepers should look for Medium Soft to Medium Firm mattresses that can cushion their impact points. Back and stomach sleepers should look for Medium Firm to Firm beds that have only light conforming. are far less common. The anatomy in these regions is more stable, reducing the likelihood of sprains and strains from twisting movements. Pain in these areas can be tied to more serious problems and should be checked out by a doctor. In some cases, poor posture can create undue tension in the middle or upper back. A pressure-relieving mattress that contributes to spinal alignment can reduce the risk of this kind of pain. Having a quality pillow with the right amount of loft can also ensure that the neck and upper spine have adequate support. What position are you in when you normally tuck in to fall asleep? And in what position do you find yourself when you wake up? The answers to these questions can provide key insight to help choose a mattress. The parts of your body that need more support in order to maintain spinal alignment vary based on your sleeping posture. For that reason, choosing a mattress to suit your sleeping position can boost comfort and help avoid aches and pains. Back sleepers put the greatest pressure on their lower back. If a mattress is too soft, the torso can sink in more deeply than the upper back and lower body, and this U-shape can create strain. If a mattress is too firm, there won’t be any accommodation of the slight curve in the lower back. As a result, back sleepers do best with a Medium Firm to Firm mattress with light to moderate contouring. Side sleepers have sharp pressure points where the body is the widest, most notably at the shoulders and hips. On a too-soft mattress, those points will dip out of line with the rest of the spine. On a too-firm mattress, they will feel the impact at those points and be prone to misalignment. Consequently, side sleepers do best with Medium Soft to Medium Firm mattresses. Stomach sleepers are like back sleepers and put the most pressure on the lumbar spine. They usually do best with a Firm mattress that can keep them out of a U-shape and that won’t feel suffocating when lying face-down on the mattress. Combination sleepers find themselves in more than one position through the night. They typically should choose a mattress based on the position they spend the most time in. If there’s no primary position, Medium Firm offers the best bet across the sleeping positions. These sleepers should also look for a responsive mattress that facilitates easy movement on the bed. Like sleeping position, body shape and weight influence the choice of the best mattress to provide spinal support, comfort, and other important features. With a lighter profile, people who weigh under 130 pounds don’t sink as far into a mattress. To get sufficient contouring, they often benefit from a softer mattress, especially if they sleep on their side and/or have pronounced pressure points. Innerspring mattresses tend to be a poor fit, and foam or hybrid beds are compelling options. People between 130 and 230 pounds can generally follow our suggestions for mattress firmness based on sleeping position in the previous section. Foam, hybrid, and latex mattresses are all solid options and can be selected based on their specific features and designs. will sink further into a mattress, especially near heavier parts of the body, which can risk throwing off spinal alignment. These sleepers usually have better results with mattresses that are a bit firmer to help avoid that risk. A responsive mattress is easier to move on top of, and this can be valuable to people over 230 pounds because it reduces the chances of feeling stuck in the bed. Latex and hybrid options tend to be the most responsive. Durability is important to sleepers of any weight, but people over 230 pounds can cause more wear in the top layers of a mattress. For this reason, sleepers with a higher body weight often opt for a mattress with a thicker comfort system that uses high-density materials. It’s not just weight that affects how to choose the right mattress. People with broader shoulders or hips may need a softer mattress with more contouring, especially if they are side sleepers. People over six feet tall should look closely at mattress dimensions to ensure that they can stretch out comfortably. As the piece of furniture that’s virtually guaranteed to get the most use, a mattress is a serious investment in your comfort. At the same time, it can be a serious investment financially, and pricing is a central factor to consider when buying a mattress. A useful exercise for most shoppers is to think about their overall bedroom budget. This includes a new mattress and any other accessories that may be needed, such as new pillows or bedding. The price range for mattresses stretches from extremely low-cost, low-quality models all the way up to six-figure designer beds. Looking past these outliers, most mattresses cost between $600 and $2,000. Casper Original ($995) Tuft & Needle Original ($595) Tempur-Pedic ProAdapt ($2,999) WinkBed ($1,599) Dreamcloud ($1,299) Brooklyn Bedding Aurora ($1,699) Avocado ($1,399) PlushBeds Botanical Bliss ($2,999) Zenhaven ($1,899) Sleep Number c2 ($999) Sleep Number p6 ($2,899) Saatva Solaire ($2,695) Mattresses with more features and robust design frequently carry a higher price tag, but this doesn’t mean that a costlier mattress is always better, which is welcome news to people shopping on a budget. A handful of factors can play into mattress pricing: Some types of materials, such as latex, frequently just cost more. In addition, the use of high-end, hand-crafted, organic, or otherwise specialty materials can push up the price of a mattress. The way a mattress is built can affect its price. In general, taller mattresses that have more layers come with a higher cost. Like most consumer products, some brands, especially those that aspire to be luxury brands, charge more. If the mattress and its components are made in the USA, it likely will be more expensive than a mattress made overseas. Buying online normally means a lower price, but there are opportunities to get a good deal in mattress stores, too, especially for savvy negotiators. For people who are worried about the cost of a new mattress, there are a few points to keep in mind. First, there are great values to be found throughout the mattress price range. Second, the prices we’ve listed above are MSRP, or in other words, the sticker price. It’s rare for customers to pay that price because , promotions, and discounts are abundant. For example, many brands run sales on holidays such as Labor Day, Memorial Day, , and . If you shop online, deals are typically offered right off-the-bat. Third, though it can be a big expenditure, getting a great mattress is worth it. An optimal mattress will not only pay off in terms of your health, but with better durability, you won’t have to spend on a mattress again for years. Good sleep is vital for children. Kids need more hours of sleep than adults, and sleeping well is important during all stages of childhood development. Outfitting their bed with a quality mattress is a central part of making sure that children get the sleep that they need. Knowing how to has quite a bit of overlap with choosing a mattress for an adult, but there are meaningful differences to take into account. One key difference is that safety is a greater concern when shopping for beds for children, especially infants who sleep in cribs. Assuring that the mattress meets safety guidelines is of the utmost importance. Another difference is the size of the bed. Unlike adults, children can outgrow a bed, so it is necessary to think about the most appropriate size mattress based on a child’s age and their expected growth. Depending on how old a child is, they may be able to use a smaller size (Twin or Twin XL) of a bed designed for adults. In other cases, parents may prefer a mattress built specifically for children. Choosing from the pool of beds available to adults means a wider selection of mattress types, models, and brands. The cost of a mattress for kids can be another point of divergence. Many beds for kids are smaller and thinner, and the reduced amount of materials can make them less expensive. However, there are some beds for children that are designed with lots of extra features and can carry a price tag similar to that of an adult mattress. There are several essential elements of choosing a crib mattress. Any crib mattress purchase should start . Key aspects of crib mattress safety include: Assuring that the crib mattress meets standards from the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) that relate to limiting exposure to lead and other compounds. Checking that the crib mattress meets CPSC size guidelines for use in a full-size crib. That means a minimum of 27.25 inches by 51.25 inches. The thickness should not be greater than six inches. Choosing a firm crib mattress as this can reduce the risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). Keeping the mattress clear of soft objects, including toys, blankets, and pillows. Loose and soft items can pose a risk of suffocation and SIDS and should not be kept in an infant’s crib. Beyond safety, there are other factors to review that relate to the convenience and usability of a crib mattress: : Messes are almost inevitable on a crib mattress, so a design that makes it easy to keep clean is a big plus. For example, some crib mattresses are made with either a waterproof cover (generally made of vinyl) or a waterproof backing. Many parents find these features make cleanup much simpler. : You likely will need to lift the crib mattress for cleaning, which for some parents provides a strong point in favor of lighter mattresses, such as those made of foam. : Foam and innerspring options are available and can both be used to create a firm sleeping surface. Some companies also make crib mattresses out of specialty materials or components, including some that are produced with an eco-conscious focus. : This design gives each side of the crib mattress a different feel. As your child gets older and doesn’t need quite as much firmness, the mattress can just be flipped over, helping you get more longevity out of your purchase. If your budget can’t accommodate a new mattress, you can consider a mattress topper as an alternative. This approach won’t be as effective or long-lasting, but it can be a useful step if replacing your current mattress isn’t an option. A topper sits on top of your current bed and goes underneath the fitted sheet. It can change the feel of your mattress and is most useful if your main focus is on adjusting the firmness level. Some toppers may be able to add contouring, motion isolation, or bounce in relation to your old bed as well. Most toppers are one to four inches thick and made with only one material. Examples of materials used in toppers include memory foam, polyfoam, latex, down, cotton, polyester, and wool. Each of these materials brings certain benefits and downsides. To choose a mattress topper, it’s useful to reflect on many of the same elements that play a part in choosing a new mattress: When reviewing those factors in the context of mattress toppers, make sure to think about your existing mattress because it will work along with the topper to affect the overall feel of your bed. For example, if you have a bouncy innerspring, be aware that it will still transfer motion even with a memory foam topper. Ultimately, if you choose to buy a topper, it’s important to be realistic. A topper won’t last as long as a whole new mattress, and it can’t revive a bed that’s already worn out. Putting a topper on a bed that is worn out and sagging will just mean that the topper quickly starts sagging as well. Should Mattresses Be Placed Directly on the Floor?

49d3ff1b-47ed-4c74-8e2f-52e0926fa6eb,"Los ejercicio de cuello son una parte común de prácticamente cualquier programa de tratamiento para el dolor cervical. Un típico programa de ejercicios para el cuello consiste en una combinación de ejercicios de elongación y de fortalecimiento, acondicionamiento aeróbico y, posiblemente, ejercicios del punto gatillo. Este artículo se focaliza en los ejercicios para el cuello que sirven para aliviar la cervicalgia que puede ser causada por problemas posturales e incluye instrucciones para ejercicios específicos para la elongación del cuello, para el fortalecimiento del cuello, ejercicios aeróbicos y ejercicios del punto gatillo. El dolor de cuello recurrente o crónico puede ser severamente debilitante y también puede estar acompañado por dolor en la zona alta de la espalda, en los omóplatos y dolores de cabeza. Estos síntomas, junto con la tensión de los músculos del cuello y la rigidez de las articulaciones, puede convertir las actividades cotidianas más sencillas en actividades dolorosas. Un programa de ejercicios adecuado puede solucionar la mayoría de estos síntomas de la siguiente manera: Los ejercicios de flexibilidad y elongación pueden expandir o preservar el rango de movimiento y elasticidad en las articulaciones cervicales (del cuello) afectadas y así aliviar la rigidez, que es lo que causa el dolor. Como regla general, la tiene mejores resultados si se hace todos los días y algunos ejercicios de elongación deben ser realizados varias veces en un mismo día. Los ejercicios específicos de fortalecimiento lo ayudarán a mantener una mejor postura, lo cual, a su vez, aliviará o eliminará las exacerbaciones recurrentes de dolor. Como regla general, deben ser realizados día por medio para darle a los músculos el tiempo para que se reparen. Los ejercicios aeróbicos aumentan el flujo de sangre hacia los músculos y los tejidos blandos del cuello y de la zona superior de la espalda, lo cual puede ayudar a que se aflojen los músculos y que aumente el rango de movimiento. Además, también se producen endorfinas después de 30 a 40 minutos de ejercicio aeróbico. Las endorfinas son el analgésico natural del cuerpo y pueden ayudar a reducir el dolor cervical. El acondicionamiento aeróbico puede ser realizado todos los días. Algunas buenas opciones para el acondicionamiento aeróbico pueden ser el uso de una cinta de caminata, bicicleta fija, o un caminador elíptico, así como un ergómetro de miembros superiores o bicicleta para brazos. Para muchos, antes de comenzar con un programa de ejercicios, primero es necesario controlar el dolor. El movimiento gradual de las articulaciones y la elongación para aumentar el rango de movimiento en el cuello a lo largo del tiempo reducirá el dolor producido por la actividad normal. Hay una gran variedad de opciones disponibles para el manejo del dolor de cuello, a saber: Aplique una almohadilla de calor antes de realizar los ejercicios para precalentar las articulaciones y los músculos que están rígidos para que así sea más fácil elongar. Después de los ejercicios, aplique una bolsa de frío (o una bolsa de arvejas congeladas envuelta en una toalla) para reducir la inflamación en las articulaciones y en los músculos. Utilice medicamentos de venta libre, como agentes antiinflamatorios no esteroideos (por ejemplo, ibuprofeno) para aliviar el dolor y reducir la inflamación. Utilice antiinflamatorios y analgésicos de venta bajo receta (corticosteroides, inhibidores de la COX-2), cuando ello fuere necesario para controlar el dolor severo. Ejercicios de cuello para la cervicalgia Ejercicios de punto gatillo para el dolor de cuello Consulte con un profesional antes de comenzar con la fisioterapia Antes de comenzar con un programa de ejercicios o de elongación para el cuello, se les recomienda a los pacientes que consulten con un profesional de la salud, como un fisioterapeuta con experiencia, un fisiatra o un quiropráctico. El objetivo de una consulta médica es doble: Obtener un diagnóstico preciso de la causa del dolor o rigidez en el cuello, ya que los diferentes diagnósticos clínicos van a dictar diferentes tipos de ejercicios. Aprender la forma correcta de hacer los ejercicios, ya que hacer los ejercicios correctos pero de manera incorrecta es un error muy común y puede causar la falta de mejoría del dolor o incluso aumentar el dolor y los síntomas. Dependiendo del diagnóstico específico y del nivel de dolor que tenga el paciente, es posible que se recomienden diferentes ejercicios para el dolor de cuello. Es importante que los pacientes busquen un especialista en columna cervical que esté capacitado para la evaluación del dolor de cuello y desarrollar un programa de ejercicios individualizado. Véase Dado que las vértebras del cuello están influenciadas por tantos grupos diferentes de músculos (como la espalda, los hombros, el pecho y el cuello), es posible que los pacientes necesiten que un médico les haga un trabajo sobre los tejidos blandos como masajes o elongación manual, junto con ejercicios para el cuello. Un medico o profesional de la salud que esté capacitado en trabajo de tejidos blandos y en la prescripción de ejercicios puede proporcionar rehabilitación y alivio del dolor para los problemas del cuello y puede incluir fisioterapeutas, quiroprácticos y fisiatras, entre otros.

d36df550-e1c0-4bbc-b009-09cc3a6addfd,"What is the Difference Between a Pillow-Top and a Euro-Top? What is the Difference Between a Pillow-Top and a Euro-Top? When shopping for a , you will be presented with dozens of terms that are likely foreign to you. One question we see frequently relates to a layer of additional padding that some manufacturers sew on to the top layer of their mattresses. The terms “pillow-top” and “Euro-top” refer to different styles of this plush comfort layer. But what is the difference between a pillow-top and a Euro-top? Both of these terms refer to the plush comfort layer that’s placed on the very top layer of new mattresses. They are approximately 1 to 4 inches thick, and are usually relatively soft and comfortable. The primary goal of these additional padding layers is to provide better initial comfort and cushioning. Although the overall purpose is similar, pillow-tops and Euro-tops have distinct designs. This design consists of a single, gusseted layer made of either fiber or foam. As the name suggests, often have a soft, “pillowy” feel to them. The layer is sewn onto the top of the mattress, with a small gap between it and the underlying comfort layer of the mattress. The result is a style with distinct layering, rather than the more uniform look of a Euro-top. Pillow-tops feel consistently plush and conforming throughout the surface of the mattress. Euro-tops are also made of foam or fiber. However, this style typically utilizes denser, somewhat firmer materials. Euro-tops are sewn on flush with the edges of the mattress, rather than to the top of the mattress. Because of this, mattresses with Euro-tops appear more flat and neatly stacked, while pillow-tops appear more rounded. Euro-tops feel a bit more firm around the edges, with more cushioning towards the center of the bed. Put simply, the difference between a pillow-top and a Euro-top is mainly in their choice of materials, plushness, and where they are sewn onto the mattress. Pillow-tops are softer, fluffier, and create a more “bowed” appearance to the top of the mattress (similar to the shape of a ). Euro-tops are more dense, and completely flush with the surface of the mattress. There are a handful of other noteworthy differences between the two: Generally speaking, Euro-tops are considered more durable than pillow-tops. The light and fluffy design of a pillow-top will eventually start to flatten out, resulting in an uneven sleep surface. Euro-tops generally last longer, but they may also display some sagging around the edges of the mattress. Whether a mattress uses a pillow-top or a Euro-top is generally not a substantial contributor to its price-point. Both styles can be found on mattresses in all price ranges. Pillow-tops offer a good balance of cushioning and firmness throughout the mattress surface. Euro-tops are firmer around the edges, and more cushy in the center. Other than this distinction, the two styles feel similar. In most cases, the underlying design and firmness of the mattress will have a much more noticeable effect on a bed’s feel, compared to the choice between Euro-top and pillow-top. Euro-tops generally offer better edge-support, as they are firmer around the outer perimeter of the mattress, and because they come flush with the edges of the bed. Conversely, pillow-tops offer a bit less edge support, due to their design that sits atop the mattress, rather than flush with it. Overall, the differences between these two topper styles are relatively minor. When shopping for a new mattress, other factors will be much more important to consider.

Learn more about our process Twin is the smallest among the six standard mattress sizes. Specific dimensions vary by model, but most twin size mattresses measure about 39 inches wide and 75 inches long. Twins can be ideal for adults and children who sleep alone, but this size is usually too narrow for two or more people to sleep comfortably. Additionally, people who stand more than 6 feet 2 inches will probably be too tall for a twin size mattress. There are some benefits to choosing a twin over other mattress sizes. For one, twin sizes tend to be the cheapest options for any given mattress model. Twins also take up the least amount of floor space, making them suitable for people with smaller bedrooms. Below, you’ll find our picks for the best twin mattress models among beds currently sold in this size. These selections are based on a combination of verified owner experiences and product research and analysis. We’ll also discuss different mattress types, pros and cons of twin sizes, and important factors to look for when buying a new mattress.  Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King Adults and kids who prefer the body-hugging feel of memory foam Shoppers looking for an all-foam bed with decent edge support Close-conforming pressure relief from three layers of memory foam Supportive high-density polyfoam core for minimal sagging Get $399 worth of free accessories with every mattress purchase. Our best twin mattress picks begin with the Nectar, which is constructed with two memory foam comfort layers and an additional transitional layer of memory foam. The mattress has a medium firm feel, allowing you to feel some gentle contouring without sinking too deeply beneath the surface. A support core of high-density polyfoam reinforces the bed fairly well, and the edge support is above-average for the Nectar compared to other all-foam models. This means less sagging when you get on and off the bed and more stability when sleeping near the perimeter. The Nectar’s moderate conforming makes the mattress optimal for many side sleepers who weigh at least 130 pounds. The foam cushions the shoulders and hips to align the spine and reduce pressure throughout the body. A sturdy support system also ensures comfortable contouring and minimal sinking for back and stomach sleepers. The bed is virtually silent, as well, so you don’t need to worry about disruptive squeaks and creaks if you switch to a different sleeping position. The Nectar is relatively inexpensive compared to the average memory foam model. Customers in the contiguous U.S. qualify for free ground shipping. The mattress is backed by a 365-night sleep trial – one of the longest in the industry – and a non-prorated lifetime warranty for added peace of mind.  Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King Adults and kids who prefer the close contour of memory foam People who enjoy switching between firmness levels Flippable design lets owners select between medium soft and firm A copper infusion is intended to keep the surface cooler and cleaner Memory foam comfort layers enhance the pressure relief and motion isolation Get $160 off a Layla Mattress + 2 pillows, sheets, protector FREE with code: SLEEPFOUNDATION Another flippable mattress, the Layla is an all-foam model with a medium soft feel on one side and a firm feel on the other. Both sleep surfaces are constructed with memory foam. You’ll feel more sink on the medium soft side and stronger support on the firm, but both surfaces conform evenly to support your spine and reduce pressure points. We expect side sleepers and people who weigh less than 130 pounds to prefer the medium soft surface, while back/stomach sleepers and those who weigh more than 230 pounds will probably prefer the firm surface instead. However, you may find that both sides of the Layla are equally comfortable. The memory foam layers are infused with copper, which has cooling properties and can help prevent excessive heat buildup on the surface. The medium soft layer has an additional layer of convoluted polyfoam for added padding and air circulation. Edge support and ease of movement are a bit better on the firm side, while the medium soft side performs better when it comes to pressure relief. The Layla is reasonably priced for a memory foam mattress – especially a model with a reversible design. Shipping is free if you reside in the contiguous U.S. The mattress is also backed by a 120-night sleep trial and a non-prorated lifetime warranty.  Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King Adults and kids who like the contouring and springy feel of a memory foam hybrid Gel-infused memory foam comfort layer for pressure-relieving contouring Get $200 off a DreamCloud Mattress, no code necessary. The DreamCloud offers the feel and performance of a luxury hybrid at a budget-friendly price-point. The DreamCloud is constructed with comfort layers of polyfoam and gel-infused memory foam, both of which provide close and even body-contouring. The mattress has a medium firm feel, so sinkage is minimal. A transitional polyfoam layer and support core of individually-wrapped coils ensure a fair amount of responsiveness and strong reinforcement along the perimeter. The mattress is an excellent choice for hot sleepers. The coils circulate strong air currents to help the interior stay cool, and the entire bed is encased in a breathable cashmere-blend cover. Pressure relief is another major strength of the DreamCloud. The memory foam cushions the shoulders and hips to promote even spinal alignment for side sleepers, while the coils keep back and stomach sleepers on an even plane. With a profile of 14 inches, the DreamCloud is much thicker than the average mattress. While the DreamCloud is a bit pricey compared to our other top picks, this is a high-value model given its high-end design and strong performance across different categories. Shipping is free within the contiguous U.S. The mattress is backed by a 365-night sleep trial and a lifetime warranty, both of which are much longer than average.  Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King Adults and kids who prefer the responsive and contouring feel of polyfoam Graphite and gel infusions intended to wick away heat Polyfoam construction for responsiveness, motion isolation, and pressure relief Use this SleepFoundation.org link for the most current discount on Tuft and Needle mattresses Next up is the T&N Original Mattress from Tuft & Needle, another budget-friendly all-foam model. The T&N is designed with a comfort layer of graphite-infused, open-cell polyfoam over a high-density polyfoam base. Polyfoam has some contouring properties but it won’t cradle the body closely like memory foam, and you’ll notice a bit more responsiveness on the surface. This makes the mattress ideal for adults and kids who want some conforming without a lot of sink. The T&N is a particularly good option for people who sleep on their side and/or back. This mattress has a medium firm feel, resulting in a good balance of cushioning and support. The mattress also sleeps very cool for an all-foam model. The open-cell polyfoam found in the comfort layer is breathable and not very dense, so it shouldn’t absorb and trap too much body heat. The graphite infusion may also help to minimize warmth on the surface. Due to its low price-point in a twin size, the T&N Original Mattress is a good option for growing children or budget-conscious college students. The company will ship for free anywhere in the contiguous U.S., as well. The mattress is backed by a 100-night sleep trial and a 10-year warranty. Read our Full Tuft and Needle Original Review to learn more Sleepers who enjoy the feel of a responsive innerspring Get $200 off when you spend $1,000 or more at Saatva.com, no code necessary The Saatva Youth is our best twin mattress for kids pick. This reversible innerspring is designed to accommodate children as they grow and require more support from their mattress. One side of the bed is constructed with a comfort layer of zoned polyfoam that reinforces the back and hips while cradling the head, neck, shoulders, and legs. This ensures adequate support regardless of the child’s body type. Beneath the comfort layer, a support core of thick Bonnell coils provides excellent stability and edge support. When your child decides they need a firmer mattress, you can flip over the Saatva Youth for a completely different sleep surface. This side features a comfort layer of dense convoluted polyfoam, resulting in less cradling and better support. Saatva recommends this side for children ages 8 and older. Thanks to strong airflow through the coils and a breathable organic cotton cover, the Saatva Youth sleeps very cool for kids of all ages. The mattress is also very well made and should perform for at least seven years before a replacement is needed. The Saatva Youth is a bit pricier than the average children’s bed. However, Saatva provides free White Glove delivery anywhere in the U.S. Most competing brands charge at least $100 for this service, which includes in-home assembly and old mattress removal. The mattress also comes with a 180-night sleep trial and a 15-year warranty.  Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King Adults and kids looking for a mattress that does not use foam or latex Breathable construction helps keep the sleep surface cool Use this SleepFoundation.org link for the most current discount on Joybed mattresses The Joybed LX is a bit different from our other best twin mattress picks. This model is not constructed with any foam or latex whatsoever. The comfort layers consist of organic cotton and natural wool batting. These materials do not conform very much but they feel very soft and provide excellent cushioning for the body. The mattress has a firm feel and you’ll notice a significant bounce on the surface. The comfort layers are also highly breathable, and wool has moisture-wicking properties to help sleepers stay cool and dry during the night. The Joybed LX’s support core features pocketed coils with extra reinforcement along the perimeter. You won’t feel much sinkage when getting in and out of bed, and responsiveness from the coils should help you move easily and feel secure sleeping anywhere on the bed’s surface. The coils also promote strong airflow for added temperature control. We recommend the Joybed LX to anyone who normally sleeps hot, especially if they have had difficulties with foam or latex models. A twin size Joybed LX has a rather reasonable price-point. The mattress is particularly affordable compared to other models containing certified-organic and sustainably sourced materials. Joybed offers free shipping throughout the contiguous U.S., and the mattress is backed by a 100-night sleep trial and a 10-year warranty. Although it is the smallest mattress size, a twin can be useful in different situations. Twin models make great beds for children because they are generally inexpensive, so you won’t spend too much on a mattress that will most likely need to be replaced following a big growth spurt. Their affordability and space-saving dimensions also make twin mattresses a great option for college students sharing dorm rooms, or beds for a guest room in your house. We’ll cover everything you need to know about twin size mattresses, including dimensions, price expectations, and other important factors for buyers. Choosing the right mattress requires a fair amount of legwork on your part. You should research different brands and models to see how mattresses compare in terms of construction, feel, and price. Some mattress brands advertise their products using exaggerated and unrealistic descriptions. These include claims that their beds offer universal comfort regardless of the sleeper’s body type or normal position, or that a mattress will last forever. Instead, we recommend using the following qualities and attributes to guide your new mattress search. The average mattress costs $500 to $1,000 in a twin size. However, price-points vary significantly by mattress type. Expect to pay less for a twin size all-foam or innerspring mattress, while hybrids, all-latex models, and airbeds will likely cost much more. Additionally, you should expect prices to be higher for certain brands. People who sleep on their side often prefer softer mattresses that cushion the shoulders and hips. This helps to align the spine and alleviate pressure points. Back and stomach sleepers usually require more support to keep their bodies on an even, upright plane. Each mattress type provides a distinct feel. All-foam beds offer close contouring and respond slowly to the body. Latex beds also conform, but not as closely as all-foam models, so the surface has more bounciness. Hybrids and innersprings both feature coil systems that make them feel responsive, but hybrids typically have thicker comfort layers that offer more contouring. Airbeds allow owners to customize the firmness by adding or releasing air from their support core chambers. Whether a bed conforms very closely or barely at all, the contouring should be even across the surface. This ensures enhanced support for the lower back, hips, and other areas where people carry a disproportionate amount of weight, and gentler cradling for the head, neck, shoulders, and legs. Beds that do not contour evenly may cause added pressure points and other aches and pains. Certain mattress materials are associated with better durability and stronger performance in certain categories. These include high-density memory foam for exceptional contouring and pressure relief, breathable and eco-friendly organic latex, and thick steel coils to support the bed and reinforce the edges. You may pay more for mattresses with these components, but you’ll get more mileage and comfort out of your bed. Mattress firmness is evaluated using a 1-10 scale, with 1 being the softest and 10 the firmest – though most mattresses made today fall between 3 and 8. A softer mattress (1-3) will conform more closely, so you should expect deeper contouring and more sinkage. A firmer mattress (7-10) won’t conform as much but these models feel more supportive. Many sleepers prefer a mid-level firmness (4-6) with a balance of contouring and support. For any sleeper, the best mattress for pressure relief will cushion the body and support the spine without sinking too deeply beneath heavier areas of the body. People who weigh less than 130 pounds often find that softer mattresses alleviate the most pressure thanks to their close conforming. Those who weigh more than 230 pounds will probably prefer a firmer bed that won’t sink too deeply in certain areas. Edge support refers to how well the support core components reinforce the perimeter against deep sinkage. Coils typically offer the strongest edge support. You won’t sink very much when getting on and off most hybrids and innersprings. Foam and latex support cores cannot withstand compression as well, so you’ll probably sink a bit more on these models. Mattresses usually sleep cooler if they are constructed with breathable components such as ventilated foam or latex, coil systems that promote airflow, and covers made from natural fabrics and fibers. People who weigh 130 pounds or more may also find that they sink less on firmer mattresses, resulting in better surface airflow and more comfortable temperatures. The coils found in innersprings and hybrids may produce squeaks and creaks that sleepers find disruptive. This issue tends to worsen over time as the springs wear out. Foam and latex support cores do not produce any noise, so mattresses with these base layer components are usually silent. The twin size mattress – also known as a single – usually measures about 39 inches wide and 75 inches long. This size is better suited to certain types of sleepers, and less so for others. Couples and co-sleepers often find twin beds too narrow, whereas most single sleepers enjoy ample space to move around during the night. Based on its dimensions, we recommend a twin size mattress for the following sleeper groups: Twin size mattresses offer more than enough space for most growing toddlers and young children. Since they’ll likely undergo growth spurts in the years ahead, buying a twin for their first big kid bed can be very cost-effective. Twins also take up less space than other mattress sizes, which can be handy if the child’s bedroom is on the smaller side, and many bunk beds for room-sharing siblings are compatible with twin size mattresses. As with toddlers and kids, teenagers typically experience major growth spurts. While the twin will be too short for teens who stand taller than 6 feet 2 inches, these mattresses should offer enough legroom for shorter teens without their feet dangling over the foot of the bed. Many college students who share dorm rooms choose twin beds for their narrower and shorter dimensions, as larger sizes take up more floor space. Twins also tend to be the cheapest option for students on a budget. Additionally, many bunk- and loft-style beds available to dorm dwellers can accommodate a twin-size mattress. If you normally sleep alone and do not share your bed with another person very often, then a twin size mattress should provide ample space – provided your height doesn’t exceed 6 feet 2 inches, in which case you may need a twin XL. Twins are especially useful if your bedroom or apartment is somewhat small and you’d like to conserve space. Twin beds are ideal for single houseguests. They won’t take up as much space as a foldout sofa, and twin models tend to be more comfortable than futons or sofa beds. The twin and twin XL are the smallest standard mattress sizes. Most twins measure approximately 39 inches wide and 75 inches long. The twin XL shares the same width of 39 inches, but most of these models measure 80 inches long. Neither size is suited to couples or co-sleepers, but a twin XL will be more comfortable for people who stand between 6 feet 3 inches and 6 feet 7 inches tall. These individuals are a bit too tall for a standard twin and their feet will probably dangle over the foot of the bed, whereas a twin XL provides extra space for their legs and feet. Like other mattress sizes, twins carry their own pros and cons for sleepers and shoppers. Some notable benefits and drawbacks of twin size beds are listed below. Takes up less floor space than other mattress sizes Cost-effective option for growing children and teenagers, as well as college students Long enough for people who stand 6 feet 2 inches or shorter Too narrow and cramped for most couples and co-sleepers Limited availability for certain mattress types, such as airbeds and luxury high-profile models Too short for people who stand 6 feet 3 inches or taller Next, let’s take a closer look at the five main mattress types. Mattresses sold today fall into five general categories based on how the comfort layers and support core are constructed: hybrid, innerspring, latex, airbed, and all-foam. Mattress types generally earn the same ratings in performance categories like durability, pressure relief, and temperature neutrality. However, you’ll notice a lot of variation with these categories in terms of feel, price, and other factors. Hybrids are technically innersprings, but they are constructed with comfort layers of memory foam, latex, and other materials that conform more closely. As a result, they tend to alleviate more pressure than traditional innersprings. Hybrids almost always have pocketed coil support cores, as well. Hybrids are designed to perform well in several different areas. Their contouring comfort layers offer extra support for the spine and more pressure relief for sleepers – side sleepers, in particular. However, their coil systems also provide enough reinforcement for most back and stomach sleepers to lie comfortably without sagging too much. Hybrids sleep cooler than most all-foam models, while also isolating more motion than the average innerspring. Innersprings are the oldest mattress type still sold today, as well as the most popular among U.S. consumers. Most feature thin comfort layers of polyfoam (and possibly memory foam) over a support core of open steel coils. As a result, innersprings often feel quite responsive on the surface regardless of the firmness level. Innersprings tend to sleep cool for a few reasons. Since their comfort layers are usually somewhat thin, they won’t absorb and trap much body heat from sleepers. Their coil systems also promote steady airflow to help the mattress maintain a cool interior temperature, and their responsive surfaces prevent most sleepers from sinking too deeply. Latex is a material derived from the sap of rubber trees. It can be processed with chemical fillers to create a soft, foamy material that conforms to the body while also maintaining some natural responsiveness. Latex is also very durable, so you can expect a healthy lifespan from your twin size latex mattress. Latex beds are suitable for sleepers who prefer some noticeable body-conforming, but don’t want to sink too deeply into their mattress. The latex layers also offer great longevity and won’t develop deep body impressions as quickly as memory foam or polyfoam layers. An airbed is constructed with two or more air chambers in its support core. You can add or release air from individual chambers, which in turn changes the firmness in different areas of the sleep surface. Some airbeds also include comfort layers of polyfoam, memory foam, and other contouring materials. Due to their adjustable feels, airbeds offer unparalleled customization compared to other mattress types. However, many airbeds are designed for dual-firmness, or a different feel on each side, to accommodate couples with different comfort preferences. As a result, you’ll have a harder time finding high-quality airbeds in the twin size. An all-foam mattress is constructed with comfort layers of polyfoam and/or memory foam, along with a support core of high-density polyfoam. Many models also include transitional polyfoam or memory foam layers to prevent you from sinking too deeply. These mattresses respond slowly to the body and often conform quite closely, so you should expect less springiness and more sink. All-foam beds offer closer conforming than other mattress types. For most sleepers, this means better pressure relief around the shoulders, lower back, hips, and other sensitive areas. If you experience frequent pressure points, then you should consider an all-foam bed – but take your body type and sleeping position into account before choosing a model to ensure the bed will be soft/firm enough. Before you head off to find the right twin size mattress, take a few more minutes to peek at our final considerations for twin mattress buyers. This is an important consideration because the best twin mattress for adults may be a bit different than the best model for children and teenagers. If you plan to use the twin size mattress yourself, be sure to compare different models based on how the beds feel. The firmness level of the mattress you choose should align with your body type and sleep position, as well as your general preferences for how soft or firm a surface should feel. If you’re buying the mattress for a child or teenager, first get their input on what kind of mattress they’d prefer. You may want to consider visiting a brick-and-mortar mattress store, where your child can try out different beds and see which firmness and responsiveness levels feel most comfortable. The best twin mattress for a toddler should offer a bit more support to ensure they don’t sink too deeply into the bed. If you are a college student planning to use a bunk- or loft-style bed, or you have children with the same type of bed, keep in mind the bed’s thickness should correspond to safety rails on the top bunk (more about this in the next FAQ). Many bunk beds are specifically designed for twin size mattresses. These include standard double and triple bunks, as well as twin-over-loft beds with an open area beneath the top bunk. One thing to keep in mind when selecting a twin mattress for a bunk bed is thickness. According to the , the mattress used on a top bunk should be at least 5 inches shorter than the guard rails on either lengthwise side. For this reason, a low-profile mattress of about 6 or 7 inches thick will be optimal for most bunk beds. Before choosing a mattress, take a glance at the brand’s shipping, return, and warranty policies. You may save a lot of money down the road by choosing a model backed by favorable policies for owners. If you order your mattress online and reside in the contiguous U.S., chances are your standard ground shipping will be free of charge. Folks in Alaska, Hawaii, and other places outside the lower 48 usually need to pay extra delivery fees. Your mattress will probably come with a sleep trial of at least 90 nights. Most online mattress brands offer free shipping and full refunds for returns within the trial period, but some charge return fees. Be sure to check the fine print on how much of a refund you’ll receive. All mattresses come with a warranty of some kind, and most last 10 years or longer. If the warranty is non-prorated, then you won’t pay anything to have a defective mattress repaired or replaced apart from some nominal shipping fees. If the warranty is partially prorated, then you’ll pay a certain percentage of the bed’s original price to have the mattress replaced. This percentage usually increases for each year you own the mattress. Common defects covered under a mattress warranty include body impressions in the surface that measure 0.5 to 1.5 inches deep (this varies by model), manufacturing flaws that cause materials to deteriorate prematurely, and defects associated with the cover. Other issues, such as normal wear and tear or physical damage you cause to the mattress, will not be covered. Get $399 worth of free accessories with every mattress purchase.

Please note the date each article was posted or last reviewed.

The for low back pain are disc injuries, sciatica, lifting heavy objects, or some other non-specific back injury. Yet even though back pain is incredibly common, not all people respond in the same way to this often-disabling condition. In fact, even if two people have the same level of pain, their responses to that pain can be very different. These differing responses are due in part to different people’s psychological attitudes and outlooks. Even when you have low back pain that is being medically treated, it helps to understand the psychological factors that impact your pain — and your brain. It also helps to know what you can do about this. When your physical movement is limited, this can cause psychological distress, and the psychological distress can, in return, . Your personal can influence both your level of distress and course of the pain. For instance, if you are anxiety-prone, expect the worst, and have catastrophic thinking, this can . That’s because those psychological vulnerabilities can change your brain and intensify the pain. Often, if you have these pre-existing psychological attitudes, you also have abnormalities in the regulation of your brain’s (particularly dopamine), and the usual in are also disrupted. As a result, you can’t control your distress; your become anxious; you expect the worst; and you can’t focus on anything else. The pain becomes all-consuming. But it’s not just pre-existing attitudes that worsen back pain. The pain itself can rewire your brain. When pain first occurs, it impacts your pain-sensitivity brain circuits. But when pain lasts, the related away from the “pain” circuits to circuits that process emotions. That’s why emotions like anxiety often take center stage in chronic back pain. And it’s why emotional control becomes that much more difficult. Fortunately, can be really helpful with back pain. They help lessen pre-existing psychological vulnerabilities, change how you perceive the pain, and also alleviate the psychological factors (such as anxiety and anticipation) that maintain your pain. The treatment with the greatest supporting evidence (for all chronic pain syndromes, not just back pain) is mindfulness. A recent study demonstrated that a technique called (MBSR) can help to reduce back pain and also improve emotional control by increasing brain blood flow to the frontal lobe. A full eight-week course in this technique may even improve anxiety and depressive symptoms as well. Practicing mindfulness involves activating a brain relaxation pathway by deliberately ignoring mental “chatter” and focusing on your breathing. When you do this, an “unfocus” circuit, called the default mode network, is activated. However, in some chronic pain patients, this circuit is . In these cases, MBSR may not work. There other forms of psychological treatment that can be helpful as well. can be especially helpful. You can attend group or individual sessions either in person or via computer. Even a of back pain can benefit from psychological treatments. CBT can also an acute injury from progressing to chronic back pain. may help relieve the pain as well. CBT and hypnosis have weaker evidence to support their effectiveness for back pain than MBSR does, but they are worth trying if MBSR fails. Depending on the cause, low back pain can be treated with too. This is a technique in which you learn how to decrease your anxiety by becoming more aware of how you can tense and then relax your body. And there is also that combining psychiatric medication with psychotherapies may be more helpful than either treatment alone. So while it’s clear that low back pain be “in your head,” that doesn’t mean that you have to trivialize it. In this day and age, “mind over matter” makes little sense. “Mind” “matter,” especially when you consider that the physical “matter” of the brain plays a major role in mindset changes. This is especially true when it comes to the brain-based changes related to low back pain. To that extent, changing your mindset and brain biology can help your brain — and lessen your pain. Related Information: Here’s something completely different for low back pain | | | | I’m surprised to see no mention of chiropractic here. I’ve suffered back pain for 25 years or more. The kind that I could work through and play through but would be almost paralyzed at times. Mostly lumbar and then lower back pain started 10 years ago. 20 years ago I started chiropractic to unstick three vertebra that had locked together. Went through three months of extensive treatment which removed most of the pain and restored mobility. I’Ve been going back to the same chiropractor once every six weeks or so for adjustments and have had no major problems. If I do something stupid I go right in and the doctor gives me three or four sessions to restore health. I am 73 and have much degenerative arthritis but this has really worked for me. My sister had severe back pain, especially down her leg — foot was often like a chunk of ice. She was very limited in sitting, standing and walking. Doctors couldn’t help and she tried many things to no avail. Finally she heard of Dr Sarno and read/studied his books. She was much better in a month. So was I and another sister and lots of our friends that were willing to accept the method. TMS is a hard concept for many to grasp. Some people would rather have the pain than accept it has an emotional base. It was liberating for us. Dr Sarno thinks much chronic pain, that doesn’t heal has an emotional base. The brain is very powerful. Highly recommend his books. There are 3 or 4. Hope this is helpful to someone. I find this article unbearably banal, a rehash of countless speculations from immemorial times. Surprised that Harvard would stand behind such trivial exercise. Now, doctor, what about matter including mind? At the most fundamental level, most of clinical medicine is different degrees of speculation tested using statistical methods to assess the probability of truth. Nothing is absolute. To that extent, I think, especially in blog format, it is possible to assimilate evidence for or against arguments that is not comprehensive. That said, I think that research-based evidence offers a more comfortable rigor upon which to reflect. And most scientists would agree that the thing that most matters is if someone can achieve reliable help from a therapy based on speculation. If they can, then that matters most. My perspective is that these studies offer such hope at different levels of evidence. And I like the possibility of matter including mind. If you have a specific perspective, I am sure readers would benefit from reflection on this. Thank you. My severe chronic lower back pain is quite real (L4-5), the result of RA, spinal stenosis, scoliosis, osteoporosis. It required not only Fetanyl but a spinal stimulator to become bearable & manageable 8 yrs. Ago. It has nothing to do with how I perceive it, it’s not in my head. Along the way, I’ve had compression fractures, sciatica & probably a pinched nerve or two, real physical characteristics causing pain. PT helped sciatica about 15 yrs. Ago, stretching exercises help to quiet leg spasms at night. I know all of this is real as my back no longer supports me. I lean on something to prepare food, brush teeth, do most things. A cane or Walker support me walking. I’m 70, not 80 or 90 & distressed, finding it difficult to cope. I also have lower back pain, muscle spasms mostly at night, but also when sitting. Pain if I sit too long, stand too long or walk too long. Long is a matter of minutes. When I carry a bag I need a cane or walker. Standing I always lean on something. In airports I ask for wheelchairs. I fell with ice skating when 26, and probably dislocated a disc at that time. Injections with pethedine en cortisone and rest were treatment at that time. After 2 weeks I was back at work, but ever since have had problems with standing long. Walking and other problems only started in recent years. I’m 72 now. I had one disc removed L4-5, and have 2 more slipped discs, L3-4 and L5-S1. Doctors are not interested in more surgery, because….. as I only recently discovered, arthritis is in my spine from neck to bottom. I has caused scoliosis, stenosis and the rest. I go for regular neck massages and do lots of exercise to keep everything moving. I have discovered that taking anti-anxiety medicine (zoloft) helps with pain tolerance. I have Baclofen against the muscle spasms, and if I cannot sleep due to spasms, I can take a low grade valium. I find that panadol osteo, an occasional panadol-forte help, as well as a glass of wine. (not together). Frame of mind and attitude can help. So glad to read the first comment. I discovered Dr. Sarno’s work many years ago and truly believe that much back pain is the result of emotions. Highly recommend reading his books. I find my back is much better when I dance vigorously! Yes, emotions do play a role. Positive outlook on life helps a lot. I still cannot do much of what I’d like to do, but work around it. And just concentrate on doing what I can do. I do use Swiss Ball a few times a week when I have pain and that helps too. I do realise that I most likely will live 10 years less than I would without this condition. But, I don’t dwell on that. I could develop something else that is worse. I could have been in a wheelchair from the day of the accident. Instead I had 30 good years with minor back aches, and 15 with pain and surgery, but still living a regular existence. I feel I am lucky to have reached 71 and hope for another 10 years of reasonable self management. I’ve had co-worker who needed an electric wheelchair, was quadriplegic since his early 20s. Now he had much less of a life, but still hangs on. That’s mind over matter. Your article is one of the best I’ve seen on back pain, but you mentioned nothing about TMS–Tension Myositis Syndrome–and the work of John E. Sarno MD. People need to know that so-called spinal “abnormalities” such as disc problems do NOT cause chronic pain. Studies proved this over 25 years ago, and yet surgeons still wrongly perform surgeries on discs even though the US Dept. of Health and Human Services reported that “surgery has been helpful in only 1 out of 100 cases of low back pain.” [HHS publication No. 95-0644, Dec. 1994 page 12]. Thank you for mentioning SAINT Dr. John Sarno. The man is a true life-saver. I had disc surgery at 38 and thought my life of exercise was over, very depressed. Then someone told me about Dr. Sarno’s books and it completely gave me my freedom back! (pardon the pun) The man should be knighted and sainted when you factor in all of the people he has cured of debilitating pain over decades. I experienced a nonfault car wreck last year. Was taken by ambulance to a local hospital, examined and released. My condition was diagnosed as follows: “mild grade one subluxation of L4 on L5. Degenerative facet disease in the lower lumbar spine. Mild endplate degenerative spurring at L4-5.” Was refereed to an orthopedic surgeon by my internist of over 15 yrs. This specialist “pinpointed my condition as “723.4 cervical radiculopathy, neuritis nos; 723.1 cervicalgia. Previous to my appointment with the ortho surgeon, my internist shared his evaluation that although he agreed that I had some degenerative back issues (my age is 70), his view was that the accident exacerbated my condition. Thus, I was now experiencing pain, most in my left that may not have occurred and if it did was now happening perhaps 5 years earlier. My arm pain occurs daily and the pain is annoying but bearable. It is greatest when I drive my automobile, which I can tolerate for long distances. My ortho surgeon has given my arm pain the label of “spondylosis.” I also have hip pain which has been labeled “spondylolisthesis” In addition, I have completed 6 months of physical therapy, which has helped me but my ortho surgeon has recommended a procedure called ACDF – anterial cervical distectomy fusion. Can you help shed some light on my situation. Thank you much. I’m so sorry that you had to go through this difficulty. I am unfortunately not able to respond to individual clinical scenarios, as some vital information may be missing. However, I would encourage you to discuss the psychological treatments described in this blog with your coordinating physician, and to see if any of the treatments mentioned might be worth trying to help with symptomatic relief. Some others here (in the comments section) have also mentioned techniques they have tried. I would encourage you to add this to your list of approaches to discuss. Important- grt at least 2 opinions from the abdolute best neurosurgeons in your area. If 2 of them agree you need cervical fusion, get it. I have had 2.iThe goal is to stabilize your spine. Might or might not help your pain. I have been totally disabled >20 years. Mindfulness meditation is an excellent coping mechanism. Will be your best tool in daeling with everything. Be sure to go to BEST hospital and BEST neurosurgeons. That is absolutely imperitive. Good luck! You need to see a physiatrist before you do anything else. They are very good in treating these kinds of pains. Neurologists always want to operate and that may no t be the best solution, believe me I have been there and back. Skill of the surgeon is Paramount.. Success rate for Back surgery is not that high. But if you must get the Best Surgeon – Best hospital . My son fell off a roof onto grass while working. . Broke his back ! Northwestern Hospital in Chicago performed surgery, inserted a 10 inch rod in his back This was in 1996. Northwestern is highly rated for back surgery. My son is doing well, walking, working …he is now 55 years old. Take care Get 2nd and even 3rd opinion from neurosurgeons. They actually are less keen to co surgery than ortho surgeons. Neurosurgeons specialise on nerve damages, ortho surgeons focus on the bones. Some do backs, some don’t. My neuro surgeon figures that with all the arthritis in my spine removing another disc isn’t going to help much. He’s most likely correct. Surgery should be last resort, if your pain is unbearable and you cannot function. I was at that point when I had a disc removed 15 years ago. Couldn’t move, so it had to be done. Now I keep moving, thanks to Pilates, stretching, treadmill walking, and generally being as active as I can. Don’t forget that at 70 or over surgery has more risk than at 60 or 50. If you can manage the pain thru mindfulness, exercise and medication that is preferable over surgery. Also, there’s no guarantee that surgery will bring relief. After a fusion there is also loss of range of movements. So, be careful, think it over. I’ve had sciatica, but, my little dogs take me walking thru it. (sometimes very slowly) In two weeks, I walked normally. Having worn a toolbelt for decades, you stand different. Chiropractor said we and Casino change people were his most patients. Haha. Thanks Doc. YES We must Keep Moving as much as possible ! Too much sitting / Inaction will cripple our bodies over time… Another thing one might want to consider is to “accept” the pain as an offering for past deeds needing forgiveness. I have found when i do this and accept the pain, it somehow seems to become less severe and more easily bearable. Thank you for this additional information. Back pain is clearly very debilitating, and the more ideas we have, the more we can consider. I have scoliosis and i do yoga and hang upside down and mindfulness meditation, and it all relieves pain for awhile. Having a positive attitude does help too. Thanks for confirming some of these techniques and sharing some of your own as well. Really helpful to others. Thank you for this paragraph: “Often, if you have these pre-existing psychological attitudes, you also have abnormalities in the regulation of your brain’s chemistry (particularly dopamine), and the usual brain functions in emotional control, anxiety, and attention are also disrupted. As a result, you can’t control your distress; your become anxious; you expect the worst; and you can’t focus on anything else. The pain becomes all-consuming.’ I suppose it can apply to other ailment as well. Thank you for airing this problem once again. The British Medical Journal has a very well researched trail showing how effective a psycho-physical approach as used by Alexander Technique teachers can be in resolving chronic back ache. . This may offer your readers a further option in dealing with this problem. Niall Kelly, certified Alexander Technique teacher. One can comment only from one’s own experience. For years I suffered from episodes of severe lower back pain several times a year and was sent by my family physician to physical therapy. Although it was comforting to lie on a table on a heating pad with some electric stimulation, it afforded me no relief whatsoever. A physiatrist recommended a book called something like Healing Your Own Back by Robin McKenzie. The recommended exercises were so simple that I memorized them and gave the book away after several years. The principal exercise was to bend back from the waist as much as I was able and hold it there for 10 seconds or so. I did it once or twice a day . That was at least eight years ago and I have never suffered lower back pain again Now from time to time I lean back from the waist and hold it for several seconds just to reinforce the benefits. I am happy to share this simple tip and hope that at least it helps some people. I realize that others may have a different type of pain requiring different procedures. Awesome. As with all tips, including the one’s I offer, it’s best to discuss with your physician to see what best works for you and your situation. It’s really great that you can share this tip-Thank you. thanks for sharing that… you may never know how many you have helped with that I have quite a few clients whose back pain has become worse by bending back from the waist so this is not for everyone and you do need to be careful. Richard Brennan (Alexander Technique Teacher and author of ‘Back in Balance’) I second the comments on the MacKenzie exercises. Twenty five years ago I experienced severe back pain related to a herniated L5/S1 disc. I was fortunate to be referred to an excellent physical therapist who prescribed MacKensie exercises, which I still use as needed. I am pain free and active at 67. Sorry to disagree with the author, but for real pain caused by a real mechanical abnormality in the spine or adjacent soft tissue issues, the brain has nothing to do with perception. Same thing applies to feeling cold when it is actually cold or perceiving an itch and trying to think the discomfort away. Sorry, this is a hefty dose of baloney. Thanks for sharing your perspective. In my clinical experience, I always take reports of pain as being “real” even when it is not clear what the source is. Even factitious symptoms indicate that there is a real underlying problem. As for your statement that “for real pain caused by a real mechanical abnormality in the spine or adjacent soft tissue issues, the brain has nothing to do with perception”, I would refer you to this article on spinal cord injury and psychological symptoms (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2743728/) and basic studies such as this one (). That said, there is always room for more and better controlled trials, and the samples included may not reflect the situations of individual patients. In that respect, many patients may not benefit from psychological interventions, but as you can see from the accompanying comments here, there are patients who can do better with psychological interventions. I agree…sure, your attitude and pain threshold and personal circumstances can help you bear or not bear the pain…But it is there and it’s not all in your head ! I stopped reading at “In fact, even if two people have the same level of pain…” There is no way to compare levels of pain in different individuals.

The amount of mattress brands out there can make the process seem daunting, so the team at Mattress Advisor used their expert testing to round up 8 excellent picks to help streamline your search. These are the 8 best pillow top mattresses to buy online: What is a pillow top mattress? A pillow top mattress can be made out of a variety of materials, but is defined by its ultra-cushioning top layer. The soft surface of pillow top beds provides superior pressure relief and keeps your spine in its natural alignment by contouring around the hips, shoulders, knees, and other high-stress areas. The pillow top layer allows these tender points to gently sink into the bed, reducing strain. The benefits of a pillow top mattress Plush feel Pillow top beds are known for their incredibly plush comfort level. They provide a cushioning surface that makes you feel like you’re floating on a cloud as you sleep.  The plush layer of a pillow top mattress supports proper spine alignment by helping to distribute your weight evenly along the length of the bed. This prevents certain areas of your body from bearing most of the stress.  Pain relief The added comfort layer on a pillow top mattress cradles your pressure points by allowing them to gently sink into the mattress, reducing your chances of waking up with morning aches and pains. It’s a great choice for sleepers with orthopedic issues who need a bed with extra padding. Motion isolation If you sleep with a pet or partner, you will appreciate the motion isolation a pillow top mattress provides. The top layer absorbs movement so you won’t be disturbed by your companion’s tossing and turning throughout the night.  Types of pillow top mattresses Innerspring An innerspring mattress, like the , is made with a core of spring coils that responds to your movements, gives the bed a bouncy feel, and provides firm support. They’re the mattresses thanks to the ample space between coils, which allows for more airflow. Adding a pillow top comfort layer to an innerspring bed helps to soften up the feel of a firm mattress without compromising the support or cooling features that this type of bed offers.  A hybrid mattress, like the , combines two or more mattress materials into a single bed (most pillow top mattresses fall into this category). They tend to come with a higher price tag because of their complex construction, but hybrids are also highly durable and typically offer a nice balance of support and contouring comfort.  A , like the , has a buoyant feel to it but still offers firm support like an innerspring bed, and provides light contouring around your body similar to a memory foam mattress. Latex is motion isolating and pressure relieving, but instead of feeling like you’re sinking into the mattress, it’s like you’re floating on top of it. Pillow top vs. euro top  A pillow top is an extra layer of padding that’s sewn into the surface of the mattress. A euro top is essentially the same thing with one key difference: it’s sewn flush, which means it has a more polished look and feel. Euro top mattresses are considered to be “top of the line” due to their excellent edge support that helps prevent sagging.  Choosing the best pillow top mattress While there are many great pillow top mattresses available, some beds will be a better fit for you than others. Here are some of the most important factors to consider. The firmness level of your mattress is subjective—what feels soft to you may be too firm for another sleeper. Back and stomach sleepers benefit from a medium-firm to firm mattress that balances sturdy support and comfort. Stomach sleepers, especially, need firm support to keep their midsection from drooping too far into the mattress. , on the other hand, often require a softer mattress to provide necessary pressure relief to sensitive areas like the hips and shoulders.  Temperature Pillow top mattresses can be made from a variety of materials, but most end up being a hybrid construction composed of foam and innerspring coils. This type of mattress because of the inclusion of coils, which offer greater airflow and breathability. However, if you’re a perpetually hot sleeper you may want to look for an option that actively promotes cooling.  The high-grade construction of pillow top mattresses make them a more expensive option—a queen size usually costs around $1,000 or more—but it’s important to note that these materials hold up over time, making each mattress an investment that’ll last for decades.  The 11 Best Mattresses in a Box, According to Rigorous Expert Testing Credit: DreamCloud Best Overall: DreamCloud Premier The ’s pillow top consists of a silky soft cashmere blend that cushions your curves, allowing you to sink into the mattress just enough for next-level pressure relief.

Healthy Home Pets Family Relationships Style Holidays Sex Gifts Money Tech Medicare Best Life Now Join Now Email Preferences Newsletters Manage Your Subscription Help Logout Give a Gift Subscription That endless tension headache or sinus pressure might actually be a migraine. Here's how to tell for sure—and get rid of the pain, fast. By By Ginny Graves June 04, 2012 Tara Moore/Getty About once a month, usually around my period, I start feeling sort of…off. My neck gets tight and achy, and I can't think as clearly as usual, like my mental gears are gummed up. That slow-brain feeling, I've learned over the years, is not a good sign. It means I'm about to get a migraine. It's my cue to be careful—to steer clear of red wine and sugar, two sure triggers when I'm in that sensitive state, and to get enough rest since lack of sleep can tip me over the edge, too. Even so, if anything in my routine is out of whack—if I don't eat often enough, or if I become overly stressed—I can count on one or two days of misery. Head-pounding, nauseated, verge-of-tears misery. Sound bad? Compared to many of the 30 million migraine sufferers in the U.S., my experience is fairly mild. Several years ago, the massive American Migraine Prevalence and Prevention Study found that half of those who struggle with migraines can't do household chores and a third forgo family or social activities. That's a whole lot of agony, and it affects three times as many women as men, largely because the ups and downs of our hormones seem to make us more susceptible, according to Andrew Charles, MD, professor and director of the UCLA School of Medicine's Headache Research and Treatment Program. A migraine isn't just a headache; it's a neurological disorder, often inherited, in which triggers ranging from stress to certain foods to even changes in the weather set off a chain reaction in the brain that results in intense pain. Most migraine sufferers are between the ages of 20 and 50—women in full-speed-ahead career/family/juggling mode. We're talking about multitaskers who definitely can't afford a day or two (or more) of feeling cruddy. And yet most don't get effective treatment, even though there are plenty of options. ""Many people still don't know what migraines are or that there's good help available,"" says Stewart Tepper, MD, a headache specialist at the Cleveland Clinic's Center for Headache and Pain. In fact, many women don't even realize that they've got migraines in the first place. The truth is, most bad headaches—the ones that make getting through the day a chore or make you feel nauseated or sensitive to light—are the Big M. ""They're more common than we used to think,"" Dr. Charles says. ""Nearly 48 percent of all women will have a migraine at some point in their lives."" Although tension headaches affect more people, they're far less debilitating and easier to deal with. Studies have found that most people who complain to their doctors about headaches have migraines—as do nearly 90 percent of people who think they have sinus headaches. That's why it's so important to understand migraines—why we get them, what triggers them, how to prevent them, and the most effective ways to treat them at every stage. Next Page: [ pagebreak ] The best migraine defense is a good offense—stopping it before it starts. ""One of the most effective things you can do is maintain regular habits and try to keep your life on an even keel,"" says Peter Goadsby, MD, director of the University of California–San Francisco Headache Clinic. Eat, sleep, and exercise regularly (studies have shown that both cardio and stretching are effective at reducing headaches), and try to control your stress, since that is the number-one migraine trigger. Two options proven to help: biofeedback and cognitive behavioral therapy. With biofeedback training, technicians attach electrodes to your head and neck to measure muscle tension and relaxation, so you not only learn to recognize those states but to control them. And in cognitive behavioral therapy, you learn relaxation strategies, like meditation. ""You get about a 55 percent reduction in headache frequency, on average, with behavioral approaches,"" says Donald Penzien, PhD, director of the Head Pain Center at the University of Mississippi Medical Center, ""so long as you make an effort to put the techniques into practice."" Training costs between $70 and $250 a session, but it's usually covered by insurance. And when Penzien and his colleagues studied the cost of behavioral therapies a few years ago, they found that most people learn the techniques in just a few sessions. Consider taking a supplement as a preventive measure if your headaches are disabling—even if you only have one or two a month. Since different options work for different people, you may need to try several before finding the one that's most effective for you: Butterbur (or Petasites root) is an herb that can help reduce the frequency of attacks, possibly by reducing inflammation. Researchers at Albert Einstein College of Medicine found that people who took 75 milligrams twice a day had about half as many migraines as usual over a four-month period. Vitamin B2, or riboflavin, reduced headache frequency from four per month to two in a German trial—possibly because it speeds up brain metabolism, which seems to be beneficial for those with migraines. ""The effective dose is 400 milligrams per day,"" Dr. Goadsby says. Coenzyme Q10 is a vitamin-like substance found in meats and seafood. It, too, may boost the brain's energy metabolism. Research shows a dose of 100 milligrams three times a day can decrease the frequency of headaches by about 50 percent. Magnesium is an element that's involved in a variety of bodily functions, and there's some evidence that low levels can trigger migraines. ""A dose of 300 to 500 milligrams a day might help,"" Dr. Charles says. ""If you have several disabling attacks a month, and you can't control the pain, talk to your doctor about using preventive medication on a daily basis,"" Dr. Goadsby says. Options include: Beta-blockers normally used to treat high blood pressure, such as propranolol (sold as Inderal) and timolol (sold as Blocadren), help prevent headaches likely because they help improve blood flow. Antiseizure drugs topiramate (sold as Topamax) and valproic acid (sold as Depakote) may reduce your migraines because epilepsy and migraines are caused by similar reactions in the brain. Tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline are used for migraine prevention because they regulate levels of the feel-good chemical serotonin in the brain, and it's believed that serotonin may play a role in the development of migraines. Botox injections are approved for use in people with chronic migraines (headaches more than 15 days a month). They help people have fewer headaches and less painful headaches, possibly because Botox affects the facial nerves that play a role in migraines, according to Dr. Goadsby. Next Page: [ pagebreak ] Sometimes, catching an attack in the pre-head-pain phase, known as prodrome, can prevent a full-blown headache. Not everyone has early-warning symptoms, but a 2004 study at the Headache Center of Atlanta found that about a third of people experienced signs like feeling tired and moody or having diarrhea and neck pain about eight hours before their migraine set in. Because stress is the most common migraine trigger, you might be able to stave off a headache by taking a few minutes to decompress, Penzien says. Try five minutes of diaphragmatic breathing: Lie on your back with a pillow beneath your head and another under your knees, so your legs are slightly bent. (You can also do this sitting in a chair.) Put your right hand on your upper chest and your left just below your rib cage. Breathe in slowly through your nose so your stomach pushes up against your left hand. Then, as you exhale, blowing out through pursed lips, tighten your stomach muscles and let them fall inward. Your right hand should remain as still as possible through the inhale and exhale. A pair of recent studies looked at treating migraine during the pre-headache stage and found it was at least moderately effective in heading off an attack, so it makes sense to talk to your doctor about taking a triptan, such as Imitrex. These drugs (if appropriate for you, your doc will give you an Rx and determine the best dose) reduce inflammation and constrict blood vessels in the brain. You can also try an over-the-counter pain med such as ibuprofen (400 to 600 milligrams). Though it's better to prevent a headache than try to get rid of it, that's not always possible. Fortunately, there are good options for managing the pain when you're hit by a migraine. ""All medications work better when you take them early in the attack—within 30 minutes of when you feel the headache coming on, whether you're actually feeling pain yet or not,"" Dr. Tepper says. ""Also, you have to be careful not to use any medications more than 10 days a month, because you run the risk of transforming your periodic headaches into a chronic condition."" OTC nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like naproxen and ibuprofen inhibit blood vessel inflammation, so they can reduce the pain, as can simple analgesics like aspirin or acetaminophen. Another good option: drugs (like Excedrin) that combine acetaminophen and aspirin with caffeine, which narrows blood vessels and increases the effectiveness of pain relievers. Triptans are the best prescription option for treating migraines, but because they constrict blood vessels, you can't use them if you have a history of heart attack or stroke. Dihydroergotamine (sold as Migranal) is a new Rx nasal spray or injection that tightens blood vessels in the brain. Studies show it reduces nausea and sensitivity to light and sound as well as pain. Rest. If you can do it, relax in a dark, quiet room at the first sign of a headache—either during the aura phase or the second the pain hits. Stretch your neck by tilting your head gently to one side for 10 seconds, then the other. ""Neck tightness and discomfort are common symptoms, so stretching might provide a little relief,"" says Dr. Charles. Relax. Try yoga or progressive muscle relaxation (in which you tighten, then relax one group of muscles at a time, starting at your calves and working up to shoulders). Because of the connection between migraine and stress, relaxing can make a big difference.

This one has soft support that's particularly ideal for stomach sleepers. available at 3 Bedgear Alpine 2.0 Pillow If you're a back or side sleeper, or tend to run hot, this Bedgear pillow is a great choice.

9b6e5940-76ec-4c87-88a6-6b9cfc458f05,"— — Cracking your joints is a common habit. Many of us do it. We crack our knuckles, fingers, toes, backs, and even our necks. But not everyone does it for the same reason. Some of us do it to release pressure that we’re feeling in our shoulders or neck or as a reaction to stress. Sometimes it’s just a matter of habit. But is there actually any benefit to cracking your neck? The answer is yes and no. Cracking your neck gently or only cracking it occasionally won’t cause you any harm, but doing it incorrectly, too frequently, or too forcefully can actually cause more pain or discomfort than you felt before you cracked your neck. Keep reading to learn more about the potential risks, what’s happening when you try to crack your own neck, and when to seek help. When you crack your neck or any joint in your body, the capsules around your joint are stretched. These capsules contain fluid, and stretching them allows the fluid to put less pressure on the joint. As the pressure decreases, the fluids in the joint turn to gas. When the fluid becomes gas, it makes a popping noise. This process is known as either boiling or cavitation, and it usually isn’t harmful. In the case of your neck, you have several sets of joints called facet joints. These joints are located on each side of your neck. When you crack your neck, the facet joints stretch, which lets fluid spread out in the joint capsule. Once the fluid becomes gas, your neck joints pop. This is what makes neck cracking feel like it’s releasing pressure from your neck area. An alternate theory suggests that the cracking sound is produced by a bubble being created in the joint. Although cracking your neck can benefit you in a few ways, you should always talk to your doctor or chiropractor before doing so. They can advise you on whether it’s safe for you and recommend other options for relief. showed that having your neck cracked by a chiropractor can have a positive mental effect. That’s because many people associate cracking sounds with the release of pressure and successful adjustment of a joint. In some cases, just hearing the cracking sound can make someone feel better, even if no pressure was released or the joint wasn’t even fully or successfully adjusted. This is known as a “placebo effect.” Cracking your neck also releases endorphins in the area of your neck joints. Endorphins are produced by your pituitary gland and are released by your body to help manage pain. When you crack your neck, endorphins are released in the area. This gives you a feeling of satisfaction and pleasure. Cracking your neck can be harmful if you don’t do it correctly or if you do it too often. Cracking your neck too forcefully can pinch the nerves in your neck. Pinching a nerve can be extremely painful and make it difficult or impossible to move your neck. Cracking your neck too hard can also strain the muscles around your joints and the joints themselves. When your muscles or joints become strained, moving your neck can feel like a chore. Feeling like you need to crack your neck a lot may be a result of . This is when your joint has a larger range of motion than normal. When you give in to the urge to crack your neck a lot, the ligaments in your joints can get permanently stretched. This is called perpetual instability. When this happens, your neck joints are more at risk of developing . Your neck is home to many important blood vessels. In some cases, cracking your neck too hard or too often can puncture one of these blood vessels. It can also cause , which can be dangerous as it blocks blood flow to your brain.

You should also see your doctor or chiropractor if: you begin to notice any unusual swelling in your neck, as this can be a sign of fluid buildup, injury, or infection you start to feel pain in your neck joint, especially chronic pain that doesn’t have any noticeable cause your joints are starting to become less mobile because of age or a condition like osteoarthritis A chiropractor can help to make sure they’re aligned, which can prevent the feeling of pressure or pain that makes you want to crack your neck. They can also give you advice on how to change your lifestyle, such as exercising or losing weight, to minimize neck pressure or pain. They may also give you tips on how to treat your neck at home. This can include how to use heat or cold on your neck to reduce pain or swelling. To find a chiropractor, ask your doctor to refer you to a specialist in your network. Your healthcare provider may also provide an online specialist locator so that you can search for your own chiropractor. Your health insurance may cover a chiropractor, but it’s best to check your insurance to see what the cost of a specialist is. Depending on how much your insurance will cover, seeking a chiropractor can cost anywhere from a few hundred to a few thousand dollars. Neck cracking, especially when it’s done right and not too often, can make you feel good by releasing pressure in your joints. But if you’re doing it a lot and feeling constant pressure or pain, see your doctor or a chiropractor.

Thanks to its added cooling features, the TEMPUR–breeze° may have an edge with side sleepers who tend to sleep hot. Tempur-Pedic produces several versions of the TEMPUR-breeze°. The PRObreeze has a medium (5) feel and is available in all-foam and hybrid versions. The LUXEbreeze is an all-foam model that comes in soft (3) and firm (7). Both the PRObreeze and the LUXEbreeze are crafted for cooling. The PRObreeze is engineered to stay up to 3 degrees cooler when you first lie down, while the LUXEbreeze is constructed to stay up to 8 degrees cooler. A cool-to-the-touch cover encases the bed.

Free White Glove delivery is standard in the contiguous United States, and it includes new mattress setup and old mattress haul away. The bed also comes with a 90-night sleep trial and a 10-year limited warranty. For many individuals, side sleeping is the most comfortable sleep position. It can carry a wide array of potential benefits, including: When sleeping on a mattress that strikes the right balance of support and contouring, many individuals report less back and joint pain. Side sleeping usually leads to less airway compression and obstruction than back sleeping, so many sleepers snore less when sleeping on their sides. Sleeping on the left side tends to ease heartburn and acid reflux symptoms. This is because the stomach is slightly to the left, and gravity helps keep stomach acid from migrating into the esophagus when you lie on your left side. Sleeping on the left side is also thought to improve circulation by limiting pressure on the blood vessels that return blood to your heart. While side sleeping is usually beneficial for most sleepers, a few potential drawbacks can arise. Sleeping on a mattress without enough contouring could lead to more shoulder pain. This is in part because the mattress could force the shoulder underneath you up towards your neck and out of alignment. Side sleeping without a sufficiently supportive pillow could contribute to neck pain, so most side sleepers should select a pillow with enough loft to keep their neck straight. Sleeping in the fetal position could also lead to neck and back pain. The arm that is positioned under the body may tingle or go numb as a result of the weight of the body compressing it. To maximize the benefits and limit the drawbacks, side sleepers may want to sleep on their left side with a supportive pillow that fills the gap between their neck and the mattress. A mattress with the ideal balance of contouring and support can also help. How to Choose a Tempur-Pedic Mattress for Side Sleepers As noted above, sleeping on your side carries potential benefits and drawbacks that may affect which mattress is the best choice for you. As a side sleeper’s hips and shoulders are usually the widest parts of their body, pressure buildup is common. Side sleepers may also struggle to maintain their spinal alignment, which can put pressure on their lumbar region. Knowing what to look for as you shop for a Tempur-Pedic mattress can help you ensure you select a model that meets your needs and preferences. Regardless of your sleep position, some traits tend to be most important when selecting a mattress. Side sleepers should also take their way of sleeping into account to find the best mattress for them. Mattress companies sometimes use misleading words and phrases, like “universal comfort,” but what is comfortable for others may not be best for side sleepers. When mattress companies claim that their mattress is comfortable for every sleeper, that usually just means that it is a mid-range firmness that can accommodate the needs of most sleepers. However, side sleepers who weigh less than 130 pounds and those that weigh over 230 pounds may rest more comfortably on softer or firmer models respectively. Tempur-Pedic offers a range of mattress models, so there’s something for virtually any side sleeper. Focusing on the following traits may make it easier to select the best option for you. Pressure relief tends to be especially important for side sleepers because their hips and shoulders usually put more pressure on the mattress than the rest of their bodies. With some models, this can lead to aches and pains from sharp pressure points. Mattresses crafted for pressure relief redistribute your weight, taking pressure off your hips and shoulders. However, finding the ideal balance between pressure relief and support also requires selecting the right firmness. Since firmness is directly linked to pressure relief, side sleepers often benefit from basing their firmness selection on their body type. Individuals who weigh less than 130 pounds typically prefer beds around a medium soft (4) or softer. Those who weigh between 130 and 230 pounds usually like a medium (5) to medium firm (6) model. Side sleepers who weigh over 230 may be best served by a medium firm (6) or firm (7-8) mattress. Sleeping on a mattress that is too soft could allow a side sleeper’s hips and shoulders to sink in excessively, putting a strain on their spine. However, a model that is too firm may not let the hips and shoulders sink in enough, which could lead to more pressure buildup. Contouring is how the mattress shapes to your body. Mattresses that contour well let a side sleeper’s hips and shoulder sink in while supporting proper spinal alignment. When a mattress adjusts to the sleeper’s body, it also typically limits pressure buildup by spreading out their weight more evenly. For many shoppers, the price may be a key factor in which mattress they ultimately select. Tempur-Pedic produces luxury mattresses, so they tend to be higher in price than many models. However, buyers shouldn’t look at the price point alone. Due to their quality construction, Tempur-Pedic mattresses may last longer than some lower-priced models, which could make them a better value over the life of the mattress. A mattress’s materials determine its performance and durability. Quality materials usually last better over time, so side sleepers should be able to enjoy contouring and support for years to come. Lower quality materials may be more likely to break down, sag, or retain lasting impressions. As a luxury mattress manufacturer, Tempur-Pedic mattresses are prized for their quality materials. Side sleepers who like to sit or sleep near the perimeter of the bed may prefer a mattress with good edge support. All-foam models typically do not have reinforced edges, so there may be some sinkage around the perimeter. This is especially likely with softer models. Some sleepers may feel insecure when they sit or sleep near the edge, limiting the usable mattress surface. Hybrid and innerspring models generally have superior edge support, so sleepers who need solid edge support will want to consider Tempur-Pedic’s hybrid models. If you tend to sleep hot during the night, you may prefer a mattress with strong temperature regulation. Memory foam has a reputation for retaining heat, but many manufacturers have adjusted their designs to counteract this. While each of Tempur-Pedic’s mattresses uses some cooling technology, the Tempur-Pedic TEMPUR-breeze° has enhanced cooling features that may appeal to hot sleepers. Some mattress models are easier to move around on than others. People with mobility issues and those who toss and turn during the night often prefer models that do not restrict their movement. Due to its close hug and relatively slow response to changes in pressure, memory foam is the material most often associated with low ease of movement scores. However, many models with memory foam still perform well enough in this category, especially if they have a firmer feel. The type of mattress influences its performance, pricing, and durability. Most mattresses on the market today are either foam, latex, hybrid, or innerspring. Depending on the model’s unique construction, any of these options may be appropriate for side sleepers. However, many side sleepers gravitate towards foam, latex, or hybrid models for the conforming and pressure relief of their comfort systems. Tempur-Pedic produces foam and hybrid models. A sleeper’s weight plays a role in how a mattress feels, but this is often particularly true for side sleepers. In general, individuals who weigh between 130 and 230 pounds usually prefer a medium to medium firm model. Those that weigh less tend to like a softer option, while those that weigh more generally favor a firmer feel. If the mattress is too firm for a side sleeper’s weight group, they may not sink in enough to enjoy pressure-relieving contouring. However, if it is too soft for their weight group, their hips and shoulders may dip too deeply into the mattress and put a strain on their lumbar region. Side sleepers should pay attention to how they position themselves to avoid pelvic rotation. Some side sleepers tend to twist their bodies, which can rotate their pelvis and put their spine out of alignment. Sleeping with the legs fully extended usually helps minimize pelvic rotation. Side sleepers may experience shoulder pain for a number of reasons. It can occur as a result of pressure buildup from sleeping on a mattress without enough contouring. Additionally, the shoulder underneath your body may also collapse against the mattress, pushing it up towards your neck and potentially straining the area. Tempur-Pedic is the pioneer of the memory foam mattress. It developed its special TEMPUR material based on foam developed by NASA for spacecraft seats. Since then, Tempur-Pedic has developed several variations on its standard material engineered for pressure relief, motion isolation, and durability. The main product line consists of five models, including the TEMPUR-Cloud, the TEMPUR-Adapt, the TEMPUR-ProAdapt, the TEMPUR-LuxeAdapt, and the TEMPUR-breeze°. Each mattress has slight variations in its materials and design based on its intended firmness and performance, but they tend to use the same basic structure. Tempur-Pedic does not publicly release many specifics about its mattress construction, but customers can typically expect the following. Most Tempur-Pedic mattress covers are breathable to help keep the sleep surface cool. Many models have removable, machine-washable covers for easy cleaning. The comfort layer typically consists of TEMPUR memory foam. Depending on the model and firmness, this may be TEMPUR, TEMPUR-ES, TEMPUR-APR, or TEMPUR-CM+. Underneath the comfort layer, there is generally a second layer of memory foam that adds contouring and helps prevent the sleeper from sinking in against the mattress core. All-foam Tempur-Pedic mattresses have a polyfoam core to support the sleep surface. Hybrid models have coil cores that add bounce, breathability, and edge support. Are Tempur-Pedic Mattresses Suited to Side Sleepers? Tempur-Pedic mattresses are often ideal for side sleepers. The company’s innovative memory foam materials excel in pressure relief. Side sleepers often experience sharp pressure points due to their hips and shoulders putting direct force on the mattress, so pressure relief is frequently a high priority for this group. Our picks are particularly well suited to side sleeping because of their balance between contouring and support. One of these options should be a good fit for most side sleepers, regardless of their body types and sleep styles. However, finding the best Tempur-Pedic mattress for you requires some consideration into these factors. Those who weigh under 130 pounds will likely prefer one of Tempur-Pedic’s softer options. Individuals between 130 and 230 pounds should sleep comfortably on a medium model. People who weigh more than 230 pounds may get the extra support they need from one of Tempur-Pedic’s firm options. Performance varies slightly between models, so shoppers should take their priorities into account when choosing a Tempur-Pedic mattress. Side sleepers prone to overheating during the night may prefer the enhanced cooling of the TEMPUR-breeze°. Those looking for extra bounce or edge support might want to go with one of Tempur-Pedic’s hybrid options. Last Things to Consider with a Tempur-Pedic Mattress for Side Sleepers Before you buy a Tempur-Pedic mattress, you may still have some lingering questions. We’ll answer some of the most common questions you may have to help you make your purchase more confidently. Which Mattress Firmness is Best for Side Sleepers? Tempur-Pedic has several firmness options, each of which may be best for some side sleepers. As a general rule, the best firmness for side sleepers will depend on their weight. Those who weigh less than 130 pounds will experience more contouring on one of Tempur-Pedic’s soft options. People who weigh between 130 and 230 pounds are likely to prefer one of Tempur-Pedic’s medium options. Individuals who weigh over 230 may like a firm Tempur-Pedic so that their hips and shoulders don’t sink in too deeply. In addition to its popular mattresses, Tempur-Pedic also produces other sleep products, like sheets, pillows, toppers, blankets, bases, sleep masks, and slippers. The company also offers other products that include the proprietary TEMPUR material, including stuffed animals and cushions. Queen size Tempur-Pedic mattresses range in price from around $2,000 to over $4,000. Since this is higher than the average cost for a new mattress, some shoppers may find these prices surprising. However, these are luxury models with high-quality materials that should last longer than many mattresses on the market, so a Tempur-Pedic mattress could ultimately cost less per year of use than some lower-priced models. Tempur-Pedic mattresses are typically more durable than many memory foam models on the market. Some mattresses develop lasting sagging or impressions over time, limiting how long side sleepers can enjoy them. However, Tempur-Pedic’s high-quality materials usually resist indentations. While we would typically expect a memory foam mattress to last for 6.5 to 7 years, we would expect most Tempur-Pedic mattresses to last for at least 7 years. Tempur-Pedic mattresses purchased directly through the company come with a 90-night sleep trial and 10-year limited warranty. To be eligible to return the mattress, customers must first try it for at least 30 nights. Customers may incur a $175 shipping fee for returns. The warranty provides for the repair or replacement of mattresses with qualifying defects. The owner is responsible for transportation costs. Additional terms and conditions apply.

Learn more about our process Tempur-Pedic launched in 1992, using material developed based on NASA’s research on a new kind of foam to use in spacecraft seats. The company decided that the material that was designed to cushion and support astronauts during takeoff could also fit the needs of sleepers. This material is now commonly known as memory foam, earning Tempur-Pedic the distinction of popularizing memory foam mattresses. After merging with Sealy in 2012, Tempur-Pedic became part of one of the world’s largest mattress companies. Memory foam’s unique combination of contouring and support can be an ideal match for back sleepers. While the foam shapes to the sleeper’s body to relieve pressure points, it is also supportive to promote better spinal alignment. The Tempur-Pedic line consists of five models, including the TEMPUR-Cloud, the TEMPUR-Adapt, the TEMPUR-ProAdapt, the TEMPUR-LuxeAdapt, and the TEMPUR-breeze°. These models vary slightly in their designs to accommodate sleepers with different sleeping styles, but they all use Tempur-Pedic’s well-known memory foam. We’ll highlight some of our top picks for Tempur-Pedic mattresses that can suit the unique needs of back sleepers. Then, we’ll discuss some special considerations for back sleepers considering a Tempur-Pedic mattress. The Best Tempur-Pedic Mattresses for Back Sleepers  Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, Cal King, Split King, Split Cal King Sleepers who tend to wake up when their sleep partner moves Customers looking for either an all-foam or a hybrid model Cool-to-the-touch cover for extra temperature regulation Use this SleepFoundation.org link for the most current discount on Tempur-Pedic mattresses Back sleepers may appreciate the TEMPUR-Adapt’s balance between softness and support. The TEMPUR-ES comfort layer hugs the body, while a transition layer of original TEMPUR contours more deeply. The TEMPUR-Adapt is available in both all-foam and hybrid designs. The all-foam version has a polyfoam core, and the hybrid version uses coils. Both options excel in motion isolation and pressure relief, but the all-foam version has some of the best motion isolation we’ve seen. The coils in the hybrid version enhance its temperature neutrality, edge support, ease of movement, and bounce. A knit cover encases the TEMPUR-Adapt. It is engineered to feel cool-to-the-touch to help the sleeper maintain a more comfortable temperature. The cover also has an antimicrobial treatment to help reduce allergens. On the standard 10-point firmness scale, the TEMPUR-Adapt rates around 5. This medium feel is likely to be most appropriate for back sleepers who weigh under 130 pounds. Back sleepers who weigh over 130 pounds may notice some sinkage around their hips, especially if they carry extra weight near their midsections. Customers in the contiguous United States can typically enjoy free White Glove delivery with new mattress setup and old mattress removal. A 90-night sleep trial gives customers a chance to try the bed at home, while a 10-year limited warranty covers certain defects. Read our Full Tempur-Pedic TEMPUR-Adapt Review to learn more  Twin, Twin Long, Double, Queen, King, California King Those who have aches and pains from pressure points Use this SleepFoundation.org link for the most current discount on Tempur-Pedic mattresses The TEMPUR-Cloud may be a good option for back sleepers who want to experience Tempur-Pedic’s supportive contouring at a lower price point. This model rates at a 5 (medium) on the 10-point firmness scale, so it may be best suited for back sleepers who weigh under 130 pounds. Since this is on the softer side for back sleepers who weigh more than 130 pounds, their hips may dip too deeply into the bed and put their spines out of alignment. Three layers of foam make up the all-foam TEMPUR-Cloud. A comfort and transition layer of TEMPUR memory foam lets the hips sink in, while a polyfoam core limits sagging near the midsection to support the sleeper’s natural spinal alignment. A stretchy, moisture-wicking cover helps keep the sleeper cool and dry while adjusting to the contouring of the bed’s comfort layer. Like other Tempur-Pedic models, the TEMPUR-Cloud excels in motion isolation and pressure relief, making it a popular choice for couples and those with sharp pressure points. The TEMPUR-Cloud ships free to the customers in the contiguous United States and arrives compressed in a box or canvas bag. It comes with a 90-night trial period and a 10-year limited warranty. Read our Full Tempur-Pedic Cloud Review to learn more  Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, Cal King, Split King, Split Cal King Use this SleepFoundation.org link for the most current discount on Tempur-Pedic mattresses The TEMPUR-LuxeAdapt comes in two firmness options, soft (2-3) and firm (7-8), giving back sleepers an opportunity to select a mattress that better corresponds to their body weight. This may lead to an exceptional balance of contouring and support. TEMPUR-ES, a soft memory foam, makes up the comfort system of the soft version of the mattress. The firm version uses original TEMPUR material. Both firmness options have a transition layer of TEMPUR-APR+, which is engineered for enhanced conforming and notable pressure relief. A polyfoam core serves as the structural base to support the sleep surface and limit how deeply a back sleeper’s hips can sink in. The TEMPUR-LuxeAdapt has a SmartClimate Dual Cover System, which is cool-to-the-touch and treated with an antimicrobial coating. Its inner panel is quite stretchy to move with the bed, while the outer layer can be unzipped and washed in a machine. Both firmness options earn high marks for motion isolation and pressure relief, but the soft version’s motion isolation is next-level. However, the firm version of the mattress tends to perform better for edge support and sex. Back sleepers who weigh over 130 pounds may prefer the supportive feel of the firm version, while those who weigh less than 130 pounds may like either firmness option depending on whether they prefer a plush or sturdy sleep surface. Within the contiguous United States, the TEMPUR-LuxeAdapt generally comes with free White Glove delivery, including old mattress haul-away. Tempur-Pedic also gives customers a 90-night trial window and a 10-year limited warranty. While back sleeping doesn’t enjoy the widespread popularity of side sleeping, around 10% of sleepers swear by it. Back sleepers may notice a wide range of potential benefits, including the following. With a sufficiently supportive and contouring mattress, back sleeping usually supports the spine’s natural alignment, which could lead to fewer aches and pains. Back sleepers are thought to be less likely to develop facial wrinkles as a result of their sleep position. Side sleeping and stomach sleeping put pressure on the face, which could lead to wrinkling. However, sleeping on your back can also have some potential drawbacks: When you fall asleep, your muscles relax. A back sleeper’s tongue may fall to the back of their mouth and their airway may compress, leading to snoring. This can be particularly problematic for those with sleep apnea. However, many back sleepers find relief from snoring by using a wedge pillow or adjustable bed to elevate their upper body. The added weight around a pregnant woman’s midsection can make back sleeping uncomfortable and contribute to lower back pain. Experts advise against this sleep position during pregnancy because it can also restrict blood flow, potentially diminishing the nutrients and oxygen that the fetus receives. Some sleepers experience aches and pains when sleeping on their backs. Neck pain may develop if the pillow is too thin or too thick. Some individuals also suffer from back or hip pain as a result of the sleep position, which can often be resolved by placing a pillow or rolled towel under the knees. Lying on the back without a sufficiently supportive pillow could allow stomach acid to creep up into the esophagus. However, a wedge pillow that elevates the upper body can reduce the risk since gravity helps keep the sleeper’s stomach contents in place. How to Choose a Tempur-Pedic Mattress for Back Sleepers Back sleeping has a unique effect on the body. Understanding the role your sleep position plays can help you select a Tempur-Pedic mattress that maximizes the potential benefits of back sleeping while limiting the potential drawbacks. Back sleepers should pay particular attention to selecting a Tempur-Pedic model that strikes the right balance between contouring and support for their body type. However, other factors may also play a role in your decision. The same criteria that influence most customers’ mattress decisions are also important to consider when buying a Tempur-Pedic mattress for back sleeping. These factors can affect both the comfort and overall value of the mattress. Unfortunately, finding the ideal mattress isn’t always easy. Some brands claim their models are comfortable for all sleep positions, but this usually just means they have a medium to medium-firm feel. Paying attention to the specifics of the model you’re looking at rather than trusting broad claims can help you find your perfect mattress match. A mattress’s firmness level is of critical importance for a back sleeper’s spinal alignment. If the bed is too firm, your hips may not sink in enough to keep your spine straight. If it’s too soft, your hips may sink in too deeply and drag your spine out of alignment. The ideal firmness will depend largely on your body type. Individuals who weigh under 130 pounds typically prefer a softer model because they may not apply enough force to sink into a firmer option. Those who weigh over 230 pounds usually prefer a firmer model because they may not receive enough support from a . Back sleepers who weigh under 130 pounds may find any of Tempur-Pedic’s firmness options comfortable, while those who weigh more than 130 pounds may prefer one of the brand’s firm options for extra spinal support. Tempur-Pedic mattresses are popular in part thanks to their high-quality, technologically advanced materials. Quality materials not only affect the bed’s performance, but they can also enhance its life expectancy. While mattresses that use high-quality materials typically come at a higher cost, this expense may be justified by their performance and durability. Since a back sleeper’s weight is relatively well distributed by the sleep position, they’re unlikely to experience as sharp of pressure points as side sleepers. However, a mattress with good pressure relief may still feel more comfortable for back sleepers. Pressure relief occurs when a mattress spreads out the sleeper’s weight more evenly to reduce pressure from key areas. Back sleepers will likely experience this as a gentle cradling of their hips. The Tempur-Pedic line has exceptional pressure-relieving properties thanks to its proprietary memory foam. Contouring is how a mattress adjusts to the shape of the sleeper’s body. Back sleepers usually benefit from a mattress with enough contouring to let their hips sink in just enough so that their spine is relatively straight. All of Tempur-Pedic’s models are built for conforming and contouring. While price matters, customers should try to avoid basing their purchasing decision solely on this criterion. Price is often reflective of the types of materials used. Since many more expensive mattresses use higher-quality materials, they may last longer, thus saving the customer from having to replace their bed as soon. Tempur-Pedic mattresses usually carry a higher-than-average sticker price, but they also tend to be durable. A stable edge can make it easier to sit or sleep comfortably near the perimeter of the bed, so back sleepers who tend to use the edge extensively may prefer extra edge. Tempur-Pedic’s hybrid models and firm all-foam models tend to have a sturdier feeling edge than its softer all-foam options. Like the softer all-foam models from other brands, some individuals could notice sagging or instability when they attempt to sit or sleep near the perimeter of a Tempur-Pedic mattress on the softer end of the firmness spectrum. is often essential to a comfortable night’s sleep. Back sleepers who tend to overheat during the night frequently prefer a model with stronger temperature control to keep them cool and dry. Several models by Tempur-Pedic have cooling features that may help sleepers maintain a more neutral body temperature. If you sleep on your back all night, ease of movement may not be a priority. However, combination sleepers often prefer a mattress that’s easy to move on so that they can easily change positions. Tempur-Pedic mattresses and other models that use memory foam are often more difficult to move on due to memory foam’s slower response time and close hug. However, the firmer models typically perform better in this category than the softer options. The main mattress types are foam, latex, innerspring, and hybrid, and back sleepers may get the support and contouring they’re looking for from any of these mattress types. Shoppers should know that each mattress type has potential pros and cons, but each model is unique. Tempur-Pedic produces all-foam and hybrid models. While the all-foam models typically isolate motion to a greater extent, the hybrid models usually have more bounce, breathability, and edge support. Since your weight influences how much pressure your body applies to your mattress, it should also play a role in your purchasing decision. The same mattress will likely feel firmer to a lightweight individual than a heavier person. Because of this, back sleepers who weigh less than 130 pounds will typically prefer a softer mattress so that it contours to their bodies, while those who weigh more than 230 pounds will generally favor a firmer model so that their hips don’t sag and put a strain on their spine. Maintaining proper spinal alignment can help prevent strain that can lead to aches and pains. For most back sleepers, the and are the critical areas. The right balance between contouring and support can cradle the hips while supporting them enough to keep the spine well aligned. Similarly, the right pillow loft can support the natural curvature of the neck. A medium- or high-loft pillow is usually best. Back sleeping can aggravate acid reflux symptoms. This relatively flat position allows stomach acid to migrate into the esophagus. While some acid reflux sufferers choose to avoid the position altogether, others use a wedge pillow to prop up their upper body and reduce acid reflux symptoms. Sleeping on the back may make it more likely for the tongue and soft tissues of the mouth and throat to obstruct the airway, contributing to increased snoring and sleep apnea symptoms. People who have sleep apnea but prefer lying on their backs often use a wedge pillow or an adjustable bed to elevate their upper bodies. Tempur-Pedic developed its proprietary memory foam based on materials engineered by NASA for use in spacecraft seats. Today, Tempur-Pedic has several variations on its famous TEMPUR foam in order to produce a wider range of firmness options and performance capabilities. Five main models make up the mattress line: the TEMPUR-Cloud, the TEMPUR-Adapt, the TEMPUR-ProAdapt, the TEMPUR-LuxeAdapt, and the TEMPUR-breeze°. Each model has a unique design and performance to accommodate different needs and preferences, but the models share the same basic construction. Tempur-Pedic does not disclose all the specifics of its construction techniques or materials, but its models seem to include a cover, a comfort layer, a transition layer, and a support core. Tempur-Pedic mattresses typically have breathable covers to allow cooling airflow into the bed. Beyond that, however, the covers vary. Some models have stretchy covers so that they move well with the comfort system, others have covers specially engineered for cooling, and some can be removed and machine washed for easy cleaning. Each mattress model uses a comfort and transition layer of some variation of TEMPUR memory foam. This may include TEMPUR, TEMPUR-ES, TEMPUR-APR, TEMPUR-APR+, and/or TEMPUR-CM+. The comfort layer gives surface-level cushioning and a close hug, while the transition layer contours more deeply and acts as a barrier between the comfort layer and core. Tempur-Pedic’s all-foam models use polyfoam cores, while its hybrid models have coil cores for support. Are Tempur-Pedic Mattresses Suited to Back Sleepers? Tempur-Pedic mattresses combine contouring and support, which are typically the most important traits for back sleepers. Our picks have balanced features that will give many back sleepers the support they need to promote proper spinal alignment while allowing their hips to sink in a bit. While Tempur-Pedic offers models that can accommodate virtually any back sleeper, shoppers should take their unique needs into account when selecting the best option for them. For instance, people who tend to sleep hot might consider a model with more cooling features, those that use the edge of the bed extensively may prefer a hybrid option or a firm all-foam model, and those who prioritize motion isolation might be best served by a softer all-foam model. The sleeper’s weight influences how much contouring and support they’ll experience, so it is another essential factor to consider when making your choice. This may be most important for sleepers who weigh over 230 pounds because their hips could sink in too deeply on one of Tempur-Pedic’s softer options. A firm model may better support their spine. Lightweight individuals might also appreciate the support of a firm mattress, but a softer bed would contour more. Last Things to Consider with a Tempur-Pedic Mattress for Back Sleepers A mattress is a big purchase, so it’s natural to have questions. Below, we’ll go over some of the most common questions shoppers have as they look for a Tempur-Pedic mattress for back sleeping. Which Mattress Firmness is Best for Back Sleepers? The best firmness for back sleepers will vary based on an individual’s weight and personal preferences. Individuals who weigh under 130 pounds usually get the right balance of conforming and support from a medium-soft mattress, those who weigh between 130 and 230 pounds often prefer a medium to medium-firm mattress, and back sleepers who weigh more than 230 pounds typically benefit from the added support of a medium-firm or firm model. A back sleeper’s hips are likely to sink too far into an excessively soft mattress, and this can put a strain on their lumbar region. If the mattress is too firm, the sleeper’s hips may not sink in enough, putting their spine out of alignment. For most back sleepers, the optimal firmness is one that allows the hips to sink in just enough to keep their spines straight. Tempur-Pedic produces a range of sleep products, including bases, pillows, mattress toppers, blankets, sheets, slippers, and sleep masks. Shoppers can also purchase stuffed animals and cushions that use Tempur-Pedic’s popular TEMPUR material. Tempur-Pedic mattresses start around $2,000 for a queen size and go to upwards of $4,000. This is above the average cost of other memory foam mattresses due to the use of high-quality proprietary materials. While their construction increases the ticket price, Tempur-Pedic mattresses often last longer than many memory foam models, which could make them a better value in the long run. Customers can typically expect to enjoy their Tempur-Pedic mattress for 7 years or more. This is longer than the average life expectancy of a memory foam mattress, which is usually around 6.5 to 7 years. Tempur-Pedic’s high-quality materials should resist the sagging and long-term impressions that often form on lower-quality beds. When you purchase a mattress directly through the company, Tempur-Pedic provides a 10-year limited warranty that offers to repair or replace defective mattresses. The owner is responsible for the cost of transportation. Customers can also take advantage of a 90-night sleep trial. Owners must try their new mattress for at least 30 nights. During the eligible window, they can return their mattress, though they may incur a $175 shipping fee. Additional terms and conditions apply.

660281b4-e9fc-4f38-bac3-1a7551c4bf74,"Dry Needling vs. Acupuncture: Which Is Right for You? Medically reviewed by Debra Rose Wilson, Ph.D., MSN, R.N., IBCLC, AHN-BC, CHT — — If you only compared dry needling and acupuncture with a photo, you might be stumped to identify each. Both acupuncture and dry needling use thin, stainless steel needles. For both practices, needles are inserted into the skin and both also claim to treat pain. That’s where the similarities end. Unique qualities help differentiate the two. One practice has been used for thousands of years as an alternative treatment and has some solid research of effectiveness. The other’s been adopted in the last couple of decades. One is designed to relieve pain, discomfort, or issues by opening up a person’s energy flow or chi. The other is designed to stimulate trigger points, or muscles that are irritable. Knowing the differences can help you decide which type of treatment is right for you. Dry needling is a modern treatment designed to ease muscular pain. Its popularity is growing. During dry needling, a practitioner inserts several filiform needles into your skin. Filiform needles are fine, short, stainless steel needles that don’t inject fluid into the body. That’s why the term “dry” is used. Practitioners place the needles in “trigger points” in your muscle or tissue. Dry needling is also sometimes called intramuscular stimulation. The points are areas of knotted or hard muscle. Dry needling practitioners say the needle helps release the knot and relieve any muscle pain or spasms. The needles will remain in your skin for a short period of time. The length of time depends on the practitioner. Some healthcare professionals, such as physical therapists and massage therapists, receive some training in dry needling. Some forms of dry needling use techniques called pistoning or sparrow pecking. Both of these techniques rely on in-and-out needle insertion. In other words, the needles don’t stay inserted in the skin for long. The needles prick the trigger points and are then removed. More research is needed to support this method of dry needling. Some dry needling techniques treat a broader landscape of the central nervous system. This is called non-trigger point treatment. Instead of inserting needles only in the area of pain, the practitioner may instead insert needles in areas around the point of pain instead of directly on it. This technique relies on the idea that pain is the result of a greater nerve or muscular issue, not just focused in the main area of pain. Dry needling is most often performed by physical and sports injury therapists. Currently, dry needling practitioners don’t need extensive training. No regulatory agency controls training, licensure, or supervision for this procedure. Because there’s no credentialing board, there’s also no way to determine if someone’s training is legitimate and satisfactory. If you choose dry needling, find someone with postgraduate healthcare education, such as a physical therapist. Dry needling may provide relief for some muscular pain and stiffness. In addition, easing the trigger points may improve flexibility and increase range of motion. That’s why this method is often used to treat sports injuries, muscle pain, and even fibromyalgia pain. Though it doesn’t currently have guidelines for practice, safe dry needling practices will be standardized as more research becomes available. Research supporting the use of dry needling is limited. Most of the existing research for dry needling supports the practice for relieving mild to moderate pain. In some studies, dry needling provided more relief than a placebo treatment. However, one study showed that dry needling is no more effective than stretching alone to relieve muscle pain. In addition, a 2012 study found that platelet-rich plasma injections provided more relief for than dry needling did. Mild side effects are very common with dry needling but serious side effects are rare. The most common side effects around the injection site include: If nonsterile needles are used, you may be at risk for contracting bloodborne illnesses, infection, and diseases. Be sure your practitioner uses sterile needles and disposes of them after each use. Since dry needling doesn’t have formal training, certifications, or state licensure, there are more concerns about use than with acupuncture. is a form of medical treatment that’s been used for hundreds — even thousands — of years. Acupuncture originated in Asian medical practices. That’s why many licensure and oversight boards use the term “Oriental Medicine” to classify acupuncture. Acupuncture is practiced by tens of thousands of licensed acupuncturists. Expert acupuncturists train for three to four years. The training includes both instruction in the use of needles and instruction in diagnosing conditions. Practitioners have direct supervision from another senior or expert practitioner. In addition to this training, acupuncturists must undergo testing from a national board of examiners and continue to take instructional courses each year to maintain their license. The American Medical Association accepts acupuncture as a medical treatment, and some insurance companies may cover the cost of treatment. The fundamental belief of acupuncture is that illness is the result of blocked or interrupted chi. Chi provides your body with healing energy. Acupuncture seeks to remove these blockages and return your energy flow to a state of balance. Acupuncture is used to treats hundreds of conditions and symptoms, including: Some people use acupuncture to treat addiction and chemical dependency. Acupuncture is used to treat several types of pain. Here’s what the research says. A 2015 review of studies found that acupuncture could provide short-term relief from low back pain. This is true if acupuncture is used alone or with other treatments, such as medications or physical therapy. Pain caused by in the knee is a leading cause of disability among adults. A 2010 review found that acupuncture is an effective treatment for and physical symptoms of osteoarthritis. Acupuncture can significantly reduce , according to one 2015 study. When acupuncture is used with other techniques to ease neck strain and reduce muscle tension, the symptom relief was significant when compared with traditional care. A found that acupuncture was at least as effective at easing symptoms as other treatments, including medication. It also has some benefits over those classic treatments, including longer lasting effects, lower medication use, and fewer serious complications or side effects. Additionally, research suggests that regular acupuncture treatments may help people with a history of migraines prevent future episodes. Researchers are mixed on the use of acupuncture to reduce labor pains during childbirth. Some studies show a statistically significant reduction in pain experience. Others point out that acupuncture’s effectiveness during labor is difficult to measure. Still, acupuncture remains an area of interest for many mothers looking for medication-free options. Acupuncture is sometimes used for the treatment of conditions other than physical pain. Research has yet to establish acupuncture as an effective therapy. When compared with nicotine replacement therapy, acupuncture was less effective. However, though more research is needed, acupuncture shouldn’t be firmly ruled out as a potential therapy for quitting smoking. One study looked at the use of acupuncture and antidepressant medication to ease signs of . It suggests that medication and acupuncture together may be effective. It’s also well tolerated and presents few complications. But a review of studies could not declare acupuncture as a reliable treatment for depression. The author concluded the findings were enough to justify additional research. Overall, the World Health Organization recognizes acupuncture as effective in treating hundreds of diseases and symptoms. If performed by a trained and licensed acupuncturist, side effects and risks are very rare. Occasionally, someone may experience: In addition, some people may develop complications if nonsterile needles are used. Both acupuncture and dry needling are used to treat . In particular, research shows acupuncture and dry needling are particularly useful for the treatment of knee pain caused by the arthritis condition. For the treatment of knee and hip osteoarthritis, non-trigger point dry needling is more effective than traditional dry needling alone. A 2014 review found that dry needling in muscles and tissues around the pain point reduces pain and sensitivity more than needling just in the pain point. This dry needling strategy is more similar to acupuncture in that it treats a larger area of muscles and nerves. Trigger point dry needling focuses entirely on the point of pain. National licensing groups for acupuncture therapists maintain lists of certified and licensed practitioners. To find an acupuncture practitioner, start with these options: National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine Before you confirm your appointment, verify that their license is current. Ask if the practitioner has graduate education. To see if you can pay for the treatment using your health insurance, confirm that your insurance company covers the treatment and that the practitioner is in your network, if needed. Finding a dry needling therapist can be a bit more difficult. If you’re interested in dry needling, start with these resources: If you’re weighing acupuncture or dry needling as a treatment option, the choice may come down to a matter of preference. Acupuncture currently has more definitive research and practitioners are regulated in training and practice. If you prefer a well-established alternative treatment option from a highly-trained therapist, acupuncture may be more beneficial for you. Dry needling is rather new, so research remains limited. Existing research shows very few side effects and potential as a treatment for pain relief. Still, large-scale studies are lacking. Additionally, there isn’t any consistency in training, certification, or licensure at this time. This can lead to unsafe needle practices. However, if you’re willing to try something that’s less established with fewer governing principles but promising results, you may be willing to try dry needling.

Patients likely to have prodromal, or early,  tend to have a higher prevalence of pain, according to a new study. The findings indicate that pain may be a relevant disease marker before the appearance of motor disturbances. The study, “” was presented at the recent 2018 World Congress on Parkinson’s Disease and Related Disorders (IAPRD), held in Lyon, France. Disease-related changes in patients with Parkinson’s can start decades before the onset of and may include pain, among other . Researchers at the Bangur Institute of Neurosciences in India conducted a combined hospital and community-based study to evaluate whether pain could be an early clinical marker of future development of Parkinson’s in people with no motor impairment. The study included a total of 500 individuals (314 men, 186 women) older than 50 from an urban community, who were examined for the prevalence of different types of pain by interviewing patients and relatives, and analyzing medical records.

The likelihood ratio (LR) of prodromal Parkinson’s — according to the research criteria of the — were estimated in these patients divided into two groups: a control group (LR under 80%) and a prodromal, or early, Parkinson’s group (LR above 80%). Presence of pain was assessed in 95 patients with less than two years of disease duration and who were attending a neurology outpatient department (clinical group). Different pain syndromes were classified according to the U.S. system of diagnostic codes (the official system of assigning codes to diagnoses and procedures associated with hospital utilization in the U.S.). Thirty-two of the 500 individuals (6.4%) had a LR consistent with early Parkinson’s. These patients showed a significantly higher prevalence of pain than the controls — 23 (71.8%) vs. 144 (30.76%), respectively. Pain prevalence in the clinical group was 63.15%, which was comparable to the prodromal group, researchers observed. The data also revealed that both the clinical and the prodromal groups had a higher prevalence of cervicalgia (neck pain), shoulder pain, pelvic pain, pain in the thigh joint, backache, and low back pain compared to controls. Individuals in the clinical and prodromal groups also had more frequent — characterized by stiffness and pain in the shoulder joint — (discomfort in the legs and an irresistible urge to move them), and nocturnal leg cramps. “This is an indirect evidence that pain can be an important early clinical marker of [Parkinson’s],” the authors wrote. However, they noted that longitudinal studies are needed to better assess the predictive value of pain in Parkinson’s disease.

9da019be-35ed-4ea6-9de0-e2084a5cd657,"Temporomandibular disorder may increase frequency and severity of chronic migraine In a study, researchers at the University of São Paulo's Ribeirão Preto School of Medicine (FMRP-USP), in Brazil, finds that the more frequent the migraine attacks, the more severe will be the so-called temporomandibular disorder, or TMD. The temporomandibular joint acts like a sliding hinge connecting the jawbone to the skull, therefore the disorder's symptoms includes difficulty chewing and joint tension. ""Our study shows that patients with chronic migraine, meaning attacks occurring on more than 15 days per month, are three times as likely to report more severe symptoms of TMD than patients with episodic migraine,"" said Lidiane Florencio, the first author of the study, which is part of the Thematic Project ""Association study of clinical, functional and neuroimaging in women with migraine"", supported by the São Paulo Research Foundation - FAPESP. Previous studies already indicated that migraine is somehow associated with pain in the chewing muscles. However, this research was the first to consider the frequency of migraine attacks when analyzing its connection with TMD: eighty-four women in their early to mid-thirties were assessed, being that 21 were chronic migraine patients, 32 had episodic migraine, while 32 with no history of migraine were included as controls - the results were published in the Journal of Manipulative and Physiological Therapeutics. Signs and symptoms of TMD were observed in 54% of the control participants without migraine, 80% of participants with episodic migraine, and 100% of those with chronic migraine. For Florencio, central sensitization may explain the association between the frequency of migraine attacks and the severity of TMD. ""The repetition of migraine attacks may increase sensitivity to pain,"" she said. ""Our hypothesis is that migraine acts as a factor that predisposes patients to TMD. On the other hand, TMD can be considered a potential perpetuating factor for migraine because it acts as a constant nociceptive input that contributes to maintaining central sensitization and abnormal pain processes."" Nociceptive pain is caused by a painful stimulus on special nerve endings called nociceptors. Midwife’s research included in new national guidance on harms caused by alcohol in pregnancy Mindfulness-based stress reduction may provide benefit to people with migraine Research suggests St. John's Wort and Echinacea could protect against COVID-19 Migraine and TMD have very similar pathological mechanisms. Migraine affects 15% of the general population, and progression to the chronic form is expected in about 2.5% of migraine sufferers. On the other hand TMD is stress-related as much as it has to do with muscle overload. Patients display joint symptoms - such as joint pain, reduced jaw movement, clicking or popping of the temporomandibular joint - but also develop a muscular condition, including muscle pain and fatigue, and/or radiating face and neck pain. TMD and migraine are comorbidities. However, while people who suffer from migraine are predisposed to have TMD, people with TMD will not necessarily have migraine. ""Migraine patients are more likely to have signs and symptoms of TMD, but the reverse is not true. There are cases of patients with severe TMD who don't present with migraine,"" said Débora Grossi, the lead researcher for the study and principal investigator for the Thematic Project. The researchers believe that TMD may increase the frequency and severity of migraine attacks, even though it does not directly cause migraine. ""We do know migraine isn't caused by TMD,"" Florencio said. ""Migraine is a neurological disease with multifactorial causes, whereas TMD, like cervicalgia - neck pain - and other musculoskeletal disorders, is a series of factors that intensify the sensitivity of migraine sufferers. Having TMD may worsen one's migraine attacks in terms of both severity and frequency."" The journal article concludes that an examination of TMD signs and symptoms should be clinically conducted in . ""Our findings show the association with TMD exists but is less frequent in patients with rare or episodic migraine,"" Grossi said. ""This information alone should change the way clinicians examine patients with migraine. If migraine sufferers tend to have more severe TMD, then health professionals should assess such patients specifically in terms of possible signs and symptoms of TMD.""

f147eec1-fbc2-4fe7-b464-af8741f0bc99,"What is the Difference Between Memory Foam and Latex? What is the Difference Between Memory Foam and Latex? Modern mattresses can be manufactured from a wide variety of materials. The choice of foams used in a mattress can substantially affect the bed’s feel, performance, and cost. Some of the most commonly used materials in quality mattresses are memory foam and latex foam. But what is the difference between memory foam and latex? is a type of polyurethane foam, a synthetic foam material. Its technical term is “viscoelastic polyurethane foam,” although most manufacturers simply refer to it as “memory foam.” The material was first developed by NASA researchers, back in the 1960s. Memory foam is made by taking polyurethane and treating it with certain chemicals to increase its viscosity and density. Unlike normal polyfoam, memory foam reacts to body heat, becoming softer and more conforming. When you lay down on memory foam, the material reacts with your body heat, and slowly adapts to the shape of your body. The result is the “body-hugging,” close-conforming feel that memory foam is famous for. When you get up, the foam material cools and returns to its normal shape. Memory foam is prized for its body-hugging feel. It’s a moderately priced material, so you will find it featured in a wide range of mattresses. The biggest downside to memory foam is that it tends to trap body heat, so those that sleep hot may wish to think twice about a memory foam mattress. Latex is a natural material derived from the sap of rubber trees. The sap is extracted and processed to form a dense foam material. Finished latex foam has a similar consistency to synthetic materials like polyfoam, with some key differences. Latex generally feels bouncier and somewhat less conforming than memory foam. It has a springy, rubber-like consistency, and is usually fairly dense. It’s also quite durable, as latex foams have a longer expected lifespan than materials like polyfoam. Owners of latex mattresses appreciate that latex is naturally derived, highly durable, responsive, and generally more temperature-neutral than memory foam. On the other hand, it’s a fairly expensive material. The are often priced at $1,500 or more, while memory foam beds can be found for a significantly lower price. What is the Difference Between Memory Foam and Latex? There are several distinct differences between these two foam materials in terms of performance. While these are the general trends in performance, not all latex or memory foam is created equally. The overall feel, firmness, support, and durability will be impacted somewhat by the density of the and the , as well as the quality of the material. Memory foam has a deep, body-hugging feel. It slowly adapts to the shape of your body when you first lay down and slowly returns to its original form when you move. A latex mattress will have a much more bouncy, responsive feel to it. It still adapts to the shape of your body, but you will find that contours to your shape less than memory foam. Both mattress styles can be considered very supportive. Both materials do a good job of supporting the body, keeping the spine aligned, and improving comfort for the sleeper. In the long-run, latex typically outperforms memory foam when it comes to properly supporting the sleeper’s body. This is due to its superior durability and responsiveness. While memory foam will eventually start to sag, reducing support, latex generally retains its shape and remains highly supportive throughout the lifespan of the mattress. A mattress that does a good job of providing pressure relief will help alleviate pain in certain problem areas, including the hips, neck, and shoulders. Memory foam does an excellent job of this, as it adapts directly to the shape of the body, cupping and cushioning common problem areas. So long as the mattress is sufficiently supportive, different parts of the body can sink in just as much as they need to without pushing the spine out of alignment, often reducing pain and discomfort for the sleeper. Latex also performs well in this area by contouring to a moderate degree, but most find that memory foam provides the best pressure relief. The body type and weight of each sleeper also influences the performance of each mattress type. Generally speaking, memory foam performs well for sleepers who weigh less than 230 pounds, but it may not be best for those who are heavier. Memory foam’s tendency to allow the body to sink in is generally a good thing, though for heavier sleepers, the foam may have too much give, resulting in a less supportive feel. Latex tends to perform better for heavier sleepers. Memory foam tends to absorb and trap body heat, while latex does a better job of remaining at a neutral temperature. That being said, some manufacturers add extra features or materials to their memory foam to aid in temperature regulation. Cooling gel, open-cell foam, and various other technologies are all utilized to reduce memory foam’s tendency to sleep warm. Motion isolation is a measure of how well a mattress keeps movement on one side of the bed from disturbing the sleeper at the opposite side. In this category, memory foam and latex earn similar ratings. Memory foam has slightly better motion isolation due to its body-hugging feel, but both materials do a very good job of reducing motion transfer. Latex is significantly more expensive than memory foam. The average latex mattress is roughly twice the price of the average memory foam mattress. With that said, latex is notably more durable, so the long-term cost difference is less substantial. Latex is usually more durable than memory foam. On average, a latex mattress has an expected useful lifespan of around 7.5-8.5 years, compared to 6-7 years for a . Likewise, latex mattress warranties often cover the bed for a longer time frame, compared to memory foam. What is the Difference Between Memory Foam and Latex?
