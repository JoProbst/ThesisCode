6004886d-4f24-415b-b07e-0db28e669cf2,"— — Lymph nodes are small, oval-shaped organs that contain immune cells to attack and kill foreign invaders, such as viruses. They’re an important part of the body’s immune system. Lymph nodes are also known as lymph glands. Lymph nodes are found in various parts of the body, including the , , and . They’re linked by lymphatic vessels, which carry lymph throughout the body. Lymph is a clear fluid containing and dead and diseased tissue for disposal. The primary function of lymph nodes is to harbor the body’s disease-fighting cells and to filter lymph before it reenters circulation. When you’re sick and your lymph nodes send out disease-fighting cells and compounds, they may become inflamed or painful. The condition of having inflamed lymph nodes is referred to as lymphadenitis. Lymph node inflammation can occur for a variety of reasons. Any infection or virus, including the , can cause your lymph nodes to . can also cause lymph node inflammation. This includes blood cancer, such as and . What are the symptoms of lymph node inflammation? Lymph node inflammation can cause a variety of symptoms. Symptoms depend on the cause of the swelling and the location of the swollen lymph nodes. Common symptoms accompanying lymph node inflammation include: tender, swollen lymph nodes in the neck, armpits, and groin upper respiratory symptoms, such as a , , or , which could indicate hardening and expansion of the lymph nodes, which could indicate the presence of a tumor A doctor typically diagnoses lymph node inflammation through a . The doctor will feel around the location of various lymph nodes to check for swelling or sensitivity. They may also ask you about any associated symptoms, such as those listed above. Your doctor may order blood tests to check for infections. They may order imaging tests as well, such as or . These can look for tumors or sources of infection. Because a wide range of conditions can cause lymph node inflammation, your doctor may request a biopsy. A is a short procedure in which the doctor removes a sample of lymph tissue. A pathologist will test this sample. This type of doctor examines tissue samples and interprets lab results. A biopsy is often the most reliable way to determine why lymph node inflammation has occurred. Treatment for lymph node inflammation depends on its cause. In some cases, treatment may not be necessary. For example, treatment is unlikely to be recommended for: healthy adults whose bodies are already conquering the infection children, whose active immune systems can result in frequent swelling If treatment is required, it can vary from self-treatment to surgery and other therapies. Your doctor is likely to advise using a fever-reducing , such as (Advil, Motrin), along with a warm compress. Elevating the swollen area can also help relieve inflammation. In other cases, a course of antibiotics may be used to help the body fight the infection that’s causing lymph node swelling. If a lymph node itself becomes infected, an abscess may form. Swelling will usually go down quickly when the abscess is drained. To do this, your doctor will first numb the area. Then they’ll make a small cut that allows the infected pus to escape. The area may be packed with gauze to ensure healing. If your lymph node swelling is due to a cancerous tumor, there are a number of treatment options. These include surgery to remove the tumor, , and .

961f4e06-2a8d-4dea-b324-c9a6aa5c35ab,"If you have radiation or surgery for your head and neck cancer, you will be at risk of developing lymphedema, or swelling, in your face, head, neck or nearby areas. Lymphedema is very common, with up to 75% of patients experiencing symptoms after treatment for their cancer. The lymph system is made up of nodes and vessels that carry a clear fluid, called lymph, through the body.  Lymph is composed of proteins, salts, water, and white blood cells, and its function is to fight infection. The lymph system works with lymph fluid in much the same way that your circulatory system works with blood, by transporting its vital fluid through a network of vessels to the heart. The lymph system also includes lymph nodes, which are small bundles of tissue located along the lymph vessels. Their function is to filter harmful substances from lymph fluid. When the system is damaged by radiation or surgery, lymph fluid cannot flow back to the heart the way that is should.  It collects under the skin, causing swelling. Head and neck cancer patients are particularly vulnerable to lymphedema due to the large number of lymph nodes and vessels in and around the head and neck. In head and neck cancer, lymphedema can be caused by: When lymph nodes and vessels are removed during surgery for cancer, it becomes harder for the body to move lymph fluid out of the area. Radiation can cause scarring and damage to the lymph nodes and vessels, affecting their ability to remove lymph fluid from the area. Depending on its location, a tumor can block or disrupt the flow of lymph fluid out of the area. Lymphedema typically occurs 2 to 6 months after treatment, but it can also occur years after treatment. Because it can be a long-term problem, it is best to get help for lymphedema as soon as possible. Lymphedema in head and neck cancer patients can happen almost anywhere in the face, head or neck. Swelling can be internal, in locations like the mouth, tongue, voice box, or throat. Or, the swelling can be external, occurring in the neck and face. While the location and severity vary from person to person, some symptoms to watch for include: Swelling in any part of the face, head, or neck, especially swelling that feels hard to the touch Pain, stiffness, or decreased range of motion in the neck or shoulders A feeling of tight skin or muscles in the face, head, or neck New aching, tingling, numbness, or other discomfort in the face, head, or neck Difficulty breathing, swallowing, eating, or speaking Any part of the affected area feels hot, looks red, or swells suddenly. This could indicate a blood clot that requires immediate treatment. have a temperature of 100.5°F or higher that isn’t related to an illness. Although some swelling is normal following surgery or radiation, any swelling that lasts longer than 6 weeks following treatment should be looked at by your doctor. He or she will do a physical exam and measure the swelling or use a standardized lymphedema scale to evaluate it. Your doctor will check to be sure there are no other causes of your swelling, such as a blood clot or infection. To make a definitive diagnosis of lymphedema, your doctor may order one of the following tests: This test checks the lymph system’s function. A small amount of radioactive substance will be injected into your body. This substance is absorbed into the lymph system, where a scanner can see its movement as it travels through your body. This imaging test uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, including the lymph system. If you are diagnosed with lymphedema, your doctor may determine its severity using an objective scoring system like the MD Anderson Cancer Center Head and Neck Lymphedema Scale, which uses 5 stages to describe lymphedema: No swelling, but a sense of heaviness in the neck Visible mild swelling without pitting. Reversible Visible mild swelling with pitting. Reversible Firm pitting swelling that is irreversible. No visible tissue changes Irreversible tissue changes with scarring and fibrosis Your doctor may monitor the progression of your lymphedema with standardized face and neck measurements for external swelling, and/or endoscopy to evaluate internal swelling. There are a number of steps you can take to reduce your risk of lymphedema or prevent it from getting worse. Your doctor may refer you to a physical therapist who can help. Management techniques include: Preventing of injury and infection to the head and neck Doing regular exercise and maintaining a healthy weight Using proper body mechanics and sleeping positions Avoiding tight clothing, scarves, and jewelry around the neck If lymphedema does develop, it’s important to get treatment right away. The earlier treatment is started, the more successful it will be. Treatment for lymphedema most likely will consist of complete decongestive therapy (CDT). CDT includes: This treatment uses a series of gentle, circular massage strokes to promote the flow of lymph fluids out of the area. Compression bands or garments can be worn around the chin, face, and head to support the soft tissue and encourage fluids to be reabsorbed by the body. Exercises to strength muscles and increase range of motion in the neck and shoulders will help keep swelling down and reduce pain and stiffness. This includes techniques to reduce your risk of worsening lymphedema and continuing your CDT activities at home. “Lymphedema (PDQ®)–Patient Version.” National Cancer Institute, www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/lymphedema/lymphedema-pdq. “Lymphedema.” American Head & Neck Society, 27 May 2019, www.ahns.info/survivorship_intro/topical_review-lymphedema/.

673f36ee-08e7-4d6f-abf1-c22c24e3c16f,"Lymphedema is the build-up of fluid in soft body tissues when the lymph system is damaged or blocked. The lymph system is a network of lymph vessels, tissues, and organs that carry lymph throughout the body. Lymphedema occurs when lymph is not able to flow through the body the way that it should. Possible signs of lymphedema include swelling of the arms or legs. Cancer and its treatment are risk factors for lymphedema. Tests that examine the lymph system are used to diagnose lymphedema. Lymphedema is the build-up of fluid in soft body tissues when the lymph system is damaged or blocked. occurs when the is damaged or blocked. builds up in and causes swelling. It is a common problem that may be caused by and cancer treatment. Lymphedema usually affects an arm or leg, but it can also affect other parts of the body. Lymphedema can cause long-term physical, , and social problems for patients. The lymph system is a network of lymph vessels, tissues, and organs that carry lymph throughout the body. The parts of the lymph system that play a direct part in lymphedema include the following: : Colorless, watery fluid that travels through the and carries and . are a type of . Lymph vessels: A network of thin tubes that collect lymph from different parts of the body and return it to the bloodstream. : Small, bean-shaped structures that filter lymph and store white blood cells that help fight and disease. Lymph nodes are found along a network of lymph vessels throughout the body. Groups of lymph nodes are found in the neck, underarm, , , , and . The , , , and are also part of the lymph system but do not play a direct part in lymphedema. Lymphedema occurs when lymph is not able to flow through the body the way that it should. When the lymph system is working as it should, lymph flows through the body and is returned to the bloodstream. Fluid and plasma leak out of the (smallest ) and flow around body tissues so the cells can take up and . Some of this fluid goes back into the bloodstream. The rest of the fluid enters the lymph system through tiny lymph vessels. These lymph vessels pick up the lymph and move it toward the heart. The lymph is slowly moved through larger and larger lymph vessels and passes through lymph nodes where waste is filtered from the lymph. The lymph keeps moving through the lymph system and collects near the neck, then flows into one of two large : The right lymph duct collects lymph from the right arm and the right side of the head and chest. The left lymph duct collects lymph from both legs, the left arm, and the left side of the head and chest. These large ducts empty into veins under the , which carry the lymph to the heart, where it is returned to the bloodstream. When part of the lymph system is damaged or blocked, fluid cannot drain from nearby body tissues. Fluid builds up in the tissues and causes swelling. Lymphedema may be either primary or secondary: Primary lymphedema is caused by the development of the lymph system. may occur at birth or later in life. Secondary lymphedema is caused by damage to the lymph system. The lymph system may be damaged or blocked by infection, injury, cancer, removal of lymph nodes, to the affected area, or from or . This summary is about secondary lymphedema in adults that is caused by cancer or cancer treatment. Possible signs of lymphedema include swelling of the arms or legs. Other may cause the same symptoms. A doctor should be consulted if any of the following problems occur: Swelling of an arm or leg, which may include fingers and toes. Thickening of the skin, with or without skin changes such as blisters or . A feeling of tightness when wearing clothing, shoes, bracelets, watches, or rings. Daily activities and the ability to work or enjoy hobbies may be affected by lymphedema. These symptoms may occur very slowly over time or more quickly if there is an infection or injury to the arm or leg. Cancer and its treatment are risk factors for lymphedema. Lymphedema can occur after any cancer or treatment that affects the flow of lymph through the lymph nodes, such as removal of lymph nodes. It may develop within days or many years after treatment. Most lymphedema develops within three years of surgery. for lymphedema include the following: Removal and/or radiation of lymph nodes in the underarm, groin, pelvis, or neck. The risk of lymphedema increases with the number of lymph nodes affected. There is less risk with the removal of only the (the first lymph node in a group of lymph nodes to receive from the ). A tumor that affects or blocks the left lymph duct or lymph nodes or vessels in the neck, chest, underarm, pelvis, or abdomen. Scar tissue in the lymph ducts under the collarbones, caused by surgery or radiation therapy. Lymphedema often occurs in patients who had all or part of their removed and (underarm) lymph nodes removed. Lymphedema in the legs may occur after surgery for , , , or . It may also occur with or . Lymphedema occurs frequently in patients with due to and combined surgery. Tests that examine the lymph system are used to diagnose lymphedema. It is important to make sure there are no other causes of swelling, such as infection or . The following tests and procedures may be used to lymphedema: and history: An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient’s health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken. : A method used to check the lymph system for disease. A very small amount of a substance that flows through the lymph ducts and can be taken up by lymph nodes is into the body. A or probe is used to follow the movement of this substance. Lymphoscintigraphy is used to find the sentinel lymph node (the first node to receive lymph from a tumor) or to certain diseases or , such as lymphedema. (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, , and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI). The swollen arm or leg is usually measured and compared to the other arm or leg. Measurements are taken over time to see how well treatment is working. A grading system is also used to diagnose and describe lymphedema. Grades 1, 2, 3, and 4 are based on size of the affected limb and how severe the signs and symptoms are. Stage I: The limb (arm or leg) is swollen and feels heavy. Pressing on the swollen area leaves a pit (dent). This stage of lymphedema may go away without treatment. Stage II: The limb is swollen and feels spongy. A condition called tissue may develop and cause the limb to feel hard. Pressing on the swollen area does not leave a pit. Stage III: This is the most advanced stage. The swollen limb may be very large. rarely occurs in breast cancer patients. Stage III is also called lymphostatic elephantiasis. Patients can take steps to prevent lymphedema or keep it from getting worse. Preventive steps include the following: Tell your health care provider right away if you notice symptoms of lymphedema. Keep skin and nails clean and cared for, to prevent infection. Avoid blocking the flow of fluids through the body. Studies have shown that carefully controlled exercise is safe for patients with lymphedema. Patients can take steps to prevent lymphedema or keep it from getting worse. Taking steps may keep from developing. can teach patients how to prevent and take care of lymphedema at home. If lymphedema has developed, these steps may keep it from getting worse. Tell your health care provider right away if you notice symptoms of lymphedema. See the section for that may be caused by lymphedema. Tell your doctor right away if you have any of these symptoms. The chance of improving the is better if treatment begins early. Untreated lymphedema can lead to problems that cannot be reversed. Keep skin and nails clean and cared for, to prevent infection. can enter the body through a cut, scratch, insect bite, or other skin injury. that is trapped in body by lymphedema makes it easy for bacteria to grow and cause . Look for signs of infection, such as redness, pain, swelling, heat, , or red streaks below the surface of the skin. Call your doctor right away if any of these signs appear. Careful skin and nail care helps prevent infection: Treat small cuts or breaks in the skin with an . Avoid needle sticks of any type into the limb (arm or leg) with lymphedema. This includes shots or tests. Avoid testing bath or cooking water using the limb with lymphedema. There may be less feeling (touch, temperature, pain) in the affected arm or leg, and skin might burn in water that is too hot. Cut toenails straight across. See a (foot doctor) as needed to prevent ingrown nails and infections. Avoid blocking the flow of fluids through the body. It is important to keep body fluids moving, especially through an affected limb or in areas where lymphedema may develop. Change sitting position at least every 30 minutes. Wear only loose jewelry and clothes without tight bands or elastic. Do not carry handbags on the arm with lymphedema. Do not use a cuff on the arm with lymphedema. Do not use elastic bandages or stockings with tight bands. Keep the limb with lymphedema raised higher than the heart when possible. Do not swing the limb quickly in circles or let the limb hang down. This makes blood and fluid collect in the lower part of the arm or leg. Studies have shown that carefully controlled exercise is safe for patients with lymphedema. Exercise does not increase the chance that lymphedema will develop in patients who are at risk for lymphedema. In the past, these patients were advised to avoid exercising the affected limb. Studies have now shown that slow, carefully controlled exercise is safe and may even help keep lymphedema from developing. Studies have also shown that, in , upper-body exercise does not increase the risk that lymphedema will develop. (See the section under for more information.) The goal of treatment is to control the swelling and other problems caused by lymphedema. Treatment of lymphedema may include the following: When lymphedema is severe and does not get better with treatment, other problems may be the cause. The goal of treatment is to control the swelling and other problems caused by lymphedema. Damage to the cannot be repaired. Treatment is given to control the swelling caused by and keep other problems from developing or getting worse. Physical (non-) are the . Treatment may be a combination of several of the physical methods. The goal of these treatments is to help patients continue with , to decrease pain, and to improve the ability to move and use the limb (arm or leg) with lymphedema. Drugs are not usually used for long-term treatment of lymphedema. Treatment of lymphedema may include the following: are made of fabric that puts a controlled amount of pressure on different parts of the arm or leg to help move and keep it from building up. Some patients may need to have these garments custom-made for a correct fit. Wearing a pressure garment during exercise may help prevent more swelling in an affected limb. It is important to use pressure garments during air travel, because lymphedema can become worse at high altitudes. Pressure garments are also called compression sleeves and lymphedema sleeves or stockings. Both light exercise and (physical activity that causes the heart and to work harder) help the move out of the affected limb and decrease swelling. Talk with a certified lymphedema therapist before beginning exercise. Patients who have lymphedema or who are at risk for lymphedema should talk with a certified lymphedema therapist before beginning an exercise routine. (See the Web site for a list of certified lymphedema therapists in the United States.) Wear a pressure garment if lymphedema has developed. Patients who have lymphedema should wear a well-fitting pressure garment during all exercise that uses the affected limb or body part. When it is not known for sure if a woman has lymphedema, upper-body exercise without a garment may be more helpful than no exercise at all. Patients who do not have lymphedema do not need to wear a pressure garment during exercise. Breast cancer survivors should begin with light upper-body exercise and increase it slowly. Some studies with show that upper-body exercise is safe in women who have lymphedema or who are at risk for lymphedema. Weight-lifting that is slowly increased may keep lymphedema from getting worse. Exercise should start at a very low level, increase slowly over time, and be overseen by the lymphedema therapist. If exercise is stopped for a week or longer, it should be started again at a low level and increased slowly. If (such as swelling or heaviness in the limb) change or increase for a week or longer, talk with the lymphedema therapist. It is likely that exercising at a low level and slowly increasing it again over time is better for the affected limb than stopping the exercise completely. More studies are needed to find out if weight-lifting is safe for cancer survivors with lymphedema in the legs. Once the lymph fluid is moved out of a swollen limb, (wrapping) can help prevent the area from refilling with fluid. Bandages also increase the ability of the lymph vessels to move lymph along. Lymphedema that has not improved with other treatments is sometimes helped with bandaging. The goal of skin care is to prevent infection and to keep skin from drying and cracking. See skin care tips, in the section. Combined is a program of massage, bandaging, exercises, and skin care managed by a trained therapist. At the beginning of the program, the therapist gives many treatments over a short time to decrease most of the swelling in the limb with lymphedema. Then the patient continues the program at home to keep the swelling down. Combined therapy is also called complex decongestive therapy. Compression devices are connected to a sleeve that wraps around the arm or leg and applies pressure on and off. The sleeve is inflated and deflated on a timed cycle. This pumping action may help move fluid through lymph vessels and veins and keep fluid from building up in the arm or leg. Compression devices may be helpful when added to combined therapy. The use of these devices should be supervised by a trained professional because too much pressure can damage lymph vessels near the surface of the skin.

It can happen if lymph nodes or lymph vessels are removed or damaged. Surgery and radiation to treat cancer can cause this damage. The lymph fluid may collect and cause swelling in the treated parts of the body. Lymphedema can happen months or even years after cancer treatment. It’s an ongoing (chronic) condition that has no cure. But you can do things to help reduce your risk for lymphedema. And there are ways to reduce or ease symptoms if it happens. If left untreated, lymphedema can get worse. It can lead to other problems, such as infections.  Talk with your healthcare provider about your risk for lymphedema and what you can do to help keep it from starting or getting worse. The lymphatic system is a network of tiny vessels and small organs called lymph nodes. The system carries lymph around the body. Lymph is a clear fluid that contains a few blood cells. The lymphatic system is part of your immune system. It helps protect and maintain the health of your body by filtering and draining lymph and cell waste products away from each body region. The lymphatic system also helps the body fight infection.  During treatment for cancer, lymph nodes and the vessels around them that are near the cancer are often removed by surgery. Or they may be treated with radiation. This scars and damages them. Radiation is done because it’s common for cancer to spread to nearby lymph nodes. When lymph nodes are gone or don’t work, it disrupts the normal flow of lymph fluid. This can lead to swelling. So instead of lymph draining into your body as it should, the fluid builds up in the fatty tissues under the skin. This causes the swelling. This swelling is lymphedema. The changes in the flow of lymph keep the lymph from being filtered the way it should. This can increase the risk of infections. It can also interfere with wound healing in the affected areas. Lymphedema can affect 1 or both arms or legs, the face, the groin, the head and neck, or the belly (abdomen). It depends on which part of the body was treated for cancer. Swelling can get worse over time and cause problems. You can get sores or other skin problems. Affected areas are more likely to become infected.  After cancer treatment that removes or damages lymph nodes, you are at risk for lymphedema for the rest of your life.  Lymphedema is a higher risk after breast cancer treatment. During treatment, some or all of the lymph nodes under the arm may be removed or treated with radiation. These lymph nodes are called the axillary lymph nodes. They drain the lymphatic vessels from the arms, hands, and most of the breast, chest, neck, and underarm area.  A mild type of lymphedema can occur within a few days after breast surgery. It usually lasts a short time. Lymphedema can also occur about 4 to 6 weeks after surgery or radiation and then go away over time. The most common type of lymphedema is painless. It may slowly develop 18 to 24 months or more after surgery. It does not get better without treatment. Once lymphedema starts, there is no way to cure it.  Lymphedema can occur in an arm, leg, groin, chest, head, neck, or armpit area. Symptoms can include: Trouble bending or moving a joint in your fingers, wrist, elbow, shoulder, or ankle If you have any of these symptoms, contact your healthcare provider right away. Something else may be causing these changes and you may need treatment. If the cause is lymphedema, treatment needs to be started right away to keep it from getting worse. Not all experts agree on what might help reduce risk. But one of the most important things you can do is watch for signs of lymphedema. Compare the sides of your body. Watch for changes. If you notice any changes, let your provider know right away. The sooner any swelling is treated, the better the chances of reducing it and keeping it from getting worse. If you are at risk for lymphedema but do not have it, the tips below may help reduce your risk. You are at risk for lymphedema for the rest of your life. So make these tips part of your regular habits: See your healthcare provider on a regular basis for checkups. Ask about your risk for lymphedema. You also may want to ask about seeing a lymphedema specialist to learn more about what you can do to try to reduce risk of lymphedema. Wash, treat, and cover any skin wounds, even a small cut, scratch, or burn. Keep your skin clean. And use lotion to keep it moist. Check your skin often. Prevent injury to the at-risk area. If you travel, include a small first aid kit. Watch for signs of infection such as rash, redness, pain, hot to touch, swelling, fever, or itching. Get treatment right away at the first sign of infection. Ask your healthcare team about the type of exercise that’s best for you. A lymphedema specialist can help you learn safe exercises. Talk with your provider about what’s a healthy weight for you. Ask them for help with how to get to or stay at that weight. Being obese (BMI 30 or higher) or overweight (BMI 25 to 29) and gaining weight after treatment are linked to a higher chance of lymphedema. Ask your healthcare team about your personal risk factors for lymphedema and any extra care you may need to take. No medicines are available to treat lymphedema. Instead, the most common treatment is complete decongestive therapy (CDT). This is a set of methods used together to help reduce your symptoms. CDT is done by certified, trained therapists. Your arms or legs may be measured before and after CDT to see how well the treatment is working.  Lymphedema treatment most often includes 1 or more of these: This is a kind of massage. It uses gentle pressure to help move lymph out of areas where it is collecting. This uses a device to apply and ease pressure to the arms or legs. Sleeves are put over the arms or legs. A pump fills the sleeves with air in a messaging motion. Then the air is let out. This happens over and over again for a set amount of time. Stretchy, padded fabric wrapping may be put on the part of the body with lymphedema. This wrap may include bandages, tape, or other types of compression garments. They help support your tissues so lymph can flow more freely. They help prevent fluid lymph from building up and squeeze fluid out of the area. These are worn as often as needed, for life. These include sleeves, gloves, stockings, undershirt, or other types of special clothes. They compress or gently squeeze parts of the body to help prevent lymph buildup. You may wear these during the day, or at night when you are asleep. Some kinds of exercise may help your symptoms. These may include aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking. And they may also include gradual weightlifting exercises that build muscle. Good care of your skin and nails will help prevent infection (see below).  If you have lymphedema, you will need to make sure the swollen area stays healthy and prevent infection. Lymphedema can’t be cured. But it can be managed. Any swelling should be checked by a healthcare provider right away. Here are some things you can do: Small injuries such as a cut, burn, or insect bite in the area with lymphedema are more likely to cause swelling and skin infection. Take special care to prevent injury. Prevent burns by wearing sunscreen and using gloves when cooking or doing housework. Use an insect repellent to prevent bug bites when outdoors. Moisturize dry skin. Wear protective gloves when doing outdoor chores such as gardening or lawn work. Check your skin regularly for cuts, sores, bug bites, or other problems. Take care of any wounds right away. Clean them, put on antibiotic cream, and keep the area covered as it heals. If you have any signs of infection, like redness or fluid leaking, call your healthcare provider. Hot and cold temperatures can cause the skin to swell and dry out. It can also cause fluid to build up. Be careful around hot objects to prevent burns. Don’t use hot tubs, saunas, or a heating pad. Cold can also damage skin. Don’t use ice packs. Protect your skin with warm clothing in the winter. This can make symptoms worse. Tell your healthcare providers about your lymphedema before getting shots, having blood drawn, having an IV put in, or having your blood pressure taken. If at all possible, these should not be done in an affected arm.  Don’t wear tight sleeves, cuffs, wristwatches, or jewelry. Don't pick at or cut the skin around your fingernails. Trim your fingernails straight across to prevent ingrown nails. Don’t cross your legs when you sit. This can block lymph drainage. Don’t walk around without shoes. This is to help keep you from injuring your feet. Wear shoes that fit well and don’t cause blisters. Trim your toenails straight across to prevent ingrown nails.  Get regular checkups and tell your healthcare team about any changes right away. See a trained lymphedema therapist to learn more about lymphedema and to get help managing it. Call your healthcare provider if you have any of these: Rash, blisters, or other skin changes in the affected area Skin that becomes red, painful, or warm to the touch A wound in the area that increases in pain, is warm, drains fluid, or has red streaks Fever of 100.4°F (38°C) or higher, or as directed by your healthcare provider",101,heavy flares swelling lymph nodes,-4.240311145782471,5

Swollen are enlargements of the small organs known as lymph nodes that are important for filtering lymph fluid and forming white blood cells to fight infection. Swollen lymph nodes can occur in one area or region of the body, or they may be found throughout the body, depending upon the cause. Lymph nodes are the organs that can trap cells that have spread into the lymphatic vessels. Lymph nodes are sometimes referred to by lay persons as lymph glands, and swollen lymph nodes may be called “swollen glands.” Infection is the main cause of swollen lymph nodes. Spread of to lymph nodes is a less common cause of lymph node swelling. The neck, groin, and armpits are areas where swollen lymph nodes may be apparent. Associated symptoms are dependent upon the cause of the swollen lymph nodes. Common associated symptoms include and chills in the case of infection, and symptoms specific to the type in the case of . If the lymph nodes are enlarged and inflamed (known as lymphadenitis), the nodes may be painful or tender to the touch. Medical Author: Bowel regularity means a bowel movement every day.

Types of conditions that involve swollen lymph nodes include: Symptoms of swollen lymph nodes depend upon the location. Treatment of swollen lymph nodes also depends upon the location and reason for the enlargement. Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer in women. Symptoms and signs of breast cancer include breast lumps, nipple discharge or inversion, or changes in the breast's skin. Treatment typically involves some type of surgery and depends upon the staging of the cancer, the tumor type, and the person's health. Cancer of the mouth and throat may look like an ulcer or a sore on the tongue, lips, inside lining of the cheeks, and other structures. Tobacco use, sun exposure, and human papillomavirus (HPV) are just some risk factors for mouth and throat cancer. Treatment may include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, and targeted therapy. The prognosis of mouth and throat cancer depends on many factors. Cellulitis is a bacterial infection of the skin and soft tissues that causes swelling, redness, tenderness and warmth. Treatment will involve antibiotics. Severe infection may require IV or intramuscular antibiotic injections. The cold is the most commonly occurring illness in the entire world, with more than 1 billion colds per year reported in the United States alone. Symptoms and signs include fever, cough, sore throat, headache, sneezing, and runny nose. Treatment involves drinking plenty of fluids and taking cough, fever, and pain medications. A cough is a symptom of an underlying disease or condition. A chronic or persistent cough may signal certain lung conditions that should be evaluated by a healthcare professional. Common causes of coughs include infection, allergies, lung disease, medications, and GERD (reflux). Acute coughs are categorized as infectious or non-infectious. Chronic cough (persistent cough) have a variety of causes and should be evaluated by physician. Treatment of cough, acute cough, chronic or persistent cough depends on the cause of the cough. HIV has killed about 25 million individuals, and approximately 40 million people are currently living with the disease. Symptoms and signs of HIV include fever, headache, tiredness, and enlarged lymph nodes. Infections that happen with AIDS are called opportunistic infections. There is no cure for HIV/AIDS. Treatment usually involves a combination of at least three drugs to suppress the virus from replicating and boost the immune system. Infectious mononucleosis is an infection most frequently caused by the Epstein-Barr virus. Symptoms include fever, sore throat, and swollen lymph glands. Treatment incorporates plenty of rest, fluids, and taking over-the-counter medications. It is recommended to avoid strenuous exercise for at least one month after the onset of symptoms to avoid rupturing the spleen. Rheumatoid arthritis, often called RA, is a chronic (long-standing) disease that damages and eventually destroys the joints of the body. Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA), or juvenile arthritis, is not a single disease but a group of diseases. Symptoms and signs include fever and joint pain, swelling, and stiffness. Treatment focuses on relieving pain, improving function, and preventing joint damage. Lymphoma is cancer of the lymphatic system. Symptoms include fevers, chills, itching, enlarged spleen, and swollen lymph nodes. Treatment depends upon the type and stage of the lymphoma, in addition to the age and overall health of the individual. Measles, also known as rubeola, is a viral respiratory infection. Measles and German Measles (a different but similar virus also known as rubella) are serious infections that cause fever and rash. Most recover without incident, but measles infections can lead to pneumonia and brain inflammation. Vaccines have reduced measles infections to a few dozen a year in the U.S., but no cure exists. Patients should treat symptoms with pain relievers, fever reducers, and fluids. Plague is a term applied to an infectious disease that spreads easily and, without antibiotics treatment, can be fatal. Plague symptoms and signs include fever, sore throat, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, buboes, and blackened tissue. Once the patient is isolated, antibiotics are administered. Prostate cancer often has no symptoms. Screening includes a digital rectal examination, PSA, and urinalysis. Treatment depends upon age, the patient's medical condition, and whether the tumor has metastasized. Risk factors for prostate cancer include advanced age, race, family history, infection with STDs, high-fat diet, and chemical exposure. The kidneys, which filter excess water and waste from the blood, are susceptible to a number of different types of cancer, including renal cell cancer. This renal carcinoma develops in the small tubes in the kidneys' filtering system. Renal cell cancer may have a variety of environmental or hereditary causes, including smoking, obesity, occupational hazards and others. Renal cell cancer does not typically present symptoms early on, but symptoms include pain, blood in the urine, fatigue, malaise, night sweats, fevers and others. A sentinal node biopsy is the surgical removal of one to five lymph nodes closest to a cancerous tumor -- usually breast or skin cancer (melanoma) -- in order to figure out the stage of the cancer, that is, how advanced the cancer is. An abscess is has several causes and can appear on many parts of the body, such as the dental, vaginal, and rectal areas. In general, home remedies or cures are not recommended as a treatment method for abscesses (or boils) because they can cause further injury. Skin cancer, the most common cancer, happens when skin cells start growing out of control, usually as a result of too much ultraviolet light exposure from the sun or tanning booths. Of the three types of skin cancer -- basal cell carcinoma (BCC), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and melanoma -- melanoma is the deadliest. Surgery is the most common treatment for skin cancer. Syphilis is a contagious bacterial infection transmitted most often through sexual intercourse. Flulike symptoms, body rash, and swollen lymph nodes. Late-phase syphilis attacks the heart, brain, skin, and bones. Late-stage syphilis is rare since the discovery of the antibiotic penicillin, which is used to treat this sexually transmitted disease (STD). Testicular cancer is a cancer of the male sex organs essential for producing testosterone, libido and other crucial functions. Cancer is usually in only one testicle, the tumor is malignant if it begins to subsume the healthy tissue. Malignant testicular tumors can metastasize to other organs. Testicular cancer is a rare cancer with a high cure rate. Find out more about thyroid cancer's symptoms, signs, diagnosis, treatment, and risk factors.

Common areas where you might notice swollen lymph nodes include your neck, under your chin, in your armpits and in your groin. One of the most common places to find swollen lymph nodes is in the neck. The inset shows three swollen lymph nodes below the lower jaw. Swollen lymph nodes usually occur as a result of infection from bacteria or viruses. Rarely, swollen lymph nodes are caused by cancer. Your lymph nodes, also called lymph glands, play a vital role in your body's ability to fight off infections. They function as filters, trapping viruses, bacteria and other causes of illnesses before they can infect other parts of your body. Common areas where you might notice swollen lymph nodes include your neck, under your chin, in your armpits and in your groin. In some cases, the passage of time and warm compresses may be all you need to treat swollen lymph nodes. If an infection causes swollen lymph nodes, treatment depends on the cause. Newsletter: Mayo Clinic Health Letter — Digital Edition Your lymphatic system is a network of organs, vessels and lymph nodes situated throughout your body. Many lymph nodes are located in your head and neck region. Lymph nodes that frequently swell are in this area, as well as in your armpits and groin area. Swollen lymph nodes are a sign that something is wrong somewhere in your body. When your lymph nodes first swell, you might notice: Swelling that may be the size of a pea or kidney bean, or even larger in the lymph nodes Depending on the cause of your swollen lymph nodes, other signs and symptoms you might have include: Runny nose, sore throat, fever and other indications of an upper respiratory infection General swelling of lymph nodes throughout your body. When this occurs, it may indicate an infection, such as or mononucleosis, or an immune system disorder, such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis Hard, fixed, rapidly growing nodes, indicating a possible cancer or lymphoma Some swollen lymph nodes return to normal when the underlying condition, such as a minor infection, gets better. See your doctor if you're concerned or if your swollen lymph nodes: Continue to enlarge or have been present for two to four weeks Feel hard or rubbery, or don't move when you push on them Are accompanied by persistent fever, night sweats or unexplained weight loss if you're having difficulty swallowing or breathing. Lymph nodes are small, round or bean-shaped clusters of cells. Inside lymph nodes are a combination of different types of immune system cells. These specialized cells filter your lymphatic fluid as it travels through your body and protect you by destroying invaders. Lymph nodes are located in groups, and each group drains a specific area of your body. You may be more likely to notice swelling in certain areas, such as in the lymph nodes in your neck, under your chin, in your armpits and in your groin. The site of the swollen lymph nodes may help identify the underlying cause. The most common cause of swollen lymph nodes is an infection, particularly a viral infection, such as the common cold. Other possible causes of swollen lymph nodes include: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) — the virus that causes AIDS Certain sexually transmitted infections, such as syphilis Toxoplasmosis — a parasitic infection resulting from contact with the feces of an infected cat or eating undercooked meat Cat scratch fever — a bacterial infection from a cat scratch or bite Lupus — a chronic inflammatory disease that targets your joints, skin, kidneys, blood cells, heart and lungs Rheumatoid arthritis — a chronic inflammatory disease targeting the tissue that lines your joints (synovium) Lymphoma — cancer that originates in your lymphatic system Leukemia — cancer of your body's blood-forming tissue, including your bone marrow and lymphatic system Other cancers that have spread (metastasized) to lymph nodes Other possible but rare causes include certain medications, such as the anti-seizure medication phenytoin (Dilantin) and preventive medications for malaria. If infection is the cause of your swollen lymph nodes and isn't treated, an abscess may form. Abscesses are localized collections of pus caused by infections. Pus contains fluid, white blood cells, dead tissue, and bacteria or other invaders. An abscess may require drainage and antibiotic treatment. Fletcher RH.

Swollen lymph nodes in the lung or chest area do not always mean cancer. Although some cancers may result in swollen lymph nodes, they may also signal infection, injury, illness or a tumor, states WebMD. Lymph nodes are small glands located throughout the body, which assist the immune system by carrying fluids, waste and nutrients from the body tissues into the bloodstream, states WebMD. Lymph nodes can become swollen in a part of the body where there is an illness or an infection because the lymph nodes are working with the immune system to remove the unwanted cells, according to the American Cancer Society. Supraclavicular lymph nodes are the glands located above the collarbone area. Swelling of these glands may indicate an infection or tumor in the areas of the neck, lungs, breasts or abdomen, according to WebMD. Swelling of lymph nodes may also be generalized, meaning there is swelling in several areas at the same time. This can be caused by illnesses such as chicken pox, strep throat, or an immune system disorder, states the American Cancer Society. Generalized swelling of lymph nodes may also be the result of certain medications or cancer. Treatment for swollen lymph nodes concentrates on determining and treating the cause, explains WebMD.

Universal Images Group/Universal Images Group/Getty Images The causes of swollen, painful lymph nodes in the neck or other areas of the body are usually infection, vaccines or medications, sexually transmitted disease, immune system disorders and cancer, according to WebMD. When an individual is sick, the lymph nodes often swell, and this causes pain. Common infections that cause swollen, painful lymph nodes include measles, ear infections, mononucleosis, strep throat and an infected tooth, according to Mayo Clinic. Additional common causes are HIV and skin or wound infections. Immune system disorders, cancer, tuberculosis, sexually transmitted disease and various rare infections are other possible causes. An individual with painful lymph nodes should see a doctor if the lymph nodes continue to grow, have appeared without a clear reason, have been present for two weeks or more, feel hard or rubbery, or are unmovable when gently pushed on, according to Mayo Clinic. An individual should also see a doctor if the painful lymph nodes are accompanied by persistent fever, difficulty swallowing or breathing, night sweats, unexplained weight loss or a sore throat. Lymph nodes that are swollen, painful, soft and easily moved are generally caused by infection or inflammation, according to WebMD. Swollen lymph nodes that are hard, unmovable and non-painful should be looked at by a health care professional. What Does George Soros' Open Society Foundations Network Fund?

48ddb472-46e9-4b9b-b294-28a79532ca88,"Lymphedema Risk in Breast Ca Linked to NAC Duration — Study identifies specific number of days associated with an increase in arm volume of 20% or more by In women with node-positive breast cancer, secondary lymphedema was associated with the duration of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), the extent of axillary dissection, and obesity, researchers found. Analysis of data after NAC and before surgical intervention in a cohort of 486 women with cT0-T4N1-2M0 breast cancer with axillary nodal metastasis at diagnosis showed that NAC for at least 144 days (hazard ratio [HR] 1.79) was associated with an arm volume increase of 20% (V20) or more, reported Jane M. Armer, PhD, RN, of the Ellis Fischel Cancer Center, Sinclair School of Nursing, at the University of Missouri in Columbia, and colleagues. Each additional day of NAC was associated with increased risk of lymphedema. ""This is particularly pertinent information to be further explored in future studies, as many of the current protocols involve neoadjuvant chemotherapy,"" Armer told The analysis, published online in also demonstrated that a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or greater was associated with symptoms of secondary lymphedema (HR 1.56, 95% CI 1.12-2.17), including patient-reported arm heaviness or swelling. Risk of lymphedema increased 4% with each point of increase in BMI. With a median follow-up of 2.2 to 3.0 years, an arm volume increase of at least 10% (V10) was highest in patients who underwent removal of 30 or more nodes (HR 1.70), and increased with the number of positive nodes removed (HR 1.03 per node). ""In addition to recommended general surveillance for breast cancer survivors at risk for lymphedema, clinicians have an opportunity to initiate individualized surveillance programs for patients with longer neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens and higher body mass index to allow early detection and intervention for lymphedema,"" Armer said. The analysis is a substudy of the women with lymphedema enrolled in the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology . It is also part of the ongoing Alliance A011202 , which is evaluating the need for axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in patients with a positive sentinel lymph node (SLN) after NAC. Outcomes will be compared with those of ALND with axillary radiotherapy. The researchers noted that despite changes to in favor of SLN surgery, recent data demonstrate that up to 30% of breast cancer survivors still develop lymphedema. In the current substudy, all women with lymphedema underwent axillary dissection, 87% received postoperative radiotherapy, and 46% had a BMI of 30 or more. Mean patient age was 50, and data analysis took place from January to November 2018. Lymphedema symptoms were defined as patient-reported arm heaviness or swelling or an arm volume increase of V10 or V20. At 3 years, the use of volumetric measurements or a validated questionnaire confirmed that the cumulative incidence for symptoms of lymphedema was 37.8%. A total of 58.4% of patients had V10 and 36.9% had V20. Adjuvant radiotherapy, which was administered to 416 patients (87.0%), was not associated with the incidence of lymphedema, the analysis showed, although this result may be limited by the small number of patients who did not receive radiotherapy, Armer and co-authors said. In addition, lymphedema was not associated with the type of chemotherapy regimen, whether it contained anthracyclines or taxanes or both. Neither was an association observed between lymphedema risk and type of surgery -- either lumpectomy or mastectomy -- or with patient age. The investigators noted that earlier evidence linking obesity to lymphedema risk in breast cancer survivors included a prospective showing a 40-60% increased risk with a BMI of 25 or more compared with 18.5 to 24.9. Timely referral of overweight/obese breast cancer patients to an oncology dietitian and to programs that increase exercise could reduce lymphedema risk, the team emphasized. Improvements to self care and overall health could also reduce the risk of breast cancer recurrence and improve the quality of life in patients with co-morbidities such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. ""The prevention of lymphedema is not only the responsibility of the surgeon and the radiation therapist but also the patient and the medical oncologist,"" Armer, et al. wrote. Writing in an accompanying , titled ""Lymphedema After Breast Cancer Treatment -- Not Just the Surgeon's Fault,"" John T. Vetto, MD, of Oregon Health and Science University in Portland, OR, agreed, writing that from the 1920s to the 1970s, surgeons ""appropriately"" took the blame for in breast cancer patients. With the current use of multimodal therapy, however, ""lymphedema can be blamed on everyone,"" he said. The current study ""underscores the well-known but often undiscussed association between lymphedema and BMI,"" Vetto continued. ""Although I certainly avoid shaming patients, I inform them of this and have seen lymphedema improve or even clinically resolve when patients pursue proper nutrition and achieve a healthier weight."" This is not to say that surgeons are off the hook entirely, though, he said. In the study's NAC population, reducing the use of axillary dissection in women who achieve a clinical complete response in the axilla will reduce the risk of lymphedema, Vetto noted. Whenever possible, the use of whole-breast radiotherapy, nodal radiotherapy, and boosts can be scaled back to reduce risk. And when radiotherapy is needed, hypofractionated techniques may reduce arm and shoulder dysfunction, he said. This study was funded by the National Institutes of Health. Armer reported having no conflicts of interest; co-authors disclosed relationships with industry.

Adult (18+) Lymphedema is the buildup of fluid called lymph in the tissues under your skin when something blocks its normal flow. This causes swelling, most commonly in an arm or leg. Lymph normally does an important job for your body. It carries foreign material and bacteria away from your skin and body tissues, and it circulates infection-fighting cells that are part of your immune system. Lymph flows slowly through the network of vessels called your lymphatic system. Lymph flow stops at points along the way to be filtered through lymph nodes. Lymph nodes are small bean-shaped organs that are part of your immune system. Lymph is formed from the fluid that surrounds cells in the body. It makes its way into very small lymphatic vessels. After traveling through these small vessels, lymph drains into deeper, wider lymph channels that run through the body. Eventually, lymph fluid returns to the blood. Lymphedema occurs when there is inadequate lymph drainage from the body, usually from a blockage in a lymph channel. Lymphatic fluid builds up underneath the skin and causes swelling. Most commonly lymphedema affects the arms or legs. Swelling from lymphedema can look similar to the more common edema caused by leakage from tiny blood vessels under the skin. In most cases of lymphedema, the lymphatic system has been injured so that the flow of lymph is blocked either temporarily or permanently. This is called secondary lymphedema. Common causes include: Surgical damage — Surgical cuts and the removal of lymph nodes can interfere with normal lymph flow. Sometimes, lymphedema appears immediately after surgery and goes away quickly. In other cases, lymphedema develops from one month to 15 years after a surgical procedure. Lymphedema occurs quite often in women who have had multiple lymph nodes removed during surgery for breast cancer. An infection involving the lymphatic vessels — An infection that involves the lymphatic vessels can be severe enough to cause lymphedema. In areas of the tropics and subtropics, such as South American, the Caribbean, Africa, Asia and the South Pacific, parasites are a common cause of lymphedema. Filariasis, a parasitic worm infection, blocks the lymph channels and causes swelling and thickening below the skin, usually in the legs. Cancer — Lymphoma, a cancer that starts in the lymph nodes, or other types of cancer that spread to the lymph nodes may block lymph vessels. Radiation therapy for cancer — This treatment can cause scar tissue to develop and block the lymphatic vessels. When lymphedema occurs without any known injury or infection, it is called primary lymphedema. Doctors diagnose three types of primary lymphedema according to when symptoms first appear: At birth — Also known as congenital lymphedema. Risk is higher in female newborns. The legs are affected more often than the arms. Usually both legs are swollen. After birth but before age 36 — Usually, it is first noted during the early teenage years. This is the most common type of primary lymphedema. Age 36 and older — This is the rarest type of primary lymphedema. All three types of primary lymphedema are probably related to the abnormal development of lymph channels before birth. The difference is when in life they first cause swelling of the legs or arms. Lymphedema causes swelling with a feeling of heaviness, tightness or fullness, usually in an arm or leg. In most cases, only one arm or leg is affected. Swelling in the leg usually begins at the foot, and then moves up if it worsens to include the ankle, calf and knee. Additional symptoms can include: A feeling of tightness in the skin of the affected limb Difficulty moving a limb or bending at a joint because of swelling and skin tightness Shoes, rings or watches that suddenly feel too tight Lymphedema can make it easier to develop a skin infection. Signs of infection include fever, pain, heat and redness. If lymphedema becomes chronic (long lasting), the skin in the affected area often becomes thickened and hard. Your doctor will ask you whether you have had any surgery, radiation treatments, or infections in the affected area. The doctor may ask if you have ever had a blood clot. If a child has lymphedema, the doctor will ask if anyone in your family had leg swelling starting at a young age. This may indicate an inherited disorder. Your doctor will examine the swollen area and press on the affected skin to look for a fingertip indentation (pitting). The skin will be indented in people with the much more common type of edema caused by leaky blood vessels. Pitting does not happen when you press on skin if you have lymphedema. Your doctor may measure the circumference of the affected arm or leg to determine how swollen it is compared to the other one. The doctor will look for signs of infection, including fever, redness, warmth and tenderness. Usually, no specific testing is necessary to diagnose lymphedema. But tests may be ordered if the diagnosis is not clear or there is no obvious cause for your condition: A blood count can look for a high level of white cells, which means you might have an infection. An ultrasound can look for blood clots, which can cause an arm or leg to swell. A computed tomography (CT) scan looks for a mass or tumor that could be blocking lymph vessels in the swollen arm or leg. How long lymphedema lasts depends on its cause. If lymphedema develops immediately after surgery, it can clear up within one week as the swelling goes down and the arm or leg is elevated to allow better drainage. If surgery or radiation therapy produced long-term damage to the lymphatic system, lymphedema can become a long-term or recurring problem. After breast cancer or prostate cancer surgery, your doctor or physical therapist may advise that you do specific exercises once you have fully recovered from the surgery. Using your muscles can encourage the flow of lymph through small channels. After breast surgery, you are less likely to develop lymphedema if you can avoid having injections, intravenous (IV) lines, or blood drawn in the arm on the side of the surgery. Also, be sure to get prompt treatment if you think you may have a skin infection on the side of your surgery. Other ways to help decrease the risk of secondary lymphedema include: Don't put use a heating pad on the arm or leg at risk Avoid any constriction, such as a blood pressure cuff or tight clothing Keeping the affected limb clean and dry and periodically applying lubricating lotions If lymphedema affects your legs, avoid wearing socks with tight bands across the top. Avoid standing for long periods. If you work on your feet or at a desk all day, your doctor may prescribe special compression stockings for you to wear throughout the day. Your doctor may suggest that you follow a protein-rich, low-salt diet and that you lose weight if you are obese. For people with more severe lymphedema, doctors prescribe inflatable sleeves that can be worn around the arm or leg, called pneumatic compression devices. These sleeves are attached to a machine that alternately fills and deflates them with air, and they can be used at home to help reduce limb swelling. An alternative to air-filled sleeves is to wrap the limb with a non-elastic bandage, and adjust the bandage each time the swelling decreases. A very helpful treatment is a type of massage therapy called manual lymph drainage. Massage should not be done if you have cancer in the limb. People with lymphedema are more prone to infection in the affected arm or leg. If your doctor suspects you have an infection, you will need to take antibiotics by mouth or into a vein (intravenously). Make an appointment with your doctor if you develop symptoms of lymphedema in an arm or leg. You should call your doctor the same day if you have symptoms that could be from an infection: Fever, redness, warmth or increased pain in addition to swelling It isn't always easy to predict whether edema will last. Most of the time, treatments can improve lymphedema symptoms. P.O.

Newsletter: Mayo Clinic Health Letter — Digital Edition Your body's lymphatic system is part of your immune system, which protects you against infection and disease. The lymphatic system includes your spleen, thymus, lymph nodes and lymph channels, as well as your tonsils and adenoids. Lymphedema is swelling in an arm or a leg. In rare circumstances it affects both arms or both legs. It can also affect the chest wall and abdomen on occasion. Lymphedema signs and symptoms, which occur in your affected arm or leg, include: Swelling of part or all of your arm or leg, including fingers or toes The swelling caused by lymphedema ranges from mild, hardly noticeable changes in the size of your arm or leg to extreme changes that make the limb hard to use. Lymphedema caused by cancer treatment may not occur until months or years after treatment. Make an appointment with your doctor if you notice persistent swelling in your arm or leg. If you already have the diagnosis of lymphedema of a limb, see your doctor if there is a sudden dramatic increase in the size of the involved limb, as it may suggest a new process is occurring. Your lymphatic system is crucial to keeping your body healthy. It circulates protein-rich lymph fluid throughout your body, collecting bacteria, viruses and waste products. Your lymphatic system carries this fluid and harmful substances through your lymph vessels, which lead to lymph nodes. The wastes are then filtered out by lymphocytes — infection-fighting cells that live in your lymph nodes — and ultimately flushed from your body. Lymphedema occurs when your lymph vessels are unable to adequately drain lymph fluid, usually from an arm or leg. Lymphedema can be either primary or secondary. This means it can occur on its own (primary lymphedema), or it can be caused by another disease or condition (secondary lymphedema). Secondary lymphedema is far more common than primary lymphedema. Any condition or procedure that damages your lymph nodes or lymph vessels can cause lymphedema. Causes include: Removal of or injury to lymph nodes and lymph vessels may result in lymphedema. For example, lymph nodes may be removed to check for spread of breast cancer, and lymph nodes may be injured in surgery that involves blood vessels in your limbs. Radiation can cause scarring and inflammation of your lymph nodes or lymph vessels. If cancer cells block lymphatic vessels, lymphedema may result. For instance, a tumor growing near a lymph node or lymph vessel could enlarge enough to block the flow of the lymph fluid. An infection of the lymph nodes or parasites can restrict the flow of lymph fluid. Infection-related lymphedema is most common in tropical and subtropical regions and is more likely to occur in developing countries. Primary lymphedema is a rare, inherited condition caused by problems with the development of lymph vessels in your body. Specific causes of primary lymphedema include: This disorder begins in infancy and causes lymph nodes to form abnormally. This disorder often causes lymphedema around puberty or during pregnancy, though it can occur later, until age 35. This occurs rarely and usually begins after age 35. Factors that may increase your risk of developing lymphedema after cancer, from cancer treatment or from other secondary causes include: Lymphedema in your arm or leg can lead to serious complications, such as: Possible infections that can result from lymphedema include a serious bacterial infection of the skin (cellulitis) and an infection of the lymph vessels (lymphangitis). The smallest injury to your arm or leg can be an entry point for infection. This rare form of soft tissue cancer can result from the most-severe cases of untreated lymphedema. Possible signs of lymphangiosarcoma include blue-red or purple marks on the skin. If you have had or you are going to have cancer surgery, ask your doctor whether your procedure will involve your lymph nodes or lymph vessels. Ask if your radiation treatment will be aimed at lymph nodes, so you'll be aware of the possible risks. Avoid injury to your affected limb. Cuts, scrapes and burns can invite infection. Protect yourself from sharp objects. For example, shave with an electric razor, wear gloves when you garden or cook, and use a thimble when you sew. If possible, avoid medical procedures, such as blood draws and vaccinations, in your affected limb. After cancer treatment, exercise and stretching are encouraged. But avoid strenuous activity until you've recovered from surgery or radiation. Don't apply ice or heat, such as with a heating pad, to your affected limb. Also, protect your affected limb from extreme cold. Whenever possible, elevate your affected limb above the level of your heart. Avoid anything that could constrict your arm or leg, such as tightfitting clothing and, in the case of your arm, blood pressure cuffs. Ask that your blood pressure be taken in your other arm. Make skin and nail care high priorities. Inspect the skin on your arm or leg daily, watching for changes or breaks in your skin that could lead to infection. Don't go barefoot. Lymphedema.

Ask if your radiation treatment will be aimed at lymph nodes, so you'll be aware of the possible risks. Avoid injury to your affected limb. Cuts, scrapes and burns can invite infection. Protect yourself from sharp objects. For example, shave with an electric razor, wear gloves when you garden or cook, and use a thimble when you sew. If possible, avoid medical procedures, such as blood draws and vaccinations, in your affected limb. After cancer treatment, exercise and stretching are encouraged. But avoid strenuous activity until you've recovered from surgery or radiation. Don't apply ice or heat, such as with a heating pad, to your affected limb. Also, protect your affected limb from extreme cold. Whenever possible, elevate your affected limb above the level of your heart. Avoid anything that could constrict your arm or leg, such as tightfitting clothing and, in the case of your arm, blood pressure cuffs. Ask that your blood pressure be taken in your other arm. Make skin and nail care high priorities. Inspect the skin on your arm or leg daily, watching for changes or breaks in your skin that could lead to infection. Don't go barefoot. Lymphedema.

Medically reviewed by — — You have hundreds of small, oval- or bean-shaped lymph nodes (also known as lymph glands) throughout your body. Your lymph nodes, along with lymph vessels, are part of your immune system. Lymph nodes contain immune cells that help defend against disease. Your lymph system filters fluid to remove harmful substances from your body. When the lymph system is working, fluids get drained away. Normally, your lymph nodes are small and firm. When they’re healthy, you shouldn’t even notice them. A buildup of fluid can cause them to swell. may feel tender to the touch or even painful. The preauricular lymph nodes are the ones located just in front of your ears. They drain lymph fluid from the eyes, cheeks, and the scalp near your temples. Generally, lymph nodes swell in only one area of the body at a time (localized lymphadenopathy). The problem, such as an infection, can usually be found nearby. But there are certain conditions, such as viral illnesses, that cause swollen lymph nodes in multiple areas of the body (generalized lymphadenopathy). Continue reading to learn a few of the causes of swollen preauricular lymph nodes and when you should see a doctor. Potential causes for swollen preauricular lymph nodes Whenever there’s an infection, injury, or cancer, lymph nodes spring into action to fight it off. In the process, they can become enlarged. If you have swollen lymph nodes, it’s because something is wrong. Usually, the problem is located in close proximity to the affected lymph nodes. Following are some reasons you might have swollen or painful preauricular lymph nodes. An ear infection can cause lymph nodes in front of or behind the ears to swell. You might also have ear pain and fever. Ears can become infected when fluid builds up in them. This can happen when you have allergies, a sinus infection, or the common cold. Parinaud oculoglandular syndrome is a type of that can cause preauricular lymph nodes to swell. There are many things that can cause this condition, the one being . Cat scratch fever is acquired from bacteria when a cat scratches or bites you. You can also get it when a cat licks an open wound. Other symptoms may include: Some of the less common causes of Parinaud oculoglandular syndrome are: A tooth abscess is a buildup of pus due to a bacterial infection. Nearby lymph nodes can swell as they try to fight off this infection. Other symptoms are: Infections of the skin and scalp can spread to the preauricular lymph nodes. Infection of the lymph nodes () may be accompanied by fever. You might also develop an abscess, and the skin over the lymph nodes may become red and warm. One symptom of is that you might have swollen lymph nodes behind the neck or ears. But rubella can cause swollen lymph nodes in other parts of the body, in addition to the preauricular nodes. Some other symptoms of rubella are: While swollen lymph nodes are not among the main symptoms, these other conditions can sometimes cause generalized lymphadenopathy: is a type of cancer that begins in the lymphatic system, including the lymph nodes, spleen, thymus, and bone marrow. There are many different types, including and . Besides swelling of the lymph nodes, other signs and are: is cancer of the blood-forming tissue. That includes the lymphatic system. There are several different types of leukemia. Some are very aggressive (acute) and some tend to progress more slowly (chronic). In addition to swollen lymph nodes, leukemia can cause: A biopsy of the affected lymph node can help diagnosis the cancer. Also, any type of cancer can spread into the lymph system and cause swollen or painful lymph nodes. That’s why when you’re diagnosed with cancer, nearby lymph nodes are usually examined. Swollen or tender lymph nodes are a symptom, not a disease. Treatment depends on the cause for swelling of the preauricular lymph nodes. Generally speaking, lymph nodes tend to return to normal size once the underlying condition is treated. Ear, eye, skin, and scalp infections can generally be treated with antibiotics. Any conditions that cause these infections should also be treated. For an abscessed tooth, you may need a to clear the infection. This would be followed by having a crown placed over the tooth. Alternatively, you can have the tooth drained by cutting into the gum tissue. This would be followed by a course of antibiotics. In some cases, the only remedy may be to have the tooth . There’s no standard treatment for rubella. Antibiotics are ineffective, but without complications, it should get better on its own. This disease can be prevented with the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine. The treatment for cancer can be complex. It may involve some combination of , , and biological and targeted drugs. Treatment for lymphoma and leukemia depend on the specific type and stage of cancer. Other considerations are your age, overall health, and personal preferences. In some cases, stem cell transplant (also called ) is an option for lymphoma and leukemia. Most of the time, swollen lymph nodes don’t signal a dangerous health problem. They should return to normal within a short period as the underlying condition clears up.

Lymphedema is a collection of fluid that causes swelling (edema) in the arms and legs. One of the causes of lymphedema is surgery to remove , usually during cancer treatment. Normally, lymph nodes filter fluid as it flows through them, trapping bacteria, viruses, and other foreign substances, which are then destroyed by special white blood cells called lymphocytes. Without normal drainage, fluid can build up in the affected arm or leg, and lymphedema can develop. Medicines such as tamoxifen (Nolvadex), , and injury to the lymph nodes can also cause lymphedema. This type is called secondary lymphedema. Primary lymphedema can be present at birth or develop during puberty or adulthood. The cause of primary lymphedema is not known. Symptoms of lymphedema include feeling as though your clothes, rings, wristwatches, or bracelets are too tight; a feeling of fullness in your arms or legs; and less flexibility in your wrists, hands, and ankles. Treatment for lymphedema depends on its cause and includes wearing compression garments such as stockings or sleeves, proper diet and skin care, and fluid drainage. Elevating an arm or leg that has swelling can help ease the drainage of lymph fluid from the affected limb. Whenever possible, rest a swollen arm or leg on a comfortable surface, above the level of your heart. Don't put pressure on your armpit or groin area, and don't hold a limb up without support for very long since this can increase swelling. Gentle exercise can help reduce swelling. The use of muscles during exercise naturally helps lymph fluid to circulate, which can reduce swelling. But exercise also increases blood flow to the muscles being used, which can increase the amount of lymph fluid present. If you have swelling, it is important to properly bandage an affected limb before exercising. Ask your doctor how to use a bandage for this purpose and what exercises are appropriate for your condition. If you have had surgery to remove some lymph nodes, use your affected arm or leg as normally as possible. Most people are healed about 4 to 6 weeks after surgery, and able to go back to their normal activities. If you have had lymph nodes removed or have had radiation therapy as part of cancer treatment, you may be able to avoid lymphedema or keep it under control by following the tips below. Contact your doctor promptly if symptoms of an infection—such as redness, pain, or increased swelling—develop in your arm, hand, leg, or foot. Protect the area below the surgery from injury, even many years after surgery. If you have had lymph nodes removed from under your arm: Do not have blood drawn from the arm on the side of the lymph node surgery. Do not allow a blood pressure cuff to be placed on that arm. If you are in the hospital, make sure you notify your nurse and other hospital staff of your condition. Wear gloves when gardening or doing other activities that may lead to cuts on your fingers or hands. If you have had lymph nodes removed from your groin: Bathe your feet daily in lukewarm, not hot, water. Use a mild soap, preferably one that has moisturizers, or use a moisturizer separately. Wear comfortable and supportive shoes that fit properly. Wear the correct size panty hose and stockings. Avoid wearing constricting garters or knee-high or thigh-high stockings. Ask your doctor how to handle any cuts, scratches, insect bites, or other injuries that may occur. Use and when outdoors to protect your skin from sunburn and insect bites. Do not ignore a feeling of tightness or swelling in or around your arm, hand, leg, or foot. Let your doctor know about it immediately. Ask your doctor to refer you to a who specializes in lymphedema. Many insurance companies will not pay for physical therapy evaluations and treatments without a doctor's referral. If you have been diagnosed with lymphedema and plan to travel by air, you'll need to use a compression garment. Changes in cabin pressure during flight can cause swelling or make it worse. A compression garment that doesn't fit right can also make swelling worse, so be sure your garment fits correctly. If you have lymphedema, you may want to wear a lymphedema alert bracelet. These bracelets, available through the National Lymphedema Network, are worn to protect people who have lymphedema from receiving treatment such as blood pressure readings, injections, or blood draws to their affected limbs. These treatments could make their conditions worse. Lawenda BD, et al. (2009). Lymphedema: A primer on the identification and management of a chronic condition in oncologic treatment.

fba132cd-e38a-4982-9b78-77593ee4f6db,"Information about the 2019 Novel Coronavirus. Información sobre el coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). Lymphadenopathy means swelling of the lymph nodes or glands. These are the bean-shaped glands in the neck, armpits, groin, chest, and abdomen. These glands act as filters for lymphatic fluid. This fluid contains white blood cells (lymphocytes) that help the body fight infection. Lymphadenopathy can occur in just one area of the body, such as the neck. Or it may affect lymph nodes throughout the body. The cervical lymph nodes, found in the neck, are the most common site of lymphadenopathy. Nearly all children will get lymphadenopathy at some time. That is because enlarged glands often occur with viral or bacterial infections like colds, the flu, or strep throat. The lymphatic system is part of the immune system. The immune system fights infection and other disease. Cells and fluid build up in the lymph nodes to help fight infection or disease. This causes the lymph nodes to get bigger. Enlarged lymph nodes are often near the source of infection, so their location can help find out the cause. For example, a baby with a scalp infection may have enlarged lymph nodes at the back of the neck. Swollen lymph nodes around the jaw may be a sign of an infection in the teeth or mouth. Lymphadenopathy may also affect lymph nodes throughout the body. This is common in some viral illnesses such as mono (infectious mononucleosis) or chickenpox. Reactions to medicines such as some antibiotics and seizure medicines Juvenile arthritis and many other joint conditions that affect children What are the symptoms of lymphadenopathy in a child? In children, it is normal to be able to feel some lymph nodes as small, movable lumps under the skin. But if the nodes get bigger than usual, your child may have an infection or other problem. The most common symptoms include: Lumps under the jaw, down the sides or back of the neck, or in the armpits, groin, chest, or belly Depending on the cause, other symptoms may include: Respiratory symptoms such as sore throat, congestion, and cough The symptoms of lymphadenopathy can be like other health conditions. Make sure your child sees his or her healthcare provider for a diagnosis. Your child’s healthcare provider will ask many questions about your child’s health history and current symptoms. For example, he or she will ask whether your child has been around others with infections like strep throat. He or she may ask if your child has been around a young cat. This is because a scratch may cause enlarged lymph nodes in a mild condition called cat scratch disease. He or she will check your child, looking closely at the areas where lymph nodes are enlarged. The provider will check the size and location of the nodes. He or she will also want to know how long they have been swollen and if they are painful. Your child may need to see a specialist. He or she may also need some diagnostic tests. They may include: A complete blood count called a CBC. A CBC checks the red blood cells, white blood cells, blood clotting cells, and sometimes young red blood cells. Urine and other blood tests may also be done. Pictures of the chest check for enlarged lymph nodes or other problems. Enlarged lymph nodes may be checked with biopsy. Samples of lymph node tissue are taken and looked at under a microscope. They are tested for different causes of enlargement. Your child may need to see a surgeon for biopsy. Or he or she may be referred to specialists in blood disorders and cancer. These can include a pediatric hematologist and oncologist.  The treatment of enlarged lymph nodes depends on the cause. Enlarged lymph nodes are often harmless and go away without any treatment. Treatment may include: Antibiotic medicines to treat an underlying bacterial infection, such as strep throat, or ear or skin infections Antibiotic medicines and drainage of the lymph node for infection of a lymph node or small group of nodes A follow-up exam to recheck enlarged nodes after waiting for 3 to 4 weeks Other medicines or procedures to treat other conditions that caused the enlarged nodes Referral to specialists for incision or drainage or more exams, diagnostic tests, and treatment What are possible complications of lymphadenopathy in a child? Lymphadenopathy is the body’s normal response to infection and other disease. Ignoring the enlarged lymph nodes may delay treatment of a serious infection or other disease. When should I call my child’s healthcare provider? You notice lumps below your child’s jaw, down the sides of the neck, in the back of the neck, in the armpits, or in the groin. Your child’s lymph nodes continue to be larger than normal, become newly tender, or develop redness of the skin over them, even after your child sees his or her healthcare provider. Your child complains of any problems or pain when swallowing. You hear any abnormal breathing sounds or your child complains of having a hard time breathing. Lymphadenopathy is the term for swollen glands or swelling of the lymph nodes. The lymph glands are part of the immune system and help fight infections and other disease. They are enlarged when the body is fighting infection or other diseases. Since enlarged lymph nodes are often near the source of infection, their location can help find the cause. Diagnosis of lymphadenopathy is often based on the presence of other conditions, such as an infection. Treatment is usually based on the cause of the lymphadenopathy. Ignoring lymphadenopathy may delay treatment of a serious infection or other disease. Tips to help you get the most from a visit to your child’s healthcare provider: Know the reason for the visit and what you want to happen. Before your visit, write down questions you want answered. At the visit, write down the name of a new diagnosis, and any new medicines, treatments, or tests. Also write down any new instructions your provider gives you for your child. Know why a new medicine or treatment is prescribed and how it will help your child. Also know what the side effects are. Ask if your child’s condition can be treated in other ways. Know why a test or procedure is recommended and what the results could mean. Know what to expect if your child does not take the medicine or have the test or procedure. If your child has a follow-up appointment, write down the date, time, and purpose for that visit. Know how you can contact your child’s provider after office hours. This is important if your child becomes ill and you have questions or need advice.",101,heavy flares swelling lymph nodes,-6.714939594268799,19

Painful, swollen lymph nodes can have many causes, including various types of bacterial infections, viral infections, disorders of the immune system and several types of cancers, suggests WebMD. To determine the cause of painful lymph nodes, doctors must assess a patient's other symptoms. Painful glands on the neck can lead to plenty of discomfort. The only way to treat them is to treat the underlying problem that has caused them to become swollen and sore. Any individual who is experiencing swollen and sore lymph nodes along with other symptoms such as a fever approaching or over 104 degrees Fahrenheit, difficulties breathing or swallowing, night sweats, or weight loss is advised to contact his doctor immediately. Another indicator that medical help is needed is if the skin over the swollen lymph nodes becomes red in color, says WebMD. Other indicators that medical help may be needed include lymph nodes that become larger than an inch in size, are very painful to the touch, become very hard, or do not reduce in size for a period of a month or longer, notes WebMD. In addition to the neck, common locations for swollen lymph nodes on the body include the armpits, the groin, the area under the jaw and the lower portion of the back of the head, reports WebMD. Because the tonsils are a kind of lymph tissue, certain illnesses such as tonsillitis can cause them to swell in much the same manner.

They’re simply a sign that your immune system is fighting an infection or illness. But if they’re enlarged with no obvious cause, see your doctor to rule out something more serious. When you’re not feeling so great, like you’re coming down with something, you may notice some swelling on the sides of your neck. Those lumps probably feel soft and tender to the touch — and may even hurt a little. Swollen lymph nodes (or what doctors call lymphadenopathy) are common and are actually a good thing. The swelling in these pea- or bean-sized lymph nodes are one of your body’s natural reactions to illness or infection. That tells doctors that your body’s healthy and robust immune system is working to clear away infection and/or invading viruses or bacteria. Many people call them swollen glands ― even though they’re really not glands, but part of your . One of your body’s lesser known systems, it’s in charge of balancing your fluid levels. Your swollen glands act like filters that help your body get rid of germs, cells or other foreign matter that passes through your lymph fluid (a clear or slightly yellowish fluid made up of white blood cells, proteins and fats). And when you think of swollen glands, you most likely think of swelling in your neck. But the lymph nodes in your groin, under your chin and your armpits can swell too. You can even move them slightly with your fingers. You also have lymph nodes throughout your body that you can’t feel.

Other bacteria and viruses that may cause your lymph nodes to become swollen include: Your lymph nodes get larger when more blood cells come to fight off an invading infection. They all essentially pile in, causing pressure and swelling. Often, the lymph nodes that swell will be close to the infection’s site.

65dcd960-6bfd-46bc-bb0a-503fa8668127,"— is a cancer that starts in the lymphatic system, a series of nodes and vessels that are an important part of your immune system. The immune system plays a role in fighting bacteria or infections and in destroying abnormal cells. Typical symptoms of lymphoma include swollen lymph nodes in the neck or armpits, fatigue, fever, and unexplained weight loss. However, lymphoma can cause additional symptoms, especially when it starts in the female reproductive organs. These symptoms are often easy to miss because they can be caused by a number of conditions besides lymphoma. Lymphoma growing in any of the organs in the female genital tract can appear as a mass in your pelvis. As the tumor grows, you might be able to feel and even see the mass, but unless you’re very thin, you probably won’t notice it. Abnormal bleeding, such as a significant change in the pattern of menstrual bleeding or starting to bleed again after going through menopause, can be a symptom of lymphoma in your uterus or cervix. This can be caused by many things, but a change in pattern, especially postmenopausal bleeding, should be evaluated by your doctor. A mass-like lymphoma that’s growing in an organ in your pelvis can cause pain or pressure. Depending on where the lymphoma is, the sensation can be felt in different parts of your abdomen or pelvis. The pain can be caused by the lymphoma pressing on or invading nerves or other structures. Other causes include the tumor causing spasms in the organ’s muscle or irritating other tissue due to tumor growth. When a mass, such as lymphoma, forms in a female organ, sex can become painful. Painful sex can also be caused by many other things besides lymphoma. If you’re experiencing painful intercourse, discuss it with your doctor. Usually when lymphoma starts in a female organ, the classic symptoms aren’t present. Only about of women with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma in their genital tract have classic symptoms. When symptoms do occur, they are nonspecific, meaning they can be seen in a variety of different conditions. You might think that they’re caused by a cold or the flu. One clue that your symptoms are caused by lymphoma is that they persist. In less serious conditions, like the flu, symptoms improve over time. Classic symptoms occur in both women and men and include: Lymph nodes or lymph glands are small structures in your body that are important for fighting infection and filtering out abnormal and worn-out cells. You have hundreds of them in your body, but the ones that are most noticeable are: They’re also found in your chest (), abdomen (), and pelvis (iliac). You can sometimes feel your lymph nodes. They’re normally small and not tender. When bacteria or viruses pass through them, your lymph nodes attack, which makes them swollen and tender. This is called , and it’s the most common cause of . They return to their normal size after a few days as the infection resolves. Lymphoma also makes your lymph nodes swell, but they usually aren’t tender. They’re almost never as painful as they are with an infection. Swollen inguinal lymph nodes could be a symptom of lymphoma in the female reproductive organs. A fever that only lasts a few days is unlikely to be caused by lymphoma. More often it’s due to a viral or bacterial infection. A fever that lasts, either continuously or intermittently, is more likely to be from a serious condition like lymphoma, especially if you don’t have any other symptoms of an infection. This symptom is common in many conditions, including most types of cancer. It’s normal to be fatigued for a few days from lack of sleep or overexertion. Unexplained fatigue that persists should be evaluated by your doctor. Lymphoma can cause you to sweat at night. You may sweat so heavily you wake up suddenly and find your clothes and sheets are soaking wet. You may have to change them before going back to sleep. It’s not as common, but heavy sweating can occur during the day, too, if you have lymphoma. Unless can be explained by things like menopause or the flu, they should be evaluated by your doctor. Suddenly losing weight when you’re not trying to can be a symptom of lymphoma. It’s also a symptom of many other conditions, including other types of cancer. Any time you have significant and , see your doctor. Lymphoma is cancer that begins in , which are a type of white blood cell that play a role in immunity.

Only of non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas outside of lymph tissue start in the female genital tract. that can be affected include: There are two main types of lymphoma: and . most often starts in lymph nodes in the upper body, especially in the armpit, neck, and chest usually spreads only to other lymph nodes through the lymphatic system if advanced, occasionally spreads to other parts of the body through the bloodstream primarily affects adults, but it can also occur in children is the type of lymphoma that occurs in female organs If you have symptoms that you think might be caused by lymphoma, see your doctor.

If lymphoma or another serious condition is suspected, your doctor may order imaging tests like X-rays or a . These tests will show enlarged lymph nodes and other indications of lymphoma. A lymphoma diagnosis is made by taking a , where a small piece of an affected lymph node or tissue is removed. The tissue is then looked at under a microscope to see if lymphoma is present. If you have lymphoma, you may experience classic symptoms or no symptoms at all. You may experience additional symptoms, such as a pelvic mass or enlarged lymph nodes in your groin, if you have lymphoma in your female reproductive organs. The symptoms of lymphoma are nonspecific. Most often they are caused by something less serious and more common. If you have unexplained symptoms and they last, see your doctor.

It works to fight disease and infection. The lymphatic system goes through many changes during a child's growth. Before birth, a baby is protected by the mother's immune system. At birth, a newborn's lymphatic system starts to respond to the regular exposure to new antigens. Antigens are organisms and diseases. The lymphatic system grows steadily until puberty, when a child’s growth slows.  This is a fluid. It moves all around the lymph system. It contains a type of white blood cell called a lymphocyte. These are white blood cells that fight infection and disease. These are tiny tubes that carry lymph fluid around the body. These are small, bean-shaped organs. They act as filters for the lymph fluid as it travels all over the body. Lymph nodes are found in the underarms, groin, neck, chest, and belly (abdomen). Children are constantly fighting off new germs and infections. Their lymphatic system quickly responds to these antigens. When this happens, lymph nodes often swell. This is known as lymphadenopathy.  It’s common for children to have slightly enlarged lymph nodes in certain areas of the body some of the time. But changes in the lymph nodes can also mean certain conditions or diseases that need special treatment. In some cases, swollen lymph nodes are caused by: This is infection of 1 or more lymph nodes in which the glands often become suddenly sore and swollen, frequently with redness of the overlying skin. Someone with lymphadenitis will often have a fever, and the swollen glands could drain pus. Lymphadenitis is often caused by bacteria such as streptococcus or staphylococcus. In some cases it is caused by other bacteria, such as those that cause tuberculosis and syphilis. This is a group of lymphatic vessels that forms a mass or lump. A large lymphangioma has greatly enlarged lymphatic vessels. This is a large pocket of lymph fluid (cyst). It is caused by blocked lymph vessels. A cystic hygroma may have multiple cysts linked to one another by the lymphatic vessels. This is cancer of the lymph system. The cancer causes the cells in the lymph system to reproduce abnormally. It causes the lymph nodes to swell. And it makes the body less able to fight infection.

Swollen lymph nodes in the female groin area can be caused by injury, a viral or bacterial infection, or a sexually transmitted disease, according to the National Institutes of Health. Patients with swollen groin lymph nodes should see a doctor in order to get a precise diagnosis. Additionally, swollen lymph nodes in the groin area might be related to the legs or feet and not to the groin area at all, advises WebMD. Other possible causes include hernias, allergies, drug reactions and benign cysts. In rare cases, swollen lymph nodes signify cancer. However, sometimes lymph nodes swell for no reason at all, which is why it is best for those concerned to check with a doctor. Lymph nodes are small glands located throughout the body and are an important part of the immune system. The nodes filter the body's fluids and trap unhealthy bacteria and viruses so they can be destroyed, explains WebMD. This is why lymph nodes often swell when there is an infection in a nearby area. For example, the lymph nodes in the neck might swell when an individual has a cold. In addition to the neck and groin, the armpits also contain lymph nodes that can be felt by touch.

Many of the first symptoms of HIV are similar to the flu. In addition to and , swollen lymph nodes are commonly experienced. Treating the virus itself is the best way to ease these symptoms. Learn why HIV can lead to swollen lymph nodes and how to reduce lymph node inflammation using a few at-home methods. Lymph nodes are a part of your lymphatic system. This system plays an important role in your immune system. Lymph, a clear fluid that circulates throughout your body, is partly made of white blood cells that attack bacteria and viruses. Lymph nodes are located in certain parts of the body, including your neck, groin, and armpits. They’re shaped like beans and measure no more than 2.5 centimeters long. Your lymph nodes are responsible for filtering lymph and producing mature immune cells. Lymph nodes protect both your blood and immune system by: Swollen lymph nodes may also be the first signs of an infection, including HIV. The recommends that you call your healthcare provider if swollen lymph nodes last more than two to four weeks. An infection from bacteria and viruses, including HIV, can cause swelling of the lymph nodes. The swelling occurs because the infection reaches the nodes through lymph fluid. HIV most often affects lymph nodes around the neck as well as in the armpits and groin. Swollen lymph nodes may occur within a few days of HIV contraction. However, it’s possible not to experience any other HIV symptoms for up to several years after contracting the virus. Usually, healthy lymph nodes aren’t visible. If there’s an infection, they become swollen and may look like hard bumps about the size of beans. As the infection progresses, more lymph nodes may swell in the body. In addition to swollen lymph nodes, non-specific symptoms of HIV include: Treating swollen lymph nodes often comes down to treating the underlying cause. Antibiotics can treat bacterial infections. Most swelling associated with viral infections requires time to heal. However, HIV is different than other types of viruses. While symptoms may be absent for months at a time, the untreated virus is continuously present in the blood and other tissues. Swollen lymph nodes that occur as a result of HIV must be treated with antiretroviral medication. reduces symptoms and prevents transmission of HIV. Other remedies may help soothe swollen lymph nodes. For example, heat from warm compresses along with medications may make you more comfortable and reduce pain. Getting plenty of rest may reduce swelling and pain as well. Over-the-counter may also help. However, only use these remedies as complementary treatments and not as replacements. Never rely on these remedies in place of prescribed medications for HIV. HIV is a chronic, or ongoing, condition. This doesn’t mean swollen lymph nodes will occur all of the time. HIV symptoms tend to fluctuate depending upon the level of virus in the body and the various complications it causes. Medications for HIV help slow the rate of immune system breakdown. It’s important to stick with all prescribed medications and treatments, even if symptoms are reduced. Untreated HIV can weaken the immune system, leaving a person at risk of other infections. Someone with HIV is most likely to experience symptoms during these periods of sickness. Healthcare providers can give more information about managing HIV. Noticeably swollen lymph nodes could indicate that your body is fighting an infection.

Swelling at the submental node is often a sign of disease and can be caused by numerous factors like an infected wisdom tooth, oral cancer, a tooth abscess, oral infections, lymphadenopathy, leukemia, lymphoma, swollen lymph nodes and may also be a result of metastasis of cancer, as reported by Right Diagnosis. The submental nodes are a part of the lymph immune system, and are situated right below the chin. These nodes are responsible for fighting off infections with the white blood cells that they contain and acting as a filter for removing potentially pathogenic microbial agents from the lymphatic system, so that it cannot be distributed throughout the body. Swollen submental lymph nodes are also commonly associated with additional symptoms like fatigue, fever, weight loss, tooth pain, enlarged or tender lymph nodes, edema, night sweats and mouth pain. Submental lymph nodes contain sinuses, germinal centers, scavenger cells, reticular fibers and trabeculae. The node is made from lymphatic tissues that have been enclosed by a capsule made from fibrous tissues. These nodes are positioned to intersect many organs, and as a result are one of the first nodes to swell when a patient is ill. The swelling indicates that the immune system is fighting off the infection, whether it be bacterial or viral. What Features Does Infinite Campus Offer for Students?

As a part of the immune system, by filtering lymph before sending the fluid back through the lymphatic system. Cancer appearing in the lymph nodes is an indicator of how the cancer is spreading. If cancer cells are only found in the lymph nodes near the original tumor, it may indicate the cancer is in an earlier stage and has not spread far beyond its primary area. On the other hand, if your doctor finds the cancer cells have traveled to lymph nodes far from the initial tumor, the cancer may be spreading at a faster rate and could be in a later stage. Additionally, it’s important to know how many cancer cells have traveled to the respective lymph node. If there’s visible or palpable cancer in lymph nodes, or the cancer has grown outside the lymph node walls, the cancer may have progressed further and may require a different treatment plan.

View All Centers & Departments Whenever the normal drainage pattern in the lymph nodes is disturbed or damaged - often during surgery to remove the lymph nodes - the arm may swell. This swelling, caused by too much fluid, is called lymphedema. Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center offers lymphedema screening for women who have been treated for breast cancer. Lymphedema is swelling that may occur after cancer surgery when lymph nodes are removed. It may also happen after radiation to the lymph nodes. It can start months or years after treatment. It’s a long-term (chronic) condition that has no cure. But you can take steps to help keep it from starting. If it does start, there are things you can do to reduce or ease symptoms. If left untreated, lymphedema can get worse. It's important to know what lymphedema is and what you should watch for. Lymphedema is easier to treat and treatment is more likely going to work if it's treated right away. The lymphatic system helps the body fight infection. It's a network of tiny vessels and small, bean-shaped organs called lymph nodes. The vessels carry lymph throughout the body. Lymph is a clear, colorless fluid that contains a few blood cells. The nodes filter lymph to help fight infection. The lymph system helps protect and maintain the fluid balance of your body. It filters and drains lymph and waste products away from every part of the body. The lymph is carried back to bigger vessels near your heart. The lymph nodes under the arm are called the axillary lymph nodes. They drain the lymphatic vessels from the upper arms, most of the breast, and from the chest, neck, and arm pit. During surgery for breast cancer, these nearby lymph nodes (and vessels) are often removed. This disrupts the flow of lymph. The axillary lymph nodes also might be treated with radiation therapy. This can cause damage and scarring that also affects the way lymph flows through that area. All of this can lead to fluid buildup and swelling on the affected side. This is lymphedema. When many lymph nodes under the arm have been affected, you are at higher risk for lymphedema for the rest of your life. Swelling can get worse and become severe. Skin sores, infection, pain, and other problems can develop. Lymphedema may start right after surgery or radiation, or months or even years later. A mild type of lymphedema happens within a few days after surgery. This is normal. It usually lasts a short time. Lymphedema can also happen about 4 to 6 weeks after surgery or radiation and then go away over time. The most common type of lymphedema is painless. It tends to slowly develop, most often within 3 years of surgery. It does not get better without treatment. Lymphedema can happen any time after surgery or radiation to the lymph nodes. The risk continues for the rest of the person's life. Lymphedema can’t be cured, but it can be managed. Any swelling should be checked by a healthcare provider right away. Doctors don't know who will or won't get lymphedema. But there are things that can be done to help prevent it. Women treated for breast cancer who take good care of their skin and exercise after treatment may be less likely to develop lymphedema. Staying at or getting to a healthy weight may also help lower your risk. Newer types of lymph node surgery have also helped lower lymphedema risk. But there's no sure way to prevent lymphedema. Protecting the arm on the side of the surgery is very important after breast surgery. Poor drainage of the lymphatic system can put that arm at risk for infection. Poor drainage can also make the arm less sensitive to extreme temperature. Be aware of activities that put too much stress on the affected arm. To protect your arm from injury and infection, make sure to: Ask for injections and blood draws to be done on the unaffected arm if possible. Ask for blood pressure tests to be done on the unaffected arm if possible. Not wear nightgowns or clothing with elastic cuffs or tight bands. Carry your handbag or heavy packages with the unaffected arm or both arms. Be very careful and use a clean razor when shaving underarms. Prevent sunburns and other burns to the affected arm. Wear gloves when gardening and when using strong household cleaners. Clean the skin of the affected arm daily, gently dry well, and apply lotion. Do approved exercises regularly to improve drainage. Not put extreme hot or cold temperatures on the affected arm. This includes hot tubs, saunas, and heating pads or ice packs. Take good care of your fingernails. Don’t cut or bite your cuticles. Clean all cuts with soap and water. Put antibacterial ointment and a sterile dressing on the cut. Protect your fingers from needle pricks and sharp objects. Use a thimble when sewing. Not do vigorous, repetitive movements against resistance with the affected arm. This includes scrubbing, pulling, or pushing. Tell your doctor right away if you have any signs of infection. These include redness, pain, heat, increased swelling, or fever. The main symptom of lymphedema after breast cancer treatment is swelling of the arm on the side where lymph nodes were removed. The amount of swelling may vary. Some people may have severe swelling (edema). The affected arm can be several inches larger than the other arm. Others will have a milder form of edema where the affected arm is only slightly larger than the other arm. Feeling of fullness, heaviness, or tightness in the arm, chest, or armpit area Trouble bending or moving a joint, such as the fingers, wrist, elbow, or shoulder If you notice any of these symptoms, see your healthcare provider right away. Treatment needs to be started right away to keep lymphedema from getting worse. There are no tests for lymphedema. Instead, your healthcare provider will ask about your health history and do a physical exam. You’ll be asked about: What other health conditions you have. These might be high blood pressure, heart disease, or diabetes. You may need other tests to diagnose lymphedema. These include imaging tests, measures of volume, and blood tests. Treatment depends on how severe the problem is. Treatment focuses on ways to help prevent and manage the condition. It may include:  Exercise helps improve lymph drainage. Your doctor, certified lymphedema therapist, or physical therapist will recommend specific exercises.  Wearing a compression sleeve or elastic bandage may help to move fluid. It can also prevent fluid buildup.  Eating a healthy diet and controlling your weight are an important part of treatment.  Raising your arm above the level of your heart when possible lets gravity help drain the fluid.  It’s important to protect the skin in the affected area from drying, cracking, infection, and skin breakdown. Massage by a certified lymphedema therapist can help move fluid out of the swollen area. Ask your healthcare provider for a referral to a certified lymphedema therapist. This is a provider who specializes in lymphedema teaching and management. Talk with your doctor about what you can do to try to keep lymphedema from happening to you. Make these precautions part of your daily habits. Plan to follow them for the rest of your life. Compare your hands and arms. Look at them in the mirror. Learn what's normal for you so you can notice changes right away. If lymphedema does develop, let your doctor know right away.

Lymphoedema can be to a small area, or over a large area such as one or both upper or lower limbs. To understand how lymphoedema occurs we need to know a bit about what the lymphatic system is and how it works. The lymphatic system forms part of the immune system and part of the system. The lymphatic system is made up of many tiny vessels that run throughout the body and gradually join together to form bigger vessels.ymphatic vessels are found in the but not in tissue. Running through these vessels is a clear fluid called . Lymph contains the excess , water, and waste products that the body doesn’t require and travels along the lymphatic system until it reaches the (). The lymph nodes, which are situated in the neck, armpits, groins and deep inside the chest and abdomen, filter and cleanse the lymph to remove any foreign matter (e.g. bacteria) and start any necessary immune reactions. Once passed through the lymph nodes, lymph finally drains into large veins located in the lower neck. Movement of muscles helps to keep the lymph moving along the lymphatic system. In addition the walls of the contract and valves inside the vessels keep things pumping.  Can occur in babies and children, and may lifelong (swelling) occurs when excess fluid and protein from damaged (e.g. after a burn or ankle sprain) enters into the lymphatic system at a rate too fast for the lymph to be carried away. This produces a temporary swelling which gradually resolves on its own as the damaged tissue heals, blood vessels no longer leak excessively and the lymphatic system can keep pace with the normal flow of lymph. Lymphoedema is the name given to the swelling that occurs because of a damaged or blocked lymphatic system. Protein, water and waste products are released into tissue in the normal way but a damaged lymphatic system prevents the drainage away and swelling of the affected area results (lymphostasis). In addition, the limb may become inflamed.  Examples of localised or lymphoedema include: facial/eyelid oedema in patients with Pendulous swelling and masses in morbidly obese patients polyps (large firm skin tags) There are basically two types of diffuse lymphoedema based on the underlying causes.  Primary lymphoedema is also known as Milroy disease. Damaged lymphatic system is usually present at birth (usually as a result of underdevelopment) Affects both sexes, although 70–80% of cases are female Age of onset varies – swelling is present at birth in 10% of cases, 80% swelling before 35 years and 10% after 35 years Commonest sites for swelling are the legs, arms, genitals and face Impaired functioning of the lymphatic system is caused by some other condition or factor disease – due to incompetent superficial and/or deep veins in the lower legs resulting in venous (increased pressure) and secondary damage to the lymphatic system Surgery – removal of lymph nodes when treating some cancers, e.g. breast, prostate – used to treat but can cause scar tissue that interrupts lymphatic flow Accidental , injury or (eg ) that directly damages lymph vessels Reduced mobility – movement keeps the muscle contracting which helps the flow of lymph Initially the symptoms and signs of lymphoedema may be very slight and almost unnoticeable. If left untreated, the swelling may get bigger and eventually become permanent. Some or all of the following symptoms may be experienced in diffuse lymphoedema. Altered sensation, such as pins and needles, shooting pains or feeling of heat Joint discomfort due to the swelling, eg elbow, knee Changes in temperature of the limb or affected skin At first the swollen area will if pressed with a thumb. However, as it becomes bigger and harder it will no longer pit. If lymphoedema is left untreated and the swelling gets worse, skin changes may occur. The skin may get very thick with folds and bulges and cannot be lifted up or pinched. Dry spots appear on the ankles, feet and toes (elephantiasis nostras verruciformis, or lymphatic ).  Lymphoedema of the legs is often worse than that of the arms as lymphatic drainage from the legs is more difficult. Walking becomes difficult as the patient carries the excess weight. Complications are common in severe diffuse lymphoedema. Because fail to circulated through the affected tissue, lymphoedema results in localised immune deficiency making it prone to infection (). This is particularly the case if lymph leaks on to the skin surface or there are in the skin. Lymphoedema results in breakdown of barrier function of the skin, leading to of contact allergic dermatitis is delayed due to immune deficiency, but if it develops can be severe and difficult to treat effectively. Severe lymphoedema is associated with chronic and (scarring).  Lymphoedema may be complicated by skin cancers including (Stewart Treves ), , , and . Tumours are often multiple. are more in lymphoedematous skin than unaffected skin. The warty and polyps arising in elephantiasis nostras verruciformis) may be due to activation of human papillomavirus (betaHPV). Diagnosis of lymphoedema is made from a patient's history and observation. The possibility of cancer should be investigated if a cause cannot be found for swelling. In some difficult cases a radiographic test called lymphoscintigraphy may be performed. This measures lymphatic function and gives a fair image of the lymphatic system. Lymphoedema should be distinguished from , in which swelling of both thighs and lower legs is due to the accumulation of fat under the skin. Lymphoedema is an ongoing condition that has no known cure. The main goal of treatment is to reduce the swelling and keep it to a minimum. It is very important to treat lymphoedema in its early stages to prevent further swelling and complications such as infection. If a cause is found then the cause needs to be treated, e.g. cancer. For patients with mild to moderate swelling of their limbs a treatment regimen called Complex Physical (Lymphatic/Lymphoedema) Therapy (C.P.T./C.L.T.) is recommended. This regimen consists of 4 main parts. Skin care – this involves keeping the skin clean to reduce infection, the use of to restore and maintain skin suppleness, and to remove hard, dead skin. Simple lymphatic drainage – this is a gentle massage technique that uses simple hand movements to try to move the swelling out of the affected area. The patient, relative or caregiver is taught the technique. , sleeve or stocking to help prevent swelling from building up in the limb again. Exercise and movement – specially designed programme to supplement the massage and help by maximising lymph drainage without over exertion For people with more severe swelling, additional treatments are usually recommended. These include: Manual Lymphatic Drainage – specialised form of massage carried out by a trained therapist to move the skin in specific directions based on the underlying anatomy and of the lymphatic system. Multi-Layer Lymphoedema Bandaging – multi-layer system of compression bandages Drug therapy – research is ongoing as to the effectiveness of drug therapy in lymphoedema.

817fbe33-013e-42d4-bd09-4bdfa85ec72f,"— — A lump under the chin is a bump, mass, or swollen area that appears under the chin, along the jawline, or on the front part of the neck. In some cases, more than one lump may develop. Lumps under the chin are usually harmless. Most of the time, they’re caused by swollen lymph nodes. This swelling is typically triggered by an infection. Cancer, cysts, abscesses, benign tumors, and other medical issues can also cause chin lumps. However, these causes are much rarer by comparison. A lump under the chin may appear as a boil or abscess. It may feel soft or hard. Some lumps feel tender or even painful to the touch, while others don’t cause pain. When neck lumps don’t cause pain, they can be present for a long time before you notice them. Read on to find out more about what causes a lump to form under the chin and how this condition is treated. Both bacterial and viral infections can cause a lump to form under the chin. Many times, these lumps are . Lymph nodes are part of the network of your immune system that help protect your body from illnesses. Many are located in the head and neck, including under the jaw and chin. Lymph nodes are small and flexible. They can be round or bean-shaped. It’s common for lymph nodes in the head and neck to swell. When they do, it’s usually a sign of an underlying illness. When swollen, they can range in size from that of a pea to that of a large olive. They may feel tender or painful to the touch, or hurt when you chew or turn your head in a particular direction. Common infections that can trigger swelling in the lymph nodes include: upper respiratory infections, including and the an or any mouth infection Many other conditions can cause lymph nodes to swell, producing a lump under the chin. These include viruses such as and . Immune system disorders, such as and , can also cause swollen lymph nodes. If you have a lump under the chin caused by a swollen lymph node, you may also experience other symptoms, such as: other swollen lymph nodes, such as in the groin or under the arms symptoms of an , such as a cough, sore throat, or runny nose Lumps under the chin caused by lymph node swelling due to an infection should go away on their own. Your doctor may suggest you monitor the swelling. Treating the underlying infection will reduce lymph node swelling. If you have an infection, you might be prescribed antibiotic or antiviral medication. Your doctor might also suggest over-the-counter medication, such as ibuprofen (Advil), (Aleve), or acetaminophen (Tylenol) to treat pain and . In severe cases, infected lymph nodes may need to be drained of pus. Cancer can also cause a lump to form under the chin. Though cancer is more likely to affect older adults, it can appear at any age. There are a variety of ways that cancer can cause a lump to form. For instance, a lump under the chin can form when: cancer is affecting a nearby organ, such as the , , , or salivary gland cancer from a distant organ metastasizes, or spreads, to the lymph nodes Certain cancers can also cause the lymph nodes to swell. These include , , and others. Cancerous lumps usually feel hard. They aren’t tender or painful to the touch. Related symptoms vary according to the type of cancer. Some warning signs may include: changes in the size, shape, and color of warts, moles, and mouth sores When a lump under the chin is caused by a cancerous tumor, there are a number of treatments available. Your doctor might suggest , , or surgery to remove the lump. The treatment depends on a number of factors, including your current health, the type of cancer, and its stage. Your doctor will help you understand which treatment is right for you. Other growths aren’t cancerous.

Unlike malignant (cancerous) tumors, they can’t invade neighboring tissues or spread to other parts of the body. Some types of cysts and benign tumors that can cause a lump to form under the chin include: Sebaceous cysts, lipomas, and fibromas can be either soft or firm. Most cysts and benign tumors aren’t usually painful. They may cause discomfort, though. When a cyst or tumor grows, it can put pressure on nearby structures. Many cysts and benign tumors don’t have related symptoms. However, if the cyst or benign tumor is close to the surface of the skin, it can become irritated, inflamed, or infected.

Introduction In 1948, Stewart and Treves reported for the first time a series of six cases of cutaneous angiosarcoma developed in lymphedema of the upper limb after mastectomy with axillary dissection for breast cancer. The disease appears eight to twenty-four years after the occurrence of lymphedema [1]. These tumors are rare, less than 1% of all sarcomas [2, 3], and have high clinical aggressiveness and poor prognosis. Up to date, more than 400 cases of Steward-Treves syndrome (STS) have been reported in the literature. The lymphatic stasis has diverse origins: congenital origin, postradiation origin, trauma, or burn [4]. The mechanism and pathophysiology of this neoplasia remain unknown at present. 2. Case Presentation A 41-year-old active woman with no particular history presented with left breast carcinoma tumor in 1987. Biological and radiological clinical assessments had revealed no distant extension. The patient underwent a surgical treatment of Patey technique in the left breast with axillary dissection. The anatomopathological study revealed that it was an invasive galactophoric adenocarcinoma and five to 23 positive nodes were detected. Four cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and 5-fluouracil were administered. Seven years following the chemotherapy, a nodule appeared on the intervention scar. The biopsy confirmed a local recurrence of breast cancer. After a staging that was featureless, radiotherapy targeting the chest wall, the collarbone, and armpit with a dose of 45 Gy for five weeks was performed. Hormone therapy with tamoxifen 20 mg per day was administered. Two years after the treatment, the patient developed a significant lymphedema of the left arm, starting from the wrist and reaching the left shoulder, which required regular sessions of lymphatic drainage. 20 years after the appearance of the left mammary neoplasia and the occurrence of chronic lymphedema of the left arm, a burn of second degree appeared on the affected limb. A local treatment was administrated. In September 2007 (one month after healing), the patient began to complain about a small hard erythematous-violet nodule at the rear and upper side of the left arm and reaching the posterior brachial region. They increased and became more painful and had a hard-bloody consistency on contact causing total functional left upper limb impotence (Figures 1 and 2). The patient was hospitalized for additional tests following a radiography of the left arm showing significant swelling of the soft tissues. An exam of the biological tumor markers (CA 19-9) indicated that those were in range. An ultrasound of the soft tissue showed a significant subcutaneous edema. A computed tomography scan revealed a member with a fluid collection under fascial muscular near the lower third of the humerus and diffused a thick septa anterosuperior arm (Figure 3), while an upper limb MRI showed the presence of a nodular formation in fatty tissue of the lower third of the arm (Figure 4). A biopsy of the soft parts of the upper limb and brachial region was performed and the histological analyses confirmed the diagnosis of cutaneous angiosarcoma of chronic lymphedema. Immunohistochemistry indicated the vascular nature of the tumor thus eliminating the diagnosis of cutaneous metastases. Following this diagnosis, a complete staging was performed. The abdominal ultrasound and thoracoabdominal and bone scans revealed no remote extension. A radical decision was made including a dislocation of the left shoulder followed by two cycles of chemotherapy. The evaluation marked alteration of the general condition and dyspnea related to tumor spread in the lungs (pleurisy abundance). The histological tests revealed metastatic character of angiosarcoma. In April 2008, approximately eight months after the start of symptoms, the patient developed multiorgan failure that resulted in her death. 3. Discussion The angiosarcoma is a rare and aggressive malignant tumor which develops in the vascular tissue and affects about 0.07% of breast cancer patients who survive five years at least after a mastectomy for Fitzpatrick [5] and 0.03% of patients surviving 10 or more years after radical mastectomy for Taghian et al. [6]. The main risk factor that could result in the development of an angiosarcoma is the lack of lymphatic drainage after axillary dissection due to radiation therapy [6]. Schreiber et al. [7] confirmed the role of chronic edema in vascular carcinogenesis. Other cofactors could be the mutation of a tumor suppressor gene p53 [2, 8]. The lymphatic stasis could cause anomaly traffic immunocompetent cells in the affected region as well as immune dysfunction in chronic lymphedema. The period between the onset of lymphedema and the STS's lesions was reported to vary between five and 11 years [9]. In our case the latency period was 13 years, which corresponds to identified publications. In 90% of the cases of STS, lesions occur on the upper left limb [10]. Lesions appear in descending order: in the arm, forearm, wrist, and anterior thorax. This corresponded to our case. Many series reported that the lesions had bluish hematoma aspect and were followed by the appearance of red or blue nodules surrounded by an ecchymosis halo. Chopra et al. [11] have diagnosed the tumor by magnetic resonance and have reported the usefulness of the MRI for evaluation of lesion's depth and orientation for biopsies. If there is a clinical suspicion of STS, a surgical biopsy is needed to confirm the angiosarcoma diagnosis and rule out others such as breast cancer and skin metastases Kaposi's sarcoma. If the standard histological examination is sufficient, it can be completed by immunohistochemistry in order to confirm the epithelial nature of the tumor cells. In our observation, the immunohistochemistry examination of the tumor confirmed the cutaneous angiomatous nature of the lesion by the use of specific markers (CD31, CD34, and AC Antifactor VIII), thus ruling out cutaneous metastases diagnosis [12]. There is no standard treatment for STS but surgery and radiotherapy are often recommended. In terms of surgery, the wide excision aims at obtaining a free safety margin of any residual tumor as mentioned by Noguchi et al. [13]. Other older publications propose more radical surgery with amputation of the limb or even a dislocation of the shoulder, but that procedure is not consensual [12, 14]. No significant difference in survival between the two techniques was observed in a literature review on 166 cases of STS [15]. In our case, the dislocation of the left shoulder was performed rather than the amputation. Radiation therapy is an option as it has demonstrated efficacy, while other authors [16, 17] propose it in a neoadjuvant process. The use of chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil, methotrexate, bleomycin, and/or a combination of actinomycin D, vincristine, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide has shown beneficial effects [18, 19]. Our patient received an adjuvant chemotherapy with only two drugs (5-fluorouracil, methotrexate). The aggressive nature of the STS and the high risk of recurrence inevitably result in extension to the limb, the chest wall, and pleura and this has been observed in our patient. Considering the diagnosis delay of these tumors, the high rate of local recurrence, and the rapid onset of metastases, survival is poor with a median of 19 to 30 months after diagnosis [20-22]. The five-year survival is almost 10% in spite of the various treatment modalities [21]. Our patient died after eight months of the beginning of symptoms despite a radical surgery follow-up by a chemotherapy. 4. Conclusion Stewart-Treves angiosarcoma is a rare and aggressive tumor with poor prognosis; therefore, it is necessary to stress the importance of regular clinical monitoring for patients affected with chronic lymphedema through preventive measures and biopsies of suspicious lesions in order to have an early diagnosis and good therapeutic management for improved survival. http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2017/4056459 Consent Written informed consent was obtained from the patient's family for publication of this paper and any accompanying images.

Lymphatic dysfunction means the lymphatic system is working poorly. The lymphatic system is made up of lymph nodes and lymph vessels that drain fluids from your body’s tissues. The fluids carry toxins, immune cells, and waste products to your lymph nodes. Lymph vessels help maintain fluid balance in the body by returning filtered lymph fluid back to the bloodstream. A poorly working lymphatic system causes tissues to become swollen with fluid. This is called lymphedema. It commonly results in swelling in your arms or legs. Other parts of the body can be affected, too. You can be born with a lymphatic problem that causes lymphedema. This is called hereditary or primary lymphedema. It can also result from a variety of complex genetic conditions. You can also develop lymphedema from a disease complication or injury. This is called secondary lymphedema. It’s a common side effect of cancer treatment. Lymphatic dysfunction is a chronic condition for most people, but treatments are available to manage it and find relief. There are several different causes of hereditary (primary) and secondary lymphatic dysfunction. Hereditary lymphedema is also known as primary lymphedema. It’s less common than secondary lymphedema. You’re more likely to have hereditary lymphedema if a also has it. One type of hereditary lymphedema is known as Milroy disease. It can cause the structures that make up your lymphatic system to form incorrectly. Meige disease is another form of lymphedema also believed to be hereditary. However, the exact genetic change hasn’t been identified yet. Treatment for breast cancer with a mastectomy is one of the most common causes of secondary lymphedema. Surgeons often remove lymph tissue from under the arm when they’re removing . Fluids draining from the arm must pass through the armpit. If are removed from this area, lymphatic dysfunction and swelling in the arm can occur. and can also cause lymphedema to develop. Tumors and scar tissue from radiation and surgery can lead to damage and injury to the lymphatic system. Lymphedema can after treating cancers of the head and neck. It can lead to swelling of the face, eyes, neck, and lips. What are the signs and symptoms of lymphatic dysfunction? The main sign of lymphatic dysfunction is lymphedema. Lymphedema causes swelling in your arms or . Your or may retain fluid and swell. The tissues of the head and neck may be affected, too. The swelling can limit your . You may experience heaviness or a dull ache in the affected area. Lymphedema can also lead to: In the head and neck, lymphedema can affect vision and cause ear pain and nasal congestion. It can problems with: People with congenital lymphatic dysfunction may show symptoms in early childhood. It can also occur with the onset of or in adulthood, even beyond . Symptoms of secondary lymphedema can appear any time after surgery. Most symptoms will appear within several months to a few years after surgery. However, it can also be significantly delayed. What complications are associated with lymphatic dysfunction? Certain infections may occur along with lymphedema, such as or . Cellulitis is a type of bacterial . This is related to the skin changes that often go along with lymphedema, allowing bacteria to access deeper tissues. Lymphangitis can be due to a bacterial, viral, or fungal infection of the lymph vessels. Symptoms of infection include a streaky or blotchy red patch on the affected area. Other common symptoms include: Your doctor will perform a and ask you about your medical history. Your doctor may order imaging tests if they suspect lymphatic dysfunction. One possible test is a lymphangiogram. It’s a type of that uses contrast dye to help show the path of your lymph nodes and lymph vessels more clearly. Your doctor will often inject the dye into a vein between your toes. The dye may also be injected in the groin area. The X-ray images can reveal abnormalities in your lymphatic drainage system. An MRI may be used in place of traditional X-ray. Lymphedema is commonly classified into stages based on its : ) No visible changes are seen, but you may notice changes in sensation, often with achiness or tightness. Swelling in the affected area can change throughout the day. Tissue will hold an indentation when you press on it (pitting edema). There are no permanent changes in the skin. There’s an irreversible swelling where your tissue feels spongy to the touch. Inflammation and thickening of the skin occurs. There’s ongoing fluid retention. The affected area hardens and becomes very large. Skin changes are permanent, and there’s often loss of function. The goals of treatment are to reduce swelling early and as much as possible and to retain range of motion and function of the affected area. Compression is an important treatment for lymphedema. Compressing the affected limb encourages the lymphatic fluids to move toward your torso and out of the arm or leg in a more normal pattern of circulation. Wrapping your arm or leg firmly with an elastic bandage or wearing a compression garment keeps continuous pressure on the swollen area. This brings down the size of the limb, decreases stress on the skin, and improves mobility. Compression garments are specially designed socks, stockings, or sleeves that have a snug fit over the swollen limb. Your doctor may suggest buying compression garments of a certain grade or level of compression. The grade or level will depend on the severity of swelling. Standard compression garments are available at most pharmacies and drugstores. Levels of compression are measured in pressures of mm Hg (millimeters of mercury). The more compression you need, the higher the pressure should be. Although there’s no industry standard, these are some measurements: Gradient compression is most often recommended. It can be built into a slip-on stocking or sleeve or achieved through a self-applied wrap. Gradient compression is designed so that it’s tightest at the furthest point of the arm or leg and becomes gradually looser further up the limb. If built-in gradient compression garments aren’t available, a lymphedema specialist can show you how to use layers of wrapping to accomplish the same effect. Tighter, more narrow wrapping with lots of overlap starts at the further point. Looser, wider, and less overlap are done as the wrapping moves further up the limb. Shop for compression , , or . Another form of compression therapy is called pneumatic compression. Pneumatic compression involves vests or sleeves that are timed to inflate and deflate to stimulate the proper flow of lymphatic fluid. Exercise can help manage lymphatic dysfunction. Your muscles contract during exercise. These contractions put pressure on your lymph vessels. This helps fluid move through the vessels and reduces swelling. Experts in lymphedema recommend a variety of exercises to help manage the condition: Simple range of motion exercises, such as knee bends or wrist rotations, are designed to maintain flexibility and mobility. Light repetitive exercises can also stop fluid from pooling in your arms or legs. Try walking, doing , or low-impact aerobics like . Aim for 20 to 30 minutes of exercise most days of the week. Speak with your doctor before starting an exercise routine. It’s common to recommend comprehensive decongestive therapy (CDT) for the treatment of lymphedema. This includes several components, some already mentioned above: Lymphatic drainage massage, also known as manual lymphatic drainage, is a type of massage therapy performed by a qualified lymphedema professional. Manipulating tissues allows the lymph fluids to drain more freely. How often manual lymphatic drainage is required depends on the severity, location of swelling, and how much movement of the area is tolerated. It often starts out five days a week for three to eight weeks, then is performed as frequently as necessary to maintain improvement. You can also receive training from a professional to . Don’t undergo manual drainage if you have cellulitis or other types of skin infections or skin breakdown. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved low-level laser therapy for treating lymphedema related to breast cancer. It’s recommended that a physical therapist or other health professional specializing in lymphedema apply this treatment. have found it can be effective in lessening swelling, pain and size of the limb. Liposuction can be effective in cases of more advanced stages of lymphedema when other treatment options haven’t helped. have found it can decrease limb size, improve function, well-being, and quality of life. However, following the procedure, it’s still necessary to the use compression garments to keep swelling down. Lymphedema that happens along with a bacterial infection will be treated first with antibiotics. Antibiotics can help control pain and swelling. They also help prevent the infection from spreading. What’s the long-term outlook for people with lymphatic dysfunction? Your outlook depends on the stage, location, and cause of lymphedema, as well as your overall health. Lymphedema is an ongoing condition that requires ongoing care. In most cases, you’ll deal with some level of swelling on a regular basis, but it can be managed. It’s important to work with a healthcare team of lymphedema specialists that include physical therapists and surgical and medical specialists. The best way to deal with lymphedema is to use a combination of treatments and management techniques. — — Medically reviewed by Debra Rose Wilson, Ph.D., MSN, R.N., IBCLC, AHN-BC, CHT If you've ever had a surgery on your lymph nodes, your doctor may have suggested lymphatic drainage massage.

Given the abundance of breast cancer data, this review will focus on breast cancer–related lymphedema. However, the principles and controversies discussed are relevant regardless of the type of malignancy to which the lymphedema is attributed. Lymphedema is a feared complication of cancer treatment and one that negatively impacts survivorship. The incidence of breast cancer–related lymphedema ranges from 6% to 70%, but lymphedema may be a common and under-reported morbidity. No standard guidelines for its diagnosis and assessment exist. Although the true etiology of lymphedema remains unknown, radiation, chemotherapy, type of breast surgery, and extent of axillary surgery are commonly cited risk factors. However, the relationship between the number of nodes removed and the risk of lymphedema is not clearly correlated. Clinical trials are focusing on ways to reduce the need for axillary dissection even in the setting of a positive sentinel node, to help minimize axillary morbidity. Risk-reduction practices, including avoidance of skin puncture and blood pressures in the ipsilateral upper extremity, and precautionary behaviors such as wearing compression garments during air travel continue to be advocated by the medical and survivor communities, despite a lack of rigorous evidence supporting their benefit. Emerging data support exercise in at-risk and affected women with lymphedema when started gradually and increased cautiously. The most recent survivorship data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database demonstrate a significant increase in the number of US cancer survivors over the last 30 years, from roughly 3 million in 1973 to nearly 12 million in 2008.[1] As a result, issues of survivorship have stimulated new focus for clinical trials, not only to determine the most effective therapeutic regimen (surgery, drug, or radiation) but also to identify the one with the least influence on future quality of life. Lymphedema has long been a feared complication of surgical cancer treatment, and notably one that negatively impacts survivorship. Fear of lymphedema stems from patient concerns regarding the chronic, progressive nature of the condition and the clinician’s relative inability to predict or prevent its development. Furthermore, decades of physician and allied health teachings based on opinion and theory have perpetuated the myths shrouding lymphedema risk, prevention, and treatment. A vast body of literature documents the occurrence of breast cancer–related lymphedema, with more than 1400 articles indexed in PubMed-MEDLINE databases alone. Importantly, lymphedema also exists after surgery for non–breast-cancer-related malignancies, but data documenting this occurrence are rare in comparison. Recently, Cormier et al found only 47 studies between 1972 and 2008 with more than 10 patients that prospectively evaluated lymphedema as a primary or secondary outcome after treatment for melanoma, bladder, sarcoma, penile, prostate, vulvar, cervical, endometrial, or head and neck cancers.[2] The authors’ analysis of these studies demonstrated the overall incidence of lymphedema to be 16.3% after melanoma, 10.1% after genitourinary cancers, and 19.6% after gynecologic malignancies, and notes that lymphedema rates are higher when the lower rather than upper extremity is affected. Given the abundance of breast cancer data, this review will focus on breast cancer–related lymphedema. However, the principles and controversies discussed are relevant regardless of the type of malignancy to which the lymphedema is attributed. The incidence of breast cancer–related lymphedema has been difficult to quantify due to delayed onset of symptoms and the lack of standardized diagnostic criteria. A recent meta-analysis reports the incidence of breast cancer–related lymphedema to range from 0 to 3% after lumpectomy alone to as high as 65% to 70% after modified radical mastectomy (removal of breast and axillary lymph nodes) with regional nodal radiation.[3] Overall, 80% to 90% of women who will develop lymphedema do so within 3 years of treatment,[4,5] but the risk persists years later as the remaining 10% to 20% will develop lymphedema at a rate of 1% per year.[5] Petrek et al followed 263 patients and found that nearly 50% developed lymphedema by 20 years.[5] These data suggest that lymphedema is probably more common than generally reported, and clearly the length of follow-up in a given study influences the reported incidence. A uniform definition of lymphedema does not exist. Although volume displacement methods are considered the gold standard for diagnosis, these methods are cumbersome and unable to identify subclinical lymphedema. Thus, displacement methods are rarely used in clinical settings. Circumferential arm measurements performed with a nonelastic tape measure are commonly used to determine upper extremity size differences. It is essential to obtain baseline preoperative measurements of the ipsilateral and contralateral extremities, as differences of up to 2 cm may naturally exist between the dominant and nondominant arms at baseline.[6] Published literature demonstrates significant heterogeneity, as studies lack agreement on the location and minimal number of measurements performed. Furthermore, they use multiple definitions of what constitutes lymphedema, including measurement changes greater than 2 cm, volume increase of more than 200 mL, or percentage increases in volume (> 10% or > 20%) compared with baseline when controlled for changes in the contralateral arm.[7,8] Aside from objective measurements, some studies define lymphedema by patient subjective symptoms or patient perceptions of swelling. Controversy remains as to whether a measurement change or a patient’s perception of swelling should be considered diagnostic. While a measurement change is objective, measurements may be affected by inter-rater and even intra-rater variability affecting reproducibility. Perhaps more importantly, a defined measurement change may be asymptomatic in an obese patient, while a thin woman may be bothered by more subtle measurement changes not meeting measured criteria for lymphedema. Alternatively, a patient’s perception of swelling may more accurately diagnose symptomatic lymphedema, but this perception may be influenced by sensory changes from the surgery and additional adjuvant therapies. Further, women with surgery in their dominant arm may perceive functional issues to a greater degree than if it were the nondominant arm that was affected.[9] In fact, one study found only 41% of women with perceived swelling had circumferential arm measurement changes greater than 2 cm, the objective threshold used in the study to define lymphedema.[9] Several contemporary studies have evaluated the differences between measured and perceived lymphedema and have validated patient perceptions against physical therapist–directed measurements.[4,10] These studies conclude that each evaluation method is valid but not interchangeable, and they do not endorse one method over another. The clinical introduction of a single-frequency bioelectrical impedance device manufactured by Impedimed (Mansfield, Australia) can minimize both inter-rater and intra-rater variability seen with other measurement techniques. The device produces easily interpretable values measuring the changes in extracellular fluid when compared with the unaffected contralateral upper extremity. A score increase of 10 or more or one that registers outside the normal range should prompt intervention with a compression garment or a referral for physical therapy. Some investigators report that measurement of bioimpedance has improved sensitivity in detecting subclinical lymphedema up to 4 months prior to standard measurement changes.[11] For these reasons, the current National Lymphedema Network (NLN) breast cancer–related lymphedema guidelines recommend that all breast cancer patients receive pre- and post-treatment measurements (of any type) on both arms and encourage the use of bioimpedance spectroscopy or infrared perometry as alternatives to tape measures, to limit measurement variations.[12] Over the years, many retrospective studies have reported risk factors for lymphedema. Axillary node dissection (ALND), mastectomy, obesity, radiation, infection, and ipsilateral upper extremity injury consistently rank as the most influential causes of damage or disruption to the lymphatic system and thus lymphedema. However, the magnitude of association between breast cancer treatment factors and lymphedema is inconsistent across studies.[8] Tsai et al reviewed 98 studies conducted in the United States and Canada through January 2008 for lymphedema risk factors.[8] The authors report a significantly increased risk for lymphedema in women undergoing mastectomy compared with lumpectomy (risk ratio [RR], 1.42; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.15–1.76), ALND compared with no dissection (RR, 3.47; CI, 2.34–5.15), ALND compared with sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) (RR, 3.07; CI, 2.20–4.29), radiation therapy vs no radiation therapy (RR, 1.92; CI, 1.61–2.28), and positive vs negative axillary lymph nodes (RR, 1.54; CI, 1.32–1.80). While this meta-analysis demonstrates a comprehensive, contemporary review of lymphedema risk factors, the heterogeneity of the data must be considered, as 11 different definitions for lymphedema were used and follow-up ranged between 1 month and 30 years. Though the most intuitively obvious risk factor for lymphedema is the number of nodes removed, the relationship between the number of lymph nodes removed and the risk of lymphedema remains unresolved. Several retrospective studies have shown that the number of nodes removed and the risk of lymphedema do not correlate.[13,14] Others find an increasing risk of lymphedema as more nodes are removed.[15-17] Despite various lengths of follow-up, from 6 to 60 months, the prospective trials vetting SLNB as the standard of care for axillary staging demonstrate significantly reduced rates of lymphedema after SLNB (0 to 7%) compared with ALND (12% to 16%).[18-21] These studies certainly support the concept that the risk of lymphedema is proportional to the extent of axillary surgery. Importantly, though, they also confirm that even with SLNB a small but clear risk of lymphedema remains. A recent study by Goldberg et al suggests that it is not the number of lymph nodes removed but instead the degree of dissection and disruption of the lymphatic system that results in lymphedema.[22] The authors reviewed 600 women having SLNB with a median follow-up of 5 years and found an overall incidence of lymphedema of 5%. When stratifying the data according to the number of nodes removed, they found no significant association between the mean, median, or range of number of nodes excised and lymphedema ( = .93). Furthermore, the authors completed a subset analysis of the women having more than 10 lymph nodes removed at SLNB. None of these women developed lymphedema. Interestingly, when these SLNB patients having > 10 nodes removed were compared with a separate group of women having 10 to 17 nodes removed at ALND, 11% of the ALND patients had measured lymphedema ( = .04). The fact that women having more than 10 nodes removed during SLNB did not develop lymphedema but women with the same number of nodes removed after ALND did reaffirms that the relationship between the nodes removed and lymphedema is complex. Perhaps it is the relative magnitude of lymphatic destruction and individual patient ability to form collateral lymphatic channels, rather than the number of nodes removed, that influences lymphedema risk. For example, a patient with many nodes removed at SLNB and no finding of lymphedema may have more lymphatic collaterals and therefore will have suffered relatively less lymphatic disruption despite a larger than “normal” number of SLNs removed. On the other hand, women having ALND and a relatively small number of total nodes excised may have suffered an overall greater degree of lymphatic disruption and therefore develop lymphedema. Unfortunately, the number of nodes within each patient’s nodal basin and the patient’s ability to protect or form new lymphatic collaterals during or after treatments is unknown. Therefore, simply the number of nodes removed may be insufficient to determine lymphedema risk. If, however, the degree of lymphatic disruption or damage is the key driver of lymphedema risk, then it is plausible that radiation can also act primarily or synergistically to influence lymphedema risk. Axillary radiation alone is not without complications, as these patients can have a 2- to 4.5-fold increase in the risk of lymphedema. A recent meta-analysis by Shah and Vicini finds lymphedema in 9% to 65% of patients after lumpectomy alone (no nodal surgery) and regional nodal radiation and in 58% to 65% of women after mastectomy alone and regional nodal radiation.[3] Additionally, the synergistic effect of surgery and radiation is well documented to result in a 3.5- to 10-fold higher risk of lymphedema when compared with surgery alone.[3,23,24] Finally, accumulating data suggest that chemotherapy may also affect lymphatic destruction. Norman et al found anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimens increase the risk of lymphedema.[25] Their prospective review of 631 breast cancer survivors followed for 5 years found an elevated hazard ratio (HR) of 1.46 (95% CI, 1.04–2.04) for lymphedema among breast cancer patients receiving anthracycline-based chemotherapy vs no chemotherapy. This risk persisted after stratifying for stage at diagnosis or number of positive nodes. Furthermore, the authors concluded that treatment combinations involving ALND or chemotherapy resulted in approximately four- to five-fold increases in the HRs for lymphedema (HR, 4.16 [95% CI, 1.32–12.45]for SLNB/chemotherapy/no radiation)compared with no treatment. While further validation of this finding is needed, the concept that chemotherapy independently influences lymphedema risk demonstrates that this risk can be affected not only by locally directed therapies but also by systemic ones.[25] Changes in the surgical management of the axilla have been instrumental in reducing axillary morbidity, especially lymphedema. SLNB is now the standard of care for axillary staging, as its accuracy, low false-negative rate, and low rate of axillary recurrence have been documented in more than 70 studies. Current research to further minimize morbidity from axillary surgery focuses on reducing the need for completion axillary dissection in the setting of a positive axillary node. The American College of Surgeons (ACOSOG) Z0011 trial published in early 2011 documents the first prospective randomized data showing that at a median of 6 years follow-up, SLNB alone does not result in inferior survival in women with T1 or T2 tumors and one or two positive sentinel nodes who received breast conservation surgery, chemotherapy and/or hormonal therapy, and whole breast radiation therapy.[26] In the study, more than 70% of the women with a positive SLNB had no additional positive nodes, suggesting that in select cases SLNB can be both diagnostic and therapeutic. While this trial is viewed as practice-changing, it is important to note that the trial called for standard whole breast radiation but did not standardize the radiation tangents other than to say that third field–directed axillary radiation was forbidden. As a result it is possible that radiation tangents were adjusted higher in node-positive women who were randomized to the SLNB-only arm. If standard radiation tangents cover approximately 30% to 50% of the level I and 25% of the level II axillary nodes,[27] then adjusting the tangents “higher” has the intention of covering more nodes than standard. These data are important from the perspective of morbidity, as an adjustment in the tangents may result in increased rates of axillary morbidity above what is seen with standard whole breast tangents and SLNB alone. The radiation ports are currently being evaluated retrospectively. An additional prospective trial, ACOSOG Z1071, is evaluating the validity, accuracy, and false-negative rate of SLNB after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in women who present with node-positive disease at diagnosis. The investigators hypothesize that SLNB after neoadjuvant chemotherapy will appropriately and reliably stage the axilla and therefore allow elimination of ALND in women converted by neoadjuvant chemotherapy from node-positive to node-negative status. The trial accrued quickly and results are pending. Remaining questions to be answered include that of which women may be able to forgo axillary surgery (SLNB or ALND) altogether. As long as axillary surgery and/or radiation remain pillars of breast cancer treatment, lymphedema will remain a potential complication. Risk-reduction practices to further prevent lymphedema after axillary surgery have long been advised. It is here that many of the myths regarding lymphedema risk and prevention arise. The National Lymphedema Network, founded in 1988, seeks to educate and guide patients and healthcare providers about lymphedema and risk-reduction practices for those at risk for and affected by the disorder. The organization publishes guidelines on risk-reducing behaviors and seeks to answer the question of whether behavioral modifications can further limit or reduce lymphedema. The NLN’s risk-reduction guidelines were updated in 2011 and continue to carry a disclaimer stating that “there is little evidence-based literature regarding many of these practices, [therefore] the majority of the recommendations must at this time be based on the knowledge of pathophysiology and decades of clinical experience by experts in the field.”[12] Although the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and the National Cancer Institute (NCI) do not publish specific guidelines regarding lymphedema diagnosis, treatment, or prevention, the NCCN and NCI websites for patients both describe and define lymphedema and endorse precautionary behaviors similar to those recommended by the NLN.[28,29] The primary goal of the risk-reducing measures is to prevent overload of the lymphatic system by limiting activities that may increase lymphatic flow, local blood flow, or metabolic waste products in the at-risk or affected limb. The recommended behaviors support activity, medical procedure, and lifestyle modifications. Although the lymphedema risk-reduction strategies promulgated by these national organizations are based on sound physiologic principles, the effect of each recommended measure on preventing lymphedema is unclear, as is the impact on one’s quality of life if these measures are followed. Although Boccardo et al documented that increased education and awareness can reduce the incidence of lymphedema,[30] it is also possible that increased education can influence patient anxiety. One study reviewed factors affecting patients’ intention to avoid strenuous activity by following 175 women for a median of 10 months after axillary surgery. The authors found women given advice on arm care and those with perceived vulnerability regarding, and fear of, lymphedema were more likely to avoid using their arm (odds ratio [OR], 4.9; 95% CI, 1.73–14.06; = .003; and OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.18–2.16, = .003, respectively). Interestingly, however, the extent of axillary surgery did not influence the women’s arm use (OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 0.56–3.11; = .52).[31] Several additional inconsistencies exist regarding risk-reduction behaviors. First, standardized advice does not meet the needs of all patients, especially given that the recommendations do not always differentiate between at-risk and affected individuals. Second, there is inconsistent application of the practices across disease sites. While these recommendations are frequently discussed in relation to breast cancer treatment, they are rarely discussed within the context of other malignancies that require lymph node assessment or treatment. Further, many additional patients annually undergo lymph node excision for diagnosis of lymphoma or infection. Ironically, they leave the hospital without having discussed future lymphedema risk with their physicians, despite having a number of lymph nodes removed that is comparable to that of a patient undergoing SLNB for breast cancer. Third, there is still debate over what constitutes a risk-reducing practice. Patients recognize these controversies, given that they frequently receive inadequate or conflicting advice regarding arm care.[31] Summary of Frequently Recommended Precautionary Behaviors Corresponding to Theoretical Risk Factors and Supporting or Refuting Evidence Despite these inconsistencies, breast cancer survivors have adopted many of the existing lymphedema risk–reducing practices. A prospective study of nearly 1000 breast cancer survivors found that patients having ALND practice a mean of 5.1 risk-reducing behaviors, while those having SLNB follow 4.3.[9] Although this difference was statistically significant (P < .0001), one could argue that it is not clinically significant. For example, more than 98% of women who have undergone ALND avoid blood pressures, intravenous catheter placement, and needle sticks in the ipsilateral arm, while more than 80% of SLNB patients do the same without documented benefit and theoretically less risk than those having ALND. Examination of the recommended risk-reducing behaviors reveals few objective data for or against each measure. The data regarding commonly considered precautionary behaviors are summarized in Table 1. An in-depth review of the role of compression garments when flying, and of IV placement, needle sticks, blood pressures, and exercise, follows. The physiologic theory supporting the role of compression garments during air travel stems from the low cabin pressure that exists during flight, which causes a decrease in extracellular fluid pressure. This pressure decrease facilitates escape of fluid and proteins from the lymphatic vasculature, resulting in lymphedema. A literature review finds only a single retrospective survey–based study of patients with lymphedema published more than 15 years ago, in which 27 of 490 (5.5%) patients surveyed link the onset or worsening of their lymphedema to an airplane flight. The authors of this study cited lowered cabin pressure as the cause but do note the lack of direct evidence.[32] Based on this report and its suggested physiologic premise, at-risk and affected patients are recommended to wear a compression garment, to help regulate the extracellular pressure and support the lymphatic musculature maintaining lymphatic flow.[12] Limited contemporary data, however, do not appear to support these findings or the use of compression garments. Graham et al retrospectively surveyed 287 at-risk survivors regarding air travel.[33] Overall, 50% of them traveled a mean of five flights, and of this group 86% practiced precautionary behaviors consisting of routine use of compression garments with or without other behaviors. The authors observed no difference in lymphedema rates between fliers and nonfliers ( = .42), but interestingly they found the practice of precautionary behaviors to be associated with an increased risk of lymphedema (OR, 6.2; 95% CI, 1.2–20.8; < .04) among those flying. Furthermore, when analyzed independently, the use of compression garments appeared not to correlate with other suspected lymphedema risk factors, including nodal disease, number of nodes removed, or radiation. They concluded that garments were not necessary and might be counterproductive.[32] Kilbreath et al drew similar conclusions after they prospectively evaluated 72 women preflight and 6 weeks after planned international or transcontinental air travel. Bioimpedance analysis in one study found no difference in extracellular fluid content between baseline and follow-up, regardless of flight distance or compression garment use. Despite their short follow-up and the fact that the women followed were athletes (which may have a protective effect), the authors concluded that air travel did not cause lymphedema.[34] Another long-supported myth regarding prevention of lymphedema is the avoidance of IV catheters or needle sticks. The theory behind this practice arises from the possible risk of infection produced by accidental and nonaccidental skin punctures and is less concerned with the actual puncture itself. Infection will cause an intense inflammatory response, altering the extremity fluid homeostasis. Despite the longevity of this landmark recommendation, a review of the literature finds only one article supporting the practice. Clark et al prospectively followed 188 women for lymphedema and measured them at baseline, 6 months, and 3 years after axillary surgery. At 3 years, patients were also questioned about skin punctures. Overall, 39 (21%) had lymphedema at 3 years.[35] Among other risk factors, univariate analysis found skin puncture for IV catheter insertion, venipuncture for blood draw, or finger stick for blood glucose testing were associated with a significant increased risk for lymphedema, with a risk ratio of 2.44 (95% CI, 1.33–4.47). These data should be interpreted cautiously; 18 of 188 (9.5%) reported remembering any type of skin puncture, and of these 18 women only 8 had lymphedema at the 3-year follow-up. Patients with lymphedema may be more likely to recall previous skin puncture than those without symptoms. Hand surgery ipsilateral to the side of prior axillary surgery could be considered a severe form of skin puncture, lending relevance to the IV and venipuncture question. A small number of studies in the hand surgery literature address this occurrence. Dawson et al reported on 15 women undergoing carpel tunnel release ipsilateral to the side of prior axillary dissection; none had a post–hand surgery infection, new onset of lymphedema, or worsening of existing lymphedema symptoms.[36] In a second series, Hershko and Stahl retrospectively reviewed all hand surgeries performed between 1983 and 2002 and identified only 25 women with 1-year follow-up, of whom 4 had lymphedema at the time of hand surgery and 21 did not. Lymphedema was determined by patient perception only and noted to be worse after surgery in 2 women, each of whom had pre-existing lymphedema. The authors noted no progression or new symptoms in the remaining 23 women. Interestingly, they did not use preoperative antibiotics on any patient, performed 24 of 25 surgeries under local anesthesia, and used a tourniquet in all cases.[37] Gharbaoui et al surveyed the members of the American Society for Surgery of the Hand.[38] Among the 606 surgeons returning the surveys, more than 95% said they have willingly performed hand surgery on patients with a history of ipsilateral lymphadenectomy, radiation, or both. Surgeon willingness to operate decreases if lymphedema is present but remains quite high at 85%. Overall, 94% and 74% of surgeons routinely use tourniquets in women without and with lymphedema, respectively. Surgeon recollection identified fewer complications of infection, lymphedema, or delayed wound healing among patients without lymphedema (3% vs 23%). These three studies offer marginal data and anecdotal reports at best about the safety of ipsilateral skin puncture as they are all retrospective with small numbers, are fraught with recall bias, and lack any objective measurements. Despite this, each study calls for re-evaluation of the skin puncture guidelines as they relate to lymphedema risk. Perhaps the authors should also conclude that re-evaluation of the ipsilateral blood pressure guidelines is warranted, as their data demonstrated a clear willingness to use tourniquets with minimal reported morbidity. No documented studies to date have reviewed the recommendation to avoid ipsilateral blood pressure measurements. Clearly, these conclusions must be interpreted with caution, and further study is warranted. While the recommendations to wear compression garments while flying, and to avoid IV sticks, venipuncture, and blood pressures are made with good intention and based on sound physiologic principles, few rigorous data support them. Unfortunately, though, without good scientific data supporting or refuting these practices, both clinicians and patients are still faced with the clinical dilemma of whether or not they should encourage or disregard these behaviors. Finally, exercise has historically been discouraged for breast cancer survivors, based on the belief that it would increase metabolic waste and extracellular fluid accumulation in the extremity, causing lymphedema. Over the last 5 years, the recommendation to avoid exercise has been challenged. Aside from recommended flexibility and remedial exercises used to reduce arm swelling and promote mobility during lymphedema treatment, exercise consists of resistance exercises (weight lifting), aerobic exercise, or a combination of both. Robust data support the value of resistance exercise in both at-risk and affected women. In fact, five of six randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published between 2006 and 2010 found weight lifting to be associated with minimal risk of developing or exacerbating lymphedema.[39] The largest study with the longest follow-up is the physical activity and lymphedema trial (PAL) that followed 141 women with breast cancer–related lymphedema. Patients were randomized to either weight training while wearing a compression sleeve, which was supervised twice weekly, or to a control group who were asked not to alter their exercise level. At 1-year follow-up, the authors found no increase in lymphedema in the intervention group and, further, found fewer and less severe lymphedema exacerbations in the weight training group.[40] The follow-up study evaluating weight training in at-risk survivors also found no difference in lymphedema rates between the two groups but interestingly found that among women with more than five nodes removed, those in the weight training group were significantly less likely to develop lymphedema than those in the control group (7% vs 22%, = .003).[41] Based on these data, the NLN now supports the safety of resistance exercises in a controlled manner, starting with small weights, low repetition, and gradual progression.[12] In general, compression garments should be worn during exercise in women with lymphedema and considered on an individual basis for women at risk for lymphedema. A recent meta-analysis reviewed seven studies evaluating aerobic exercise in people with lymphedema.[39] Among the three randomized controlled trials and the four literature reviews, aerobic exercise or the combination of resistance and aerobic exercise did not trigger lymphedema or increase its incidence. Despite the relative agreement between the studies, the meta-analysis cautions that the benefits of aerobic exercise should be weighed against potential harms, as the data were not robust. Specifically, only one of three RCTs had more than 50 patients, but it was hampered by a trial adherence rate of only 70%.[42] Although aerobic exercises appear safe, additional well-designed studies with larger numbers and longer follow-up are needed. As long as evaluation and treatment of the axilla are necessary, lymphedema will continue to be a potential morbidity. It is hoped that the move towards personalized medicine, by individualizing surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy regimens, will help to reduce the incidence of treatment morbidities, including lymphedema. Until the risk of lymphedema is eliminated, however, risk-reduction practices will remain a consideration for all breast cancer survivors. Clinicians should recognize that patients are not at equal risk for lymphedema and that data do not support a standardized approach nor allow for complete disregard of risk-reduction behaviors. Exercise in a monitored fashion is likely to be safe in all survivors, and the recommendation not to exercise appears to be the only myth surrounding lymphedema that has been scientifically disproven.

c7eec525-ced7-476e-9e06-78a5d864e95f,"Lymphedema is swelling that occurs when protein-rich lymph fluid accumulates in the interstitial tissue. This lymph fluid may contain plasma proteins, extravascular blood cells, excess water, and parenchymal products.[] Lymphedema is one of the most poorly understood, relatively underestimated, and least researched complications of cancer or its treatment. The Institute of Medicine of the National Academies published a report in 2006 recommending a “survivorship care plan” for cancer patients that incorporates information about late effects of treatment, health management behaviors, disease management, and recurrence monitoring.[] The Institute of Medicine also highlighted critical shortfalls in the transition to survivorship, particularly in providing education about late effects of treatment. Lymphedema is an important consideration for clinicians who care for cancer patients because of its relatively high frequency and significant functional and quality of life implications for patients. Lymphedema is an independent predictor of decreased quality of life, even when other predictive factors such as socioeconomic status, decreased range of motion, age, and obesity are taken into account.[] This summary will review issues related to anatomy and pathophysiology of lymphedema related to cancer, its clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment. Primary (congenital) lymphedema and non–cancer-related lymphedema (e.g., recurrent cellulitis, connective tissue disease, and infection) will not be reviewed here. In this summary, unless otherwise stated, evidence and practice issues as they relate to adults are discussed. The evidence and application to practice related to children may differ significantly from information related to adults. When specific information about the care of children is available, it is summarized under its own heading. Anatomy and Pathophysiology of the Lymphatic System The human lymphatic system generally includes superficial or primary lymphatic vessels that form a complex dermal network of capillarylike channels that drain into larger, secondary lymphatic vessels located in the subdermal space. These primary and secondary lymphatic vessels parallel the superficial veins and drain into a deeper third layer of lymphatic vessels located in the subcutaneous fat adjacent to the fascia. A muscular wall and numerous valves aid active, unidirectional lymphatic flow in secondary and subcutaneous lymphatic vessels. Primary lymphatic vessels lack a muscular wall and do not have valves. An intramuscular system of lymphatic vessels that parallels the deep arteries and drains the muscular compartment, joints, and synovium also exists. The superficial and deep lymphatic systems probably function independently, except in abnormal states, although there is evidence that they communicate near lymph nodes.[] Lymph drains from the lower limbs into the lumbar lymphatic trunk, which joins the intestinal lymphatic trunk and cisterna chyli to form the thoracic duct that empties into the left subclavian vein. The lymphatic vessels of the left arm drain into the left subclavian lymphatic trunk and then into the left subclavian vein. Lymph channels of the right arm drain into the right subclavian lymphatic trunk and then into the right subclavian vein. One function of the lymphatic system is to return excess fluid and protein from interstitial spaces to the blood vascular system. Because lymphatic vessels often lack a basement membrane, they can resorb molecules too large for venous uptake. Mechanisms of clinical edema include increased arteriovenous capillary filtration and reduced interstitial fluid absorption. Causes of increased capillary filtration include increased hydrostatic pressure in capillaries, decreased tissue pressure, and increased membrane permeability. Reduced interstitial fluid resorption can be caused by decreased plasma oncotic pressure, increased oncotic pressure of tissue fluid, and lymphatic obstruction. The onset of secondary lymphedema is often insidious. However, it may be suddenly provoked by local inflammation from causes such as infection or limb injury. Therefore, patients should be evaluated for evidence of cellulitis. Classically, lymphedema is characterized by nonpitting swelling of an extremity, usually with involvement of the digits. Early stages of lymphedema manifest with pitting edema until fibrosis develops. The distribution of the swelling may be restricted only in the proximal or distal portion of the limb. Lymphedema may also predispose to recurrent skin infections.[] Lymphedema can and does occur in the trunk, in addition to the limbs. For example, radiation therapy to the chest wall is associated with the development of edema specifically in the irradiated breast.[,] Some reports suggest a lymphedema prevalence rate as high as 75% in patients with cancers of the head and neck, with risk factors being high-dose radiation and combined surgery.[] Patients with lymphedema may report a wide variety of complaints, including heaviness or fullness related to the weight of the limb, a tight sensation of the skin, or decreased flexibility of the affected joint. The texture of the skin may become hyperkeratotic, with verrucous and vesicular skin lesions. With upper-extremity involvement, the patient may have difficulty fitting the affected area into clothing or wearing previously well-fitting rings, watches, or bracelets. Similar difficulties with lower-extremity lymphedema include a sensation of tightness or difficulty wearing shoes, itching of the legs or toes, burning sensation in the legs, or sleep disturbance and loss of hair. Ambulation can be affected because of the increased size and weight of the affected limb. Activities of daily living, hobbies, and the ability to perform previous work tasks may also be affected. Breast cancer survivors with arm lymphedema have been found to be more disabled, experience a poorer quality of life, and have more psychological distress than do survivors without lymphedema.[,] In addition, women reporting swelling have reported significantly lower quality of life with multiple functional assessments.[] Lymphedema can occur after any cancer or its treatment that affects lymph node drainage. It has been reported to occur within days and up to 30 years after treatment for breast cancer.[] Eighty percent of patients experience onset within 3 years of surgery; the remainder develop edema at a rate of 1% per year.[] Upper-extremity lymphedema most often occurs after breast cancer; lower-extremity lymphedema most often occurs with uterine cancer, prostate cancer, lymphoma, or melanoma.[] A large population-based study supports the evidence that lower-limb lymphedema is experienced by a significant proportion of women after treatment for gynecological cancer, with the highest prevalence (36%) among vulvar cancer survivors and the lowest prevalence (5%) among ovarian cancer survivors.[] There is no consistency in the data on the incidence and prevalence of lymphedema after breast cancer, probably because of differences in diagnosis, the different characteristics of the patients studied, and inadequate follow-up to capture delayed development of the disorder. The overall incidence of arm lymphedema can range from 8% to 56% at 2 years postsurgery.[] In a longitudinal substudy of the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group (ACOSOG)/Alliance Z1071 breast cancer trial, patient reports of 3-year cumulative incidence of arm swelling and arm heaviness were actually lower than the objective findings.[] It is important to diagnose and treat lymphedema when it is mild because those with mild lymphedema make up the cohort that gives rise to preventable severe, debilitating lymphedema. Women with mild lymphedema are more than three times as likely to develop severe lymphedema than are women with no lymphedema.[] Patients undergoing axillary surgery and/or axillary radiation therapy for breast cancer are at higher risk for developing lymphedema of the arm. Previous convention suggested that nodal positivity was a predisposing factor for the development of lymphedema in breast cancer patients.[] Controlling for axillary radiation, one study actually found an inverse relationship between nodal positivity and arm volume.[] Compared with axillary sampling alone, partial or total mastectomy followed by full axillary lymph node dissection significantly increases a patient’s chance of developing arm edema. For example, in one series of 100 women who underwent partial or total mastectomy and then full axillary lymph node dissection or axillary sampling, arm edema developed in more patients who underwent axillary lymph node dissection compared with sampling alone (30% vs. none).[] In addition, the extent of axillary lymph node dissection increases the risk for developing arm edema. For example, in one series involving 381 women undergoing segmental mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection, women who had ten or more lymph nodes removed were more likely than women who had few lymph nodes in the specimen to develop arm symptoms within the first year (53% vs. 33%) and within the next 2 years (33% vs. 20%).[] For patients with breast cancer, sentinel lymph node dissection has gained favor over axillary lymph node dissection for the axillary staging of early disease because of decreased morbidity and because of the questionable survival benefits of axillary lymph node dissection, as shown in a phase III randomized study () of axillary lymph node dissection in women who had stage I or IIA breast cancer and a positive sentinel node.[][] Several studies have shown that lymphedema is more prevalent in breast cancer patients who undergo axillary lymph node dissection than in those who undergo sentinel lymph node biopsy.[][] One study evaluated 30 patients with unilateral invasive breast carcinoma who underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy and 30 patients who underwent axillary lymph node dissection. This study found a 20% rate of developing lymphedema in the axillary lymph node dissection group compared with none in the sentinel lymph node biopsy group.[] Rates of lymphedema among women who undergo sentinel lymph node biopsy have been reported to be between 5% and 17%, depending on the diagnostic threshold and length of follow-up.[-] The majority of diagnosed lymphedema is mild.[][] Among all breast cancer patients, being obese or overweight may predispose women to developing lymphedema after treatment for breast cancer.[,][] A well-conducted prospective study followed 138 breast cancer patients for 30 months postdiagnosis. Individuals with body mass indices of 30 or higher at the time of diagnosis were 3.6 times more likely to develop lymphedema, but weight gain after diagnosis was not related.[] Some studies have correlated the degree of lymphedema with the level of obesity.[][] Similarly, among young breast cancer survivors, persistent swelling was related to having more lymph nodes removed and being obese.[] The dose-response relationship between obesity and risk for lymphedema onset is not known. There have also been no studies to determine whether weight loss among patients at risk for developing lymphedema would reduce risk. At this time, it is not possible to advise patients regarding the dose-response relationship of weight loss and risk reduction or the body weight associated with lowest risk of incident lymphedema. Other risk factors for developing lymphedema include the following: Local radiation (axillary, inguinal, pelvic, or supraclavicular regions). Tumor causing lymphatic obstruction of the anterior cervical, thoracic, axillary, pelvic, or abdominal nodes. Scarring of the left or right subclavian lymphatic ducts by either surgery or radiation. Intrapelvic or intra-abdominal tumors that involve or directly compress lymphatic vessels and/or the cisterna chyli and thoracic duct. Roughly one-third of breast cancer patients (and a majority of African Americans with breast cancer) present with regional disease and positive lymph nodes,[] thus requiring complete axillary lymph node dissection; many undergo further irradiation of their axillary and supraclavicular lymph node beds. Lymphedema is a persistent adverse effect of breast cancer treatment that will continue to occur long into the future, despite increasing use of sentinel lymph node biopsy procedures. Exercise does not increase risk of lymphedema onset Historically, those at risk for lymphedema have been advised to avoid using the affected limb. The reasoning for this clinical advice seems to arise from the notion that the removal of lymph nodes altered the response of the affected area to inflammation, infection, injury, and trauma—therefore, it would be wise to avoid stressing the limb. However, exercise has a different effect on the body at lower doses than it does at higher doses; extreme exercise would promote inflammation and injury and should be avoided in patients at risk for lymphedema.[] By contrast, slowly progressive, carefully controlled increases in physiologic stress on a limb at risk for lymphedema may actually provide protection for real-life situations that require taxing that body part (e.g., carrying grocery bags, doing holiday shopping, or lifting a child).[] Therefore, physiologic evidence exists to question the historic advice to restrict use of the affected limb. Furthermore, there is empirical evidence that upper-body exercise does NOT result in increased onset of lymphedema among breast cancer survivors.[,];[,,] The largest of these studies (N = 204) [][] measured the arms of women before breast surgery with axillary node dissection and randomly assigned participants to one of two rehabilitation programs: The women in this group (N = 104) had no restrictions on physical activities that used the affected limb for 6 months postsurgery. The NAR patients followed a supervised program of moderate, progressive resistance exercise training 2 to 3 times per week. The resistance exercises (total exercise time = 45 minutes) included a minimum of 15 repetitions for each exercise, using low resistance (0.5 kg) during the first 2 weeks. The resistance was increased individually for each patient (no upper limit), with the aim of enhancing muscular strength and endurance but always using 15 repetitions per set for each exercise. The women in this group (N = 100) were instructed to restrict the activity of the affected limb for 6 months postsurgery. The patients were told to avoid heavy or strenuous physical activities such as aerobic or other types of exercise classes that included heavy upper-limb physical activity or work, and to avoid carrying or lifting groceries or other items weighing more than 3 kg. At the end of 2 years of postsurgical follow-up, the incidence of new lymphedema was 13% in both groups. Of note, the single most important predictor of lymphedema onset in this large study was obesity.[] Another large (N = 134 completers) randomized study compared a 1-year weight-lifting intervention with a no-exercise control group for breast cancer survivors who had unilateral disease and at least two lymph nodes removed. No patients had evidence of lymphedema at baseline. A progressive weight-lifting program did not result in an increased incidence of lymphedema. The study was designed as an equivalence trial but noted a lower incidence of lymphedema in the weight-training group (11% vs. 17%, with a significant difference of 7% vs. 22%, for those with five or more lymph nodes removed).[] Patients with and at risk for lymphedema should be evaluated by a certified lymphedema therapist to ensure it is safe to proceed with exercise of the affected body part. (Refer to the website for referrals to certified lymphedema therapists in locations across the United States.) Patients who have lymphedema should wear a well-fitting compression garment during all exercise that uses the affected limb or body part. If there are questions regarding whether lymphedema is present, there is no evidence as to whether use of a garment will be helpful or harmful. Garments must be well fitted to be useful, are costly, may not be covered by insurance without a clear diagnosis, and must be replaced every 6 months. Among women with an unclear diagnosis, it is likely that the risk of avoiding upper-body activity outweighs the risk of engaging in slowly progressive upper-body activity without a garment. Patients without lymphedema do NOT need to wear a garment while doing exercise with the at-risk limb. Evidence from studies with breast cancer survivors suggests that upper-body exercise among women with and at risk for lymphedema should start at a very low intensity and progress slowly and according to symptom response.[];[][] There should be a certified lymphedema specialist to whom these women can be referred if there is a need for evaluation of possible flare-ups or onsets. If there is a break in exercise of a week or longer, it is strongly recommended that women decrease the intensity of activity with the upper body and then increase it again gradually. Changes in symptoms (increased heaviness, achiness, puffiness, swelling) that last a week or longer should be evaluated for possible onsets or flare-ups. It is likely that starting at low intensity and progressing slowly is better for the affected limb than is avoiding activity. Lymphedema is typically evident by clinical findings such as nonpitting edema, usually with involvement of the digits, in a patient with known risk factors such as previous axillary dissection. Other causes of limb swelling, including deep venous thrombosis, malignancy, and infection, should be considered in the differential diagnosis and excluded with appropriate studies, if indicated. If the diagnosis is not evident on the basis of clinical assessment, imaging of the lymphatic system with lymphoscintigraphy (radionuclide imaging) may be necessary. Lymphangiography is generally no longer a favored diagnostic test and may be contraindicated in patients with malignancy because of concern that it may contribute to metastatic spread of tumor. Additional imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging may complement information obtained via lymphoscintigraphy by providing anatomic and nodal detail.[] The wide variety of methods described in the literature for evaluating limb volume and lack of standardization makes it difficult for the clinician to assess the at-risk limb. Options include water displacement, tape measurement, infrared scanning, and bioelectrical impedance measures.[] The most widely used method to diagnose upper-extremity lymphedema is circumferential upper-extremity measurement using specific anatomical landmarks.[] Arm circumference measures are used to estimate volume differences between the affected and unaffected arms. Sequential measurements are taken at four points on both arms: the metacarpal-phalangeal joints, the wrist, 10 cm distal to the lateral epicondyles, and 15 cm proximal to the lateral epicondyles. Differences of 2 cm or more at any point compared with the contralateral arm are considered by some experts to be clinically significant. However, measuring specific differences between arms may have limited clinical relevance because of implications, for example, of a 3-cm difference between the arm of an obese woman and the arm of a thin woman. In addition, there can be inherent anatomic variations in circumference between the dominant and nondominant limb related to differences in muscle mass and variations after breast cancer treatment that may occur with atrophy of the ipsilateral arm or hypertrophy of the contralateral arm.[] A small study comparing various methods of assessing upper-limb lymphedema did not show any superiority of any one method.[] Sequential measurements over time, including pretreatment measurements, may prove to be more clinically meaningful. The water displacement method is another way to evaluate arm edema. A volume difference of 200 mL or more between the affected and opposite arms is typically considered to be a cutoff point to define lymphedema.[] One common method of lymphedema classification uses three stages based on severity.[] Stage I is spontaneously reversible and typically is marked by pitting edema, increase in upper-extremity girth, and heaviness. Stage II is characterized by a spongy consistency of the tissue without signs of pitting edema. Tissue fibrosis can then cause the limbs to harden and increase in size.[] Stage III, also called lymphostatic elephantiasis, is the most advanced stage, but is rarely seen following breast cancer treatment.[] Another commonly used approach to classifying lymphedema is the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0 (CTCAE), which were developed for grading adverse events in the context of clinical trials.[] A key advantage of the CTCAE approach is that it includes both objective measures (interlimb discrepancy) and subjective, clinical assessments in diagnosing lymphedema. This allows for the very real possibility that a patient could have clinically meaningful, treatable lymphedema isolated to a segment of his or her limb that would not meet objective interlimb discrepancy criteria, but which could still be graded according to severity by signs and symptoms, as follows: Grade 1: 5% to 10% interlimb discrepancy in volume or circumference at point of greatest visible difference; swelling or obscuration of anatomic architecture on close inspection; pitting edema. Grade 2: More than 10% to 30% interlimb discrepancy in volume or circumference at point of greatest visible difference; readily apparent obscuration of anatomic architecture; obliteration of skin folds; readily apparent deviation from normal anatomic contour. Grade 3: More than 30% interlimb discrepancy in volume; lymphorrhea; gross deviation from normal anatomic contour; interfering with activities of daily living. Grade 4: Progression to malignancy (e.g., lymphangiosarcoma); amputation indicated; disabling lymphedema.

Proceeding in this way may diminish a breast cancer survivor’s dissatisfaction with the educational information received about lymphedema, and could serve as a foundation for making decisions and coping with lymphedema, should it develop later.[] Patients should be taught to recognize the early signs of edema because treatment outcomes may be significantly improved if the problem is detected early.[] Refer to the Exercise does not increase risk of lymphedema onset subsection in the section of this summary for more information. Generally anecdotal recommendations for taking preventive measures include the following: Maintain meticulous skin hygiene and nail care to prevent a portal of entry for infection which may result in cellulitis. Cut toenails straight across; see a podiatrist as needed to prevent ingrown nails and infections. Use skin moisturizers and topical antibiotic solutions after small breaks in the skin, such as paper cuts. Wear gardening and cooking gloves and use thimbles for sewing. Avoid blood draws (including finger sticks), vaccinations, or intravenous lines in the affected arm. Use the unaffected extremity to test temperatures (e.g., for bath water or cooking), as sensation may be diminished. Be aware of the signs of infection (fever, swelling, redness, pain, and heat) and see a physician for evaluation immediately. Keep the arm or leg elevated above the level of the heart when possible. Avoid constrictive pressure on the affected arm or leg. Wear loose jewelry and clothes with no constricting bands. Do not use elastic bandages and stockings with constrictive bands. Do not sit in one position for longer than 30 minutes. Avoiding the Pooling of Blood in the Involved Extremity Avoid rapid circular movements that cause centrifugal pooling of fluid in distal parts of the limb. Avoid local application of heat to the limb, which may increase blood flow. Do not maintain the limb in a gravity-dependent position for long periods of time. Avoid tight-fitting clothing or blood pressure monitoring in the affected arm, which could cause a tourniquet effect and obstruct lymph flow. The goal of lymphedema treatment centers on controlling limb swelling and minimizing complications; the underlying lymphatic vessel interruption cannot be corrected. Because clinical trials evaluating pharmacologic measures are generally not found to be effective, nonpharmacologic measures are the mainstay of treatment, with the goal of maximizing the activities of daily living, decreasing pain, increasing range of motion, and improving function. Nonfatiguing exercises may induce sufficient muscle contraction to move lymph into terminal lymphangioles and reduce swelling. Aerobic exercise may also increase the tone of the sympathetic nervous system, which causes the lymph collector vessels to pump more vigorously.[] Multiple studies indicate that exercise, including upper-body exercise, is safe for women with breast cancer–related lymphedema.[] There is also evidence that slowly progressive weight lifting among women with previously diagnosed breast cancer–related lymphedema leads to a reduction by half of the likelihood of a clinically meaningful exacerbation of lymphedema (a flare-up) that requires treatment by a physical therapist.[][] A group of 141 breast cancer survivors with lymphedema were randomly assigned to a twice-weekly, year-long weight-lifting intervention (N = 71) or to a wait-list comparison group (N = 70). The intervention started with 13 weeks of supervised training with little to no resistance; the amount of weight lifted was increased very gradually and only if there was no change in lymphedema symptoms or swelling. The participants all wore well-fitting, custom-made compression garments that were replaced 6 months into the intervention period. Women with breast cancer–related lymphedema should be guided to work with a certified fitness professional or physical therapist to learn the proper biomechanical form for upper-body weight-lifting exercises before undertaking this program on their own. (The specifics of the intervention are available to certified fitness professionals and physical therapists through the .) Further research is needed to develop a version of this intervention that can be broadly disseminated. One small pilot study has examined the safety of an intervention similar to that described above in cancer survivors with lower-extremity lymphedema secondary to melanoma or gynecologic or urological cancers. In this uncontrolled pilot study, 20% of participants developed a cellulitic infection within the first 2 months after starting a slowly progressive weight-lifting regimen.[] Further research is needed to determine whether weight-lifting is a safe exercise modality for cancer survivors with lower-extremity lymphedema. Gradient pressure garments (also known as lymphedema sleeves or stockings) generate greater pressures distally than proximally, which enhances mobilization of edema fluid. Some patients may require custom-made sleeves to achieve an appropriate fit. The use of these garments may be especially important at high altitudes, such as during air travel, because the ambient atmospheric pressure is less than the outlet transcapillary pressure within the superficial tissues, which can lead to worsening edema. Bandaging involves the use of inelastic material to discourage reaccumulation of lymph by reducing capillary ultrafiltration and optimizing the efficacy of the intrinsic muscle pump. Bandaging may change an initially resistant limb to one with less edema, resulting in decreased limb volume and allowing a garment to be applied successfully.[][] The goal of skin care is to minimize dermal colonization by bacteria and fungus, especially in the crevices, and hydrate the skin to control dryness and cracking. Complex decongestive therapy is a multimodality program that consists of manual lymphedema drainage therapy, low-stretch bandaging, exercises, and skin care.[] This approach has been recommended as a primary treatment by consensus panels and as an effective therapy for lymphedema unresponsive to standard elastic compression therapy.[,] Complex decongestive therapy is divided into two successive phases. The first phase consists of intensive treatment to allow substantive reduction of lymphedema volume. The second phase consists of maintenance treatment at home. Compliance with the use of the elastic sleeve and low-stretch bandage has been found to be an important determinant of success with maintenance therapy at home.[] Complex decongestive therapy has also been shown to improve lymphedema following groin dissection.[] Patients should be referred to a properly trained therapist for optimal results. Intermittent external pneumatic compression may also provide additional improvement with lymphedema management when used adjunctively with decongestive lymphatic therapy. One small randomized trial of 23 women with new breast cancer–associated lymphedema found an additional significant volume reduction when compared with manual lymphatic drainage alone (45% vs. 26%).[][] Similarly, improvements were also found in the maintenance phase of therapy. Concerns regarding the use of intermittent pneumatic compression include the optimum amount of pressure and treatment schedule and whether maintenance therapy is needed after the initial reduction in edema.[][] There is a theoretical concern that pressures higher than 60 mmHg and long-term use may actually injure lymphatic vessels. No chronic pharmacologic therapy is recommended for patients with lymphedema. Diuretics are typically of little benefit and may promote intravascular volume depletion because the lymphedema fluid cannot be easily mobilized into the vascular space. Coumarin is associated with significant hepatotoxicity and has not been found to have any benefit in controlled trials.[] Antibiotics should be used promptly for patients with evidence of cellulitis; intravenous use may sometimes be required for severe cellulitis, lymphangitis, or septicemia. The results of a small randomized trial have suggested that breast cancer–related lymphedema may improve with weight loss.[][] The mechanism by which obesity may predispose to lymphedema is unclear, but proposed mechanisms include an increased risk of postoperative complications, including infection, reduced muscle pumping efficiency, and separation of lymphatic channels by subcutaneous fat.[] A larger, longer-term weight-loss intervention in cancer patients with lymphedema (including those with lower-extremity disease) is warranted to further explore weight loss for disease management. Studies suggest that low-level laser therapy may be effective in reducing lymphedema in a clinically meaningful way for some women.[][][,] Two cycles of laser treatment were found to be effective in reducing the volume of the affected arm, extracellular fluid, and tissue hardness in approximately one-third of patients with postmastectomy lymphedema at 3 months posttreatment.[] Suggested rationales for laser therapy include a potential decrease in fibrosis, stimulation of macrophages and the immune system, and a possible role in encouraging lymphangiogenesis.[] Surgery is rarely performed on patients who have cancer-related lymphedema. The primary surgical method for treating lymphedema consists of removing the subcutaneous fat and fibrous tissue with or without creation of a dermal flap within the muscle to encourage superficial-to-deep lymphatic anastomoses. These methods have not been evaluated in prospective trials, with adequate results for only 30% of patients in one retrospective review. In addition, many patients face complications such as skin necrosis, infection, and sensory abnormalities.[] The oncology patient is usually not a candidate for these procedures. Other surgical options include the following: Microsurgical lymphaticovenous anastomoses, in which the lymph is drained into the venous circulation or the lymphatic collectors above the area of lymphatic obstruction. Manual lymphedema therapy, a type of massage technique, involves the use of a very light superficial massage with gentle, rhythmic skin distention, ideally limited to pressures of approximately 30 mmHg to 45 mmHg.[] In comparison to many other massage techniques, manual lymphedema therapy is very light to the touch. The strokes often feel like a “brushing” technique. Manual lymphedema therapy decreases congested lymph nodes by directing it to the circulatory and lymphatic system.[] Manual lymphedema therapy begins on unaffected areas to direct the lymph away from the affected extremity. A limited number of trials have been conducted among women with breast cancer who are experiencing lymphedema. These trials have reported significant reductions in limb volume when manual lymphedema therapy is administered as the sole intervention or as an adjunct to standard of care.[-][] However, large randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these preliminary findings. Manual lymphedema therapy should be introduced in a closely supervised medical setting, by a clinician specifically trained in manual lymphedema therapy.[] No adverse events have been reported in the pilot studies that administered manual lymphedema therapy to women with breast cancer. The reported adverse events are associated with the general discipline of massage therapy and are largely related to treatments delivered by unlicensed massage therapists or treatments that include deep and rigorous massage techniques. Manual lymphatic therapy, also known as manual lymphatic drainage, can be taught to patients for self-care. Despite the safety profile, the following special precautions should be considered when massage therapy is delivered to individuals with cancer: Avoid directly massaging any open wounds, hematomas, or areas with skin breakdown. Avoid directly massaging tumors that are apparent on the skin surface. Avoid massaging areas with acute deep venous thrombosis. Avoid directly massaging radiated soft tissue when the skin is sensitive.[] Additional integrative modalities have been under investigation for their role in the treatment of secondary lymphedema. Selenium has been studied in clinical trial , and acupuncture and moxibustion have been studied in clinical trial as treatments for lymphedema. If lymphedema is massive and refractory to treatment, or has an onset several years after the primary surgery without obvious trauma, a search for other etiologies should be undertaken. Of particular importance is exclusion of the recurrence of tumor or the development of lymphangiosarcoma, which should be excluded with computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. The complication of lymphangiosarcoma is classically seen in the postmastectomy lymphedematous arm (Stewart-Treves syndrome). The mean time between mastectomy and lymphangiosarcoma is 10.2 years, with a median survival of 1.3 years. Clinically, the lesions of lymphangiosarcoma may initially appear as blue-red or purple with a macular or papular shape in the skin. Multiple lesions are common; subcutaneous nodules may appear and should be carefully evaluated in the patient who has chronic lymphedema.[] Ridner SH: Pretreatment lymphedema education and identified educational resources in breast cancer patients.

Bello, , , , , Stella M. Seal, Background: Lymphedema remains a significant complication following breast cancer surgery when there is axillary lymph node intervention. Previous systematic reviews have identified risk factors for breast cancer-related lymphedema, including increased BMI, number of lymph nodes dissected and radiotherapy. However, they have not examined the effect of breast reconstruction on lymphedema occurrence. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we sought to evaluate the association between breast reconstruction (BR) and lymphedema. Methods: We searched PubMed (1966–2016), Embase (1966–2016), Scopus (2004–2016) and Google Scholar (2004–2016) for studies involving breast reconstruction and upper-extremity lymphedema or breast cancer-related lymphedema. Our primary outcome was lymphedema occurrence. We performed a meta-analysis using random effects due to heterogeneity of the studies. Results: Our search strategy identified 934 articles. After screening, 19 studies were included in our meta-analysis evaluating outcomes based on number of patients (7501) or number of breasts surgically treated (2063). Breast reconstruction was significantly associated with lower odds of lymphedema (p < 0.001) compared to mastectomy only or breast-conserving surgery. Lymphedema rates were not statistically significantly different between patients undergoing implant-based or autologous BR. Conclusions: Breast reconstruction is associated with lower rates of lymphedema compared to mastectomy only or breast conserving surgery patients. Although the study does not prove causation, we hypothesize that this association is likely due to multiple factors, including a self-selecting population and mechanisms through which BR may contribute to primary or secondary prevention of lymphedema.

aaa33dbc-1d6d-4d3c-91e0-7f46360521b4,"Information about the 2019 Novel Coronavirus. Información sobre el coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). Lymphadenitis is the medical term for inflamed and enlarged lymph nodes. It is usually due to an infection. Lymph nodes are filled with white blood cells that help your body fight infections. When lymph nodes become infected, it's usually because an infection started somewhere else in your body. Rarely, lymph nodes can enlarge due to cancer. You have about 600 lymph nodes in your body. But normal lymph nodes may be felt only below your jaw, under your arms, and in your groin area. A normal lymph node is small and soft. When lymph nodes become infected, they usually increase in size, become tender, and may be felt in other areas of your body during a physical exam. Infections that spread to lymph nodes are usually caused by bacteria, a virus, or a fungus. It is important to learn how the infection spread into your lymph nodes so that the right treatment can be started. This is the most common type. Localized lymphadenitis involves one or just a few nodes that are close to the area where the infection started. For example, nodes enlarged because of a tonsil infection may be felt in the neck area. This type of lymph node infection occurs in two or more lymph node groups. It may be caused by an infection that spreads through the bloodstream or another illness that affects the whole body. Lymphadenitis occurs when one or more lymph nodes are infected by a bacteria, a virus, or a fungus. When lymph nodes become infected, it's often because an infection started somewhere else in your body. Lymphadenitis mainly causes enlarged, tender lymph nodes. A lymph node is considered enlarged if it is about 1/2-inch wide. Symptoms caused by an infected lymph node or group of nodes may include: These symptoms may look like other health problems. Always see your healthcare provider for a diagnosis. If you have lymphadenitis, your healthcare provider will ask about your past history and do a physical exam. You may be asked about your symptoms, such as chills and fever, any recent travel, any breaks in your skin, and recent contact with cats or other animals. During the exam, your healthcare provider will look for signs of infection near the enlarged lymph nodes. These tests may be needed to help make the diagnosis: Taking a sample of tissue from the lymph node or fluid from inside the lymph node to study under a microscope Placing fluid from the lymph node into a culture to see what type of germs grow Treatment will depend on your symptoms, age, and general health. It will also depend on how severe the condition is. The exact type of treatment depends on what type of infection has spread into your lymph nodes. Once an infection has spread into some lymph nodes, it can spread quickly to others and to other parts of your body. So it's important to find the cause of the infection and start treatment quickly. Antibiotics given by mouth, IV, or injection to fight an infection caused by bacteria Surgery to drain a lymph node that has filled with pus The best way to prevent lymphadenitis is to see your healthcare provider at the first sign of any infection or if you notice a tender swelling that feels like a little lump just beneath your skin. Make sure to cleanse and use antiseptic on any scratches or breaks in your skin. And always practice good hygiene, especially frequent handwashing. Take all your medicines exactly as prescribed and keep all your follow-up appointments. Don't use any over-the-counter medicines without first talking to your healthcare provider. Applying cool compresses and elevating the affected part of your body may help relieve pain and swelling while your medicines are doing their work. In most cases, lymphadenitis clears up quickly with proper treatment. But it may take more time for lymph node swelling to go away. Be sure to let your healthcare provider know if your lymphadenitis symptoms come back.  If your symptoms get worse or you have new symptoms, call your healthcare provider.  Lymphadenitis is an infection in one or more lymph nodes. When lymph nodes become infected, it's usually because an infection started somewhere else in your body. Lymphadenitis can cause lymph nodes to become enlarged, red, or tender. Treatment may include antibiotics and medicines to control pain and fever. Early treatment of infections can prevent the development of lymphadenitis. Tips to help you get the most from a visit to your healthcare provider:  Know the reason for your visit and what you want to happen. Before your visit, write down questions you want answered. Bring someone with you to help you ask questions and remember what your provider tells you. At the visit, write down the name of a new diagnosis, and any new medicines, treatments, or tests. Also write down any new instructions your provider gives you. Know why a new medicine or treatment is prescribed, and how it will help you. Also know what the side effects are. Ask if your condition can be treated in other ways. Know why a test or procedure is recommended and what the results could mean. Know what to expect if you do not take the medicine or have the test or procedure. If you have a follow-up appointment, write down the date, time, and purpose for that visit. Know how you can contact your provider if you have questions.",101,heavy flares swelling lymph nodes,-10.088302612304688,70
4f23a7c2-e2a3-4e43-b21c-8595a351a342,"Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research Lymphedema is swelling that occurs when protein-rich lymph fluid accumulates in the interstitial tissue. This lymph fluid may contain plasma proteins, extravascular blood cells, excess water, and parenchymal products.[] Lymphedema is one of the most poorly understood, relatively underestimated, and least researched complications of cancer or its treatment. The Institute of Medicine of the National Academies published a report in 2006 recommending a “survivorship care plan” for cancer patients that incorporates information about late effects of treatment, health management behaviors, disease management, and recurrence monitoring.[] The Institute of Medicine also highlighted critical shortfalls in the transition to survivorship, particularly in providing education about late effects of treatment. Lymphedema is an important consideration for clinicians who care for cancer patients because of its relatively high frequency and significant functional and quality of life implications for patients. Lymphedema is an independent predictor of decreased quality of life, even when other predictive factors such as socioeconomic status, decreased range of motion, age, and obesity are taken into account.[] This summary will review issues related to anatomy and pathophysiology of lymphedema related to cancer, its clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment. Primary (congenital) lymphedema and non–cancer-related lymphedema (e.g., recurrent cellulitis, connective tissue disease, and infection) will not be reviewed here. In this summary, unless otherwise stated, evidence and practice issues as they relate to adults are discussed. The evidence and application to practice related to children may differ significantly from information related to adults. When specific information about the care of children is available, it is summarized under its own heading. Anatomy and Pathophysiology of the Lymphatic System The human lymphatic system generally includes superficial or primary lymphatic vessels that form a complex dermal network of capillarylike channels that drain into larger, secondary lymphatic vessels located in the subdermal space. These primary and secondary lymphatic vessels parallel the superficial veins and drain into a deeper third layer of lymphatic vessels located in the subcutaneous fat adjacent to the fascia. A muscular wall and numerous valves aid active, unidirectional lymphatic flow in secondary and subcutaneous lymphatic vessels. Primary lymphatic vessels lack a muscular wall and do not have valves. An intramuscular system of lymphatic vessels that parallels the deep arteries and drains the muscular compartment, joints, and synovium also exists. The superficial and deep lymphatic systems probably function independently, except in abnormal states, although there is evidence that they communicate near lymph nodes.[] Lymph drains from the lower limbs into the lumbar lymphatic trunk, which joins the intestinal lymphatic trunk and cisterna chyli to form the thoracic duct that empties into the left subclavian vein. The lymphatic vessels of the left arm drain into the left subclavian lymphatic trunk and then into the left subclavian vein. Lymph channels of the right arm drain into the right subclavian lymphatic trunk and then into the right subclavian vein. One function of the lymphatic system is to return excess fluid and protein from interstitial spaces to the blood vascular system. Because lymphatic vessels often lack a basement membrane, they can resorb molecules too large for venous uptake. Mechanisms of clinical edema include increased arteriovenous capillary filtration and reduced interstitial fluid absorption. Causes of increased capillary filtration include increased hydrostatic pressure in capillaries, decreased tissue pressure, and increased membrane permeability. Reduced interstitial fluid resorption can be caused by decreased plasma oncotic pressure, increased oncotic pressure of tissue fluid, and lymphatic obstruction. The onset of secondary lymphedema is often insidious. However, it may be suddenly provoked by local inflammation from causes such as infection or limb injury. Therefore, patients should be evaluated for evidence of cellulitis. Classically, lymphedema is characterized by nonpitting swelling of an extremity, usually with involvement of the digits. Early stages of lymphedema manifest with pitting edema until fibrosis develops. The distribution of the swelling may be restricted only in the proximal or distal portion of the limb. Lymphedema may also predispose to recurrent skin infections.[] Lymphedema can and does occur in the trunk, in addition to the limbs. For example, radiation therapy to the chest wall is associated with the development of edema specifically in the irradiated breast.[,] Some reports suggest a lymphedema prevalence rate as high as 75% in patients with cancers of the head and neck, with risk factors being high-dose radiation and combined surgery.[] Patients with lymphedema may report a wide variety of complaints, including heaviness or fullness related to the weight of the limb, a tight sensation of the skin, or decreased flexibility of the affected joint. The texture of the skin may become hyperkeratotic, with verrucous and vesicular skin lesions. With upper-extremity involvement, the patient may have difficulty fitting the affected area into clothing or wearing previously well-fitting rings, watches, or bracelets. Similar difficulties with lower-extremity lymphedema include a sensation of tightness or difficulty wearing shoes, itching of the legs or toes, burning sensation in the legs, or sleep disturbance and loss of hair. Ambulation can be affected because of the increased size and weight of the affected limb. Activities of daily living, hobbies, and the ability to perform previous work tasks may also be affected. Breast cancer survivors with arm lymphedema have been found to be more disabled, experience a poorer quality of life, and have more psychological distress than do survivors without lymphedema.[,] In addition, women reporting swelling have reported significantly lower quality of life with multiple functional assessments.[] Lymphedema can occur after any cancer or its treatment that affects lymph node drainage. It has been reported to occur within days and up to 30 years after treatment for breast cancer.[] Eighty percent of patients experience onset within 3 years of surgery; the remainder develop edema at a rate of 1% per year.[] Upper-extremity lymphedema most often occurs after breast cancer; lower-extremity lymphedema most often occurs with uterine cancer, prostate cancer, lymphoma, or melanoma.[] A large population-based study supports the evidence that lower-limb lymphedema is experienced by a significant proportion of women after treatment for gynecological cancer, with the highest prevalence (36%) among vulvar cancer survivors and the lowest prevalence (5%) among ovarian cancer survivors.[] There is no consistency in the data on the incidence and prevalence of lymphedema after breast cancer, probably because of differences in diagnosis, the different characteristics of the patients studied, and inadequate follow-up to capture delayed development of the disorder. The overall incidence of arm lymphedema can range from 8% to 56% at 2 years postsurgery.[] In a longitudinal substudy of the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group (ACOSOG)/Alliance Z1071 breast cancer trial, patient reports of 3-year cumulative incidence of arm swelling and arm heaviness were actually lower than the objective findings.[] It is important to diagnose and treat lymphedema when it is mild because those with mild lymphedema make up the cohort that gives rise to preventable severe, debilitating lymphedema. Women with mild lymphedema are more than three times as likely to develop severe lymphedema than are women with no lymphedema.[] Patients undergoing axillary surgery and/or axillary radiation therapy for breast cancer are at higher risk for developing lymphedema of the arm. Previous convention suggested that nodal positivity was a predisposing factor for the development of lymphedema in breast cancer patients.[] Controlling for axillary radiation, one study actually found an inverse relationship between nodal positivity and arm volume.[] Compared with axillary sampling alone, partial or total mastectomy followed by full axillary lymph node dissection significantly increases a patient’s chance of developing arm edema. For example, in one series of 100 women who underwent partial or total mastectomy and then full axillary lymph node dissection or axillary sampling, arm edema developed in more patients who underwent axillary lymph node dissection compared with sampling alone (30% vs. none).[] In addition, the extent of axillary lymph node dissection increases the risk for developing arm edema. For example, in one series involving 381 women undergoing segmental mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection, women who had ten or more lymph nodes removed were more likely than women who had few lymph nodes in the specimen to develop arm symptoms within the first year (53% vs. 33%) and within the next 2 years (33% vs. 20%).[] For patients with breast cancer, sentinel lymph node dissection has gained favor over axillary lymph node dissection for the axillary staging of early disease because of decreased morbidity and because of the questionable survival benefits of axillary lymph node dissection, as shown in a phase III randomized study () of axillary lymph node dissection in women who had stage I or IIA breast cancer and a positive sentinel node.[][] Several studies have shown that lymphedema is more prevalent in breast cancer patients who undergo axillary lymph node dissection than in those who undergo sentinel lymph node biopsy.[][] One study evaluated 30 patients with unilateral invasive breast carcinoma who underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy and 30 patients who underwent axillary lymph node dissection. This study found a 20% rate of developing lymphedema in the axillary lymph node dissection group compared with none in the sentinel lymph node biopsy group.[] Rates of lymphedema among women who undergo sentinel lymph node biopsy have been reported to be between 5% and 17%, depending on the diagnostic threshold and length of follow-up.[-] The majority of diagnosed lymphedema is mild.[][] Among all breast cancer patients, being obese or overweight may predispose women to developing lymphedema after treatment for breast cancer.[,][] A well-conducted prospective study followed 138 breast cancer patients for 30 months postdiagnosis. Individuals with body mass indices of 30 or higher at the time of diagnosis were 3.6 times more likely to develop lymphedema, but weight gain after diagnosis was not related.[] Some studies have correlated the degree of lymphedema with the level of obesity.[][] Similarly, among young breast cancer survivors, persistent swelling was related to having more lymph nodes removed and being obese.[] The dose-response relationship between obesity and risk for lymphedema onset is not known. There have also been no studies to determine whether weight loss among patients at risk for developing lymphedema would reduce risk. At this time, it is not possible to advise patients regarding the dose-response relationship of weight loss and risk reduction or the body weight associated with lowest risk of incident lymphedema. Other risk factors for developing lymphedema include the following: Local radiation (axillary, inguinal, pelvic, or supraclavicular regions). Tumor causing lymphatic obstruction of the anterior cervical, thoracic, axillary, pelvic, or abdominal nodes. Scarring of the left or right subclavian lymphatic ducts by either surgery or radiation. Intrapelvic or intra-abdominal tumors that involve or directly compress lymphatic vessels and/or the cisterna chyli and thoracic duct. Roughly one-third of breast cancer patients (and a majority of African Americans with breast cancer) present with regional disease and positive lymph nodes,[] thus requiring complete axillary lymph node dissection; many undergo further irradiation of their axillary and supraclavicular lymph node beds. Lymphedema is a persistent adverse effect of breast cancer treatment that will continue to occur long into the future, despite increasing use of sentinel lymph node biopsy procedures. Exercise does not increase risk of lymphedema onset Historically, those at risk for lymphedema have been advised to avoid using the affected limb. The reasoning for this clinical advice seems to arise from the notion that the removal of lymph nodes altered the response of the affected area to inflammation, infection, injury, and trauma—therefore, it would be wise to avoid stressing the limb. However, exercise has a different effect on the body at lower doses than it does at higher doses; extreme exercise would promote inflammation and injury and should be avoided in patients at risk for lymphedema.[] By contrast, slowly progressive, carefully controlled increases in physiologic stress on a limb at risk for lymphedema may actually provide protection for real-life situations that require taxing that body part (e.g., carrying grocery bags, doing holiday shopping, or lifting a child).[] Therefore, physiologic evidence exists to question the historic advice to restrict use of the affected limb. Furthermore, there is empirical evidence that upper-body exercise does NOT result in increased onset of lymphedema among breast cancer survivors.[,];[,,] The largest of these studies (N = 204) [][] measured the arms of women before breast surgery with axillary node dissection and randomly assigned participants to one of two rehabilitation programs: The women in this group (N = 104) had no restrictions on physical activities that used the affected limb for 6 months postsurgery. The NAR patients followed a supervised program of moderate, progressive resistance exercise training 2 to 3 times per week. The resistance exercises (total exercise time = 45 minutes) included a minimum of 15 repetitions for each exercise, using low resistance (0.5 kg) during the first 2 weeks. The resistance was increased individually for each patient (no upper limit), with the aim of enhancing muscular strength and endurance but always using 15 repetitions per set for each exercise. The women in this group (N = 100) were instructed to restrict the activity of the affected limb for 6 months postsurgery. The patients were told to avoid heavy or strenuous physical activities such as aerobic or other types of exercise classes that included heavy upper-limb physical activity or work, and to avoid carrying or lifting groceries or other items weighing more than 3 kg. At the end of 2 years of postsurgical follow-up, the incidence of new lymphedema was 13% in both groups. Of note, the single most important predictor of lymphedema onset in this large study was obesity.[] Another large (N = 134 completers) randomized study compared a 1-year weight-lifting intervention with a no-exercise control group for breast cancer survivors who had unilateral disease and at least two lymph nodes removed. No patients had evidence of lymphedema at baseline. A progressive weight-lifting program did not result in an increased incidence of lymphedema. The study was designed as an equivalence trial but noted a lower incidence of lymphedema in the weight-training group (11% vs. 17%, with a significant difference of 7% vs. 22%, for those with five or more lymph nodes removed).[] Patients with and at risk for lymphedema should be evaluated by a certified lymphedema therapist to ensure it is safe to proceed with exercise of the affected body part. (Refer to the website for referrals to certified lymphedema therapists in locations across the United States.) Patients who have lymphedema should wear a well-fitting compression garment during all exercise that uses the affected limb or body part. If there are questions regarding whether lymphedema is present, there is no evidence as to whether use of a garment will be helpful or harmful. Garments must be well fitted to be useful, are costly, may not be covered by insurance without a clear diagnosis, and must be replaced every 6 months. Among women with an unclear diagnosis, it is likely that the risk of avoiding upper-body activity outweighs the risk of engaging in slowly progressive upper-body activity without a garment. Patients without lymphedema do NOT need to wear a garment while doing exercise with the at-risk limb. Evidence from studies with breast cancer survivors suggests that upper-body exercise among women with and at risk for lymphedema should start at a very low intensity and progress slowly and according to symptom response.[];[][] There should be a certified lymphedema specialist to whom these women can be referred if there is a need for evaluation of possible flare-ups or onsets. If there is a break in exercise of a week or longer, it is strongly recommended that women decrease the intensity of activity with the upper body and then increase it again gradually. Changes in symptoms (increased heaviness, achiness, puffiness, swelling) that last a week or longer should be evaluated for possible onsets or flare-ups. It is likely that starting at low intensity and progressing slowly is better for the affected limb than is avoiding activity. Lymphedema is typically evident by clinical findings such as nonpitting edema, usually with involvement of the digits, in a patient with known risk factors such as previous axillary dissection. Other causes of limb swelling, including deep venous thrombosis, malignancy, and infection, should be considered in the differential diagnosis and excluded with appropriate studies, if indicated. If the diagnosis is not evident on the basis of clinical assessment, imaging of the lymphatic system with lymphoscintigraphy (radionuclide imaging) may be necessary. Lymphangiography is generally no longer a favored diagnostic test and may be contraindicated in patients with malignancy because of concern that it may contribute to metastatic spread of tumor. Additional imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging may complement information obtained via lymphoscintigraphy by providing anatomic and nodal detail.[] The wide variety of methods described in the literature for evaluating limb volume and lack of standardization makes it difficult for the clinician to assess the at-risk limb. Options include water displacement, tape measurement, infrared scanning, and bioelectrical impedance measures.[] The most widely used method to diagnose upper-extremity lymphedema is circumferential upper-extremity measurement using specific anatomical landmarks.[] Arm circumference measures are used to estimate volume differences between the affected and unaffected arms. Sequential measurements are taken at four points on both arms: the metacarpal-phalangeal joints, the wrist, 10 cm distal to the lateral epicondyles, and 15 cm proximal to the lateral epicondyles. Differences of 2 cm or more at any point compared with the contralateral arm are considered by some experts to be clinically significant. However, measuring specific differences between arms may have limited clinical relevance because of implications, for example, of a 3-cm difference between the arm of an obese woman and the arm of a thin woman. In addition, there can be inherent anatomic variations in circumference between the dominant and nondominant limb related to differences in muscle mass and variations after breast cancer treatment that may occur with atrophy of the ipsilateral arm or hypertrophy of the contralateral arm.[] A small study comparing various methods of assessing upper-limb lymphedema did not show any superiority of any one method.[] Sequential measurements over time, including pretreatment measurements, may prove to be more clinically meaningful. The water displacement method is another way to evaluate arm edema. A volume difference of 200 mL or more between the affected and opposite arms is typically considered to be a cutoff point to define lymphedema.[] One common method of lymphedema classification uses three stages based on severity.[] Stage I is spontaneously reversible and typically is marked by pitting edema, increase in upper-extremity girth, and heaviness. Stage II is characterized by a spongy consistency of the tissue without signs of pitting edema. Tissue fibrosis can then cause the limbs to harden and increase in size.[] Stage III, also called lymphostatic elephantiasis, is the most advanced stage, but is rarely seen following breast cancer treatment.[] Another commonly used approach to classifying lymphedema is the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0 (CTCAE), which were developed for grading adverse events in the context of clinical trials.[] A key advantage of the CTCAE approach is that it includes both objective measures (interlimb discrepancy) and subjective, clinical assessments in diagnosing lymphedema. This allows for the very real possibility that a patient could have clinically meaningful, treatable lymphedema isolated to a segment of his or her limb that would not meet objective interlimb discrepancy criteria, but which could still be graded according to severity by signs and symptoms, as follows: Grade 1: 5% to 10% interlimb discrepancy in volume or circumference at point of greatest visible difference; swelling or obscuration of anatomic architecture on close inspection; pitting edema. Grade 2: More than 10% to 30% interlimb discrepancy in volume or circumference at point of greatest visible difference; readily apparent obscuration of anatomic architecture; obliteration of skin folds; readily apparent deviation from normal anatomic contour. Grade 3: More than 30% interlimb discrepancy in volume; lymphorrhea; gross deviation from normal anatomic contour; interfering with activities of daily living. Grade 4: Progression to malignancy (e.g., lymphangiosarcoma); amputation indicated; disabling lymphedema.

Semin Radiat Oncol 13 (3): 214-25, 2003.  Ideally, prevention should begin before treatment, by educating the patient and family in a sensitive fashion about the potential risk of developing lymphedema. Proceeding in this way may diminish a breast cancer survivor’s dissatisfaction with the educational information received about lymphedema, and could serve as a foundation for making decisions and coping with lymphedema, should it develop later.[] Patients should be taught to recognize the early signs of edema because treatment outcomes may be significantly improved if the problem is detected early.[] Refer to the Exercise does not increase risk of lymphedema onset subsection in the section of this summary for more information. Generally anecdotal recommendations for taking preventive measures include the following: Maintain meticulous skin hygiene and nail care to prevent a portal of entry for infection which may result in cellulitis. Cut toenails straight across; see a podiatrist as needed to prevent ingrown nails and infections. Use skin moisturizers and topical antibiotic solutions after small breaks in the skin, such as paper cuts. Wear gardening and cooking gloves and use thimbles for sewing. Avoid blood draws (including finger sticks), vaccinations, or intravenous lines in the affected arm. Use the unaffected extremity to test temperatures (e.g., for bath water or cooking), as sensation may be diminished. Be aware of the signs of infection (fever, swelling, redness, pain, and heat) and see a physician for evaluation immediately. Keep the arm or leg elevated above the level of the heart when possible. Avoid constrictive pressure on the affected arm or leg. Wear loose jewelry and clothes with no constricting bands. Do not use elastic bandages and stockings with constrictive bands. Do not sit in one position for longer than 30 minutes. Avoiding the Pooling of Blood in the Involved Extremity Avoid rapid circular movements that cause centrifugal pooling of fluid in distal parts of the limb. Avoid local application of heat to the limb, which may increase blood flow. Do not maintain the limb in a gravity-dependent position for long periods of time. Avoid tight-fitting clothing or blood pressure monitoring in the affected arm, which could cause a tourniquet effect and obstruct lymph flow. The goal of lymphedema treatment centers on controlling limb swelling and minimizing complications; the underlying lymphatic vessel interruption cannot be corrected. Because clinical trials evaluating pharmacologic measures are generally not found to be effective, nonpharmacologic measures are the mainstay of treatment, with the goal of maximizing the activities of daily living, decreasing pain, increasing range of motion, and improving function. Nonfatiguing exercises may induce sufficient muscle contraction to move lymph into terminal lymphangioles and reduce swelling. Aerobic exercise may also increase the tone of the sympathetic nervous system, which causes the lymph collector vessels to pump more vigorously.[] Multiple studies indicate that exercise, including upper-body exercise, is safe for women with breast cancer–related lymphedema.[] There is also evidence that slowly progressive weight lifting among women with previously diagnosed breast cancer–related lymphedema leads to a reduction by half of the likelihood of a clinically meaningful exacerbation of lymphedema (a flare-up) that requires treatment by a physical therapist.[][] A group of 141 breast cancer survivors with lymphedema were randomly assigned to a twice-weekly, year-long weight-lifting intervention (N = 71) or to a wait-list comparison group (N = 70). The intervention started with 13 weeks of supervised training with little to no resistance; the amount of weight lifted was increased very gradually and only if there was no change in lymphedema symptoms or swelling. The participants all wore well-fitting, custom-made compression garments that were replaced 6 months into the intervention period. Women with breast cancer–related lymphedema should be guided to work with a certified fitness professional or physical therapist to learn the proper biomechanical form for upper-body weight-lifting exercises before undertaking this program on their own. (The specifics of the intervention are available to certified fitness professionals and physical therapists through the .) Further research is needed to develop a version of this intervention that can be broadly disseminated. One small pilot study has examined the safety of an intervention similar to that described above in cancer survivors with lower-extremity lymphedema secondary to melanoma or gynecologic or urological cancers. In this uncontrolled pilot study, 20% of participants developed a cellulitic infection within the first 2 months after starting a slowly progressive weight-lifting regimen.[] Further research is needed to determine whether weight-lifting is a safe exercise modality for cancer survivors with lower-extremity lymphedema. Gradient pressure garments (also known as lymphedema sleeves or stockings) generate greater pressures distally than proximally, which enhances mobilization of edema fluid. Some patients may require custom-made sleeves to achieve an appropriate fit. The use of these garments may be especially important at high altitudes, such as during air travel, because the ambient atmospheric pressure is less than the outlet transcapillary pressure within the superficial tissues, which can lead to worsening edema. Bandaging involves the use of inelastic material to discourage reaccumulation of lymph by reducing capillary ultrafiltration and optimizing the efficacy of the intrinsic muscle pump. Bandaging may change an initially resistant limb to one with less edema, resulting in decreased limb volume and allowing a garment to be applied successfully.[][] The goal of skin care is to minimize dermal colonization by bacteria and fungus, especially in the crevices, and hydrate the skin to control dryness and cracking. Complex decongestive therapy is a multimodality program that consists of manual lymphedema drainage therapy, low-stretch bandaging, exercises, and skin care.[] This approach has been recommended as a primary treatment by consensus panels and as an effective therapy for lymphedema unresponsive to standard elastic compression therapy.[,] Complex decongestive therapy is divided into two successive phases. The first phase consists of intensive treatment to allow substantive reduction of lymphedema volume. The second phase consists of maintenance treatment at home. Compliance with the use of the elastic sleeve and low-stretch bandage has been found to be an important determinant of success with maintenance therapy at home.[] Complex decongestive therapy has also been shown to improve lymphedema following groin dissection.[] Patients should be referred to a properly trained therapist for optimal results. Intermittent external pneumatic compression may also provide additional improvement with lymphedema management when used adjunctively with decongestive lymphatic therapy. One small randomized trial of 23 women with new breast cancer–associated lymphedema found an additional significant volume reduction when compared with manual lymphatic drainage alone (45% vs. 26%).[][] Similarly, improvements were also found in the maintenance phase of therapy. Concerns regarding the use of intermittent pneumatic compression include the optimum amount of pressure and treatment schedule and whether maintenance therapy is needed after the initial reduction in edema.[][] There is a theoretical concern that pressures higher than 60 mmHg and long-term use may actually injure lymphatic vessels. No chronic pharmacologic therapy is recommended for patients with lymphedema. Diuretics are typically of little benefit and may promote intravascular volume depletion because the lymphedema fluid cannot be easily mobilized into the vascular space. Coumarin is associated with significant hepatotoxicity and has not been found to have any benefit in controlled trials.[] Antibiotics should be used promptly for patients with evidence of cellulitis; intravenous use may sometimes be required for severe cellulitis, lymphangitis, or septicemia. The results of a small randomized trial have suggested that breast cancer–related lymphedema may improve with weight loss.[][] The mechanism by which obesity may predispose to lymphedema is unclear, but proposed mechanisms include an increased risk of postoperative complications, including infection, reduced muscle pumping efficiency, and separation of lymphatic channels by subcutaneous fat.[] A larger, longer-term weight-loss intervention in cancer patients with lymphedema (including those with lower-extremity disease) is warranted to further explore weight loss for disease management. Studies suggest that low-level laser therapy may be effective in reducing lymphedema in a clinically meaningful way for some women.[][][,] Two cycles of laser treatment were found to be effective in reducing the volume of the affected arm, extracellular fluid, and tissue hardness in approximately one-third of patients with postmastectomy lymphedema at 3 months posttreatment.[] Suggested rationales for laser therapy include a potential decrease in fibrosis, stimulation of macrophages and the immune system, and a possible role in encouraging lymphangiogenesis.[] Surgery is rarely performed on patients who have cancer-related lymphedema. The primary surgical method for treating lymphedema consists of removing the subcutaneous fat and fibrous tissue with or without creation of a dermal flap within the muscle to encourage superficial-to-deep lymphatic anastomoses. These methods have not been evaluated in prospective trials, with adequate results for only 30% of patients in one retrospective review. In addition, many patients face complications such as skin necrosis, infection, and sensory abnormalities.[] The oncology patient is usually not a candidate for these procedures. Other surgical options include the following: Microsurgical lymphaticovenous anastomoses, in which the lymph is drained into the venous circulation or the lymphatic collectors above the area of lymphatic obstruction. Manual lymphedema therapy, a type of massage technique, involves the use of a very light superficial massage with gentle, rhythmic skin distention, ideally limited to pressures of approximately 30 mmHg to 45 mmHg.[] In comparison to many other massage techniques, manual lymphedema therapy is very light to the touch. The strokes often feel like a “brushing” technique. Manual lymphedema therapy decreases congested lymph nodes by directing it to the circulatory and lymphatic system.[] Manual lymphedema therapy begins on unaffected areas to direct the lymph away from the affected extremity. A limited number of trials have been conducted among women with breast cancer who are experiencing lymphedema. These trials have reported significant reductions in limb volume when manual lymphedema therapy is administered as the sole intervention or as an adjunct to standard of care.[-][] However, large randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these preliminary findings. Manual lymphedema therapy should be introduced in a closely supervised medical setting, by a clinician specifically trained in manual lymphedema therapy.[] No adverse events have been reported in the pilot studies that administered manual lymphedema therapy to women with breast cancer. The reported adverse events are associated with the general discipline of massage therapy and are largely related to treatments delivered by unlicensed massage therapists or treatments that include deep and rigorous massage techniques. Manual lymphatic therapy, also known as manual lymphatic drainage, can be taught to patients for self-care. Despite the safety profile, the following special precautions should be considered when massage therapy is delivered to individuals with cancer: Avoid directly massaging any open wounds, hematomas, or areas with skin breakdown. Avoid directly massaging tumors that are apparent on the skin surface. Avoid massaging areas with acute deep venous thrombosis. Avoid directly massaging radiated soft tissue when the skin is sensitive.[] Additional integrative modalities have been under investigation for their role in the treatment of secondary lymphedema. Selenium has been studied in clinical trial , and acupuncture and moxibustion have been studied in clinical trial as treatments for lymphedema. If lymphedema is massive and refractory to treatment, or has an onset several years after the primary surgery without obvious trauma, a search for other etiologies should be undertaken. Of particular importance is exclusion of the recurrence of tumor or the development of lymphangiosarcoma, which should be excluded with computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. The complication of lymphangiosarcoma is classically seen in the postmastectomy lymphedematous arm (Stewart-Treves syndrome). The mean time between mastectomy and lymphangiosarcoma is 10.2 years, with a median survival of 1.3 years. Clinically, the lesions of lymphangiosarcoma may initially appear as blue-red or purple with a macular or papular shape in the skin. Multiple lesions are common; subcutaneous nodules may appear and should be carefully evaluated in the patient who has chronic lymphedema.[] Ridner SH: Pretreatment lymphedema education and identified educational resources in breast cancer patients.

2cb269a4-d37c-46da-8367-9e8cfbff9089,"Manual Lymphatic Drainage and its Therapeutic Benefits listed in , originally published in In 1932 Dr Emil Vodder and his wife Estrid were working as massage therapists in Cannes on the French Riviera on English patients who were there to recover from chronic colds caused by the damp British climate. The Vodders discovered that these patients had swollen lymph nodes, in their necks. At that time it was regarded as taboo to interfere with the lymphatic system or the lymph nodes and so little was understood that it was thought of as a Pandora's box. Intuitively, Vodder dared to work on the lymph nodes, lightly pumping and massaging and achieved great success. Together with his wife, he continued to expand on his knowledge and understanding, but the scientific world was not quite ready for their findings and would not accept their hypothesis and empirical evidence. Vodder held lectures and gave demonstrations and with his wife taught other massage therapists this new technique, which they called Manual Lymphatic Drainage. Gradually, more massage therapists, aestheticians and physicians took up the therapy and used it with great effect. Now its efficacy is no longer doubted and it is practised in many locations worldwide. It forms part of the management of the condition 'lymphoedema' and is indicated for a host of other ailments and conditions for various reasons. From Vodders pioneering work on the lymphatic system we now have a therapy that works on the basic needs of the body to have every cell nourished and cleansed in an efficient way – a therapy that is effective for the fundamental building blocks of the body, the cells.[1] MLD is a highly specialised form of massage, which uses light, rhythmical, very precise hand movements, pressures and sequences and requires the therapist to develop a great degree of skill, having an intimate knowledge of the workings of the anatomy of the lymphatic system. The massage works at a skin level to influence the direction and speed of lymphatic flow, re-directing if necessary. The lymphatic system is a complex one which integrates with other bodily systems, for example, the circulatory system and the urinary system. As well as playing a major part in immunity, it facilitates waste removal at cellular level and assists with bringing nutrients and oxygen to cells. Interstitial fluid, the fluid that bathes all cells, contains a rich soup of proteins, plasma, long chain fatty molecules, cell waste and debris and any molecules which are too big to pass into the venous system – these enter the lymphatic system and become 'lymph'. The vessels of the lymphatic system begin as blind-ended lymph capillaries in the periphery in the layers of the skin, and progress into slightly larger vessels, then slightly larger again. These lymph vessels progress through the body passing through clearing stations called lymph nodes. We each have between 600 and 800 lymph nodes (a third of which are in the area of the head and neck), which range in size from a pinhead to a broad bean. They are arranged in clusters or chains and while we know where they are situated, in each person the exact arrangement is unique. Lymph nodes, among other things, filter the lymph fluid that passes through and re-absorb some of components to the blood stream while the rest of the Lymph passes along the vessels of the lymphatic system back to the thoracic ducts (at the base of the neck, under the collarbones) where the contents re-join the circulatory system, and go to the kidneys via the heart. The kidneys filter and process the blood and excrete the waste products as urine. A treatment commences at the neck to clear the area and 'make space' for lymph to be brought there. The next parts of the sequence will depend entirely on why MLD is being performed and the particular needs of the individual. However, lymph follows pre-determined pathways on its journey to the thoracic ducts and is continuous – if space is made at the top of the chain, fluid from lower down can 'move up'. So areas are cleared for lymph to be brought to from other parts of the system. The lymphatic system does not have its own pump (unlike the circulation which has the heart) and relies on movement of muscles in the surrounding area to activate the collection of lymph from surrounding tissues. The act of inspiration acts as a trigger for the lymphatic system to 'empty' back into the circulatory system at the base of the neck. The massage is, on the whole, a very light technique. This is because the practitioner is trying to influence vessels that are situated in the skin layers. It may be as well to point out here that Manual Lymph Drainage is NOT the same as some of the 'Lymph Drainage Massage' offered by, for example, sports or Swedish-massage therapists which can be a very heavy technique indeed. Yes, that kind of heavy massage will influence lymph drainage because it will increase circulation of blood to the area being massaged but may not be suitable for someone who has a compromised lymphatic system and it is not nearly as effective in moving fluid as MLD. MLD will remove fluid from tissues without first bringing extra load to the area in the form of circulation. The aim of the MLD therapist is to restore equilibrium in the tissues and ensure that 'that which enters equals that which departs'. If the body is not in this state of equilibrium, and there is too much fluid in the tissues, they become soft and 'boggy' to the touch. If excess fluid is present it can interfere with cell nutrition – oxygen and nutrients will take longer to pass through the tissues and get from the bloodstream to the cells through the interstitial fluid. This will also mean that waste products from cell metabolism will take longer to move from cells to the transport system, which will remove them from the body. If the lymphatic system is functioning well, we feel well. There are many reasons for the Lymphatic system to be sluggish and not functioning well, leaving fluid static in the tissues. Pollution, toxins, poor nutrition, mucous formation, overload from previous viral or bacterial infections etc – these are all things that can give rise to cellular stagnation. Damage to the lymph transport system – the lymph vessels or lymph nodes can lead to oedema known as lymphoedema. Lymphoedema can result in massively swollen limbs and can have a major impact on the sufferer and can mean reduced mobility, low self-esteem, inconvenience, discomfort and pain. There are two basic types of lymphoedema – primary and secondary. Primary lymphoedema is believed to be hereditary and is caused by there being a problem with the lymph transport system from birth. There may be insufficient vessels, or the vessels may be weak and unable to cope with the load, or there may be a problem with the lymph nodes. Usually affecting the lower limbs, Primary lymphoedema is not necessarily present at birth but may manifest at any time in life and can be triggered by an incident such as a long journey or insect bite, or may just be a gradual swelling over a number of years, beginning with the feet and ankles and gradually progressing up one or both legs. Secondary lymphoedema can arise because of damage to the lymphatic system, for example when nodes are removed in surgery or after irradiation in treatment for cancer, or when vessels are cut or damaged in trauma or accident. For example, in cases of breast cancer where nodes are removed from the axilla there may be swelling of the arm on the affected side. Both types of lymphoedema are progressive and can result in massive swellings of limbs, trunk or face. With these oedemas, complications can arise with time resulting in skin changes and leaving the sufferer prone to bouts of cellulitis, a bacterial infection of the tissues. It is thought that the bacteria thrive on the protein rich oedema found in the tissues. Other skin changes can also occur such as fibrosis where the tissue becomes hardened and 'woody' and further prevents the flow of lymph. This then becomes a vicious circle – the lymph feeding bacteria and causing infections and hardened tissues, and the hardened tissues preventing the free flow of lymph. MLD is a big part of the management of both types of lymphoedema and is fundamental in Complex Decongestive Therapy (CDT). CDT initially involves an intensive regime of daily Multi Layer Lymphoedema Bandaging (compression bandaging), MLD, exercise and skin care. The aim of CDT is to reduce limb volume and improve shape so that compression garments can be fitted and worn to help prevent the limb refilling. Ongoing MLD helps to keep lymph moving and stimulated, encouraging whatever vessels are present and intact to work well. It also allows the body to open up other pathways – collateral vessels and anastamoses. These are the body's natural backstop in event of tissue overload but sometimes need encouragement to work. MLD therapists can re-direct lymph around a problem, for example, bypassing areas where nodes have been removed and taking fluid to the next set of available or desirable nodes along the system. There are many other conditions, that benefit from the application of MLD, because of its propensity to move fluid, but MLD also has other properties that have great therapeutic value besides decongesting tissue. Because it is a very light massage, utilizing repetitive and continuous hand movements, it has a calming effect on the autonomic nervous system which Vodder explains as ""a change from a sympathetic state to a parasympathetic state"" stressing the importance of the lightness of touch so as not to trigger a release of histamines in the tissue which would otherwise overstimulate. The effect is to induce a state of deep relaxation in the body allowing even the walls of vessels and bowels to be relaxed. For this reason, MLD is an excellent therapy for sufferers of hypertension.[2] MLD is also believed to have an analgesic effect based on the Gate Theory where nocireceptors (pain receptors) and mechanoreceptors (touch receptors) of the central nervous system share a synapse or pathway. A simplified explanation could be that the touch receptors are stimulated by the light, repetitive touch of MLD, these signals overtake or crowd out those sent by the pain receptors. MLD will also remove from cells the chemicals associated with the central nervous systems pain response. In practice, MLD does, indeed, have an analgesic effect. Not yet proven but noted empirically and anecdotally, a logical consequence of MLD is in boosting the immune system. Lymph stagnation impedes the body's immunological response so speeding up the workings of the lymphatic system must promote it. Certainly, people who are receiving MLD on a regular basis, report that they no longer pick up colds and sore throats as frequently as they may have done before having the treatment. Vodder quotes over 60 different ailments and conditions for which MLD is indicated – these include migraine and chronic headaches, common acne and acne rosacea, constipation, eczema, tinnitus, Ménière's, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid and osteo arthritis, sinus congestion and chronic catarrh, tendonitis, repetitive strain injury, whiplash and other trauma to name a few. It can be used to improve scar tissue and to reduce bruising after surgery or injury. It is an excellent therapy for rejuvenation as a beauty treatment and can reduce puffiness and fine lines and wrinkles.[3] MLD is also an effective treatment for localized post-traumatic oedema after bruising, distortion, fracture, dislocation or surgical procedures and is a useful to complement mobilization by physical therapy.[4] There are some people who cannot have MLD, as there are some absolute contra-indications to treatment and some cases where caution is warranted. The MLD therapist takes a full medical history to determine suitability of the treatment before sessions can commence. Mrs C (42), a self-employed choreographer and teacher, was involved in a rear-end collision with her car being struck from behind at some speed resulting in a moderate whiplash injury. She was examined at casualty and X-rayed which confirmed no skeletal damage but soft tissue injury. She was told that her injury could take 'some months' to resolve, to see her GP for a referral to the local physiotherapy department and for analgesics. She was supplied with a soft collar and advised to refrain from driving, working etc. She presented with pain and stiffness and immobility of the neck and upper back, with some pain radiating down her arms on movement. The first treatment took place about one week after the accident and initially she was treated in a sitting position, leaning forward with her arms resting on a couch and supported by pillows, as this was the only way for her to be comfortable. Stiffness of the whole upper body had set in by this time. She received MLD to the neck and shoulders every day for about one week, reported some pain relief after the first session and showed a marked improvement after the first three days reporting much less pain and stiffness and improved mobility. Before the end of the first week she was able to lie face down on the couch. MLD was applied to her neck, shoulders and upper back at each session. For the second week, sessions again took place every day with continuing improvements resulting in very little pain and greatly increased mobility and lack of stiffness. The following two weeks, sessions took place every other day with continuing improvements; at one point Mrs C reported that she felt fully recovered. Sessions were continued to the end of the week to ensure that there was no return of the problem. In all, 21 sessions took place and effected a full recovery so that Mrs C was able to resume her work. She continues to have occasional MLD sessions she says 'to keep her in good working order' and was very pleased to have resolved her whiplash in a shorter time than originally thought. She never sought physiotherapy treatments. Mrs E (34) came for MLD because she had been diagnosed as suffering from this condition after she had developed weeping, itchy lumps on her scalp. She had been prescribed a topical cream, which appeared to be ineffective. She had been told that the condition could be exacerbated by stress and she had noted that it was prone to flaring up intermittently. Treatment began at the neck as it always does with MLD. The first session was planned to take no longer than 20 minutes to see what sort of reaction might occur and ensure that it would not induce a flare-up; it consisted of work on the neck and face. When Mrs E returned a week later, there was a marked improvement with much less itchiness and weeping. At this second session, again the neck and face were treated but for 40 minutes. A third session was planned for the following week and again, there was a remarkable improvement with the lumps having almost completely resolved. Again, neck and face were worked on for 40 minutes. At the fourth and final session, the scalp area was clear enough to be worked on directly after the initial clearing of the neck; a forty-minute treatment took place. Mrs E was so pleased with the results after the four sessions that she had another four but spaced a month apart with no return of the problematic itchy, weeping lumps on her scalp. She continues to be free of the original condition. Mrs S (32) was 27 weeks pregnant with twins when she came for help with swollen feet and hands due to the pregnancy. She was getting symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome (which can be a complication of pregnancy due to the extra fluid being carried) in both hands. She had weekly sessions of MLD concentrating on clearing her pathways centrally and then her arms and legs, which helped to keep her comfortable and maintain her fluid balance preventing her feet and hands from becoming too swollen. The biggest difficulty for Mrs S was in getting into a comfortable position for the treatments. Sessions were kept short or broken for comfort breaks so that she could be re-positioned with supporting pillows and bolsters. She was delivered of healthy boy/girl twins at 37 weeks. She continues to have occasional sessions for relaxation and recuperation. Wittlinger, H. & G. Textbook of Dr Vodder's Manual Lymph Drainage, Vol 1. Haug Publishing. Heidelberg.

131881ce-c2d4-49cc-b9f2-16ffc59baba5,"Information about the 2019 Novel Coronavirus. Información sobre el coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). A sentinel lymph node biopsy is a procedure to see if or how far a cancer has spread. Lymph nodes are part of the body’s lymphatic system. This system is one way your body fights bacteria, viruses, and other foreign germs. Inside the lymph system is a clear fluid called lymph. The fluid traps these germs. This fluid flows to your lymph nodes. Lymph nodes are small, round organs. They are in your neck, underarms, groin, belly (abdomen), and chest. If you have an infection, nearby lymph nodes may swell. They can also become hard and painful. The same symptoms can happen if cancer cells spread to a lymph node. Or in some cases, cancer cells may be in a lymph node and not cause symptoms. The sentinel lymph node is the node that cancer cells may go into first, before going to other nodes. Looking at cells in this node can give your healthcare provider a lot of information about your cancer. To do this, your healthcare provider may order a procedure called a sentinel lymph node biopsy. The biopsy is done with a surgery to remove the node so that it can be examined. The main reason for a sentinel lymph node biopsy is to see if the cancer has spread beyond the main tumor. This will help determine the best kinds of treatment for you. It is an alternative to standard lymph node removal. In that procedure, more lymph nodes are removed from the area near the cancer. This is done whether or not they may have cancer cells. With a sentinel lymph node biopsy, more lymph nodes are removed only if there is cancer in the sentinel node. If the sentinel node does not have cancer cells, other nodes don't need to be removed. A sentinel lymph node biopsy is most often used in cases of breast cancer or melanoma. Sentinel lymph node biopsy is called a minimally invasive procedure. This means the risks are less than having more nodes removed. All surgeries have some risks. The most common risks of this procedure include: Allergic reaction to the contrast dye that is used to help find the sentinel lymph node Short-term reactions to the dye, such as discolored urine or stains on the skin Your own risks may vary according to your age, your general health, and the reason for your procedure. Talk with your healthcare provider to find out what risks may apply to you. Have any allergies, especially to anesthesia or medical dye Are taking a blood-thinning medicine, such as aspirin or warfarin Ask a family member or friend to take you home from the hospital. You can’t drive yourself if you are given sedation during the procedure. Follow any directions you are given for not eating or drinking before surgery. Follow all other instructions from your healthcare provider. You usually will have a sentinel lymph node biopsy done as an outpatient. This means you go home the same day. In some cases, you may need to stay overnight. The procedure often takes about 30 to 60 minutes. This is how the biopsy is often done: You may get a sedative medicine to help you relax. The surgeon will inject a special substance near the site of the tumor. This substance travels to the sentinel lymph node. It may be a tiny amount of radioactive material. Or it may be a blue dye. In some cases, both may be used.  The surgeon then uses a scanner to find the lymph node that contains the substance or the dye. This is the sentinel lymph node. Sometimes there can be more than 1 node. The surgeon will make a small cut (incision) in the skin near the node. He or she will remove the node. The biopsy site will then be closed and covered with a bandage. After the biopsy, you may feel some pain at the site of the surgery. You may be drowsy if you had anesthesia. Your healthcare provider will likely give you pain medicine. Pain should stop after a few days. You may have a little bleeding at the site of the biopsy. This is normal. Call your healthcare provider if you have any of these: After the biopsy, the lymph node is sent to a doctor called a pathologist. He or she cuts it into small pieces and looks at these with a microscope to check for cancer cells. Your medical team will tell you the results of your biopsy. Then your team will talk with you about your treatment plan. In many cases, more lymph nodes will need to be removed. This is most often done in a follow-up procedure. But in some cases, the pathologist can work quickly and more lymph nodes can be removed during your first procedure.",101,heavy flares swelling lymph nodes,-11.2066011428833,80
00b8910a-8107-4eef-9fad-e5e5c321f9ac,"Nomograms for Predicting the Risk of Arm Lymphedema after Axillary Dissection in Breast Cancer , –() Lymphedema (LE) after axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) is a multifactorial, chronic, and disabling condition that currently affects an estimated 4 million people worldwide. Although several risk factors have been described, it is difficult to estimate the risk in individual patients. We therefore developed nomograms based on a large data set. Clinicopathologic features were collected from a prospective cohort comprising 1,054 women with unilateral breast cancer undergoing ALND as part of their surgical treatment from August 2001 to November 2002. LE was defined as a volume difference of at least 200 ml between arms at 6 months or more after surgery. The cumulative incidence of LE was ascertained by the Kaplan–Meier method, and Cox proportional hazard models were used to predict the risk of developing LE on the basis of the available data at each time point: model 1, preoperatively; model 2, within 6 months from surgery; and model 3, at 6 months or later after surgery. The 5 year cumulative incidence of LE was 30.3%. Independent risk factors for LE were age, body mass index, ipsilateral arm chemotherapy infusions, level of ALND, location of radiotherapy field, development of postoperative seroma, infection, and early edema. When applied to the validation set, the concordance indices were 0.706, 0.729, and 0.736 for models 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The proposed nomograms can help physicians and patients predict the 5 year probability of LE after ALND for breast cancer. Free online versions of the nomograms are available at .

1e4cf852-b308-4e6c-8117-927b8f6493c5,"Nomograms for Predicting the Risk of Arm Lymphedema after Axillary Dissection in Breast Cancer , –() Lymphedema (LE) after axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) is a multifactorial, chronic, and disabling condition that currently affects an estimated 4 million people worldwide. Although several risk factors have been described, it is difficult to estimate the risk in individual patients. We therefore developed nomograms based on a large data set. Clinicopathologic features were collected from a prospective cohort comprising 1,054 women with unilateral breast cancer undergoing ALND as part of their surgical treatment from August 2001 to November 2002. LE was defined as a volume difference of at least 200 ml between arms at 6 months or more after surgery. The cumulative incidence of LE was ascertained by the Kaplan–Meier method, and Cox proportional hazard models were used to predict the risk of developing LE on the basis of the available data at each time point: model 1, preoperatively; model 2, within 6 months from surgery; and model 3, at 6 months or later after surgery. The 5 year cumulative incidence of LE was 30.3%. Independent risk factors for LE were age, body mass index, ipsilateral arm chemotherapy infusions, level of ALND, location of radiotherapy field, development of postoperative seroma, infection, and early edema. When applied to the validation set, the concordance indices were 0.706, 0.729, and 0.736 for models 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The proposed nomograms can help physicians and patients predict the 5 year probability of LE after ALND for breast cancer. Free online versions of the nomograms are available at .

dc0f1adc-c280-4916-a88f-cd4e252e4d4d,"Nomograms for Predicting the Risk of Arm Lymphedema after Axillary Dissection in Breast Cancer , –() Lymphedema (LE) after axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) is a multifactorial, chronic, and disabling condition that currently affects an estimated 4 million people worldwide. Although several risk factors have been described, it is difficult to estimate the risk in individual patients. We therefore developed nomograms based on a large data set. Clinicopathologic features were collected from a prospective cohort comprising 1,054 women with unilateral breast cancer undergoing ALND as part of their surgical treatment from August 2001 to November 2002. LE was defined as a volume difference of at least 200 ml between arms at 6 months or more after surgery. The cumulative incidence of LE was ascertained by the Kaplan–Meier method, and Cox proportional hazard models were used to predict the risk of developing LE on the basis of the available data at each time point: model 1, preoperatively; model 2, within 6 months from surgery; and model 3, at 6 months or later after surgery. The 5 year cumulative incidence of LE was 30.3%. Independent risk factors for LE were age, body mass index, ipsilateral arm chemotherapy infusions, level of ALND, location of radiotherapy field, development of postoperative seroma, infection, and early edema. When applied to the validation set, the concordance indices were 0.706, 0.729, and 0.736 for models 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The proposed nomograms can help physicians and patients predict the 5 year probability of LE after ALND for breast cancer. Free online versions of the nomograms are available at .

This podcast will be led by Dr. Judith Nudelman, a family physician and certified lymphedema therapist. Dr. Nudelman's interest in lymphedema began when she developed breast cancer related lymphedema and discovered a lack of awareness of this common long term side effect. ASCO would like to thank Dr. Nudelman for discussing this topic. : I'm Dr. Judith Nudelman. I'm a family physician. I'm also a patient with breast cancer related lymphedema, and I'm talking about it today because despite the fact that I'd been in practice for over 20 years, I really didn't know anything about lymphedema when I developed it myself, although I had a sense that I was at slightly higher risk. I did develop lymphedema very shortly after my initial surgery for breast cancer, and I had sought treatment, and that was actually under the care of two lymphedema therapists while I developed it. And yet I found that I really didn't know anything about lymphedema, and I really didn't understand the treatment or how to get the treatment that I needed. I actually found my support and guidance in an online forum where some women really devoted themselves to helping other women going through this. And ultimately we did create a website called , which is basically an evidence-based website to help patients with lymphedema. Lymphedema can be secondary, which is that you're not born with it, or it can be primary, that you're born with it. But there's actually an overlap where there have been studies that show that some of us who get lymphedema so easily probably have a genetic predisposition to get it. So what is lymphedema? Lymphedema is damage to the lymphatic system, which we all know about lymph nodes, but there are actually vessels that collect the lymphatic fluid which is a protein fluid, which also helps the immune system. It's really difficult to see it in real life other than the lymph nodes. And the lymphatic system kind of sits there quietly, but when it's damaged, it actually can cause swelling which we know about. That's the obvious problem that one can see, but it's actually a damaged immune system. It doesn't function well. You're predisposed to bad infections. So lymphedema can be as subtle as just some excess fluid in the tissues, but that's actually not a benign problem because when the fluid sits in the tissues, it can actually cause lots of inflammation and something we call fibrosis, a hardening of the tissue. And one of the really frustrating things I discovered about lymphedema was that there's no single diagnosis for it. Unfortunately we don't have a criteria to diagnose it. It's a clinical diagnosis. And in an effort to be objective and scientific, people have applied diagnostic criteria like a 10% volume increase or two centimeters bigger on one side than the other. But you know that there really isn't a firm scientific diagnosis. So it's really a clinical disease, and people have symptoms which are swelling—what I find most important is thickening of the tissues and the skin. Sometimes it's easy to measure, like when it's in the arms and the legs, but sometimes it's very hard to measure when it's in the head and neck, because head and neck cancer patients develop lymphedema very, very commonly both externally and internally, when it's in the breast, which is very common, or when it's in the abdomen, the trunk. So it's a problem that I find suffers from a lot of issues. One is the rampant lack of knowledge because it's not taught in medical school. The fact that people don't know how to get treatment, because the treatment really only came to the United States in 1990. And in 1998 the American Cancer Society looked at it and found that most physicians really didn't know much about lymphedema or its treatment. And I just recently found a journal article in my specialty released last month which reinforces that there is no treatment for lymphedema, and nothing could be further from the truth. So what part of cancer treatment predisposes you to lymphedema? Actually, all of it. Lymph nodes are removed both for staging and for local control of cancer. There are scars that are created in surgery and lymph can't flow across scars. Radiation damages the lymphatic system, and actually so do certain chemotherapeutic agents as well. So all of the components that effectively treat your cancer can harm your immune system. Also some of our immune systems just aren't that robust at the very beginning, so we really can't tolerate an insult to it very well. And as we get older, our lymphatic systems tend to fatigue and get less resilient over time. So basically, again, lymphedema is a damage to the lymphatic system. It can be caused by all the treatments that we get to cure or treat our cancers. And it's most obvious in the sense that it can cause swelling when the lymphatic system backs up, and the lymph fluid sits stagnant in the tissues. But there is a stage called latency stage where you really can't see the swelling, and that's the stage we'd like to keep lymphedema at. Lymphedema can occur at any point after treatment for your cancer. It's most common in the first three years, but the risk is actually lifelong. Again, my experience with lymphedema was that it came on very suddenly after my surgery for breast cancer. And one thing I did learn in further research is that the lymphatics are very delicate, and you really don't want to disrupt them while they're trying to heal. I'd had a sentinel biopsy, and I thought I needed to do a lot of range of motion of my shoulder. So I was reaching up and hanging from door frames, and actually that was the worst thing I could've done. I developed something called a seroma, a pocket of fluid, and then something called axillary web syndrome, a lot of scarring of my deep lymphatics. That probably doubled or tripled my risk of getting lymphedema. So the one thing I have learned from further education in lymphedema is that people who get surgery for breast cancer in their axilla to remove lymph nodes really shouldn't stretch through the axilla for a good ten to fourteen days after the surgery. You're not going to lose range of motion in your shoulder, and you're going to give your lymphatic system the opportunity to heal the best that it can. Also, if you get a seroma, a collection of fluid in the axilla, best to have it removed by your surgeon. Lymphedema—because it's a clinical diagnosis—the symptoms that you might feel can be heaviness, warmth, a sense of fullness. There's pain associated with it the way there's pain with any swelling. A sense of heaviness, and if you rub your skin or pinch it or pull it, you might feel that there's thickening in the skin where the fluid is being held. And what I've done to treat it and manage it is that I've found a wonderful lymphedema therapist, and I've learned how to do self-care at home because you need to live with this and manage it all of your life, or even manage the risk for it. So the self-care involves therapeutic exercises. For me, I actually wrap my arm and my hand every night. People can use different garments, but I find it works the best even though it is a lot of effort and effort I wish I didn't have to do. But the benefits are so powerful that it's worth it to me. I wear compression garments when I exercise, and I'm very careful when I fly. And I actually fly wrapped or in a compression garment because the barometric changes make my lymphedema worse. Also, I'm careful to avoid excess heat, damage to my skin. Sunburn is really important as well. But we also have discovered that exercise is really good for lymphedema because the lymphatic system works best when you contract the muscles, so I try and stay as active as I can. I know that I have to be cautious when I exercise my area at risk, which is my arm, so I try and do it thoughtfully and slowly. But I also do try and exercise as much as possible to stay fit. I try to avoid excess salt in my diet and drink plenty of fluids. I actually trained as a lymphedema therapist in 2012 because I wanted to be able to treat the patients that I saw and understand the treatment, and I found this really helpful to be able to treat my patients. I worked in radiation oncology, although I am a family practice doctor, for three years and I found that although my patients were wonderful and saw all the members of their team, nobody really seemed to own their lymphedema. People didn't really check for it or refer patients, and I've found a lot of lymphedema not just in breast cancer, but in prostate cancer, gynecologic cancers, in lung cancer, head and neck cancer, and melanoma. And I really also found what my patients needed was not just to be sent to a lymphedema therapist who is a physical therapist or occupational therapist, but also to have me advocate for them that they get the treatment that they needed, that the treatment not just be based on some volume reduction, but on helping them manage the disease and be able to evaluate themselves to see if things got worse, to manage their work requirements, and to have the garments that they needed. And know that the garments only last for about six months and need to be replaced, and need to be replaced also if there's any weight gain. Also unfortunately, I saw way too many physicians tell patients to just run out and get an ace wrap, and ace wraps are just far too elastic and really are dangerous. The kind of wraps we use in lymphedema are called short-stretch bandages. So what I discovered is that lymphedema is actually very common, much more common than we know. And I found if I asked, I found it. If I looked, I found it. And that because patients and physicians didn't know that there was effective treatment for it - and no one person seemed to feel that it was their job as part of the oncology treatment team to look for the lymphedema - patients weren't being asked and they weren't being examined. I would say be aware that lymphedema is a risk of all cancer treatments. Be aware of your body, and your body is changed due to cancer treatment but if you notice that you have a heaviness or a swelling, bring it to the attention of any of member of your treatment team who you feel comfortable with and get referred to a good lymphedema therapist. And there are websites to help you find a fully trained lymphedema therapist. Due to Medicare guidelines, lymphedema therapy is given by physical therapists and occupational therapists, but there are also many well-trained massage therapists who are out there who can assist in your treatment as well. What I would say is that my experience with being treated for breast cancer is that my treatment team focused on treating my cancer. Very often the treatment can harm other parts of our bodies and our new normal is often difficult to sort out, and that lymphedema for some reason just is not in the medical education and people are just still continue to be unaware of it. Patients often aren't aware that they can seek treatment for it. So I'd say be aware of it, bring it up, seek treatment for it. For some reason it's a disease that feels disfiguring and embarrassing. Also, I think as physicians, we don't want to think that we've actually caused harm to our patients, so for many reasons it's just something that tends to be overlooked, but there's good treatments. Working in radiation oncology, I found that I could find a lot of lymphedema and also help patients get control of their lymphedema. Yes, it can be a chronic, incurable, permanent problem, but it's also one that can be managed and something that you can learn to live with in a way that it really minimizes the impact on your life. Again, I would suggest for patients that they become educated on it, and I've worked to help physicians become educated on it as well. And just know that—be aware of your body, if you feel heaviness, swelling, warmth, changes in the configuration. One of things we talk about are that your bony prominences may become obscured a little bit: you just can't see your knuckles. You can't see the tendons on the back of your wrist. Your elbow doesn't look as sharp. There's thickening to your skin. Your pores may be more obvious. Head and neck cancer patients may feel it internally when they go to swallow or see it in their necks. You can feel a thickening in your abdomen or swelling in your legs. Be aware of these symptoms, and report them to any member of your treatment team to get treated for it. Treatment is very effective, and the earlier you catch the problem, the more effective the treatment. : Thank you Dr. Nudelman. More information on lymphedema can be found at .

ab2e298d-28ed-4f22-961e-b5ba3035c1f1,"ASCO: RT Alone OK for Some Node-Positive Breast Cancers by CHICAGO -- Breast cancer patients with a positive but nonpalpable sentinel lymph node may be better off with radiation than with further axillary surgery, the AMAROS trial affirmed. Recurrence rates came out similar, at 0.5% with completion axillary lymph node dissection and 1.0% with axillary radiotherapy over 5 years, Emiel Rutgers, MD, of the Netherlands Cancer Institute in Amsterdam, and colleagues found. Overall survival didn't differ between the groups either, they reported here at the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting. This study was published as an abstract and presented at a conference. These data and conclusions should be considered to be preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal. Breast cancer patients with a positive but nonpalpable sentinel lymph node have a reduced risk of lymphedema with radiation compared with surgery. Point out that recurrence rates came out similar, at 0.5% with completion axillary lymph node dissection and 1.0% with axillary radiotherapy over 5 years. But surgery doubled the lymphedema risk compared with radiation alone, at 40% versus 22% at year 1 and 28% versus 14% at year 5 (both <0.0001). These findings were seen as largely confirmatory of those reported at the meeting 2 years ago from the , which showed no advantage in survival or relapse prevention from routine axillary node dissection after discovering a positive sentinel node. It also confirms the importance of radiation for these patients, commented Elizabeth Mittendorf, MD, PhD, of the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, in an interview with . ""Those of us who have adopted Z0011, which in the U.S., we mostly have, have contended that a very important part of Z0011 was the fact that every patient was undergoing breast conservation so every patient was getting radiation,"" she said. ""You do need some treatment but it doesn't have to be surgery, the radiation is adequate by itself without doing further surgery."" The lower lymphedema risk of radiation in AMAROS was somewhat a surprise though, she suggested. ""If you had asked me before, I would have told you surgery and radiation are probably comparable with respect to the complication of lymphedema and this clearly shows that's not true,"" Mittendorf said. The randomized AMAROS trial included 1,425 women with early-stage, invasive breast tumors up to 5 cm in size that were clinically node-negative but yielded a positive sentinel lymph node biopsy. They were enrolled in the trial from 2001 to 2010. Disease-free survival rates were 87% with completion axillary node dissection and 83% with axillary dissection, which wasn't statistically significant at =0.1788. Overall survival was 93% at 5 years in both treatment groups. The surgery group also tended to have more shoulder movement impairment early in the trial and to report poorer quality of life with regard to movement but better quality of life related to swelling, but none of these differences were statistically significant. The researchers cautioned that the planned non-inferiority test was underpowered because of an unexpectedly low number of recurrences and deaths. Also, the trial enrolled a select group of women with relatively small tumors and no evidence of nodal metastases at presentation, so the results wouldn't generalize to those who come in with more advanced disease or have known large nodal metastases, Mittendorf added. Another limitation was the lack of a definition for lymphedema, which can occur across the spectrum from arm swelling resulting only in a feeling of heaviness to cases requiring compression garments and lifestyle changes, she noted. The study was supported by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Charitable Trust. The researchers reported no conflicts of interest.

ed768108-587a-45c3-82cf-7592aa67a374,"Medically reviewed by Debra Rose Wilson, Ph.D., MSN, R.N., IBCLC, AHN-BC, CHT — — Your lymphatic system helps eliminate your body’s waste. A healthy, active lymphatic system uses the natural movements of smooth muscle tissue to do this. However, surgery, medical conditions, or other damage can cause fluids to build up in your lymph system and your lymph nodes, a condition known as . If you’ve ever had a surgery on or involving your lymph nodes, your doctor may have suggested lymphatic drainage massage performed by a certified massage or physical therapist. However, lymphatic massage is not recommended for people with the following conditions: Procedures that affect or remove your lymph nodes can cause lymphedema as a side effect. Lymphedema will only occur in the area near a surgical site. For example, if you have lymph nodes removed as a part of cancer surgery to your left breast, only your left arm, not your right, might be affected with lymphedema. Lymphedema can also occur as a result of an injury or medical conditions such as or in the body. To move waste fluids away from the damaged area, lymphatic massage, which uses a gentle pressure, can help. It’s one technique used to reduce lymphedema. Raakhee Patel, PT, DPT, CLT, is a physical therapist and certified lymphedema specialist who trains people to perform their own lymphatic massage after surgery. “We don’t talk enough about lymphedema,” says Patel. Fluid build-up is uncomfortable and causes pain and heaviness in the affected area. And, according to Patel, “Stage 3 lymphedema can be devastating,” causing significant depression and lack of mobility that could complicate healing. When performing a lymphatic massage, it’s important that the massage include more than just the affected area. The entire lymphatic system of the body, except the head, right side of the chest, and right arm, drains near the left shoulder. So, a massage should include all areas to drain properly. Patel teaches two stages of lymphatic massage: clearing and reabsorption. The purpose of clearing is to create a vacuum with gentle pressure so that the area is prepared to bring in more fluid, creating a flushing effect. located directly under the collarbone Clearing motions can be repeated as many as 10 times a day. Patel advises, “Always massage both sides of your body, not just the side with the lymphedema.” There are three stages to clearing. Be sure to clear the supraclavicular area, axillary area, and inner-elbow area, in that order. Cross your arms on your chest, with your hands resting just below the collarbones. Then lift your elbows slowly. The muscle action is as much pressure required to prepare the area to flush lymphatic fluid. Use your other hand to gently scoop the underarm area from top to bottom. The only pressure required is gentle enough to move the surface of the skin. Use the fingers of your opposite hand to gently pull the skin inside the elbow an inch at a time. Only very gentle pressure is required. “In lymphatic massage, you’re only working the superficial skin structure,” says Patel. That’s where the fluid is trapped. The goal of lymphatic massage on the legs is to open the lymphatic vessels to let excess fluid drain back up into the lymph nodes located in the groin. There are different techniques used to perform lymphatic massage on the legs, but all have the same end goal: to release the fluid to go back up through the lymph nodes. To perform a lymphatic massage on the legs, you can follow these steps: Perform lymphatic massage of the upper body before beginning with the legs. Follow the three stages of clearing in the supraclavicular area, the axillary area, and the inner-elbow area, in that order. This ensures that the system is clear to allow fluid to drain up. Use light pressure. If you can feel the muscles underneath your skin, you are pressing too hard. Begin the leg massage at the furthest point away from the injury or affected area and work your way down. For example, if your ankle has swelling, start the massage on the upper part of the leg. Starting at the top of the leg, put one hand on the inside of the leg and the other on the back of your leg. With gentle pressure, stretch the skin from the inside of your leg up and out, toward your hip. Continue this motion down the leg until you reach the knee. When you reach the knee, stretch the skin up, with alternating hands, toward your armpit. You have now completed the clearing step of the lymphatic massage. The second part of lymphatic massage is reabsorption. To perform this stage of massage: Begin at the affected part of the body farthest from the core of the body. For example, begin at the tips of the fingers if you have lymphedema in your hand, arm, and shoulder. Using a gentle, sweeping motion with just enough pressure to shift the surface of the skin, massage from fingertip to hand, from hand to elbow, and from elbow to shoulder. “Patient compliance is the hardest part of self-care, especially for women, who are so used to taking care of others,” says Patel. She advises people to set aside at least 20 minutes a day for lymphatic drainage massage. “If you only have a brief amount of time, perform the clearing stage of massage.” To begin reabsorption on the legs, you will use a pumping motion behind the knee: Pump the back of the knee with a rolling, upward motion 10 to 15 times. Your knee is now ready to take in fluid from the lower leg, so you can proceed to massaging the lower legs: Put one hand on the top of the shin and the other behind the leg. Stretch the skin in an upward motion, then release it. Repeat down through the ankle and feet, always stroking upward. End the massage by gently pushing fluid in the toes upward with your fingers. How do you know if lymphatic drainage massage is effective? “This is a maintenance technique,” says Patel. “Your lymphedema should not get worse if you regularly practice lymphatic massage.” Also, drink water. Well-hydrated tissue helps moves out waste materials. using a compression sleeve to prevent fluid buildup seeing a qualified therapist for in-office drainage massage When choosing a therapist, learn as much about their education as possible. “Massage is very good for you, but deep tissue massage can be too heavy for someone with lymphedema, so don’t assume you can just go to a massage therapist.” Look for someone who is a certified lymphedema therapist (CLT) and preferably a physical or massage therapist with oncology and pathology training.

697b3446-bfa5-47ef-9b1e-f8e1a2343521,"Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research What has research shown about the use of SLNB in breast cancer? What has research shown about the use of SLNB in melanoma? Lymph nodes are small round organs that are part of the body’s . The lymphatic system is a part of the . It consists of a network of vessels and organs that contains , a clear fluid that carries infection-fighting as well as fluid and waste products from the body’s cells and tissues. In a person with cancer, lymph can also carry cancer cells that have broken off from the main tumor.   Lymph is filtered through lymph nodes, which are found widely throughout the body and are connected to one another by . Groups of lymph nodes are located in the neck, underarms, chest, abdomen, and groin. The lymph nodes contain white blood cells ( and ) and other types of immune system cells. Lymph nodes trap bacteria and viruses, as well as some damaged and abnormal cells, helping the immune system fight disease.  Many types of cancer spread through the lymphatic system, and one of the earliest sites of spread for these cancers is nearby lymph nodes. A sentinel lymph node is defined as the first lymph node to which cancer cells are most likely to spread from a . Sometimes, there can be more than one sentinel lymph node. A sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is a procedure in which the sentinel lymph node is identified, removed, and examined to determine whether cancer cells are present. It is used in people who have already been diagnosed with cancer. A negative SLNB result suggests that cancer has not yet spread to nearby lymph nodes or other organs. A positive SLNB result indicates that cancer is present in the sentinel lymph node and that it may have spread to other nearby lymph nodes (called ) and, possibly, other organs. This information can help a doctor determine the stage of the cancer (extent of the disease within the body) and develop an appropriate treatment plan. First, the sentinel lymph node (or nodes) must be located. To do so, a surgeon injects a substance, a blue dye, or both near the tumor. The surgeon then uses a device to detect lymph nodes that contain the radioactive substance or looks for lymph nodes that are stained with the blue dye. Once the sentinel lymph node is located, the surgeon makes a small incision (about 1/2 inch) in the overlying skin and removes the node. The sentinel node is then checked for the presence of cancer cells by a . If cancer is found, the surgeon may remove additional lymph nodes, either during the same biopsy procedure or during a follow-up surgical procedure. SLNB may be done on an outpatient basis or may require a short stay in the hospital. SLNB is usually done at the same time the is removed. In some cases the procedure can also be done before or even after (depending on how much the have been disrupted) removal of the tumor.  SNLB helps doctors cancers and estimate the risk that tumor cells have developed the ability to spread to other parts of the body. If the sentinel node is negative for cancer, a patient may be able to avoid more extensive lymph node surgery, reducing the potential complications associated with having many lymph nodes removed.  All surgery to remove lymph nodes, including SLNB, can have harmful , although removal of fewer lymph nodes is usually associated with fewer side effects, particularly serious ones such as . The potential side effects include:  Lymphedema, or tissue swelling. During lymph node surgery, leading to and from the sentinel node or group of nodes are cut. This disrupts the normal flow of lymph through the affected area, which may lead to an abnormal buildup of that can cause swelling. Lymphedema may cause pain or discomfort in the affected area, and the overlying skin may become thickened or hard.  The risk of lymphedema increases with the number of lymph nodes removed. There is less risk with the removal of only the sentinel lymph node. In the case of extensive lymph node removal in an armpit or groin, the swelling may affect an entire arm or leg. In addition, there is an increased risk of infection in the affected area or limb. Very rarely, chronic lymphedema due to extensive lymph node removal may cause a cancer of the called .  , or a mass or lump caused by the buildup of lymph fluid at the site of the surgery Numbness, tingling, swelling, bruising, or pain at the site of the surgery, and an increased risk of infection Skin or  to the blue dye used in SNLB A —that is, cancer cells are not seen in the sentinel lymph node even though they have already spread to or other parts of the body. A false-negative biopsy result gives the patient and the doctor a false sense of security about the extent of cancer in the patient’s body. No. SLNB is most commonly used to help stage and . It is sometimes used to stage () and (). However, it is being studied with other cancer types, including  and  cancers (), and , , , , , and  cancers (). What has research shown about the use of SLNB in breast cancer? Breast cancer cells are most likely to spread first to lymph nodes located in the , or armpit area, next to the affected breast. However, in breast cancers close to the center of the chest (near the ), cancer cells may spread first to lymph nodes inside the chest (under the breastbone, called internal mammary nodes) before they can be detected in the axilla. The number of lymph nodes in the axilla varies from person to person; the usual range is between 20 and 40. Historically, all of these were removed (in an operation called , or ALND) in women diagnosed with breast cancer. This was done for two reasons: to help stage the breast cancer and to help prevent a of the disease. (Regional recurrence of breast cancer occurs when breast cancer cells that have migrated to nearby lymph nodes give rise to a new tumor.)  However, because removing multiple lymph nodes at the same time increases the risk of harmful , clinical trials were launched to investigate whether just the sentinel lymph nodes could be removed. Two NCI-sponsored  have shown that SLNB without ALND is sufficient for breast cancer and for preventing regional recurrence in women who have no clinical signs of axillary lymph node , such as a lump or swelling in the armpit that may cause discomfort, and who are treated with surgery,  , and . In one trial, involving 5,611 women, researchers randomly assigned participants to receive just SLNB, or SLNB plus ALND, after surgery (). Those women in the two groups whose sentinel lymph node(s) were negative for cancer (a total of 3,989 women) were then followed for an average of 8 years. The researchers found no differences in or between the two groups of women.  The other trial included 891 women with tumors up to 5 cm in the breast and one or two positive sentinel lymph nodes. Patients were randomly assigned to receive SLNB only or to receive ALND after SLNB (). All of the women were treated with , and most also received adjuvant systemic therapy and to the affected breast. After extended follow-up, the two groups of women had similar 10-year overall survival, disease-free survival, and regional recurrence rates (). What has research shown about the use of SLNB in melanoma? Research indicates that patients with melanoma who have undergone SLNB and whose sentinel lymph node is found to be negative for cancer and who have no clinical signs that cancer has spread to other lymph nodes can be spared more extensive lymph node surgery at the time of primary tumor removal. A of 71 studies with data from 25,240 patients found that the risk of in patients with a negative SLNB was 5% or less (). Findings from the (MSLT-II) also confirmed the safety of SLNB in people with melanoma with positive sentinel lymph nodes and no clinical evidence of other lymph node involvement. This large , which included more than 1,900 patients, compared the potential benefit of SLNB plus the immediate removal of the remaining regional lymph nodes (called completion lymph node dissection, or CLND) with SNLB plus , which included regular examination of the remaining regional lymph nodes and treatment with CLND if signs of additional lymph node were detected.  After a follow-up of 43 months, patients who had undergone immediate CLND did not have better melanoma-specific survival than those who had undergone SLNB with CLND only if signs of additional lymph node metastasis appear (86% of participants in both groups had not died from melanoma at 3 years) ().  Mehralivand S, van der Poel H, Winter A, et al.

By The lymphatic system is a network of tissues and organs that help rid the body of toxins, waste and other unwanted materials. The primary function of the lymphatic system is to transport lymph, a fluid containing infection-fighting white blood cells, throughout the body.  The lymphatic system primarily consists of lymphatic vessels, which are similar to the veins and capillaries of . The vessels are connected to lymph nodes, where the lymph is filtered. The tonsils, adenoids, and thymus are all part of the lymphatic system. There are hundreds of lymph nodes in . They are located deep inside the body, such as around the lungs and heart, or closer to the surface, such as under the arm or groin, according to the American Cancer Society. The lymph nodes are found from the head to around the knee area.  The , which is located on the left side of the body just above the kidney, is the largest lymphatic organ, according to the (NLM). ""The spleen . . . acts as a blood filter; it controls the amount of red blood cells and blood storage in the body, and helps to fight infection,"" said Jordan Knowlton, an advanced registered nurse practitioner at the University of Florida Health Shands Hospital.  If the spleen detects potentially dangerous bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms in the blood, it — along with the lymph nodes — creates white blood cells called lymphocytes, which act as defenders against invaders. The lymphocytes produce antibodies to kill the foreign microorganisms and stop infections from spreading. Humans can live without a spleen, although people who have lost their spleen to disease or injury are more prone to infections. The thymus is located in the chest just above the heart, according to . This small organ stores immature lymphocytes (specialized white blood cells) and prepares them to become active T cells, which help destroy infected or cancerous cells.  Tonsils are large clusters of lymphatic cells found in the pharynx. According to the , they are the body's ""first line of defense as part of the immune system. They sample bacteria and viruses that enter the body through the mouth or nose."" They sometimes become infected, and although tonsillectomies occur much less frequently today than they did in the 1950s, it is still among the most common operations performed and typically follows frequent throat infections. Lymph is a clear and colorless fluid; the word ""lymph"" comes from the Latin word , which means ""connected to water,"" according to the .  Plasma leaves the body's cells once it has delivered its nutrients and removed debris. Most of this fluid returns to the venous circulation through tiny blood vessels called venules and continues as venous blood. The remainder becomes lymph, according to the Mayo Clinic. Unlike blood, which flows throughout the body in a continue loop, lymph flows in only one direction — upward toward the neck. Lymphatic vessels connect to two subclavian veins, which are located on either sides of the neck near the collarbones, and the fluid re-enters the circulatory system, according to the Mayo Clinic. Diseases and disorders of the lymphatic system are typically treated by immunologists. Vascular surgeons, dermatologists, oncologists and physiatrists also get involved in treatment of various lymphatic ailments. There are also lymphedema therapists who specialize in the manual drainage of the lymphatic system. The most common diseases of the lymphatic system are enlargement of the lymph nodes (also known as ), swelling due to lymph node blockage (also known as ) and cancers involving the lymphatic system, according to Dr. James Hamrick, chief of medical oncology and hematology at in Atlanta. When bacteria are recognized in the lymph fluid, the lymph nodes make more infection-fighting white blood cells, which can cause swelling. The swollen nodes can sometimes be felt in the neck, underarms and groin, according to the NLM. Lymphadenopathy is usually caused by infection, inflammation, or cancer. Infections that cause lymphadenopathy include bacterial infections such as strep throat, locally infected skin wounds, or viral infections such as mononucleosis or HIV infection, Hamrick stated. ""The enlargement of the lymph nodes may be localized to the area of infection, as in strep throat, or more generalized as in HIV infection. In some areas of the body the enlarged lymph nodes are palpable, while others are to deep to feel and can be seen on CT scan or MRI."" Inflammatory or autoimmune conditions occur when a person's immune system is active, and can result in enlargement of lymph nodes. This can happen in lupus, according to Hamrick.  This refers to cancer of the lymph nodes. It occurs when lymphocytes grow and multiply uncontrollably. There are a number of different types of lymphoma, according to Dr. Jeffrey P. Sharman director of research at and medical director of hematology research for the U.S. Oncology Network. ""The first 'branch point' is the difference between Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL),"" Sharman said. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is more common of the two, according to the Lymphoma Research Foundation.  The most common types of NHL are follicular, which accounts for about 30 percent of all NHL cases; diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), which comprises 40 to 50 percent of NHL cases; and Burkitt's lymphoma, which accounts for 5 percent of NHL cases. ""The remainder of cases makes up the bewildering complexity of NHL,"" Sharman said. ""Though there can be a significant range within an individual category, the clinical approach to each category is unique and the expectations of patient outcome varies by category,"" Sharman said. When a person has had surgery and/or radiation to remove a cancer, the lymphatic flow back to the heart and can result in swelling or , Hamrick noted. This most commonly occurs in women who have had surgery to remove a breast cancer. Part of the operation to remove the breast cancer involves removing lymph nodes in the armpit.  The more lymph nodes removed the higher the risk of chronic bothersome swelling and pain due to lymphedema in the arm, Hamrick explained. ""Fortunately, modern surgical techniques are allowing for fewer lymph nodes to be removed, and thus fewer cases of severe lymphedema for breast cancer survivors."" Some interesting research has been done on why people possibly get lymphoma. For example, VU University Medical Center in Amsterdam researched a nationwide Dutch pathology registry between 1990 and 2016. From the research, they estimated that the risk of developing anaplastic large cell lymphoma in the breast after getting implants is 1 in 35,000 at age 50, 1 in 12,000 at age 70, and 1 in 7,000 at age 75. The study was published in the Jan. 4, 2018 issue of the journal JAMA Oncology. This disease refers to a group of inflammatory disorders that cause lymph node enlargement and can result in multiple-organ dysfunction, according to the . While not specifically a cancer, it is a similar to a lymphoma and is often treated with chemotherapy. It can be unicentric (one lymph node) or multicentric, involving multiple lymph nodes.  This disease involves multiple cysts or lesions formed from lymphatic vessels, according to the . It is thought to be the result of a genetic mutation.  Tonsil stones are another problem that can happen to the lymphatic system. Small bits of debris catches on the tonsils and white blood cells attack the debris and leave behind hard a hard biofilm that breaths oxygen. They are not smooth like regular stones, though. ""Instead, they look like prunes, with crevices where bacteria can accumulate,"" said Chetan Kaher, a dentist in London. Usually, tonsil stones fall away and get swallowed, but sometimes they need to be manually removed. Diseases of the lymphatic system are usually diagnosed when lymph nodes are enlarged, Hamrick noted. This may be discovered when the lymph nodes become enlarged enough to be felt (""palpable lymphadenopathy"") or are seen on imaging studies such as CT scans or MRIs. The majority of enlarged lymph nodes are not dangerous; they are the body's way of fighting off an infection, such as a viral upper respiratory infection. If the lymph nodes become significantly enlarged and persist longer than the infection, then they are more worrisome. There is no specific size cutoff, but typically nodes that persist at larger than a centimeter are more worrisome and warrant examination by a doctor. Common symptoms of any lymphatic disorder include swelling of the arm or groin, weight loss, fever and night sweats, according to Stephanie Bernik, chief of surgical oncology at in New York. ""A PET or CAT scan is usually ordered to further investigate.""  The diagnosis of lymphadenopathy depends on the location of the abnormal lymph nodes and other things that are going on with the patient. If the patient has a known infection, then the lymph nodes can simply be followed to await resolution with treatment of the infection. If the nodes are growing quickly and there is no obvious explanation then typically a biopsy is warranted to look for a cancer or an infection. If the node can be felt then this can be done at the bedside with a needle, according to Hamrick.  If the lymph node is deeper, such as in the abdomen or pelvis, Hamrick said the biopsy might need to be done by an interventional radiologist using image guidance to place the needle into the node. Sometimes the biopsy needs to be done by a surgeon in the operating room. This is often where the most tissue can be obtained to make a diagnosis, he said. With many types of lymphoma and leukemia, there are unique treatment options for each type, according to Sharman. ""There is no one 'summary' of treatment options. Treatment options can include traditional chemotherapy, immunotherapy (such as using antibodies or immune modulating drugs), and even radiation."" Treatment of lymphatic diseases depends on treating the underlying cause. Infections are treated with antibiotics, supportive care (while the immune system does its job, as in a viral infection) or antivirals. Lymphedema can be treated by elevation, compression and physical therapy. Cancers of the lymphatic system are treated by chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery, or a combination of those modalities, Hamrick noted.  In last several years, Sharman noted that there has been explosion of new treatment options. ""There are a handful of newly approved drugs that target the actual disease causing processes within cells. Ibrutinib, idelalisib, obinutuzumab, lenalidomide have been approved in various indications and it is likely that we will see multiple more in coming years.""

Schubert, After axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), patients are cautioned against ipsilateral interventional procedures to avoid the theoretical increased risk of postoperative complications, particularly lymphedema. The authors' goal was to evaluate the complications of elective hand surgery after ALND. The authors reviewed patients presenting to their hand clinic from 1998 to 2011, selecting those with a diagnosis of breast cancer or melanoma and a history of previous ALND; the authors excluded those treated nonoperatively and those treated with elective surgery in the contralateral hand. Average age of the 22 patients meeting the criteria (20 with a history of breast cancer, 6 with preexisting lymphedema) was 53.9 years (range, 26.7 to 73.6 years) at the time of ALND and 63.1 years (range, 31.7 to 83.5 years) at the time of hand surgery. Average interval between surgeries was 9.2 years (range, 8 days to 37.3 years). Follow-up averaged 9.2 months (range, 8 days to 41.7 months). Fifteen patients were surveyed for long-term postoperative results (average surgery-to-survey interval, 4.3 years [range, 1 to 11.9 years]). Fifteen patients had uneventful postoperative recoveries, 4 had peri-incisional erythema requiring oral antibiotics, 1 had incisional pain and scarring, 1 had chronic wound-healing issues, and 1 had a dehiscence requiring a return to the operating room. In the 15 patients who completed the follow-up survey, there was no disease exacerbation in the 3 patients with preexisting lymphedema, and there were no new cases of lymphedema. Routine minor hand surgery did not result in lymphedema and did not increase existing lymphedema in these patients with previous ipsilateral ALND, but almost one-third of them had short-term complications in the postoperative recovery period.

0169da64-231c-4096-aebe-2b035e8ccb11,"Linfedema (PDQ®)–Versión para profesionales de salud El linfedema es una inflamación que se presenta cuando el líquido linfático rico en proteínas se acumula en el tejido intersticial. El líquido linfático puede contener proteínas plasmáticas, células sanguíneas extravasculares, exceso de agua y productos parenquimales.[] El linfedema es una de las complicaciones del cáncer o su tratamiento menos entendida, relativamente subestimada y menos investigada. El Institute of Medicine of the National Academies publicó un informe en 2006 en el que recomienda un ""plan de cuidados de supervivencia"" para los pacientes de cáncer. Este incorpora información sobre los efectos tardíos del tratamiento, los comportamientos para el manejo de la salud, el manejo de las enfermedades y la vigilancia de la recidiva.[,] El Institute of Medicine también resaltó fallas críticas en la transición hacia la supervivencia, particularmente en lo que se refiere a proveer educación sobre los efectos tardíos del tratamiento. El linfedema es un aspecto importante que los médicos que atienden a pacientes de cáncer deben tomar en cuenta por su relativa alta frecuencia y sus significativos efectos en los aspectos funcionales y de calidad de vida del paciente, incluso cuando se toman en cuenta otros factores predictivos como la condición socioeconómica, la disminución de la amplitud de movimiento, la edad y la obesidad.[] En este sumario se analizan temas relacionados con la anatomía y fisiopatología del linfedema relacionado con el cáncer, sus manifestaciones clínicas, diagnóstico y tratamiento. No se analiza el linfedema primario (congénito) ni el linfedema no relacionado con el cáncer (por ejemplo, la celulitis recidivante, las enfermedades del tejido conjuntivo y las infecciones. En este sumario, a menos que se indique lo contrario, se tratan temas relacionados con datos probatorios y prácticas referidas a los adultos. Los datos probatorios y la aplicación a la práctica referida a los niños pueden diferir significativamente de la información pertinente a los adultos. Cuando la información específica sobre la atención de los niños esté disponible, se resumirá bajo su propio encabezado. El sistema linfático humano generalmente incluye los vasos linfáticos superficiales o primarios que forman una red dérmica compleja de canales en forma de capilares que drenan en vasos linfáticos secundarios localizados en el espacio subdérmico. Estos vasos linfáticos primarios y secundarios van paralelos a las venas superficiales y drenan en una tercera capa de vasos linfáticos más profunda localizada en la grasa subcutánea adyacente a la fascia. Una barrera muscular y numerosas válvulas ayudan a que el flujo linfático activo siga un recorrido unidireccional hacia los ganglios linfáticos secundarios y subcutáneos. Los vasos linfáticos primarios carecen de barrera muscular y no tienen válvulas. También hay un sistema intramuscular de vasos linfáticos paralelo a las arterias profundas y drena en los compartimientos musculares, las articulaciones y las membranas sinoviales. Los sistemas linfáticos superficiales y profundos posiblemente funcionen en forma independiente, excepto en los estados anormales, aunque hay pruebas de que se comunican cerca de los ganglios linfáticos.[] La linfa drena desde las extremidades inferiores hacia el tronco linfático lumbar, que se une al tronco linfático intestinal y la cisterna del quilo para formar el conducto torácico que vacía en la vena subclavia izquierda. Los vasos linfáticos del brazo izquierdo drenan en el tronco linfático subclavio izquierdo y luego en la vena subclavia izquierda. Los canales linfáticos del brazo derecho drenan en el tronco subclavio derecho y luego en la vena subclavia derecha. Una de las funciones del sistema linfático es devolver el exceso de líquido y las proteínas de los espacios intersticiales al sistema vascular de la sangre. Debido a que los vasos linfáticos a menudo carecen de una membrana basal, pueden reabsorber moléculas demasiado grandes para la captación venosa. Los mecanismos del edema clínico incluyen un aumento de la filtración capilar arteriovenosa y una disminución de la absorción del líquido intersticial. Las causas del aumento de la filtración capilar incluyen el aumento de la presión hidrostática en los capilares, la disminución de la presión del tejido y un aumento de la permeabilidad de las membranas. La reducción de la absorción intersticial se puede deber a la disminución de la presión oncótica del plasma, a un aumento de la presión oncótica del líquido tisular y a una obstrucción linfática. La aparición del linfedema secundario es a menudo insidiosa. Sin embargo, puede ser provocada repentinamente por una inflamación local debida a causas tales como una infección o una lesión en una extremidad. Por lo tanto, se debe evaluar a los pacientes en busca de pruebas de celulitis. Clásicamente, el linfedema se caracteriza por una hinchazón sin fóvea que por lo general afecta los dedos. Los estadios tempranos del linfedema se manifiestan con edema con fóvea hasta que aparece la fibrosis. La distribución de la hinchazón se puede restringir solo a la parte proximal o a la parte distal del miembro. El linfedema también puede predisponer a infecciones recidivantes de la piel.[] El linfedema puede y de hecho se presenta en el tronco, además de las extremidades. Por ejemplo, la radioterapia a las paredes torácicas está relacionada con la presentación de edema sobre todo en el seno irradiado.[,] En algunos informes se indica una tasa de prevalencia de linfedema de hasta 75 % en pacientes de cáncer de cabeza y cuello; las dosis altas de radiación y la cirugía combinada son factores de riesgo.[] Los pacientes con linfedema pueden expresar una amplia gama de molestias, como pesadez o sensación de llenura relacionada con el peso de la extremidad, sensación de piel ajustada o disminución de la flexibilidad de la articulación afectada. La textura de la piel se puede volver hiperqueratósica, con lesiones cutáneas verrugosas y vesiculares. Cuando están afectadas las extremidades superiores, el paciente puede tener dificultades para vestir la zona afectada o para usar relojes o brazaletes que antes le calzaban bien. Las similares dificultades por el linfedema de las extremidades inferiores incluyen una sensación de piel ajustada o dificultad para usar calzado, picazón en las piernas o los dedos de los pies, sensación de quemadura en las piernas o trastornos del sueño y caída de cabello. La locomoción puede ser difícil por el aumento de tamaño y peso de la extremidad afectada. También pueden estar afectadas las actividades cotidianas, los pasatiempos y la capacidad de realizar las tareas laborales previas. Se encontró que los sobrevivientes de cáncer de mama con linfedema en el brazo pueden estar más discapacitados y tener una calidad de vida más precaria y mayor aflicción psicológica que los sobrevivientes sin linfedema.[,] Además, las mujeres que notifican hinchazón informan tener una calidad de vida inferior en múltiples evaluaciones funcionales.[] El linfedema se puede presentar después de cualquier cáncer o su tratamiento que afecta el drenaje de los ganglios linfáticos. Se ha notificado que se presenta a los pocos días y hasta 30 años después del tratamiento para el cáncer de mama.[] Ochenta por ciento de pacientes experimentan su aparición en un plazo de tres años a partir de la cirugía; el resto presenta edema a una tasa anual de 1%.[] El linfedema de las extremidades superiores se presenta con mayor frecuencia después del cáncer de mama; el linfedema de las extremidades inferiores se presenta con mayor frecuencia con cáncer de útero, cáncer de próstata, linfoma o melanoma.[] Un estudio amplio con base en la población sustenta las pruebas de que el linfedema de las extremidades inferiores es algo que experimenta una gran proporción de mujeres luego del tratamiento de cáncer ginecológico, con la prevalencia más alta (36%) entre las sobrevivientes de cáncer de vulva y la prevalencia más baja (5%) entre las sobrevivientes de cáncer de ovario.[] No hay uniformidad en los datos sobre la incidencia y la prevalencia de linfedema después del cáncer de mama; posiblemente, debido por las diferencias en el diagnóstico, las diferentes características de los pacientes estudiados y un seguimiento inadecuado para captar la presentación demorada del trastorno. La incidencia general del linfedema del brazo puede oscilar entre 8% y 56% dos años después de la cirugía.[] En un subestudio longitudinal del ensayo American College of Surgeons Oncology Group (ACOSOG)/Alliance Z1071 sobre cáncer de mama, los informes de pacientes con la incidencia acumulada a 3 años de hinchazón y pesadez del brazo fueron en realidad más bajos que los hallazgos objetivos.[] Es importante diagnosticar y tratar el linfedema cuando es leve debido a que los pacientes con linfedema ligero componen la cohorte que da lugar a un linfedema grave y debilitante que puede prevenirse. Las mujeres con linfedema leve presentan tres veces más probabilidades de padecer linfedema grave que las mujeres sin linfedema.[] Los pacientes sometidos a cirugía axilar o radioterapia axilar para el cáncer de mama tienen un riesgo más alto de contraer linfedema del brazo. Las convenciones previas indicaban que la positividad ganglionar era un factor predisponente del linfedema en pacientes de cáncer de mama.[] De hecho, un estudio encontró que, con respecto al control de la radiación de la axila, hay una relación inversamente proporcional entre la positividad ganglionar y el volumen del brazo.[] Cuando se compara con un muestreo axilar solo, la mastectomía parcial o total seguida de disección completa del ganglio linfático axilar aumenta en forma significativa las probabilidades de que el paciente sufra de edema del brazo. Por ejemplo, en una serie de 100 mujeres sometidas a mastectomía parcial o total y, luego, a una disección completa del ganglio linfático axilar o muestreo axilar, el edema del brazo se presentó en más pacientes sometidas a disección axilar de ganglio linfático que las que solo se sometieron a un muestreo axilar (30% frente a 0%)[] Además, el alcance de la disección del ganglio linfático aumenta el riesgo de presentar edema en el brazo. Por ejemplo, en una serie de 381 mujeres sometidas a mastectomía segmentaria y disección de ganglio linfático axilar, las mujeres a las que se les extirparon 10 o más ganglios linfáticos tuvieron mayores probabilidades de presentar síntomas en el brazo durante el primer año que las mujeres que tenían pocos ganglios linfáticos en el espécimen (53% frente a 33%) en los próximos dos años (33% frente a 20%, respectivamente).[] Como lo muestra un estudio aleatorizado en fase lll () de disección de ganglios linfáticos en mujeres que tenían cáncer de mama en estadios l o llA y un ganglio centinela positivo, la disección de ganglio centinela ha ganado preferencia sobre la disección de ganglio linfático axilar para la estadificación axilar de la enfermedad temprana debido a la disminución de la morbilidad y los beneficios cuestionables de supervivencia de la disección de ganglios linfáticos axilares.[][] Varios estudios mostraron que el linfedema es más frecuente en pacientes de cáncer de mama sometidas a disección de ganglio linfático axilar que en aquellas sometidas a biopsia del ganglio linfático centinela.[][] Un estudio evaluó a 30 pacientes con carcinoma invasor unilateral de mama sometidas a biopsia de ganglio linfático centinela y a 30 pacientes sometidas a disección de ganglio linfático axilar. Este estudio encontró una tasa de 20% de presentación de linfedema en el grupo con disección del ganglio linfático axilar en comparación con 0% en el grupo de biopsia del ganglio linfático centinela.[] Las tasas de linfedema entre mujeres que se someten a biopsia de ganglio linfático centinela es entre 5 y 17%, dependiendo del umbral del diagnóstico y la duración de seguimiento.[-] La mayoría de linfedemas son leves.[][] Entre todos los pacientes de cáncer de mama, la obesidad o el sobrepeso puede predisponer a las mujeres al linfedema después del tratamiento del cáncer de mama.[,][] Un estudio bien realizado de manera prospectiva, siguió a 138 pacientes con cáncer de mama durante 30 meses después del diagnóstico. Las personas con un índice de masa corporal de 30 o mayor al momento del diagnóstico tuvieron 3,6 veces más probabilidades de presentar linfedema, pero la ganancia de peso después del diagnóstico no estuvo asociada con esto.[] Algunos estudios correlacionaron el grado de linfedema y el grado de obesidad.[][] De igual manera, entre las supervivientes jóvenes de cáncer de mama se relacionó una inflamación persistente con la extirpación de más ganglios linfáticos y con la obesidad.[] No se conoce la relación que existe entre la obesidad y la presentación de linfedema, en cuanto a la respuesta a la dosis. Tampoco ha habido estudios que determinen si la pérdida de peso entre pacientes en riesgo de presentar linfedema reduciría el riesgo. En este momento, no es posible orientar a los pacientes con relación a la respuesta a la dosis y su relación con la pérdida de peso y la reducción del riesgo o la relación del peso con el riesgo más bajo de linfedema incidental. Otros factores de riesgo para la presentación del linfedema son los siguientes: Radiación local (en la región axilar, inguinal, pélvica o supraclavicular). Tumor que causa obstrucción linfática de los ganglios cervicales, torácicos, axilares, pélvicos o abdominales anteriores. Cicatrización patológica de los conductos linfáticos subclavios derecho o izquierdo debida a cirugía o radiación. Tumores intrapélvicos o intrabdominales que afectan o comprimen directamente los vasos linfáticos o la cisterna del quilo y el conducto torácico. Más o menos, alrededor de un tercio de las pacientes (y la mayoría de afroamericanas con cáncer) presentan enfermedad regional y ganglios linfáticos positivos,[] y por tanto requieren de una disección completa de los ganglios linfáticos axilares, muchas se someten a radiación adicional al lecho de los ganglios linfáticos axilares y supraclaviculares. El linfedema es un efecto adverso persistente del tratamiento del cáncer que continua presentándose mucho tiempo después en el futuro, a pesar del aumento en el uso de procedimientos como la biopsia de ganglios linfáticos centinelas. El ejercicio no aumenta el riesgo de aparición de linfedema Tradicionalmente, a los pacientes en riesgo de linfedema se les ha aconsejado no usar el miembro afectado. La razón de este consejo clínico, parece surgir de la noción que la extirpación de ganglios linfáticos alteraban la respuesta del área afectada con inflamación, infección, lesión y trauma y por tanto era prudente evitar excederse en el uso del miembro. Sin embargo, el ejercicio tiene un efecto diferente en el cuerpo en dosis más bajas que en dosis más altas; los ejercicios extremos pueden provocar inflamación y lesión y deben evitarse en paciente con riesgo de linfedema.[] Por el contrario, el ejercicio fisiológico, que avanza de manera lenta, progresiva, cuidadosamente controlado podría de hecho, proveer protección en situaciones cotidianas que requieren esfuerzo de esa parte del cuerpo (es decir, cargar bolsas de la compra, hacer las compras de navidad, o cargar un niño).[] Por tanto, hay pruebas fisiológicas que cuestionan el consejo tradicional para restringir el uso del miembro afectado. Más aún, hay pruebas empíricas que muestran que el ejercicio de la parte superior del cuerpo NO aumenta la aparición de linfedema entre los supervivientes de cáncer de mama.[,];[,,] El más numeroso de estos estudios (N = 204) [][] midió el grupo de la mujeres antes de la cirugía de mama con disección de ganglios linfáticos axilares y se asignó de forma aleatorizada a las participantes a uno de dos programas de rehabilitación: Las mujeres en este grupo (N = 104) no tuvieron restricciones en cuanto a las actividades físicas que usaban el miembro afectado durante 6 meses después de la cirugía. Los pacientes de SRA siguieron un programa supervisado de ejercicio de resistencia progresiva, moderada con entrenamiento de 2 a 3 veces por semana. Los ejercicios de resistencia (tiempo total de ejercicio = 45 minutos) que incluyó un mínimo de 15 repeticiones para cada ejercicio, utilizando una resistencia baja (0,5 kg) durante las primeras 2 semanas. La resistencia aumento de forma individual para cada paciente (sin límite superior) con la meta de mejorar la fortaleza muscular y la resistencia pero siempre usando 15 repeticiones por cada juego de ejercicio. Las mujeres de este grupo (N = 100) se les instruyó para que restringieran la actividad del miembro afectado durante 6 meses después de la cirugía. A los pacientes se les dijo evitaran cualquier actividad física extenuante o pesada como los aeróbicos u otros tipos de ejercicios que incluyen actividad física pesada de los miembros superiores y evitar el cargar o levantar bolsas con abastecimientos del supermercado u otros artículos que pesen más de 3 kg. Al final del segundo año de seguimiento posquirúrgico, la incidencia de nuevos linfedemas fue de 13% en ambos grupos. Es de hace notar que el factor pronóstico más importante por si solo para la aparición del linfedema fue la obesidad.[] En otro estudio aleatorizado grande (N = 134 lo completaron) se comparó una intervención de un año de levantamiento de pesas contra un grupo control no sometido a ejercicio de supervivientes de cáncer de mama, que tenían una enfermedad unilateral y a los cuales se les resecaron al menos dos ganglios linfáticos. Al momento inicial, ningún paciente presentó linfedema. Un programa de levantamiento de pesas progresivo no causó un aumento en la incidencia de linfedema. El estudio fue diseñado como un ensayo de equivalencia pero señaló una incidencia más baja de linfedema en el grupo que levantó pesas (11 contra 17%, con una diferencia significativa de 7 contra 22%, para aquellos a quienes se resecaron cinco o más ganglios linfáticos).[] Los pacientes con riesgo de linfedema y que la tienen, deben ser evaluados por un terapeuta certificado en linfedema que asegure la inocuidad de proseguir con los ejercicios de la parte del cuerpo afectada. (Consultar la página de internet (esta información solo está disponible en inglés) para ubicar centros de terapeutas certificados en linfedema en todos los Estados Unidos.) Los pacientes que presentan linfedema deben vestir ropas de compresión ajustadas durante los ejercicios en los que se use el miembro o parte del cuerpo afectada. Si hay dudas con relación a si hay presencia de linfedema, no hay pruebas sobre si el uso de prendas de vestir sería beneficioso o dañino. Dichas prendas deben estar ajustadas para ser beneficiosas y estas son caras, podrían no estar cubiertas por el seguro médico sin un diagnóstico claro y deben reemplazarse cada 6 meses. Entre las mujeres que no tienen un diagnóstico claro, es probable que el riesgo de evitar actividades de la parte superior del cuerpo, sobrepase el riesgo de involucrarse lentamente en actividad de la parte superior del cuerpo sin ropas de vestir. Los pacientes sin linfedema No necesitan prendas especiales para hacer ejercicios con el miembro en riesgo. Pruebas provenientes de estudios entre supervivientes de cáncer de mama indican que el ejercicio de la parte superior del cuerpo entre mujeres en riesgo de linfedema deben comenzar con una intensidad baja y subir la intensidad lentamente dependiendo de cómo respondan a los síntomas.[];[][] Debe haber un especialista certificado en linfedema al que se debe derivar las mujeres de ser necesario o de presentarse una reaparición o presentación. Si hay pausa en estos ejercicios de una semana o más, se recomienda encarecidamente que las mujeres disminuyan la intensidad de las actividades con la parte superior del cuerpo y luego aumentarla de nuevo otra vez de forma gradual. Cambios en los síntomas (aumento de la pesadez, dolor, hinchazón, inflamación) que dura una semana o más debe ser evaluada en cuanto a un posible brote o presentación. Es posible que el comenzar con intensidad baja y avanzar lentamente es mejor para el miembro afectado que el evitar toda actividad. El linfedema se pone en evidencia mediante manifestaciones clínicas tales como el edema sin fóvea, que por lo general afecta los dedos, en pacientes con factores de riesgo conocidos, como una disección axilar previa. Otras causas de la inflamación de las extremidades que deben tomarse en cuenta en el diagnóstico diferencial y excluirlas mediante estudios apropiados, si resulta indicado, incluyen una trombosis venosa profunda, un cáncer o una infección. Si el diagnóstico no ofrece pruebas durante las evaluaciones clínicas, puede ser necesaria una prueba de imaginología del sistema linfático con linfocentellografía (imaginología con radionúclido). Por lo general, la linfangiografía ya no es la prueba diagnóstica favorita y puede estar contraindicada en pacientes de cáncer debido a la preocupación de que podría contribuir a la diseminación metastásica del tumor. Las técnicas adicionales de imaginología, como la imaginología por resonancia magnética, pueden complementar la información obtenida en la linfocentellografía al proveer detalles anatómicos y ganglionares.[] La amplia variedad de métodos descritos en la literatura médica para evaluar el volumen de la extremidad, así como la carencia de estandarización, presenta dificultades cuando el médico evalúa la extremidad en riesgo. Entre las opciones, se incluye el desplazamiento de agua, las mediciones con cinta, la gammagrafía infrarroja y las mediciones de impedancia bioeléctrica.[] El método que se usa más ampliamente para diagnosticar el linfedema de las extremidades superiores es la medición de la circunferencia de la extremidad superior mediante el uso de puntos anatómicos específicos.[] La medición de la circunferencia del brazo se utiliza para calcular la diferencia de volumen entre el brazo afectado y el no afectado. Las medidas en secuencia se toman en cuatro puntos de ambos brazos: las articulaciones metacarpofalángicas, la muñeca, los 10 cm distales de los epicóndilos laterales y los 15 cm proximales de los epicóndilos laterales. Según algunos expertos, la diferencia de 2 cm o más con el brazo contralateral en cualquier punto se considera clínicamente significativo. Sin embargo, las diferencias de las mediciones específicas entre ambos brazos pueden tener un significado de importancia clínica limitada; por ejemplo, la diferencia de 3 cm entre los brazos de una mujer obesa y los de una mujer delgada. Además, puede haber variaciones anatómicas inherentes en cuanto a la circunferencia entre la extremidad dominante y la no dominante con respecto a la diferencia en la masa muscular y las variaciones después de un tratamiento de cáncer del seno que pueden presentarse con atrofia del brazo ipsilateral o hipertrofia del brazo contralateral.[] Un estudio pequeño en el que se compararon varios métodos para evaluar el linfedema de las extremidades superiores, no mostró la superioridad de ninguno de los métodos.[] Una secuencia de mediciones a lo largo del tiempo, que incluya las mediciones pretratamiento, puede ser más significativa desde el punto de vista clínico. El método de desplazamiento de agua es otra manera de evaluar un edema en el brazo. Normalmente, una diferencia de 200 ml o más entre el brazo afectado y el brazo opuesto se considera el punto límite para definir el linfedema.[] Un método común para clasificar el linfedema usa tres estadios con base en la gravedad del mismo.[] El estadio I es espontáneamente reversible y normalmente se caracteriza por edema con fóvea, aumento en la circunferencia de la extremidad superior y sensación de pesadez. El estadio II se caracteriza por una consistencia esponjosa del tejido, sin signos de edema con fóvea. La fibrosis tisular puede causar luego el endurecimiento de las extremidades y un aumento de tamaño.[] El estadio III, también llamado elefantiasis linfostática, es el estadio más avanzado, pero se observa con poca frecuencia luego del tratamiento del cáncer de mama.[] Otro enfoque que se usa con frecuencia en la clasificación del linfedema consiste en el Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0 (CTCAE), el cual se instituyó a fin de otorgarle un grado a los efectos adversos en el contexto de ensayos clínicos.[] Un ventaja clave del el enfoque CTCAE es que incluye ambas medidas objetivas (discrepancia intramiembro) y subjetiva, evaluación clínica en el diagnóstico del linfedema. Esto permite una posibilidad muy real, de que un paciente pueda presentar linfedema clínicamente significativo tratable, aislado a un segmento de su miembro que no cumpliría con los criterios de discrepancia intramiembro, pero que todavía se le puede otorgar un grado de acuerdo con la gravedad por signos y síntomas, según sigue a continuación: Grado 1: 5 a 10% discrepancia intramiembro en volumen o circunferencias al punto de la mayor diferencia visible; inflamación u oscurecimiento de la arquitectura anatómica bajo inspección cercana; edema con fóvea. Grado 2: más de 10 a 30% de discrepancia intramiembro en volumen o circunferencia; al punto de la mayor diferencia visible; obvio oscurecimiento de la anatomía arquitectónica; obliteración de los colgajos de la piel; deviación obvia del contorno anatómico normal. Grado 3: más de 30% de discrepancia intramiembro en volumen; linforrea; desviación desproporcionada del contorno anatómico normal, que interfieren con la vida cotidiana. Grado 4: evolución hacia una neoplasia (por ejemplo, linfangiosarcoma); se indica amputación; linfedema incapacitante.

Al proceder de esta forma, se puede disminuir la insatisfacción del superviviente de cáncer de mama y la información recibida puede servir como fundamento para tomar decisiones y lidiar con el linfedema en caso de que este se presente más tarde.[] Se debe enseñar a los pacientes a reconocer los síntomas tempranos de edema porque los resultados del tratamiento pueden mejorar de manera significativa si el problema se detecta temprano.[] Para mayor información consultar la subsección El ejercicio no aumenta el riesgo de aparición de linfedema en la sección de este sumario. Entre las recomendaciones generales de carácter anecdótico sobre medidas preventivas, se incluyen las siguientes: Mantener una meticulosa higiene de la piel y las uñas para prevenir abrir una puerta de entrada a infecciones que pueden resultar en celulitis. Cortar las uñas de los pies en línea recta; consultar con un podiatra siempre que sea necesario para prevenir uñas encarnadas e infecciones. Usar hidratantes de la piel y soluciones antibióticas tópicas cuando haya pequeños cortes en la piel como las que produce el papel. Usar en forma gradual bloqueadores de rayos solares y bronceadores. Usar medias (calcetines o zoquetes) de algodón; mantener los pies limpios y secos. Usar guantes de cocina y jardinería, y dedales para coser. Evitar andar descalzo cuando se sale al aire libre. Evitar extracciones de sangre (incluso pinchazos en los dedos), vacunas y líneas de suero intravenoso en el brazo afectado. Usar la extremidad que no está afectada para probar las temperaturas (por ejemplo, del agua del baño o para cocinar), porque la sensibilidad puede estar disminuida. Estar pendiente de signos de infección (fiebre, hinchazón, enrojecimiento, dolor y calor) y consultar con el médico de inmediato para que realice una evaluación. Siempre que sea posible, mantener el brazo o la pierna elevada sobre el nivel del corazón. Evitar que el brazo o pierna afectada reciba una presión que lo restrinja: Vestir ropas y joyas sueltas, sin bandas que aprieten. No sentarse en una sola posición por más de 30 minutos. Cómo impedir que la sangre se acumule en la extremidad afectada Evitar los movimientos circulares rápidos que ocasionan una acumulación centrífuga de líquidos en las partes distales del miembro. Evitar la aplicación de calor local en el miembro porque puede aumentar el flujo de sangre. No mantener el miembro en una posición que dependa de la gravedad por períodos largos. Evitar las ropas apretadas o manguillos para tomar la presión en el brazo afectado porque puede causar un efecto torniquete y obstruir el flujo de linfa. La meta de los centros de tratamiento para el linfedema es controlar la inflamación de las extremidades y disminuir las complicaciones, por la interrupción de los vasos linfáticos subyacente que no se puede corregir. Debido a que los ensayos clínicos que evalúan las medidas farmacológicas por lo general no son eficaces, las medidas no farmacológicas son el pilar principal del tratamiento, con la meta de aumentar al máximo las actividades cotidianas, disminuir el dolor, aumentar la amplitud de movimiento y mejorar el funcionamiento. Los ejercicios que no causan fatiga pueden producir suficiente contracción muscular como para hacer circular la linfa hacia los linfangiomas terminales y reducir la inflamación. Los ejercicios aeróbicos también pueden aumentar el tono del sistema nervioso simpático porque hacen que los vasos linfáticos colectores bombeen con mayor vigor.[] Múltiples estudios indican que el ejercicio, como el de la parte superior del cuerpo, es inocuo en mujeres con linfedema relacionado con cáncer de mama.[] También hay pruebas de que entre las mujeres con linfedema relacionado con el cáncer de mama, que logran levantar pesas de una manera lenta y progresiva, esto las lleva a reducir a la mitad la probabilidad de una exacerbación clínicamente significativa (agudización) que requiera de tratamiento por parte de un fisioterapeuta.[] Un grupo de 141 supervivientes de cáncer de mama con linfedema se asignaron de forma aleatorizada a levantar pesas dos veces por semanas de entrenamiento durante un año (N = 71) o a un grupo de comparación en lista de espera (N = 70). La intervención comenzó a las 13 semanas de entrenamiento supervisado con una resistencia baja o ausente; la cantidad de peso a levantar fue aumentando de manera muy gradual y solo si no se presentaba algún cambio en los síntomas del linfedema o la inflamación. Todas las participantes vistieron ropas de compresión bien ajustadas hechas a la medida que fueron reemplazadas a los 6 meses de la intervención. Las mujeres con linfedema relacionado con el cáncer de mama, deben ser guiadas para que trabajen con un profesional certificado en ejercicios o fisioterapeuta para aprender la forma biomecánica apropiada de hacer ejercicios de levantamiento de pesas antes de iniciar este programa por sí mismas. (Los detalles de esta intervención están disponibles para profesionales certificados en ejercicios y fisioterapeutas en la . La información contenida en este enlace solo está disponible en inglés Se necesita más investigación para realizar una intervención de esta versión que pueda ser ampliamente diseminada. En un estudio piloto pequeño se examinó la inocuidad de una intervención similar a la descrita anteriormente en supervivientes de cáncer con linfedema en las extremidades inferiores debido a melanoma secundario o cánceres urológicos o ginecológicos. En este estudio piloto no controlado, 20% de participantes presentó infección celulítica dentro de los primeros 2 meses después de comenzar un lento y progresivo régimen de levantamiento de pesas.[] Se necesita más investigación para determinar si el levantamiento de pesas es una modalidad de ejercicio inocuo para las supervivientes de cáncer con linfedema de las extremidades inferiores. Las prendas de vestir de compresión graduada (también conocidas como mangas o medias para linfedema) generan mayor presión distal que proximal, lo cual mejora la movilización del líquido del edema. Algunos pacientes pueden necesitar mangas hechas a la medida para lograr un mejor ajuste. El uso de estas vestimentas puede ser de especial importancia en las grandes alturas, como cuando se viaja en avión, debido a que la presión atmosférica ambiental es menor que la presión de salida transcapilar en el interior de los tejidos superficiales y ello puede empeorar el edema. El proceso de vendaje implica el uso de material no elástico para evitar la reacumulación de linfa al reducir la ultrafiltración capilar y hacer óptima la eficacia de la bomba muscular intrínseca. El vendaje puede cambiar un miembro que en principio se resiste a uno con menos edema, lo que resulta en una disminución del volumen del miembro y permite que la colocación de la prenda de vestir o venda se lleve a cabo con éxito.[][] La meta en el cuidado de la piel es reducir la formación de colonias dérmicas de bacteria y hongos, sobre todo en los pliegues, e hidratar la piel para controlar la sequedad y el cuarteo de la piel. La terapia descongestiva compleja es un programa multimodal que consiste en el drenaje manual del linfedema, vendaje de baja elasticidad, ejercicios y cuidado de la piel.[] Los paneles de consenso recomendaron este enfoque como tratamiento primario y como un tratamiento eficaz para el linfedema que no responde a la terapia de compresión elástica estándar.[,] La terapia descongestiva compleja se divide en dos fases sucesivas. La primera fase consiste en un tratamiento enérgico para permitir una reducción sustancial del volumen del linfedema. La segunda fase consiste en un tratamiento de mantenimiento en el hogar. Se encontró que el cumplimiento cabal en el uso de la manga elástica y el vendaje de baja elasticidad es un determinante importante del éxito de la terapia de mantenimiento en el hogar.[] La terapia descongestiva compleja también mostró que mejora el linfedema después de una disección de la ingle.[] Los pacientes deben ser derivados a un terapeuta debidamente entrenado para obtener resultados óptimos. La compresión neumática externa intermitente también puede proveer una mejoría adicional en el manejo del linfedema cuando se usa conjuntamente con la terapia descongestiva linfática. Un ensayo aleatorizado pequeño con 23 mujeres con linfedema reciente relacionado con un cáncer de mama, halló una reducción adicional significativa del volumen cuando se lo comparó con el drenaje linfático manual solo (45% vs. 26%).[][] De manera similar, también se encontraron mejoras en la fase de mantenimiento de la terapia. Entre las preocupaciones relacionadas con el uso de la compresión neumática intermitente se incluye la cantidad óptima de presión y el régimen de tratamiento, y si se necesita la terapia de mantenimiento luego de la reducción inicial del edema.[][] Hay una preocupación teórica de que presiones más altas de 60 mmHg y el uso prolongado pueden, de hecho, lesionar los vasos linfáticos. No se recomienda ningún tratamiento farmacológico crónico para los pacientes de linfedema. Normalmente, los diuréticos no son beneficiosos y pueden promover un agotamiento del volumen intravascular porque el líquido del linfedema no se puede movilizar con facilidad en el espacio vascular. La cumarina se relaciona con una hepatotoxicidad importante y no se ha encontrado que ofrezca beneficio alguno en los ensayos clínicos controlados.[] Los antibióticos deben utilizarse rápidamente en aquellos pacientes con prueba de celulitis; a veces, se necesita su uso intravenoso en los casos de celulitis grave, linfangitis o septicemia. Los resultados de un ensayo pequeño aleatorizado indicaron que el linfedema relacionado con el cáncer de mama puede mejorar con la pérdida de peso.[][] No está claro el mecanismo mediante el cual la obesidad podría predisponer al linfedema, pero entre los mecanismos propuestos están un aumento en el riesgo de complicaciones posoperatorias, tales como infección, reducción de la eficacia de bombeo muscular y separación de los canales linfáticos por la grasa subcutánea.[] Una intervención más grande y de mayor duración sobre pérdida de peso en los pacientes de cáncer con linfedema (incluyendo a aquellos con enfermedad de los miembros inferiores) asegura explorar más allá la pérdida de peso en el manejo de la enfermedad. Los estudios indican que la terapia láser de intensidad baja puede ser eficaz para reducir el linfedema de manera clínicamente significativa en algunas mujeres.[][] [,] Se encontró que dos ciclos de tratamiento con láser fueron eficaces para disminuir el volumen del brazo afectado, el líquido extracelular y el endurecimiento tisular en aproximadamente un tercio de los pacientes con linfedema posmastectomía tres meses después del tratamiento.[] Entre las razones para aplicar la terapia láser se incluyen una posible disminución de la fibrosis, la estimulación de los macrófagos y el sistema inmunitario y, posiblemente, el aumento de la linfangiogénesis.[] Es muy raro que se lleve a cabo una cirugía en pacientes con linfedema relacionado con cáncer. El principal método quirúrgico para tratar el linfedema consiste en extraer la grasa subcutánea y el tejido fibroso con la creación de un colgajo dérmico o sin este, dentro del músculo para estimular una anastomosis linfática que va de lo superficial a lo profundo. Estos métodos no se evaluaron en ensayos clínicos prospectivos, pero un análisis retrospectivo encontró resultados adecuados en solo 30% de los pacientes. Además, muchos pacientes enfrentan complicaciones tales como necrosis de la piel, infección y anomalías sensoriales.[] Por lo general, el paciente oncológico no es apto para este tipo de procedimientos. Otras opciones quirúrgicas incluyen las siguientes: Anastomosis linfático venosa microquirúrgica, en la que se drena la linfa hacia la circulación venosa o los depósitos linfáticos colectores por encima del área de la obstrucción linfática. La terapia manual del linfedema, un tipo de técnica de masaje, implica el uso de un masaje superficial muy ligero con distención de la piel de forma suave y rítmica, idealmente se limita a una presión de 30mmHg a 45 mmHg.[] En comparación con varias otras técnicas de masaje, la terapia manual del linfedema es muy suave al tacto. Los sobos se sienten como una técnica de ""cepillado"". La terapia manual de linfedema comienza en las áreas no afectadas a fin de dirigir la linfa fuera de las extremidades afectadas. Se ha llevado a cabo un número limitado de ensayos en mujeres con cáncer de mama que presentan linfedema. Estos ensayos han significado una reducción en el volumen de los miembros cuando se administra terapia manual para el linfedema como la única forma de intervención o como adjunto al estándar de tratamiento.[-][] Sin embargo, se hace necesario llevar a cabo ensayos aleatorizados controlados a fin de confirmar estos hallazgos preliminares. La terapia manual del linfedema se debe llevar a cabo en un entorno médico estrechamente vigilado, por un médico que ha recibido entrenamiento específico en la terapia manual del linfedema.[] Nunca se ha presentado efectos adversos en los estudios pilotos donde se ha administrado terapia manual del linfedema en mujeres con cáncer de mama. Los efectos adversos de que se tiene conocimiento, están relacionados con la disciplina general de masaje y están en gran parte relacionado con un masajista sin licencia para dar estos masajes o tratamientos que incluyeron masajes profundos y vigorosos. La terapia linfática manual, también conocida como drenaje linfático manual, se les puede enseñar a los pacientes para que se lo administren a sí mismos. A pesar del perfil de inocuidad, se deben tomar en cuenta las siguientes precauciones especiales cuando se administra masaje a los pacientes de cáncer: Evite aplicar masaje directamente en una herida abierta, hematoma o áreas en que la piel está muy irritada y sensible. Evite aplicar masajes directamente a los tumores que se sienten en la superficie de la piel. Evite aplicar masajes en áreas con trombosis venosa profunda aguda. Evite aplicar masajes directamente en el tejido suave radiado cuando la piel está sensible.[] Se ha mantenido bajo investigación la función de otras modalidades integrales en el tratamiento del linfedema secundario. El selenio se ha investigado en el ensayo clínico ; la acupuntura y el moxibustión se estudiaron en el ensayo clínico como opciones de tratamiento del linfedema. Si el linfedema es masivo y resistente al tratamiento o resurge varios años después de la cirugía primaria sin un trauma obvio, se debe iniciar una búsqueda de otras etiologías. Es especialmente importante la exclusión de la recidiva del tumor o el surgimiento de un linfangiosarcoma, que se debe excluir mediante tomografía computarizada o imaginología por resonancia magnética. La complicación del linfangiosarcoma se ve tradicionalmente después de la mastectomía en el brazo linfaedematoso (síndrome de Stewart-Treves). La media de tiempo entre la mastectomía y el linfangiosarcoma es de 10,2 años, con una mediana de supervivencia de 1,3 años. Clínicamente, las lesiones de linfangiosarcoma pueden aparecer inicialmente como azul-rojizas o moradas, con una forma macular o papular en la piel. Las lesiones múltiples son comunes; se pueden presentar nódulos subcutáneos y deberían ser cuidadosamente evaluados en el paciente de linfedema crónico.[] Ridner SH: Pretreatment lymphedema education and identified educational resources in breast cancer patients.

If you have sex — oral, anal or vaginal intercourse and genital touching — you can get an , also called a sexually transmitted infection (STI). Regardless of your marital status or sexual orientation, you're vulnerable to and symptoms. Thinking or hoping your partner doesn't have an is no protection — you need to know for sure. Condoms, when properly used, are highly effective for reducing transmission of some . But no method is foolproof, and symptoms aren't always obvious. If you think you have symptoms or have been exposed to an , see a doctor. Also, inform your partner or partners so that they can be evaluated and treated. Some are easy to treat and cure; others require more-complicated treatment to manage them. If untreated, can increase your risk of acquiring another such as . This happens because an can stimulate an immune response in the genital area or cause sores, either of which might raise the risk of transmission. Some untreated can also lead to infertility, organ damage, certain types of cancer or death. Many have no signs or symptoms (asymptomatic). Even with no symptoms, however, you can pass the infection to your sex partners. So it's important to use protection, such as a condom, during sex. And visit your doctor regularly for screening so you can identify and treat an infection before you can pass it on. Chlamydia is a bacterial infection of your genital tract. Chlamydia may be difficult to detect because early-stage infections often cause few or no signs and symptoms. When they do occur, symptoms usually start one to three weeks after you've been exposed to chlamydia and may be mild and pass quickly. Gonorrhea is a bacterial infection of your genital tract. The bacteria can also grow in your mouth, throat, eyes and anus. The first gonorrhea symptoms generally appear within 10 days after exposure. However, some people may be infected for months before signs or symptoms occur. Thick, cloudy or bloody discharge from the penis or vagina Heavy menstrual bleeding or bleeding between periods Trichomoniasis is a common caused by a microscopic, one-celled parasite called Trichomonas vaginalis. This organism spreads during sexual intercourse with someone who already has the infection. The organism usually infects the urinary tract in men, but often causes no symptoms. Trichomoniasis typically infects the vagina in women. When trichomoniasis causes symptoms, they may appear within five to 28 days of exposure and range from mild irritation to severe inflammation. Clear, white, greenish or yellowish vaginal discharge is an infection with the human immunodeficiency virus. interferes with your body's ability to fight off viruses, bacteria and fungi that cause illness, and it can lead to AIDS, a chronic, life-threatening disease. When first infected with , you may have no symptoms. Some people develop a flu-like illness, usually two to six weeks after being infected. Still, the only way you know if you have is to be tested. Early signs and symptoms usually disappear within a week to a month and are often mistaken for those of another viral infection. During this period, you're highly infectious. More-persistent or -severe symptoms of infection may not appear for 10 years or more after the initial infection. Early-stage symptoms may include: As the virus continues to multiply and destroy immune cells, you may develop mild infections or chronic signs and symptoms such as: Swollen lymph nodes — often one of the first signs of infection Signs and symptoms of late-stage infection include: Shaking chills or fever higher than 100.4 F (38 C) for several weeks Swelling of lymph nodes for more than three months Genital herpes is a highly contagious caused by a type of the herpes simplex virus (HSV) that enters your body through small breaks in your skin or mucous membranes. Most people with never know they have it, because they have no signs or symptoms or the signs and symptoms are so mild they go unnoticed. When signs and symptoms are noticeable, the first episode is generally the worst. Some people never have a second episode. Others, however, can have recurrent episodes for decades. When present, genital herpes signs and symptoms may include: Small red bumps, blisters (vesicles) or open sores (ulcers) in the genital and anal areas and areas nearby Pain or itching around the genital area, buttocks and inner thighs Ulcers can make urination painful. You may also have pain and tenderness in your genital area until the infection clears. During an initial episode, you may have flu-like signs and symptoms, such as a headache, muscle aches and fever, as well as swollen lymph nodes in your groin. In some cases, the infection can be active and contagious even when sores aren't present. infection is one of the most common types of . Some forms of put women at high risk of cervical cancer. Other forms cause genital warts. usually has no signs or symptoms. The signs and symptoms of genital warts include: Small, flesh-colored or gray swellings in your genital area Several warts close together that take on a cauliflower shape Often, however, genital warts cause no symptoms. Genital warts may be as small as 1 millimeter in diameter or may multiply into large clusters. Warts can also develop in the mouth or throat of a person who has had oral sex with an infected person. Hepatitis A, hepatitis B and hepatitis C are all contagious viral infections that affect your liver. Hepatitis B and C are the most serious of the three, but each can cause your liver to become inflamed. Some people never develop signs or symptoms. But for those who do, signs and symptoms may occur several weeks after exposure and may include: Abdominal pain or discomfort, especially in the area of your liver on your right side beneath your lower ribs Yellowing of your skin and the whites of your eyes (jaundice) Syphilis is a bacterial infection. The disease affects your genitals, skin and mucous membranes, but it can also involve many other parts of your body, including your brain and your heart. The signs and symptoms of syphilis may occur in three stages — primary, secondary, and tertiary. Some people also experience latent syphilis, in which blood tests are positive for the bacteria but no symptoms are present. At first, only a small, painless sore (chancre) may be present at the site of infection, usually the genitals, rectum, tongue or lips. As the disease worsens, symptoms may include: Rash marked by red or reddish-brown, penny-sized sores over any area of your body, including your palms and soles Without treatment, syphilis bacteria may spread, leading to serious internal organ damage and death years after the original infection. Some of the signs and symptoms of late-stage syphilis include: There's also a condition known as congenital syphilis, which occurs when a pregnant woman with syphilis passes the disease to her unborn infant. Congenital syphilis can be disabling, even life-threatening, so it's important for pregnant women with syphilis to be treated. At any stage, syphilis can affect the nervous system. Neurosyphilis may cause no signs or symptoms, or it can cause: If you suspect that you have these or other or that you may have been exposed to one, see your doctor for testing. Timely diagnosis and treatment is important to avoid or delay more-severe, potentially life-threatening health problems and to avoid infecting others. Jameson JL, et al., eds.

Keep reading to learn more about the possible causes and how to recognize them. are a common type of cyst that forms in blocked or damaged sebaceous glands. These glands secrete sebum, which is an oily substance that lubricates your skin and hair. Sebaceous cysts feel like small, soft bumps. They’re usually found on your face, neck, or torso. In most cases, your doctor can diagnose a sebaceous cyst just by looking at it. However, they may do some additional testing, such as a , if the bump: shows signs of infection, such as redness, pain, or pus While sebaceous cysts are harmless, some people prefer to remove them for cosmetic reasons. If you want to remove a sebaceous cyst, talk to your doctor. They can remove it with a minor . An is a strand of hair that either grows back into itself and reenters your skin or grows under your skin due to a clogged hair follicle. This results in a pimple-like bump around the hair. They’re more common in areas where you regularly remove hair by waxing, shaving, or other methods. If have short hair, you might get ingrown hairs on the back of your neck, especially along the bottom of your hairline. You might have just one or a cluster of several. Most ingrown hairs resolve on their own without any treatment. To avoid developing an , try not to squeeze or pick at an ingrown hair. (also called furuncles) are pus-filled bumps that form under the skin due to bacteria in your hair follicles. While you can have a boil anywhere, they’re common in hairy areas that are exposed to a lot of sweat and friction. This makes the back of your neck particularly vulnerable to boils. For small boils, you can apply a warm compress to help the boil drain. Larger boils, which can grow to be the size of a golf ball, usually need to be drained by a doctor. In some cases, your doctor might also prescribe antibiotics for more severe infections. A is a noncancerous, fatty lump that grows slowly, usually between your skin and muscle. You might have one or several. Lipomas are more common in middle-aged people and usually don’t cause any health problems. While they can grow anywhere, they tend to appear on your neck, shoulders, arms, back, abdomen, or thighs. Lipomas are usually: smaller than 5 cm in diameter, though they can grow bigger painful if they contain blood vessels or are large enough to put pressure on a nearby nerve Lipomas don’t require treatment unless they start to cause pain. If you think you might have a lipoma, your doctor may want to do a quick biopsy to make sure it isn’t something else. They can also help you remove a lipoma, usually either with surgery or . is an inflammation of the hair follicle that causes bumps on the back of the neck, along the hairline. It begins with small, itchy bumps that eventually lead to scarring and hair loss. Over time, they turn into , which are large, raised bands of scarring. The condition is more common in dark-skinned males, particularly those with thick, curly hair. Experts aren’t sure what causes it, but it may be related to: constant irritation from sports equipment or shirt collars Acne keloidalis nuchae is hard to treat. Start by avoiding close shaves and making sure your shirt collar doesn’t run against the back your neck. You can also try washing the area with . If keeping the area clean and free of friction doesn’t help, talk to your doctor. They might prescribe antibiotics or corticosteroids. In addition, or surgery can sometimes help.

Some other common causes of swollen lymph nodes include: Less common causes of swollen lymph nodes include: Depending on the underlying cause, you might also notice additional symptoms, such as: runny nose, sore throat, and other symptoms of an upper respiratory infection If your swollen lymph nodes are due to an underlying infection, they should return to their usual size once the infection clears up. Follow up with your doctor if you can’t determine the cause or notice that the swollen node: is accompanied by a fever, night sweats, and unexplained weight loss is a type of cancer that starts in the lymphocytes, which are your white blood cells. Swollen lymph nodes are often the first sign of lymphoma. However, according to the , swollen lymph nodes are much more likely to be a sign of infection than of lymphoma. Most of the time, a lump on the back of the neck is harmless. However, it’s important to follow up with your doctor right away if you notice: symptoms of severe infection, such as an ongoing fever a bump that doesn’t go away after two to four weeks a lump that’s accompanied by night sweats or unintended weight loss A lump on the back of the neck is usually not serious, and most go away without any treatment. If you’re concerned or have other symptoms, talk to your doctor.

AdvertisementSanctum Pure Body Products are so pure you could eat them (no guarantees for the taste...) Interesting article from the Jon Barron newsletter concerning the lymph system Lymph cancer is on the march. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is now one of the most rapidly increasing cancers in the United States, having more than doubled in incidence since the 1970s. The American Cancer Society estimates that 66,670 men and women will be diagnosed with lymphoma in 2006, with one third of them dying from it. A perverse paradox indeed, considering that one of the key roles of the lymph system is to protect your body from those very cells that are now overwhelming it and causing such a high mortality rate. A system designed to handle the worst of the worst our bodies face, the lymph system works hand in hand with the immune system to protect your body from attacks -- both intrinsic and extrinsic. But now, thanks to a combination of bad diet, a sedentary lifestyle, and a toxic environment, this vital system is being pushed past the breaking point The lymph system is one of the most under appreciated systems in our bodies. So let's take a few moments to get a better understanding of where it comes from, what it does, how it works, and what can go wrong with it -- before we look at how we can turn things around. Where it comes from Up until the early 1900s, scientists were unsure of the exact relationship of the lymph system to the circulatory system -- a bit of the ""which came first, the chicken or the egg"" mystery if you will. It took the dedication of Dr. Florence Rena Sabin and a fetal pig to finally unravel the mystery. Dr. Sabin discovered that lymphatic vessels did, in fact, arise from veins. She found that the outer layer of cells on veins sprouted buds, much like stems growing out of the branches of trees. As these stems grew outward, they connected with each other. Thanks to the work of Dr. Sabin, it is now known that the lymphatic system develops from the existing vessels of the circulatory system. A University of Pennsylvania News release entitled Separated Before Birth: Molecular Signals Part Fetal Blood and Lymphatic Vessels details the birth of the lymphatic system. According to the article, researchers have discovered that the SLP-76 and Syk proteins, which were known to have a signaling function in white blood cell development, also play a key role in the development of the lymphatic system. During fetal development, these unique proteins signal cells from the circulatory system to ""split off"" and become the separate parallel network of vessels we call the lymphatic system. Surprisingly, although ""born"" from the circulatory system, the lymph system is twice the size of the circulatory system. Twice as much lymph as blood is present in our bodies, and we have twice as many lymph vessels as blood vessels. What it does Put simply, the lymphatic system (lymph system for short) serves as a collecting duct for excess fluid and as a filtering system to screen out foreign organisms. Yes, even the dirt particles from the taxi's exhaust you breathed in last week find their way into the lymph system. In essence, the lymph system is a network of tubes throughout the body that drains fluid (called lymph) from tissues and empties it back into the bloodstream. The main roles of the lymphatic system include managing the fluid levels in the body, filtering out bacteria, and housing certain white blood cells. Lymph fluid is filtered through the spleen, thymus and lymph nodes before being emptied into the blood. Lymph Fluid Lymph comes from the Latin word lympha, meaning ""clear water."" Slightly yellowish but clear, lymph is any tissue or interstitial fluid that enters the lymph vessels. It is similar to blood plasma, but contains more white blood cells. Lymph originates as blood plasma lost from the circulatory system, which leaks out into the surrounding tissues where the lymphatic system collects this fluid through a bio-chemical process called diffusion -- moving it into lymph capillaries and ultimately back into the circulatory system. Once in the lymphatic system, the fluid is called lymph and has almost the same composition as the original interstitial fluid. Lymph also carries other substances, the composition of which depends on where it is found in the body. In the limbs, lymph is rich in protein, especially albumin. In the bone marrow, spleen, and thymus, lymph contains higher concentrations of white blood cells. And in the intestine, lymph contains fats absorbed during digestion. Interestingly, lymph fluid does not travel the same road or by the same mechanisms as your blood. In fact, this is an open system that travels in only one direction (toward the heart), orchestrating many players throughout your entire body to work together to protect your delicate systems. So let's take a closer look at each player before we talk more about the workings of this essential ensemble. The Lymph Vessels Lymph vessels, also called lymphatics, carry lymph in only one direction -- towards the heart. Throughout all the tissues of the body, lymph vessels form a complicated, spidery network of fine tubes. The smallest vessels, called lymph capillaries, have closed or dead ends (unlike vessels in the cardiovascular system, which form a circuit). The walls of the lymph capillaries are composed of only a single layer of flattened cells. Material in the interstitial fluid passes easily through the gaps between these cells and on into the capillaries. Lymph capillaries in the villi of the small intestine are called lacteals. These specialized capillaries transport the fat products of digestion, such as fatty acids and vitamin A. The Lymph Capillaries Blood capillaries cannot absorb proteins and other large molecules dissolved in the interstitial fluid. But because the walls of lymph capillaries are much more permeable (allowing material to pass through easily), these large substances enter the lymph capillaries and are eventually returned to the blood. This function of lymph capillaries is particularly important in the small intestine. Whereas carbohydrates and many other nutrients are small enough to pass directly from the intestine into the bloodstream, fats are not. Lacteals (the lymph capillaries in the small intestine) are able to absorb fats and other nutrients that are too large to enter blood capillaries. After digestion, the lymph in lacteals contains as much as 1 to 2 percent fat. Milky-white in appearance, this thick mixture of lymph and tiny fat globules is called chyle. It becomes mixed with the blood after lymph drains into the thoracic duct. The exchange of materials (oxygen, carbon dioxide, nutrients, and wastes) between the blood and the cells in the body occurs through the lymph capillaries. In the body of an average person, over the course of an average day, roughly 25.4 (24 liters) of plasma fluid are forced out of the capillaries into the interstitial fluid surrounding the cells. After bathing the cells, providing them with nutrients, and picking up their wastes, this fluid is drawn back into the capillaries. However, only 85 percent of the total fluid is drawn back into the bloodstream. The remaining 15 percent, roughly 3.8 (3.6 liters), remains in the interstitial fluid. If this small amount of fluid were allowed to accumulate over even a brief period of time, massive edema (swelling caused by excessive bodily fluid) would result. If left unchecked, the body would blow up like a balloon, tissues would be destroyed, and death would take place. This condition is prevented by the presence of lymph capillaries, which run alongside blood vessels in most tissue spaces. The lymph capillaries act as ""drains,"" collecting the excess fluid and returning it to the venous blood just before the blood reaches the heart. The Lymphocytes Lymphocytes, the primary cells of the lymphatic system, make up roughly one-fourth of all white blood cells in the body. Like other white blood cells, they are produced in the red bone marrow. Lymphocytes constantly travel throughout the body, moving through tissues or through the blood or lymph vessels. There are two major classes of lymphocytes: T cells and B cells. The letter T refers to the thymus, where those lymphocytes mature. The letter B refers to the bone marrow, where that group of lymphocytes matures. About three-quarters of the circulating lymphocytes are T cells. They carry out two main defensive functions: they kill invaders and orchestrate or control the actions of other lymphocytes involved in the immune process or response. In addition, T cells recognize and destroy any abnormal body cells, such as those that have become cancerous. Like T cells, B cells are also programmed to recognize specific antigens on foreign cells. When stimulated during an immune response (such as when foreign cells enter the body), B cells undergo a change in structure. They then produce antibodies, which are protein compounds. These compounds bind with specific antigens of foreign cells, labeling those cells for destruction. The Lymph Nodes Scattered along the pathways of lymph vessels are oval or kidney bean-shaped masses of lymphatic tissue called lymph nodes. These nodes are the filters of the lymph system. They range in size from microscopic to just under 1 (2.5 centimeters) in length. The smaller lymph nodes are often called lymph nodules. You have most likely heard of lymph nodes in the context of cancer since these masses trap cancer cells that try to pass by and are a good gauge of the health of adjacent systems. Between 500 and 1,500 lymph nodes are located in the body; most of them usually occur in clusters or chains. Principal groupings are based in the neck, armpits, chest, abdomen, pelvis, and groin (at the top of your legs). Some (those in the neck, armpits, and groin) you can feel and some (those in the abdomen, pelvis, and chest) you cannot. The lymph nodes in the neck, armpits, and groin are especially important because they are located where the head, arms, and legs (the extremities) meet the main part of the body (the trunk). Most injuries to the skin, which allow bacteria and other pathogens (disease-causing organisms) to enter the body, are likely to occur along the extremities. The lymph nodes at the junctions of the extremities and trunk filter out and destroy the pathogens before they reach the main part of the body and the vital organs. Each lymph node is enclosed in a fibrous capsule. Lymph enters the node through several small lymph vessels. Inside, bands of connective tissue divide the node into spaces known as sinuses. The specialized tissue in these sinuses harbors macrophages and lymphocytes, both of which are types of white blood cells. Macrophages engulf and destroy bacteria and other foreign substances in the lymph. Lymphocytes also act to identify and destroy foreign substances. (If foreign invaders are abundant and macrophages and lymphocytes have to increase in number to defend the body against them, the lymph node often becomes swollen and tender.) Once the lymph has been filtered and cleansed, it leaves the node through one or two other small lymph vessels. Tonsils, Adenoids and Peyer's Patches Tonsils, Adenoids and Peyer's patches are small masses of lymphatic tissue (some sources consider them specialized lymph nodes). These tissues serve to prevent infection in the body in areas where bacteria is abundant. There are five tonsils: a pair on either side of the inner wall of the throat (palatine tonsils), one near the rear opening of the nasal cavity (pharyngeal tonsil, AKA adenoid), and a pair near the base of the tongue (lingual tonsils). This ""ring"" around the throat helps trap and remove any bacteria or other foreign pathogens entering the throat through breathing, eating, or drinking. Peyer's patches, which resemble tonsils, are located in the small intestine. The macrophages of Peyer's patches prevent infection of the intestinal wall by destroying the bacteria always present in the moist environment of the intestine. The other organs involved in the lymph system Spleen Your spleen is under your ribs on the left side of your body. Though considered to be part of the lymphatic system, the spleen does not filter lymph (only lymph nodes do that). Instead, it filters and cleanses blood of bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens. It also destroys worn or old red blood cells. As blood flows through the spleen, macrophages lining the organ's tissues engulf and destroy both pathogens and worn red blood cells. Any remaining parts of decomposed red blood cells, such as iron, are returned to the body to be used again to form new red blood cells. Other functions of the spleen include the production of lymphocytes, which the organ releases into the bloodstream and blood storage. When the body demands additional blood (such as during stress or injury), the spleen contracts, forcing its stored blood into circulation. Thymus Your thymus is a small gland under your breastbone that helps produce white blood cells. Your thymus continues to shrink as you age. In a fetus and infant, immature or not fully developed lymphocytes are produced in the bone marrow (the sponge-like material that fills the cavities inside most bones). A certain group or class of these lymphocytes travels to the thymus where thymic hormones change them into T lymphocytes or T cells. While maturing and multiplying in the thymus, T cells are ""educated"" to recognize the difference between cells that belong to the body (""self"") and those that are foreign (""nonself""). Each T cell is programmed to respond to a specific chemical identification markercalled an antigenon the surface of foreign or abnormal cells. Once they are fully mature, T cells then enter the bloodstream and circulate to the spleen, lymph nodes, and other lymphatic tissue. To summarize The lymph system has three main jobs: Balance fluids Filter lymph Fight infections How the lymph system works As lymph capillaries carry lymph away from the tissue spaces and towards the heart, they merge to form larger and larger vessels. These larger lymph vessels resemble veins, but their walls are thinner and they have more one-way valves to prevent lymph from flowing backwards. Whereas the cardiovascular system has a pump (the heart) to move fluid (blood) through the system, the lymphatic system does not. It relies on the contraction of muscles to move lymph throughout the body, although the larger lymph vessels have a layer of smooth muscle in their walls that contracts rhythmically to help ""pump"" lymph along. But it is primarily the contraction of skeletal muscles, brought about by simple body movement and the mechanics of breathing that move lymph on its way. The successively larger lymph vessels eventually unite to return lymph to the venous system through two ducts or passageways: the right lymphatic duct and the thoracic duct. Lymph that has been collected from the right arm and the right side of the head, neck, and thorax (area of the body between the neck and the abdomen) empties into the right lymphatic duct. Lymph from the rest of the body drains into the thoracic duct, the body's main lymph vessel, which runs upward in front of the backbone. Both ducts then empty the lymph into the right and left subclavian veins, which lie under the collarbone. Flaps in both subclavian veins allow the lymph to flow into the veins, but prevent it from flowing backward into the ducts. The subclavian veins empty into the superior vena cava, which then empties into the right atrium of the heart. What can go wrong Edema The lymph system's role of removing proteins is vital to keeping edema down since proteins draw water to themselves. If the lymph system becomes sluggish, or is damaged by surgical removal of lymph nodes, edema can develop. This type of edema is called lymphostatic edema -- or a high protein edema. Other causes of edema can be a chemical imbalance in the body caused by liver disease, diabetes, or a variety of other ailments. This type of edema is called lymphodynamic edema, and requires other forms of therapy due to the fact that it is caused by a chemical imbalance. (Kasseroller, R., Compendium of Dr. Vodder's Manual Lymph Drainage, Haug, Heidelberg, 1998) Glandular Fever (mono, Epstein-Barr) Infectious mononucleosis, commonly known as glandular fever, is a viral infection, which is caused by the Epstein-Barr virus. It is characterized by a sore throat, swollen lymph nodes and extreme fatigue. Young people aged between 10 and 25 years are most vulnerable to this infection, which is also sometimes called the ""kissing disease."" According to the National Institutes of Health, Epstein-Barr causes 85 percent of mono cases. Incidentally, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report that 95 percent all people have been infected by Epstein-Barr by the ages of 35 to 40. Hodgkin's Hodgkin's lymphoma begins in a lymph node (usually in the neck), causing swelling and possibly pain. After affecting one group of nodes, it progresses on to the next. In advanced cases of the cancer, the spleen, liver, and bone marrow may also be affected. Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas encompass over twenty-nine types of lymphomas. Their exact cause is unknown.) Tonsillitis Tonsillitis is an inflammation of the tonsils in the mouth and often, but not necessarily, causes a sore throat and fever. Most tonsillitis is viral in origin and is quite frequently caused by the Epstein-Barr virus in fact. Infection/HIV HIV and AIDS are directly connected to the lymphatic system. In fact, one of the conditions used to identify HIV infection is a condition called persistent generalized lymphadenopathy. This is defined as having two or more enlarged lymph nodes that are not next to each other and are not in the groin. This area is excluded because lymph nodes are commonly enlarged there. The lymph node swelling is caused by the rapid multiplication of the virus itself at these sites. Later in the course of the illness, the lymph nodes actually shrink. Ultimately, the ability to effectively control HIV will require increased knowledge of the lymphatics. Continued research will lead to an understanding of how infectious organisms invade the lymphatic system and overcome its normal protective role. Heart Disease The lymphatic system allows the body to more efficiently clear excess cholesterol out of the arteries. When the lymph system is clear, cholesterol can travel easily thereby reducing any build up in the arteries. Excess cholesterol is carried through the lymphatics to the veins and then to the liver, where it is broken down and discarded. Why lymphoma is one of the fastest growing cancers The lymphatic system is critical to the body's surveillance against cancer. The lymphatic system is one of the most common avenues for the spread of cancer cells throughout the body. Medicine will immeasurably add to its ability to conquer cancer when we learn more about how cancer cells influence the development of new lymphatic vessels and pathways, establishing the route for these cells to spread to other parts of the body. This process known as ""lymphangiogenesis"" is an emerging focus within the scientific cancer research community. But why wait for doctors to figure it out. We actually know many of the problems already. The Lymph System Does Not Have a Pump of its Own The lymph capillaries and vessels pick up the lymph fluid and start pumping it away from the cells. Lymph vessels do not have an active pump like the heart. Instead, lymph vessels have one-way valves, and muscle motion pumps the lymph. The larger lymph vessels have a layer of smooth muscle in their walls that contracts to move the lymph fluid along. But the primary lymphatic pump results from the contraction of skeletal muscles and the mechanics of breathing. If you don't use your muscles, if you don't exercise, if you don't breathe deeply, lymph stagnates. That means that waste products hang around far longer in the lymph reducing its ability to remove things such as dead cells, toxins, allergens, etc. from healthy tissue in a timely manner, thereby putting severe stress on the immune system. With longer exposure to these toxins, the health of organs and tissue is compromised. Poor Diet The dramatically lower incidence of lymphoma in Sri Lanka, China and Japan -- and the much higher incidence of lymphoma in the industrialized nations (see Cancer Rates Comparison) - provides a very strong indication that nutrition - and more specifically, high consumption of nutrient dead, highly processed foods may be a prime factor in lymph disorders. Also, high consumption of meat, dairy and an imbalance of Omega-6 to Omega-3 fatty acids are highly suspect. Toxic Chemicals The high levels of toxic chemicals and heavy metals we are exposed to overwhelm the ability of the lymph system to deal with them. Lack of Exercise A sedentary lifestyle creates a stagnant lymph system. Lymph circulation depends solely upon your breathing and muscle movement. Physical exercise and diaphragmatic deep breathing are critical to lymph cleansing and to healthy immune response. Thus, the sedentary lifestyle not only contributes to obesity (now epidemic) in first world countries, but also to the onset of cancer, likewise epidemic in first world countries. How to optimize your lymph system Such a vital and complex system may leave you feeling a bit intimidated when it comes to taking steps to optimize the functioning of the entire lymph system. But the reality is that this is a good example of a little effort going a long way. Simple, easy (heck even enjoyable) measures can make a huge difference in the health of your lymph system. Use enzymes supplements It is a harsh inescapable reality that the vast majority of food we eat is either enzyme dead from the start or cooked, killing off any potential living beneficial enzymes. Being a realist, I will not suggest that you alter your entire diet, rather that you add one simple step -- supplement with enzymes. Use digestive enzymes with your meals to ease the burden of complex fats and proteins on the lymph system. Use systemic proteolytic enzymes between meals To cleanse the blood of debris: Proteolytic enzymes are the primary tools the body uses to ""digest"" organic debris in the circulatory and lymph systems. Supplementing merely improves the effectiveness of the process. To remove Circulating Immune Complexes (CICs) from the body: As CICs accumulate in the soft tissue of the body, they trigger a constant allergic response from the lymphocytes in your immune system (particularly in the lymph system) thereby overwhelming it. Using proteolytic enzymes eases the burden markedly and frees up your immune system for its real work. Do Body Cleanses One of the best things you can do for your lymph system is to make a routine of doing cleanses to take some of the burden off this system. For more information on cleansing programs that should be mandatory parts of your health routine see: Blood Cleanse Liver Cleanse Liver health is a key to lymphatic health. The liver produces the majority of lymph, and lymph fluid provides a major route for nutrients from the liver. The integrity of the lymph system is dependent on immune cells in the liver that filter out harmful bacteria and destructive yeasts. If liver function is compromised, the lymph system is compromised. Intestinal/Colon Cleanse & Detox Exercise I don't often cite trendy media phrasing, but in this case I can say without hesitation: ""Just do it."" (Thank you, Nike). We are conscious reasonable beings (well, most of us) and to make a conscious decision NOT to exercise is to sentence yourself to slow death. As I mentioned above, if you don't move, your lymph stagnates and you die. Body Work Lymphatic drainage massage can stimulate the opening of the initial lymphatic and increase the volume of lymph flow by as much as 20 times. To learn more see Lymphatic drainage strokes. Sauna and Steam Baths Help your lymph system out by eliminating toxins through sweating. Your skin is not just a covering, it is also the largest organ in your body, and one of its primary roles is the elimination of toxins through the pores. Saunas and steam baths greatly accelerate the process. Also, the heat increases your heart rate and your breathing, both of which help move lymph fluid along. PS: Keep Your Tonsils and Adenoids Swollen tonsils and adenoids are merely a symptom of a problem, not the problem itself. They play an important role in the functioning of your immune system and your lymph system. Tonsils should never be removed before age 4, because prior to age 4, they are a major supplier of the cells and proteins that help to protect you from being infected with viruses and bacteria, and they still play an important role after that age. Like their related lymph nodes, they too swell up when taxed by allergens and invaders. Removing them merely weakens your defenses. Note: it is not unusual for tonsils and adenoids to swell temporarily at around age 8 -- normal, that is, in children eating large amounts of wheat, corn, and dairy. Conclusion The bottom-line is that if you give your lymph system a helping hand by living and eating pure and smart in addition to making a habit of cleansing and exercising, then this essential ensemble (your lymph system) will serve you well, protecting and defending your entire body in return.

Radiotherapy for Cutaneous Malignant Melanoma: Rationale and Indications The use of radiation as adjuvant therapy for patients with cutaneousmalignant melanoma has been hindered by the unsubstantiatedbelief that melanoma cells are radioresistant. An abundance of literaturehas now demonstrated that locoregional relapse of melanoma iscommon after surgery alone when certain clinicopathologic featuresare present. Features associated with a high risk of primary tumor recurrenceinclude desmoplastic subtype, positive microscopic margins,recurrent disease, and thick primary lesions with ulceration or satellitosis.Features associated with a high risk of nodal relapse include extracapsularextension, involvement of four or more lymph nodes, lymphnodes measuring at least 3 cm, cervical lymph node location, and recurrentdisease. Numerous studies support the efficacy of adjuvant irradiationin these clinical situations. Although data in the literatureremain sparse, evidence also indicates that elective irradiation is effectivein eradicating subclinical nodal metastases after removal of theprimary melanoma. Consequently, there may be an opportunity to integrateradiotherapy into the multimodality treatment of patients at highrisk of subclinical nodal disease, particularly those with an involvedsentinel lymph node. Such patients are known to have a low rate ofadditional lymph node involvement, and thus in this group, a shortcourse of radiotherapy may be an adequate substitute for regional lymphnode dissection. This will be the topic of future research. ABSTRACT: The use of radiation as adjuvant therapy for patients with cutaneous malignant melanoma has been hindered by the unsubstantiated belief that melanoma cells are radioresistant. An abundance of literature has now demonstrated that locoregional relapse of melanoma is common after surgery alone when certain clinicopathologic features are present. Features associated with a high risk of primary tumor recurrence include desmoplastic subtype, positive microscopic margins, recurrent disease, and thick primary lesions with ulceration or satellitosis. Features associated with a high risk of nodal relapse include extracapsular extension, involvement of four or more lymph nodes, lymph nodes measuring at least 3 cm, cervical lymph node location, and recurrent disease. Numerous studies support the efficacy of adjuvant irradiation in these clinical situations. Although data in the literature remain sparse, evidence also indicates that elective irradiation is effective in eradicating subclinical nodal metastases after removal of the primary melanoma. Consequently, there may be an opportunity to integrate radiotherapy into the multimodality treatment of patients at high risk of subclinical nodal disease, particularly those with an involved sentinel lymph node. Such patients are known to have a low rate of additional lymph node involvement, and thus in this group, a short course of radiotherapy may be an adequate substitute for regional lymph node dissection. This will be the topic of future research. Because of improved public awareness, most cases of cutaneous malignant melanoma are diagnosed at an early stage and can be cured by simple surgical resection. Local recurrence after wide local excision of primary disease is rare, and with few exceptions, the role of adjuvant local therapy in primary melanoma is limited. As the thickness of the primary melanoma increases, however, so does the risk of lymphatic spread. Surgical resection of clinically documented regional disease results in satisfactory regional control, but for certain patients adjuvant regional irradiation is indicated to prevent potentially morbid regional relapse. For patients without clinically apparent lymphatic involvement, the risk of subclinical nodal disease may be predicted from clinicopathologic features of the primary lesion. In patients with a high risk of subclinical regional disease, approaches have included observation of the nodal basin (with delayed dissection as needed), elective lymph node dissection, and, less frequently, elective lymph node irradiation. Although elective treatment results in lower rates of nodal recurrence, findings in the four randomized trials investigating the effect of elective dissection on overall survival were negative.[ 1-4] Despite these results, recent developments in sentinel lymph node biopsy techniques have renewed interest in regional lymph node dissection. Patients with an involved sentinel lymph node generally undergo completion dissection. The role of ra diotherapy after sentinel lymph node biopsy remains largely undefined. In this article we review the rationale and indications for radiotherapy in cutaneous malignant melanoma. We focus first on adjuvant irradiation of the primary tumor site or regional lymph node basins after surgical excision of the primary tumor or dissection of lymph nodes. We then turn to the evolving role of elective nodal irradiation for patients with clinically node-negative disease but a high risk of subclinical nodal involvement. Finally, we discuss the implications of recent developments in sentinel lymph node biopsy for the use of elective lymph node treatment.   Local Recurrence Rates After Surgery Alone for Primary Tumor by High-Risk Pathologic Characteristics Surgical resection remains the primary mode of therapy for cutaneous malignant melanoma. In general, local recurrence after adequate wide local excision of primary tumors is rare, occurring in fewer than 5% of cases. As detailed in Table 1, the rate of local recurrence is higher when primary lesions are thicker than 4 mm, are located on the head or neck, or are associated with ulceration or satellitosis.[2,5-17] Even when these factors are present, however, the rate of local recurrence is generally less than 15%, although combinations of these factors- such as thickness greater than 4 mm with ulceration or head and neck location-most likely further increase the risk of local recurrence.[ 6,14] Desmoplastic melanoma, a rare variant of cutaneous melanoma, is associated with a clearly increased local recurrence rate.[18-23] These tumors typically present in elderly patients, have a predilection for head and neck sites, and are associated with perineural invasion. Recurrence rates as high as 50% have been reported after ostensibly adequate wide local excision of desmoplastic melanomas (Table 1). Indications for Adjuvant Irradiation in Melanoma Patients Few series have examined the use of adjuvant irradiation of the primary tumor site in the presence of high-risk clinicopathologic features. The first report of this approach was that of Dickson, who analyzed outcomes in a series of 234 patients according to primary treatment.[24] Treatment consisted of local excision alone (71 patients), radical surgery alone (42 patients), or surgery followed by adjuvant radiotherapy (121 patients). In the adjuvant radiotherapy group, surgery usually involved only simple excision or electrocautery. Radium (surface molds or teleradium therapy) or orthovoltage x-rays were used with almost equal frequency-the latter to deliver a dose of 5,000 cGy in 10 days to the primary tumor site. Although the result in terms of local disease control was not reported, overall survival after simple excision and radio- therapy was similar to that after wide local excision and skin grafting. Johanson et al reported on a group of 54 patients who underwent surgery and radiotherapy for nodular melanoma to a total dose of 24 Gy in three fractions delivered on days 0, 7, and 21.[25] Of the nine patients who received radiotherapy to the primary tumor site for gross or microscopic residual disease, only one developed progressive local disease. Although prospective studies are lacking, the available data support a strategy of adjuvant irradiation when local recurrence is of concern. Indications for irradiation of the primary tumor site are detailed in Table 2 and include desmoplastic melanoma, but primary thick primary tumors with associated ulceration or satellitosis, close or positive resection margins where re-resection might compromise cosmesis, and locally recurrent disease are also associated with an increased local failure rate and adjuvant irradiation may be warranted. The primary tumor site may also be irradiated when features of the primary tumor by themselves do not indicate the need for local adjuvant irradiation but regional nodal irradiation is indicated (see below). Regional Recurrence Rates After Surgery Alone for Nodal Disease by High-Risk Pathologic Characteristics For patients who present with documented nodal disease or nodal recurrence after local excision of primary melanoma, therapeutic nodal dissection results in regional control in more than 85% of patients overall. However, several features (Table 3) substantially decrease this satisfactory nodal control rate and indicate a need for adjuvant radiotherapy to avoid uncontrolled regional recurrence. In most series, the presence of any one of these high-risk features results in a 30% to 50% rate of subsequent nodal recurrence after surgery alone. Although these high-risk features also predict for increased rates of hematogenous metastases, the importance of maintaining regional control and avoiding unmanageable regional recurrence should not be underestimated. The most consistently reported high-risk feature is extracapsular extension, but other factors must also be considered when patients are evaluated for adjuvant therapy. • -In an early surgical series from M. D. Anderson Cancer Center that included 1,001 patients with nodal metastasis, the nodal failure rate after surgery alone was significantly higher when lymph nodes were described as matted (eg, gross extracapsular extension).[ 26] Investigators from Roswell Park Cancer Institute also reported a significantly elevated regional failure rate in the presence of extracapsular extension.[27] In their series of 338 patients, the nodal failure rate was 63% when extracapsular extension was noted microscopically. This association remained significant on multivariate analysis. In another series, from the John Wayne Cancer Institute, extracapsular extension was the single most important predictor of subsequent regional failure after surgery alone.[28] Reported rates of regional failure after surgery alone for nodal metastases with associated extracapsular extension range from 31% to 63% (Table 3).[26-29] • -Another factor associated with an increased risk of regional recurrence is a high number of involved lymph nodes. Lee and colleagues reported regional recurrence rates of 25% when 1 to 3 nodes were involved, 46% for 4 to 10 involved nodes, and 63% for more than 10 involved nodes ( = .0001).[27] Two additional series also revealed an increasing risk of regional recurrence with an increasing number of involved lymph nodes.[28,30] Reported rates of regional failure increase rapidly when four or more lymph nodes are involved, ranging from 22% to 63% (Table 3). Although not specifically addressed in most studies, it is reasonable to predict a high correlation between a high number of positive nodes and the presence of extracapsular extension. • -Lymph node size has less frequently been cor- related with the rate of recurrence, but Lee and colleagues did report higher regional recurrence rates with larger lymph nodes: 25% when lymph nodes were smaller than 3 cm, 42% when they were 3 to 6 cm, and 80% when they were larger than 6 cm ( < .001).[27] This finding is not surprising, as the probability of extracapsular extension generally increases with increasing nodal size. • -Finally, clinical factors may also predict an increased rate of regional recurrence. At least two series have reported that nodal recurrence rates are higher for cervical nodal disease than for disease in the axillary or inguinal basins.[ 27,31] Also, some series have suggested that the risk of regional recurrence is higher in patients who undergo therapeutic dissection for clinically apparent disease than in patients who have subclinical nodal metastases discovered at the time of elective dissection. Specifically, in an M. D. Anderson series including patients with cervical lymph node metastases treated with therapeutic modified neck dissection, the regional recurrence rate was 50% for patients with multiple positive lymph nodes as compared with a regional recurrence rate of only 17% when dissection was performed electively but lymph nodes were found to be involved.[12] Other series, including patients with disease in any nodal basin, have reported regional recurrence rates ranging from 20% to 50% when dissection is performed therapeutically (Table 3).[14,27,28] Regional Recurrence Rates After Surgery and Radiotherapy for Nodal Disease Data from several retrospective series are now available suggesting significant improvements in regional control when adjuvant nodal irradiation is delivered (Table 4).[32-38] In an analysis from M. D. Anderson, the regional recurrence rate in patients treated with adjuvant radiotherapy for axillary nodal metastases was only 13%, despite the fact that the majority of patients presented with one or more of the high-risk features outlined in Table 3.[32] In a separate analysis, we reviewed the records of 160 patients with cervical lymph node metastases and a high risk of regional recurrence and found a 6% 10-year recurrence rate after adjuvant radiotherapy.[33] These findings are consistent with those of other adjuvant radiotherapy series in which regional recurrence rates are consistently below what has been reported after surgery alone despite the presence of adverse clinicopathologic risk factors (compare Tables 3 and 4).   Review of published series, therefore, suggests a clear association between the risk of regional recurrence and the presence of extracapsular ex-tension, the number of involved lymph nodes, size of the lymph nodes, and the site of disease. Although no series has directly analyzed regional recurrence rates according to disease presentation (ie, recurrence after prior lymph node dissection vs primary presentation), recurrent disease is a wellaccepted risk factor for subsequent relapse and indicates the need for radiotherapy. Although therapeutic (vs elective) dissection was associated with an increased risk of nodal recurrence in several retrospective series, at M. D. Anderson we have reserved adjuvant irradiation of lymph node basins for patients who have combinations of therapeutic dissection and other high-risk features. Indications for adjuvant regional radiotherapy are summarized in Table 2. Elective Irradiation of Regional Lymph Nodes in Patients Without Clinically Evident Nodal Disease Surgical experience has revealed high rates of subclinical nodal involvement and nodal recurrence after wide local excision of cutaneous malignant melanomas that are clinically nodenegative but greater than 4 mm thick or ulcerated. The rate of lymph node involvement according to primary tumor thickness, documented using sentinel lymph node biopsy techniques, is shown in Table 5. The rate of involvement is generally less than 5% for lesions 0.75 mm or thinner, 10% for lesions 0.76 to 1.50 mm, 20% for lesions 1.51 to 4.0 mm, and 30% to 50% for lesions thicker than 4.0 mm.[39-47] These reported incidences are based on immunohistochemical staining; the use of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction would increase the detection rate significantly. This assertion is supported by the fact that the documented regional recurrence rate observed after local excision of primary melanoma actually ranges from 20% to 60%.[1,2,4,48-55] Risk of Positive Sentinel Lymph Node by Primary Tumor Thickness Approaches to addressing subclinical regional disease have included observation of the nodal basin, with de- layed dissection as needed; elective lymph node dissection; and, less frequently, elective lymph node irradiation. Although elective treatment results in lower rates of nodal recurrence, the four completed randomized trials did not show a benefit of elective dissection in terms of overall survival.[1-4] A similar lack of effect on overall survival would be expected from elective regional irradiation, but studies have now shown that elective irradiation can in fact effectively control subclinical regional disease and obviate dissection. This option is particularly attractive for patients in whom the disease status of the lymph nodes will have no bearing on subsequent therapy. The most obvious candidates are elderly patients and those with considerable comorbid conditions, but any patient who is not a candidate for systemic therapy protocols or dissection of the regional lymphatics may benefit from this approach. At M. D. Anderson, patients with clinically node-negative cutaneous melanoma of the head and neck with a thickness of at least 1.5 mm or Clark level of at least IV have routinely been offered elective irradiation. In 157 patients with stage I or II cutaneous melanoma of the head and neck, the policy of elective regional radiotherapy after wide local excision of the primary lesion resulted in an actuarial regional control rate of 89% at both 5 and 10 years.[56] This regional control rate was significantly better than the rate expected on the basis of the Breslow thicknesses in these patients. Indications for elective nodal irradiation used at M. D. Anderson are outlined in Table 6. To our knowledge, no data regarding elective irradiation of other nodal basins are available, but this is certainly a reasonable therapeutic option for some patients. The most appropriate radiation dose schedule for patients with cutaneous malignant melanoma remains somewhat controversial. The Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) launched a phase III trial in 1983 to compare the effects of four fractions of 8 Gy given at weekly intervals with those of 20 fractions of 2.5 Gy given daily, 5 days per week. A total of 137 patients were entered in this study, which included all sites of metastasis other than the abdomen or brain. Most patients had soft-tissue, cutaneous, or nodal disease. Approximately half of the lesions in this trial were greater than 5 cm in largest diameter. There was no difference in complete or partial response rates according to fraction size: The complete response rate was 24.2% for four fractions and 23.4% for 20 fractions, and the partial response rate was 35.5% for four fractions and 34.4% for 20 fractions.[ 57] Unfortunately, the duration of response-an important indicator of the magnitude of cell killing-was not reported. Although neither of the two treatments was superior to the other, both were certainly effective in terms of clinical response, refuting the alleged radioresistance of malignant melanoma. We have continued to advocate a hypofractionated regimen because of the positive experiences at M. D. Anderson with this approach, a continued belief that some melanoma cell lines are more sensitive to large doses per fraction, and patient convenience.[ 32,33,56,58,59] For most clinical situations, we recommend 30 Gy in five 6-Gy fractions delivered over 2.5 weeks (on Mondays and Thursdays, or Tuesdays and Fridays). When irradiation of the brain, brainstem, or spinal cord is required, the dose must not exceed 24 Gy, or a more conventional fractionation schedule may be used. For adjuvant irradiation of the primary tumor site, the width of the portal will depend on the proximity of critical structures, but generally 2-to 4-cm margins using electrons with appropriately thick bolus material are sufficient. Portals for Irradiation of Cutaneous Head and Neck Melanoma For nodal irradiation, portals should encompass the predicted draining lymphatics with adequate shielding of nearby critical structures. When the cervical lymph nodes are irradiated, the patient may be immobilized in an ""open neck"" position (Figure 1). Computed tomography planning is used to choose electron energies, and junctions are shifted twice during the course of irradiation. The dose is prescribed to Dmax. Tissue-equivalent bolus may be used to limit the dose to the temporal lobe and the larynx. Portals generally encompass the site of the primary lesion, the superficial parotid gland, and the entire ipsilateral neck, including the supraclavicular fossa. The primary lesion may be excluded if the indication for irradiation is nodal recurrence 1 year or more after treatment of a primary melanoma. Portal for Irradiation of Axillary Nodal Metastases For the axilla, anterior and posterior photon beams are used to cover the ipsilateral low cervical, supraclavicular, and level I, II, and III axillary lymph node regions (Figure 2). Either wedge or compensation filters are used to correct for dose inhomogeneities caused by surface irregularities through the field of irradiation. Dose heterogeneity may also be avoided by prescribing to a volume and, if necessary, allowing the isocenter dose to be 3% to 6% below the prescribed dose. For inguinal lymph node metastases, radiation portals are generally less comprehensive than for the cervical and axillary basins. In an attempt to minimize the risk of long-term lymphedema, radiation is directed to documented clinical disease only, with no attempt to cover potential subclinical extension to the external or common iliac lymph node chains unless initially involved. Also, it is believed that 30 Gy in five fractions exceeds the tolerance of the small bowel, and thus every attempt should be made to limit the small bowel dose to less than 24 Gy using appropriate technique and shielding. If this is not possible, more conventional fractionation should be used.   In general, nodal dissection is well tolerated and adjuvant irradiation only modestly increases the overall morbidity of the procedure. In one study, after cervical lymphadenectomy, 7% of patients had functional deficits and 6% experienced long-term pain.[60] Using actuarial techniques, we reported 5-year complication rates of 12% for grade 1 and 10% for grade 2 complications.[ 33] This series included 160 patients who had therapeutic neck dissection and adjuvant radiotherapy for lymph node metastases. The grade 1 complications all involved the irradiated skin or mucous membranes and corresponded to an RTOG/European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer late radiation morbidity score of grade 1, which is defined as slight induration, loss of subcutaneous fat, or slight atrophy. The grade 2 complications included nine cases in which conservative medical treatment was required for decreased hearing (three patients), clinical hypothyroidism (two patients), wound breakdown (two patients), bone exposure (one patient), or mild ear pain (one patient). After axillary dissection, Urist and colleagues reported edema, functional deficits, and pain in 1%, 9%, and 6% of patients, respectively.[60] In a separate series reviewing regional node dissection for axillary melanoma, the reported risk of long-term lymphedema was only 3%.[31] In our series of 89 patients who had undergone axillary lymph node dissection and adjuvant hypofractionated radiotherapy at M. D. Anderson, we found late arm edema in 26 patients.[32] The 5-year actuarial rates of edema by severity were 21% for grade 1 (transient or asymptomatic), 19% for grade 2 (requiring medical management), and 1% for grade 3 (requiring surgical therapy). In an Australian series, the rate of upper-extremity edema after nodal dissection and hypofractionated radiotherapy was 10% at 20 months.[61] That these rates are higher than those reported in series examining lymphadenectomy alone may reflect patient selection factors, with adjuvant radiotherapy being delivered to patients with more regionally advanced disease and requiring more extensive surgical dissection. Also, the incidence of mild to moderate arm edema seen in this setting at M. D. Anderson is similar to what is seen after nodal dissection and comprehensive axillary irradiation for locally advanced breast cancer. The risk of clinically significant lower-extremity edema after inguinal lymph node dissection depends on the extent of dissection and the definition of edema but ranges from 10% to 28%.[60,62-64] Series specifically reporting the rate of lymphedema according to severity have indicated that long-term lymphedema requiring medical management occurs in 10% to 19% of patients.[62,63] In a recent Australian series, the rate of moderate lymphedema requiring medical management after groin dissection and adjuvant irradiation was 48% at 4 years.[61] Again, it was unclear whether this rate of lymphedema was due solely to the adjuvant irradiation or if the extent of dissection and burden of disease may have played a role. In general, patients will have atrophy and loss of subcutaneous fat after nodal irradiation. Mild to moderate long-term lymphedema requiring medical management (physical therapy and compressive devices) occurs in a minority of patients and is seen most commonly after adjuvant irradiation for inguinal nodal metastases. Despite the documented risk of long-term lymphedema, in appropriately selected patients the risk of major complications is far outweighed by improvements in regional control and avoidance of uncontrolled regional recurrence. Irradiation of Regional Lymph Nodes in Patients With a Positive Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy Although data from the literature suggest that adjuvant irradiation after nodal dissection decreases the rate of local recurrence, this has not been proven. Similarly, evidence in favor of elective irradiation has been limited to a single institution and suffers from the same limitations as elective lymph node dissection. Wider availability of sentinel lymph node biopsy now provides an opportunity to examine the potential benefits of elective nodal treatment in a more appropriately selected patient population. It has been suggested that lymph node dissection might benefit only those patients who are known to have nodal involvement. Specifically, Cascinelli and colleagues reported a worse survival rate in patients undergoing delayed dissection for regional recurrence than in patients undergoing elective lymph node dissection and found to have nodal disease.[2] By identifying early nodal metastases, sentinel lymph node biopsy allows proponents of elective lymph node dissection to perform dissection in patients with documented nodal disease. As a corollary, sentinel lymph node biopsy might also allow proponents of elective regional irradiation to irradiate the regional lymphatics in lieu of completion dissection after sentinel node mapping. This policy would provide prognostic information and allow appropriate stratification of patients according to risk factors for clinical trials examining the role of adjuvant systemic therapy, while at the same time providing regional control and eliminating the possibility of morbidity from surgical dissection. Risk of Additional Involved Lymph Nodes in Patients With a Positive Sentinel Node Evidence supporting the validity of this proposed treatment is twofold. First, series examining adjuvant radiotherapy for patients with high-risk clinicopathologic features noted at the time of therapeutic dissection for nodal disease indicate that radiotherapy is effective at sterilizing microscopic deposits of melanoma cells (Table 4).[32-38] Second, as shown in Table 7, the likelihood of additional nodal disease in patients with a positive sentinel lymph node is approximately 20%, and this disease is usually of minimal microscopic burden.[ 39,40,42-45,47,65] It is likely that radiation can effectively sterilize this burden of microscopic disease, as it does when patients are treated therapeutically. We believe a randomized trial comparing completion lymphadenectomy to therapeutic irradiation for patients with a positive sentinel lymph node is justified. A growing body of literature supports the efficacy of adjuvant and elective irradiation in patients with cutaneous malignant melanoma and highrisk clinicopathologic features. The effect of irradiation on overall survival remains largely unknown, but the avoidance of locoregional recurrence is clearly beneficial. Future research should focus on the integration of radiotherapy into systemic therapy protocols. Despite the abundance of retrospective data, only well-designed randomized trials can establish radiotherapy as an appropriate component of multidisciplinary treatment for patients with malignant melanoma. Such trials are urgently needed.

ca004f0f-3aa8-4674-837b-96982a441fa0,"— — Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is a type of inflammatory arthritis that affects children under the age of 16. It was previously known as juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA). Most forms of JIA are . That means your body’s immune system mistakes your own cells for foreign ones and attacks them. The attacks cause joint pain, swelling, and stiffness. An infectious organism such as bacteria can trigger an attack. You might have a single attack of JIA, or symptoms may last for years. The condition is considered chronic if the symptoms linger for more than three months. Read more about juvenile idiopathic (formerly rheumatoid) arthritis. Oligoarthritis (previously called pauciarticular JRA) affects four or fewer joints in the first six months. The joints most often affected are the knees, ankles, and elbows. Hip joints aren’t affected, but inflammation in the eye () can occur. If are present, children who have them need to be monitored closely by an . Polyarthritis (also called polyarticular JIA) involves more of the body than oligoarthritis. It affects five or more joints in the first six months of illness. Small joints in the fingers and hand are most affected; it may also affect weight-bearing joints such as the knees and jaw. There are two forms: RF-positive (rheumatoid factor-positive) and RF-negative (rheumatoid factor-negative). The RF-positive type most closely resembles adult . Systemic JIA affects the entire body, sometimes including internal organs such as the heart, liver, and spleen. Symptoms can include , , , and . Other subtypes include psoriatic and enthesitis-related JIA: occurs when is present alongside other symptoms such as , nail separation (), and the swelling of a single whole finger or toe (). involves inflammation of the , ligaments, spine (axial), and (SI) joints. It can also affect the hips, knees, and feet. Uveitis can occur as can the genetic marker . The last subtype is undifferentiated arthritis, which does not fit within any other subtype. Symptoms can span two or more of the subtypes. The symptoms of arthritis come and go in waves called flare-ups. During a flare-up, symptoms worsen. Symptoms go into remission — become less severe or disappear — between flare-ups. JIA is different in everyone. You may have a few flare-ups and then never have symptoms again. You may also experience frequent flare-ups or flare-ups that never go away. The most common symptom of JIA is . Joints may swell and grow tender. They can turn red and feel . Your joints can become stiff and lose their mobility. This results in a loss of fine dexterity, especially in your hands. Many people with JIA limp due to joint pain in their , , or . Read more about what causes stiff joints and how to find relief. You might find yourself becoming less physically active due to the pain and loss of mobility. If your arthritis lasts long enough, your joints may become damaged. The joint pain from arthritis can disrupt your sleep, causing you to feel tired. Inflammation can also cause . You might and have trouble gaining weight as you grow. It’s also possible that you may lose weight. Don’t let pain and fatigue get worse. Stay active to reset your body’s sleep cycle. Exercise to release endorphins, the body’s natural painkillers. Certain exercises can also strengthen the muscles around your joints, diminish pain, and help you maintain flexibility. Persistent arthritis can damage your joints. While you’re still growing, you have what are called growth plates on the ends of your bones. These allow your bones to get longer and stronger. Arthritis can distort these plates and the surrounding cartilage. This can inhibit your growth or cause joints to grow at different rates. For example, one arm or leg might become longer or shorter than the other. Treating arthritis early can help protect against growth problems. Inflammation associated with arthritis can involve the eyes, causing and . You might be particularly sensitive to bright light if you have eye pain and inflammation. Untreated inflammation can permanently damage your eyes and cause vision problems. This inflammation is often inside the eyeball instead of on the surface of the eye. Diagnosing this requires a , a test that detects the inflammation. If you have systemic JIA, you may experience a high fever and a light pink rash on your skin. The rash most commonly appears on the following body parts: The rash and the fever appear together and can come and go very suddenly. A fever from JIA can spike above 103°F (39.4°C). It can last for weeks, unlike the fever caused by a cold. Systemic JIA can also cause lymph nodes to swell up and become inflamed. Lymph nodes are small glands that act as your body’s filters. They’re found all over the body, including the corners of the jaw, the armpit, and inside the thigh. Sometimes the swelling can spread to the internal organs, affecting the heart, liver, spleen, and the tissue that surrounds the organs (serositis). In rare cases, lungs can become inflamed. A rare, but serious, complication called macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) can occur when the immune system goes into extreme overdrive.

Male Breast Cancer Treatment (PDQ®): Treatment - Patient Information [NCI] Male Breast Cancer Treatment (PDQ®): Treatment - Patient Information [NCI] This information is produced and provided by the National Cancer Institute (NCI). The information in this topic may have changed since it was written. For the most current information, contact the National Cancer Institute via the Internet web site at http://cancer.gov or call 1-800-4-CANCER. Male breast cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the breast. Breast cancer may occur in men. Breast cancer may occur in men at any age, but it usually occurs in men between 60 and 70 years of age. Male breast cancer makes up less than 1% of all cases of breast cancer. The following types of breast cancer are found in men: Infiltrating ductal carcinoma: Cancer that has spread beyond the cells lining ducts in the breast. This is the most common type of breast cancer in men. Ductal carcinoma in situ: Abnormal cells that are found in the lining of a duct; also called intraductal carcinoma. Inflammatory breast cancer: A type of cancer in which the breast looks red and swollen and feels warm. Paget disease of the nipple: A tumor that has grown from ducts beneath the nipple onto the surface of the nipple. Lobular carcinoma in situ (abnormal cells found in one of the lobes or sections of the breast), which sometimes occurs in women, has not been seen in men. Anatomy of the male breast. The nipple and areola are shown on the outside of the breast. The lymph nodes, fatty tissue, ducts, and other parts of the inside of the breast are also shown. A family history of breast cancer and other factors can increase a man's risk of breast cancer. Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn't mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk. Risk factors for breast cancer in men may include the following: Treatment with radiation therapy to your breast/chest. Having a disease linked to high levels of estrogen in the body, such as cirrhosis (liver disease) or Klinefelter syndrome (a genetic disorder). Having one or more female relatives who have had breast cancer. Having mutations (changes) in genes such as BRCA2. Male breast cancer is sometimes caused by inherited gene mutations (changes). The genes in cells carry the hereditary information that is received from a person's parents. Hereditary breast cancer makes up about 5% to 10% of all breast cancer. Some mutated genes related to breast cancer, such as BRCA2, are more common in certain ethnic groups. Men who have a mutated gene related to breast cancer have an increased risk of this disease. There are tests that can detect (find) mutated genes. These genetic tests are sometimes done for members of families with a high risk of cancer. See the following PDQ summaries for more information: Men with breast cancer usually have lumps that can be felt. Lumps and other signs may be caused by male breast cancer or by other conditions. Check with your doctor if you have any of the following: A lump or thickening in or near the breast or in the underarm area. Scaly, red, or swollen skin on the breast, nipple, or areola (the dark area of skin around the nipple). Dimples in the breast that look like the skin of an orange, called peau d'orange. Tests that examine the breasts are used to detect (find) and diagnose breast cancer in men. : An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient's health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken. : An exam of the breast by a doctor or other health professional. The doctor will carefully feel the breasts and under the arms for lumps or anything else that seems unusual. : A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. The picture can be printed to be looked at later. : A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of both breasts. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI). : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease. : The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. There are four types of biopsies to check for breast cancer: : The removal of an entire lump of tissue. : The removal of part of a lump or a sample of tissue. : The removal of tissue using a wide needle. : The removal of tissue or fluid using a thin needle. If cancer is found, tests are done to study the cancer cells. Decisions about the best treatment are based on the results of these tests. The tests give information about: How likely it is that the cancer will spread through the body. : A test to measure the amount of estrogen and progesterone (hormones) receptors in cancer tissue. If there are more estrogen and progesterone receptors than normal, the cancer is called estrogen and/or progesterone receptor positive. This type of breast cancer may grow more quickly. The test results show whether treatment to block estrogen and progesterone may stop the cancer from growing. : A laboratory test to measure how many HER2/neu genes there are and how much HER2/neu protein is made in a sample of tissue. If there are more HER2/neu genes or higher levels of HER2/neu protein than normal, the cancer is called HER2/neu positive. This type of breast cancer may grow more quickly and is more likely to spread to other parts of the body. The cancer may be treated with drugs that target the HER2/neu protein, such as trastuzumab and pertuzumab. Survival for men with breast cancer is similar to survival for women with breast cancer. Survival for men with breast cancer is similar to that for women with breast cancer when their stage at diagnosis is the same. Breast cancer in men, however, is often diagnosed at a later stage. Cancer found at a later stage may be less likely to be cured. Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on the following: The stage of the cancer (the size of the tumor and whether it is in the breast only or has spread to lymph nodes or other places in the body). Estrogen-receptor and progesterone-receptor levels in the tumor tissue. Whether the cancer is also found in the other breast. Whether the cancer has just been diagnosed or has recurred (come back). After breast cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the breast or to other parts of the body. After breast cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the breast or to other parts of the body. This process is called staging. The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment. Breast cancer in men is staged the same as it is in women. The spread of cancer from the breast to lymph nodes and other parts of the body appears to be similar in men and women. The following tests and procedures may be used in the staging process: : The removal of the sentinel lymph node during surgery. The sentinel lymph node is the first lymph node in a group of lymph nodes to receive lymphatic drainage from the primary tumor. It is the first lymph node the cancer is likely to spread to from the primary tumor. A radioactive substance and/or blue dye is injected near the tumor. The substance or dye flows through the lymph ducts to the lymph nodes. The first lymph node to receive the substance or dye is removed. A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells. If cancer cells are not found, it may not be necessary to remove more lymph nodes. Sometimes, a sentinel lymph node is found in more than one group of nodes. : An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body. : A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. : A procedure to check if there are rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer cells, in the bone. A very small amount of radioactive material is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream. The radioactive material collects in the bones with cancer and is detected by a scanner. : A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do. There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body. Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood: Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas. Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body. Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body. Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body. When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood. Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body. Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body. The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if breast cancer spreads to the bone, the cancer cells in the bone are actually breast cancer cells. The disease is metastatic breast cancer, not bone cancer. In breast cancer, stage is based on the size and location of the primary tumor, the spread of cancer to nearby lymph nodes or other parts of the body, tumor grade, and whether certain biomarkers are present. To plan the best treatment and understand your prognosis, it is important to know the breast cancer stage. is used first to assign a stage for patients based on health history, physical exam, imaging tests (if done), and biopsies. The Clinical Prognostic Stage is described by the TNM system, tumor grade, and biomarker status (ER, PR, HER2). In clinical staging, mammography or ultrasound is used to check the lymph nodes for signs of cancer. is then used for patients who have surgery as their first treatment. The Pathological Prognostic Stage is based on all clinical information, biomarker status, and laboratory test results from breast tissue and lymph nodes removed during surgery. is based on the size and the spread of cancer as described by the TNM system. The Anatomic Stage is used in parts of the world where biomarker testing is not available. It is not used in the United States. The TNM system is used to describe the size of the primary tumor and the spread of cancer to nearby lymph nodes or other parts of the body. For breast cancer, the TNM system describes the tumor as follows: Tumor sizes are often measured in millimeters (mm) or centimeters. Common items that can be used to show tumor size in mm include: a sharp pencil point (1 mm), a new crayon point (2 mm), a pencil-top eraser (5 mm), a pea (10 mm), a peanut (20 mm), and a lime (50 mm). Tis: Carcinoma in situ. There are 2 types of breast carcinoma in situ: Tis (DCIS): DCIS is a condition in which abnormal cells are found in the lining of a breast duct. The abnormal cells have not spread outside the duct to other tissues in the breast. In some cases, DCIS may become invasive breast cancer that is able to spread to other tissues. At this time, there is no way to know which lesions can become invasive. Tis (Paget disease): Paget disease of the nipple is a condition in which abnormal cells are found in the skin cells of the nipple and may spread to the areola. It is not staged according to the TNM system. If Paget disease AND an invasive breast cancer are present, the TNM system is used to stage the invasive breast cancer. T1: The tumor is 20 millimeters or smaller. There are 4 subtypes of a T1 tumor depending on the size of the tumor: T1a: the tumor is larger than 1 millimeter but not larger than 5 millimeters. T1b: the tumor is larger than 5 millimeters but not larger than 10 millimeters. T1c: the tumor is larger than 10 millimeters but not larger than 20 millimeters. T2: The tumor is larger than 20 millimeters but not larger than 50 millimeters. T4: The tumor is described as one of the following: T4b: the tumor has grown into the skin—an ulcer has formed on the surface of the skin on the breast, small tumor nodules have formed in the same breast as the primary tumor, and/or there is swelling of the skin on the breast. T4c: the tumor has grown into the chest wall and the skin. T4d: inflammatory breast cancer —one-third or more of the skin on the breast is red and swollen (called peau d'orange). Lymph Node (N). The size and location of lymph nodes where cancer has spread. When the lymph nodes are removed by surgery and studied under a microscope by a pathologist, pathologic staging is used to describe the lymph nodes. The pathologic staging of lymph nodes is described below. N0: No sign of cancer in the lymph nodes, or tiny clusters of cancer cells not larger than 0.2 millimeters in the lymph nodes. N1: Cancer is described as one of the following: N1mi: cancer has spread to the axillary (armpit area) lymph nodes and is larger than 0.2 millimeters but not larger than 2 millimeters. N1a: cancer has spread to 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes and the cancer in at least one of the lymph nodes is larger than 2 millimeters. N1b: cancer has spread to lymph nodes near the breastbone on the same side of the body as the primary tumor, and the cancer is larger than 0.2 millimeters and is found by sentinel lymph node biopsy. Cancer is not found in the axillary lymph nodes. N1c: cancer has spread to 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes and the cancer in at least one of the lymph nodes is larger than 2 millimeters. Cancer is also found by sentinel lymph node biopsy in the lymph nodes near the breastbone on the same side of the body as the primary tumor. N2: Cancer is described as one of the following: N2a: cancer has spread to 4 to 9 axillary lymph nodes and the cancer in at least one of the lymph nodes is larger than 2 millimeters. N2b: cancer has spread to lymph nodes near the breastbone and the cancer is found by imaging tests. Cancer is not found in the axillary lymph nodes by sentinel lymph node biopsy or lymph node dissection. N3: Cancer is described as one of the following: N3a: cancer has spread to 10 or more axillary lymph nodes and the cancer in at least one of the lymph nodes is larger than 2 millimeters, or cancer has spread to lymph nodes below the collarbone. N3b: cancer has spread to 1 to 9 axillary lymph nodes and the cancer in at least one of the lymph nodes is larger than 2 millimeters. Cancer has also spread to lymph nodes near the breastbone and the cancer is found by imaging tests; cancer has spread to 4 to 9 axillary lymph nodes and cancer in at least one of the lymph nodes is larger than 2 millimeters. Cancer has also spread to lymph nodes near the breastbone on the same side of the body as the primary tumor, and the cancer is larger than 0.2 millimeters and is found by sentinel lymph node biopsy. N3c: cancer has spread to lymph nodes above the collarbone on the same side of the body as the primary tumor. When the lymph nodes are checked using mammography or ultrasound, it is called clinical staging. The clinical staging of lymph nodes is not described here. Metastasis (M). The spread of cancer to other parts of the body. M0: There is no sign that cancer has spread to other parts of the body. M1: Cancer has spread to other parts of the body, most often the bones, lungs, liver, or brain. If cancer has spread to distant lymph nodes, the cancer in the lymph nodes is larger than 0.2 millimeters. The grading system is used to describe how quickly a breast tumor is likely to grow and spread. The grading system describes a tumor based on how abnormal the cancer cells and tissue look under a microscope and how quickly the cancer cells are likely to grow and spread. Low-grade cancer cells look more like normal cells and tend to grow and spread more slowly than high-grade cancer cells. To describe how abnormal the cancer cells and tissue are, the pathologist will assess the following three features: How much of the tumor tissue has normal breast ducts. The size and shape of the nuclei in the tumor cells. How many dividing cells are present, which is a measure of how fast the tumor cells are growing and dividing. For each feature, the pathologist assigns a score of 1 to 3; a score of ""1"" means the cells and tumor tissue look the most like normal cells and tissue, and a score of ""3"" means the cells and tissue look the most abnormal. The scores for each feature are added together to get a total score between 3 and 9. Total score of 3 to 5: G1 (Low grade or well differentiated). Total score of 6 to 7: G2 (Intermediate grade or moderately differentiated). Total score of 8 to 9: G3 (High grade or poorly differentiated). Biomarker testing is used to find out whether breast cancer cells have certain receptors. Healthy breast cells, and some breast cancer cells, have receptors (biomarkers) that attach to the hormones estrogen and progesterone. These hormones are needed for healthy cells, and some breast cancer cells, to grow and divide. To check for these biomarkers, samples of tissue containing breast cancer cells are removed during a biopsy or surgery. The samples are tested in a laboratory to see whether the breast cancer cells have estrogen or progesterone receptors. Another type of receptor (biomarker) that is found on the surface of all breast cancer cells is called HER2. HER2 receptors are needed for the breast cancer cells to grow and divide. For breast cancer, biomarker testing includes the following: . If the breast cancer cells have estrogen receptors, the cancer cells are called ER positive (ER+). If the breast cancer cells do not have estrogen receptors, the cancer cells are called ER negative (ER-). . If the breast cancer cells have progesterone receptors, the cancer cells are called PR positive (PR+). If the breast cancer cells do not have progesterone receptors, the cancer cells are called PR negative (PR-). Human epidermal growth factor type 2 receptor (HER2/neu or HER2). If the breast cancer cells have larger than normal amounts of HER2 receptors on their surface, the cancer cells are called HER2 positive (HER2+). If the breast cancer cells have a normal amount of HER2 on their surface, the cancer cells are called HER2 negative (HER2-). HER2+ breast cancer is more likely to grow and divide faster than HER2- breast cancer. Sometimes the breast cancer cells will be described as triple negative or triple positive. . If the breast cancer cells do not have estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors, or a larger than normal amount of HER2 receptors, the cancer cells are called triple negative. . If the breast cancer cells do have estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors, and a larger than normal amount of HER2 receptors, the cancer cells are called triple positive. It is important to know the estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER2 receptor status to choose the best treatment. There are drugs that can stop the receptors from attaching to the hormones estrogen and progesterone and stop the cancer from growing. Other drugs may be used to block the HER2 receptors on the surface of the breast cancer cells and stop the cancer from growing. The TNM system, the grading system, and biomarker status are combined to find out the breast cancer stage. Here are 3 examples that combine the TNM system, the grading system, and the biomarker status to find out the Pathological Prognostic breast cancer stage for a woman whose first treatment was surgery: If the tumor size is 30 millimeters (T2), has not spread to nearby lymph nodes (N0), has not spread to distant parts of the body (M0), and is: If the tumor size is 53 millimeters (T3), has spread to 4 to 9 axillary lymph nodes (N2), has not spread to other parts of the body (M0), and is: If the tumor size is 65 millimeters (T3), has spread to 3 axillary lymph nodes (N1a), has spread to the lungs (M1), and is: Talk to your doctor to find out what your breast cancer stage is and how it is used to plan the best treatment for you. After surgery, your doctor will receive a pathology report that describes the size and location of the primary tumor, the spread of cancer to nearby lymph nodes, tumor grade, and whether certain biomarkers are present. The pathology report and other test results are used to determine your breast cancer stage. You are likely to have many questions. Ask your doctor to explain how staging is used to decide the best options to treat your cancer and whether there are clinical trials that might be right for you. The treatment of male breast cancer depends partly on the stage of the disease. For treatment options for stage I, stage II, stage IIIA, and operable stage IIIC breast cancer, see Early/Localized/Operable Male Breast Cancer. For treatment options for cancer that has recurred near the area where it first formed, see Locoregional Recurrent Male Breast Cancer. For treatment options for stage IV breast cancer or breast cancer that has recurred in other parts of the body, see Metastatic Breast Cancer in Men. In inflammatory breast cancer, cancer has spread to the skin of the breast and the breast looks red and swollen and feels warm. The redness and warmth occur because the cancer cells block the lymph vessels in the skin. The skin of the breast may also show the dimpled appearance called peau d'orange (like the skin of an orange). There may not be any lumps in the breast that can be felt. Inflammatory breast cancer may be stage IIIB, stage IIIC, or stage IV. Recurrent breast cancer is cancer that has recurred (come back) after it has been treated. The cancer may come back in the breast, in the chest wall, or in other parts of the body. There are different types of treatment for men with breast cancer. Different types of treatment are available for men with breast cancer. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment. Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward. Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment. Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website. Choosing the most appropriate cancer treatment is a decision that ideally involves the patient, family, and health care team. Five types of standard treatment are used to treat men with breast cancer: Surgery for men with breast cancer is usually a modified radical mastectomy (removal of the breast, many of the lymph nodes under the arm, the lining over the chest muscles, and sometimes part of the chest wall muscles). Modified radical mastectomy. The dotted line shows where the entire breast and some lymph nodes are removed. Part of the chest wall muscle may also be removed. Breast-conserving surgery, an operation to remove the cancer but not the breast itself, is also used for some men with breast cancer. A lumpectomy is done to remove the tumor (lump) and a small amount of normal tissue around it. Radiation therapy is given after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Breast-conserving surgery. Dotted lines show the area containing the tumor that is removed and some of the lymph nodes that may be removed. Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. Systemic chemotherapy is used to treat breast cancer in men. See Drugs Approved for Breast Cancer for more information. Hormone therapy is a cancer treatment that removes hormones or blocks their action and stops cancer cells from growing. Hormones are substances made by glands in the body and circulated in the bloodstream. Some hormones can cause certain cancers to grow. If tests show that the cancer cells have places where hormones can attach (receptors), drugs, surgery, or radiation therapy is used to reduce the production of hormones or block them from working. Hormone therapy with tamoxifen is often given to patients with estrogen-receptor and progesterone-receptor positive breast cancer and to patients with metastatic breast cancer (cancer that has spread to other parts of the body). Hormone therapy with an aromatase inhibitor is given to some men who have metastatic breast cancer. Aromatase inhibitors decrease the body's estrogen by blocking an enzyme called aromatase from turning androgen into estrogen. Anastrozole, letrozole, and exemestane are types of aromatase inhibitors. Hormone therapy with a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist is given to some men who have metastatic breast cancer. LHRH agonists affect the pituitary gland, which controls how much testosterone is made by the testicles. In men who are taking LHRH agonists, the pituitary gland tells the testicles to make less testosterone. Leuprolide and goserelin are types of LHRH agonists. Other types of hormone therapy include megestrol acetate or anti-estrogen therapy, such as fulvestrant. See Drugs Approved for Breast Cancer for more information. Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy: External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer. Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer. The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. External radiation therapy is used to treat male breast cancer. Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells. Monoclonal antibody therapy, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors are types of targeted therapies used to treat men with breast cancer. Monoclonal antibody therapy uses antibodies made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell. These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow. The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion. They may be used alone or to carry drugs, toxins, or radioactive material directly to cancer cells. Monoclonal antibodies are also used with chemotherapy as adjuvant therapy (treatment given after surgery to lower the risk that the cancer will come back). Types of monoclonal antibody therapy include the following: Trastuzumab is a monoclonal antibody that blocks the effects of the growth factor protein HER2. Pertuzumab is a monoclonal antibody that may be combined with trastuzumab and chemotherapy to treat breast cancer. Ado-trastuzumab emtansine is a monoclonal antibody linked to an anticancer drug. This is called an antibody-drug conjugate. It may be used to treat men with hormone receptor positive breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors are targeted therapy drugs that block signals needed for tumors to grow. Lapatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that may be used to treat men with metastatic breast cancer. Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors are targeted therapy drugs that block proteins called cyclin-dependent kinases, which cause the growth of cancer cells. Palbociclib is a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor used to treat men with metastatic breast cancer. Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors block a protein called mTOR, which may keep cancer cells from growing and prevent the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow. See Drugs Approved for Breast Cancer for more information. Treatment for male breast cancer may cause side effects. For information about side effects caused by treatment for cancer, see our Side Effects page. For information about the treatments listed below, see the Treatment Option Overview section. Breast cancer in men is treated the same as breast cancer in women. (See the PDQ summary on Breast Cancer Treatment (Adult) for more information.) Treatment of early, localized, or operable breast cancer may include the following: Treatment for men diagnosed with breast cancer is usually modified radical mastectomy. Breast-conserving surgery with lumpectomy followed by radiation therapy may be used for some men. Therapy given after an operation when cancer cells can no longer be seen is called adjuvant therapy. Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the operation, the patient may be given radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, and/or targeted therapy after surgery, to try to kill any cancer cells that may be left. Node-negative: For men whose cancer is node-negative (cancer has not spread to the lymph nodes), adjuvant therapy should be considered on the same basis as for a woman with breast cancer because there is no evidence that response to therapy is different for men and women. Node-positive: For men whose cancer is node-positive (cancer has spread to the lymph nodes), adjuvant therapy may include the following: Hormone therapy with tamoxifen (to block the effect of estrogen) or less often, aromatase inhibitors (to reduce the amount of estrogen in the body). Targeted therapy with a monoclonal antibody (trastuzumab or pertuzumab). These treatments appear to increase survival in men as they do in women. The patient's response to hormone therapy depends on whether there are hormone receptors (proteins) in the tumor. Most breast cancers in men have these receptors. Hormone therapy is usually recommended for male breast cancer patients, but it can have many side effects, including hot flashes and impotence (the inability to have an erection adequate for sexual intercourse). For information about the treatments listed below, see the Treatment Option Overview section.

Abstract Abstract Surgical treatment of breast cancer has changed significantly in recent years. Fine-needle aspirations or core-needle biopsies can be used in the diagnostic process, thus avoiding scarring incisions. The preferred method of treatment for many women with early breast cancer is conservative surgical therapy (principally lumpectomy and axillary dissection) followed by breast irradiation. Sentinel node biopsy is being investigated as an alternative to standard axillary node dissection. This could decrease morbidity following standard axillary dissection. These techniques allow women with different forms of breast cancer to conserve their breasts. For women who choose mastectomy, immediate reconstruction of the breast is now routinely performed with a prosthetic implant or autologous tissue. Clinical history, physical examination, and breast imaging are the most effective means of follow-up. Approximately 192,200 women in the United States are diagnosed annually with invasive breast cancer. Conservative surgery followed by breast irradiation has replaced modified radical mastectomy as the preferred treatment for early-stage invasive breast cancer. Public education and proactive screening programs have contributed to the early detection of small tumors in a greater percentage of women. Studies have shown that women diagnosed at early stages of invasive breast cancer have equivalent outcomes when they are treated by lumpectomy and radiation therapy or modified radical mastectomy.- Abstract The diagnostic process for a breast mass begins with assessment of risk based on family history, personal history of breast problems, and physical examination. Significant signs of cancer include an irregular hard mass, lymph node involvement, and skin changes. If none of these signs is present and the mass is asymptomatic, mammography (ultrasound for women 30 years of age or less) and needle biopsy should be performed. Abstract Stage I and Stage II breast cancers are early cancers that are not fixed to the skin or muscle. If lymph nodes are involved, they are not fixed to each other or to underlying structures. Modified radical mastectomy continues to be appropriate for some patients, but breast conservation therapy is now regarded as the optimal treatment for most. Six prospective randomized trials have shown no difference in survival when mastectomy is compared with conservative surgery plus radiation for Stage I and Stage II breast cancer .

Adapted from Winchester DP, Cox JD. Standards for diagnosis and management of invasive breast carcinoma. CA Cancer J Clin 1998;48:85. Local recurrence can happen after surgery. Following lumpectomy, local recurrence is usually at the surgical site and can be treated with mastectomy. After mastectomy, recurrence is on the chest wall. The resulting five-year survival rate is approximately 69 percent. Randomized trials also have compared breast conservation surgery alone with surgery plus radiation therapy. These trials have shown a higher recurrence rate in women who did not receive radiation. Standard breast conservation therapy should therefore include radiation therapy. Abstract A complete history and physical examination help determine which surgery is best for each individual patient. A family history of breast cancer is not a contraindication to breast-conserving surgery. Age alone should not be a determining factor in selecting surgical strategy, however elderly women may have comorbid conditions that need to be considered. A woman who is likely to have difficulty with general anesthesia might benefit from a lumpectomy performed under local anesthesia. Conversely, a woman who has difficulty complying with six weeks of radiation treatments may be a better candidate for mastectomy. Mammographic evaluation performed within the past three months is necessary to plan surgery. The location, size, associated microcalcifications, and any other characteristics of the primary tumor must be determined. Bilateral mammography is also necessary to evaluate the presence of other suspicious lesions in the breast tissue. Patients with invasive ductal and lobular cancers are candidates for conservative therapy if the tumor is not diffuse and negative surgical margins can be achieved. The presence of positive axillary nodes is not a contraindication to breast conservation therapy. Tumors located near the nipple areolar complex may require excision of the nipple, but this also is not a contraindication. The status of the margins of resection after lumpectomy is important when determining the optimal surgical treatment. When negative margins can be achieved with the preservation of adequate amounts of breast tissue, the patient is a candidate for conservative surgical therapy. If tumor remains at the margin after re-excision, modified radical mastectomy may be the treatment of choice. The patient's wishes should always be considered when deciding treatment. For most patients, mastectomy will not influence the likelihood of survival but may impact quality of life. Women whose breasts are preserved have fewer episodes of depression, anxiety, and insomnia. A recent study of patients with early-stage breast cancer found women who undergo breast conservation therapy have improved body image, higher satisfaction with treatment, and no more fear of recurrence compared with women treated with mastectomy. Abstract When two or more primary tumors are located in different quadrants of the breast or there are associated diffuse microcalcifications which appear malignant, breast-conserving therapy is not appropriate. A woman with previous breast irradiation is also not a candidate. Breast irradiation cannot be given during pregnancy, but it may be possible to perform breast-conserving surgery in the third trimester and administer irradiation after delivery. As mentioned above, positive surgical margins are also an absolute contraindication. Most radiation oncologists consider a history of collagen vascular disease a relative con-traindication because the poor vasculature in the skin leads to unacceptable cosmetic results. Tumor size is not an absolute contraindication, but the presence of a large tumor in a small breast treated with adequate margins might result in an unwanted cosmetic appearance. Abstract Stage III tumors (larger than 5 cm), inflammatory cancers, and cancers fixed to the skin or muscle are usually treated with three cycles of chemotherapy followed by surgery. Because locally advanced cancers are more likely to spread to distant sites, systemic therapy should be commenced as early as possible. Abstract Nonpalpable carcinoma can be diagnosed using image-guided biopsy or needle localization with excisional biopsy. The image-guided biopsy uses either ultrasound or mammography to stereotactically localize the suspicious lesion. A large-bore needle is then used to obtain a sample from the lesion. This procedure is done through a small incision (several millimeters in length) with local anesthesia. A large multi-institutional study of core-needle biopsies did not show seeding or spreading of cancer cells along the instrumentation track following this procedure. The localization excisional biopsy requires that a wire be placed using mammography prior to surgery. The subsequent surgical incision is usually 1 to 2 cm in length allowing the tissue surrounding the tip of the wire to be removed. Studies suggest that the stereotactic procedure is faster and less costly than excisional biopsy. This procedure may not be possible, as in the cases of patients who cannot lie in the prone position required for the procedure, or those who have a body weight exceeding the limits of the surgery table. If the patient becomes easily agitated or is unable to stop coughing, monitored sedation and an excisional procedure are indicated. Suspicious lesions close to the chest wall or the skin may be too difficult to remove stereotactically and may require needle localization excisional biopsy. Lesions that should probably be removed stereotactically are those in women who have breast implants or have a pacemaker implanted in the breast. Abstract Local anesthesia with intravenous sedation can be used for definitive excision or lumpectomy. An incision is made directly over the tumor and should be of adequate size to allow the tumor to be completely removed. The pathologist determines that the margins are grossly clear on the surgical specimen. If the surgical margin is positive on histologic evaluation, re-excision of the biopsy site is necessary to ensure complete tumor removal. Axillary dissection is performed under general anesthesia. The incision is transverse at the lower border of the axilla and extends to the posterior border of the pectoralis major muscle. Standard axillary dissection involves removing Level I and Level II nodes. Level II nodes lie between the pectoralis muscles, with Level III nodes above and Level I nodes below. Removal of Level III axillary nodes is necessary when obvious disease is present. A closed suction drain is placed following axillary dissection. Active range-of-motion exercises are advised beginning three to five days postoperative. Although this may prolong axillary drainage, it may prevent frozen shoulder. The sentinel lymph node is the first node in the chain of nodes that forms the regional lymphatic system. This system drains the area containing the malignant lesion. The sentinel node is a key indicator of spread. The sentinel node can be identified using several strategies, such as a gammaemitting agent, Technetium 99-labeled sulfur colloids, or a blue dye. These can be used individually or in combination, and are injected circumferentially around the periphery of the lesion during surgery. The material is then taken up by the natural lymphatic drainage system. The sentinel nodes can be found during surgery with a gamma probe (a handheld device) that identifies a “hot spot” representing the node. When dye techniques are used, the sentinel node is colored blue for visual identification. The sentinel node can then be removed and examined for tumor cells. One study reported that 11 surgeons in various practice settings were able to identify 413 sentinel nodes in 443 patients. When subsequent complete axillary dissection was performed, the positive predictive value of the sentinel nodes identified was 96 percent, with a sensitivity of 89 percent. This and other studies concluded that sentinel node biopsy can predict whether axillary node metastasis is present and may reduce the need for extensive axillary dissection in some women. Contraindications to sentinel node biopsy include a clinically positive axillary node, prior axillary surgery, pregnancy, or lactation. Additionally, women who have received pre-operative chemotherapy, who have multicentric and extensive multifocal carcinoma, and who have tumors larger than 5 cm should not undergo sentinel node biopsy. Studies documenting the success rates of physicians learning this procedure have conflicting results. One study found that after five training cases, individual physicians could identify the sentinel node 79 to 98 percent of the time. Another study found that the success rate for a physician's first 10 cases ranged from 60 to 90 percent. Physicians should document their ability to identify a sentinel node before obtaining privileges for this procedure. Even though a recent survey showed 77 percent of physicians reported performing sentinel lymph node dissection for breast cancer, it remains an investigational procedure. Prophylactic mastectomy can be offered to high-risk women, including Stage I and Stage II BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutation carriers and women with lobular carcinoma in situ. This bilateral mastectomy removes the nipple and 90 percent of the breast tissue but not the axillary lymph nodes. Reconstruction can then be performed. Abstract Radiation therapy begins two to four weeks after surgery. The dose of radiation delivered to the entire breast is between 4,500 and 5,000 cGy. A booster dose of 1,500 cGy is delivered to the tumor site. Treatment is given for five days per week during a period of six weeks. Side effects can include fatigue, burns, and skin thickening. Abstract Treatment for DCIS is complex and depends on the size of the lesion, the histology, and the margin status. Combinations of wide excision, radiation therapy, and tamoxifen (Nolvadex) are used. A treatment algorithm is shown in . Reprinted from Levitt SH. Radiotherapy for breast cancer.

Abstract Risks and benefits are different for each surgical procedure, the most common of which are summarized in . The rightsholder did not grant rights to reproduce this item in electronic media. For the missing item, see the original print version of this publication. Common complications of breast surgery are bleeding and infection. Seromas (accumulations of clear fluid) can develop and are usually treated with percutaneous needle aspiration. Major complications after axillary dissection include lymphedema of the arm and nerve damage. Injury to the long thoracic nerve denervates the serratus anterior muscle and causes a winged scapula. Intercosto-brachial nerve damage causes loss of sensation in the upper inner arm. Several strategies are recommended for prevention of lymphedema, but these strategies lack scientific proof of effectiveness. Patients should immediately seek treatment for any infection. Blood pressure measurements, venipunctures, and intravenous insertions should be avoided in the arm on the side of the surgery. Abstract Reconstruction is available for women who need a total mastectomy or whose partial mastectomy leaves an unacceptable deformity. Reconstructive surgery can be delayed or performed immediately, and uses either breast implants or autologous tissue. The most commonly used autologous tissue is the TRAM (transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous) flap. The latissimus dorsi muscle also can be used. In some cases, free flaps are used. Reasons for undergoing reconstruction include inability to wear clothes, dislike of the external prosthesis, and weariness of the mastectomy deformity. Many women choose not to have reconstruction. Women tend to be satisfied with the result of reconstruction when it is delayed months or years after mastectomy. Additionally, chemotherapy or radiation therapy will not interfere with the reconstruction. Immediate reconstruction is more convenient for patients, less expensive, and limits exposure to anesthesia risk. The aesthetic results tend to be better and the patient does not have to live with a deformity, even temporarily. Abstract Clinical history, physical examination, and breast imaging are the most effective means of follow-up. Physical examination should be performed every three to six months for the first three years following surgery, and every six months in years four and five. After five years, annual physical examinations provide adequate follow-up. Patients at exceptionally high risk of recurrence or development of a second primary tumor should be watched more closely. Mammography is important for the early recognition of recurrence. Unfortunately, changes seen on mammography resulting from surgical therapy and irradiation (such as scarring, skin thickening, and masses representing postoperative fluid collections) may mimic the signs of malignancy. A baseline mammogram should be obtained approximately six months after tumor excision and the completion of all treatments. Mammography should then be done at least annually. Other imaging studies may be necessary in symptomatic patients. Patients with bone pain should be screened by bone scan for bone secondaries. Detailed laboratory follow-up is expensive and has not been shown to improve survival. Randomized control trials have not shown survival benefit from the routine use of bone scan and computed tomographic scan for asymptomatic patients with Stage I or Stage II breast cancer.

Los datos probatorios y la aplicación a la práctica referida a los niños pueden diferir significativamente de la información pertinente a los adultos. Cuando la información específica sobre la atención de los niños esté disponible, se resumirá bajo su propio encabezado. El sistema linfático humano generalmente incluye los vasos linfáticos superficiales o primarios que forman una red dérmica compleja de canales en forma de capilares que drenan en vasos linfáticos secundarios localizados en el espacio subdérmico. Estos vasos linfáticos primarios y secundarios van paralelos a las venas superficiales y drenan en una tercera capa de vasos linfáticos más profunda localizada en la grasa subcutánea adyacente a la fascia. Una barrera muscular y numerosas válvulas ayudan a que el flujo linfático activo siga un recorrido unidireccional hacia los ganglios linfáticos secundarios y subcutáneos. Los vasos linfáticos primarios carecen de barrera muscular y no tienen válvulas. También hay un sistema intramuscular de vasos linfáticos paralelo a las arterias profundas y drena en los compartimientos musculares, las articulaciones y las membranas sinoviales. Los sistemas linfáticos superficiales y profundos posiblemente funcionen en forma independiente, excepto en los estados anormales, aunque hay pruebas de que se comunican cerca de los ganglios linfáticos.[] La linfa drena desde las extremidades inferiores hacia el tronco linfático lumbar, que se une al tronco linfático intestinal y la cisterna del quilo para formar el conducto torácico que vacía en la vena subclavia izquierda. Los vasos linfáticos del brazo izquierdo drenan en el tronco linfático subclavio izquierdo y luego en la vena subclavia izquierda. Los canales linfáticos del brazo derecho drenan en el tronco subclavio derecho y luego en la vena subclavia derecha. Una de las funciones del sistema linfático es devolver el exceso de líquido y las proteínas de los espacios intersticiales al sistema vascular de la sangre. Debido a que los vasos linfáticos a menudo carecen de una membrana basal, pueden reabsorber moléculas demasiado grandes para la captación venosa. Los mecanismos del edema clínico incluyen un aumento de la filtración capilar arteriovenosa y una disminución de la absorción del líquido intersticial. Las causas del aumento de la filtración capilar incluyen el aumento de la presión hidrostática en los capilares, la disminución de la presión del tejido y un aumento de la permeabilidad de las membranas. La reducción de la absorción intersticial se puede deber a la disminución de la presión oncótica del plasma, a un aumento de la presión oncótica del líquido tisular y a una obstrucción linfática. La aparición del linfedema secundario es a menudo insidiosa. Sin embargo, puede ser provocada repentinamente por una inflamación local debida a causas tales como una infección o una lesión en una extremidad. Por lo tanto, se debe evaluar a los pacientes en busca de pruebas de celulitis. Clásicamente, el linfedema se caracteriza por una hinchazón sin fóvea que por lo general afecta los dedos. Los estadios tempranos del linfedema se manifiestan con edema con fóvea hasta que aparece la fibrosis. La distribución de la hinchazón se puede restringir solo a la parte proximal o a la parte distal del miembro. El linfedema también puede predisponer a infecciones recidivantes de la piel.[] El linfedema puede y de hecho se presenta en el tronco, además de las extremidades. Por ejemplo, la radioterapia a las paredes torácicas está relacionada con la presentación de edema sobre todo en el seno irradiado.[,] En algunos informes se indica una tasa de prevalencia de linfedema de hasta 75 % en pacientes de cáncer de cabeza y cuello; las dosis altas de radiación y la cirugía combinada son factores de riesgo.[] Los pacientes con linfedema pueden expresar una amplia gama de molestias, como pesadez o sensación de llenura relacionada con el peso de la extremidad, sensación de piel ajustada o disminución de la flexibilidad de la articulación afectada. La textura de la piel se puede volver hiperqueratósica, con lesiones cutáneas verrugosas y vesiculares. Cuando están afectadas las extremidades superiores, el paciente puede tener dificultades para vestir la zona afectada o para usar relojes o brazaletes que antes le calzaban bien. Las similares dificultades por el linfedema de las extremidades inferiores incluyen una sensación de piel ajustada o dificultad para usar calzado, picazón en las piernas o los dedos de los pies, sensación de quemadura en las piernas o trastornos del sueño y caída de cabello. La locomoción puede ser difícil por el aumento de tamaño y peso de la extremidad afectada. También pueden estar afectadas las actividades cotidianas, los pasatiempos y la capacidad de realizar las tareas laborales previas. Se encontró que los sobrevivientes de cáncer de mama con linfedema en el brazo pueden estar más discapacitados y tener una calidad de vida más precaria y mayor aflicción psicológica que los sobrevivientes sin linfedema.[,] Además, las mujeres que notifican hinchazón informan tener una calidad de vida inferior en múltiples evaluaciones funcionales.[] El linfedema se puede presentar después de cualquier cáncer o su tratamiento que afecta el drenaje de los ganglios linfáticos. Se ha notificado que se presenta a los pocos días y hasta 30 años después del tratamiento para el cáncer de mama.[] Ochenta por ciento de pacientes experimentan su aparición en un plazo de tres años a partir de la cirugía; el resto presenta edema a una tasa anual de 1%.[] El linfedema de las extremidades superiores se presenta con mayor frecuencia después del cáncer de mama; el linfedema de las extremidades inferiores se presenta con mayor frecuencia con cáncer de útero, cáncer de próstata, linfoma o melanoma.[] Un estudio amplio con base en la población sustenta las pruebas de que el linfedema de las extremidades inferiores es algo que experimenta una gran proporción de mujeres luego del tratamiento de cáncer ginecológico, con la prevalencia más alta (36%) entre las sobrevivientes de cáncer de vulva y la prevalencia más baja (5%) entre las sobrevivientes de cáncer de ovario.[] No hay uniformidad en los datos sobre la incidencia y la prevalencia de linfedema después del cáncer de mama; posiblemente, debido por las diferencias en el diagnóstico, las diferentes características de los pacientes estudiados y un seguimiento inadecuado para captar la presentación demorada del trastorno. La incidencia general del linfedema del brazo puede oscilar entre 8% y 56% dos años después de la cirugía.[] En un subestudio longitudinal del ensayo American College of Surgeons Oncology Group (ACOSOG)/Alliance Z1071 sobre cáncer de mama, los informes de pacientes con la incidencia acumulada a 3 años de hinchazón y pesadez del brazo fueron en realidad más bajos que los hallazgos objetivos.[] Es importante diagnosticar y tratar el linfedema cuando es leve debido a que los pacientes con linfedema ligero componen la cohorte que da lugar a un linfedema grave y debilitante que puede prevenirse. Las mujeres con linfedema leve presentan tres veces más probabilidades de padecer linfedema grave que las mujeres sin linfedema.[] Los pacientes sometidos a cirugía axilar o radioterapia axilar para el cáncer de mama tienen un riesgo más alto de contraer linfedema del brazo. Las convenciones previas indicaban que la positividad ganglionar era un factor predisponente del linfedema en pacientes de cáncer de mama.[] De hecho, un estudio encontró que, con respecto al control de la radiación de la axila, hay una relación inversamente proporcional entre la positividad ganglionar y el volumen del brazo.[] Cuando se compara con un muestreo axilar solo, la mastectomía parcial o total seguida de disección completa del ganglio linfático axilar aumenta en forma significativa las probabilidades de que el paciente sufra de edema del brazo. Por ejemplo, en una serie de 100 mujeres sometidas a mastectomía parcial o total y, luego, a una disección completa del ganglio linfático axilar o muestreo axilar, el edema del brazo se presentó en más pacientes sometidas a disección axilar de ganglio linfático que las que solo se sometieron a un muestreo axilar (30% frente a 0%)[] Además, el alcance de la disección del ganglio linfático aumenta el riesgo de presentar edema en el brazo. Por ejemplo, en una serie de 381 mujeres sometidas a mastectomía segmentaria y disección de ganglio linfático axilar, las mujeres a las que se les extirparon 10 o más ganglios linfáticos tuvieron mayores probabilidades de presentar síntomas en el brazo durante el primer año que las mujeres que tenían pocos ganglios linfáticos en el espécimen (53% frente a 33%) en los próximos dos años (33% frente a 20%, respectivamente).[] Como lo muestra un estudio aleatorizado en fase lll () de disección de ganglios linfáticos en mujeres que tenían cáncer de mama en estadios l o llA y un ganglio centinela positivo, la disección de ganglio centinela ha ganado preferencia sobre la disección de ganglio linfático axilar para la estadificación axilar de la enfermedad temprana debido a la disminución de la morbilidad y los beneficios cuestionables de supervivencia de la disección de ganglios linfáticos axilares.[][] Varios estudios mostraron que el linfedema es más frecuente en pacientes de cáncer de mama sometidas a disección de ganglio linfático axilar que en aquellas sometidas a biopsia del ganglio linfático centinela.[][] Un estudio evaluó a 30 pacientes con carcinoma invasor unilateral de mama sometidas a biopsia de ganglio linfático centinela y a 30 pacientes sometidas a disección de ganglio linfático axilar. Este estudio encontró una tasa de 20% de presentación de linfedema en el grupo con disección del ganglio linfático axilar en comparación con 0% en el grupo de biopsia del ganglio linfático centinela.[] Las tasas de linfedema entre mujeres que se someten a biopsia de ganglio linfático centinela es entre 5 y 17%, dependiendo del umbral del diagnóstico y la duración de seguimiento.[-] La mayoría de linfedemas son leves.[][] Entre todos los pacientes de cáncer de mama, la obesidad o el sobrepeso puede predisponer a las mujeres al linfedema después del tratamiento del cáncer de mama.[,][] Un estudio bien realizado de manera prospectiva, siguió a 138 pacientes con cáncer de mama durante 30 meses después del diagnóstico. Las personas con un índice de masa corporal de 30 o mayor al momento del diagnóstico tuvieron 3,6 veces más probabilidades de presentar linfedema, pero la ganancia de peso después del diagnóstico no estuvo asociada con esto.[] Algunos estudios correlacionaron el grado de linfedema y el grado de obesidad.[][] De igual manera, entre las supervivientes jóvenes de cáncer de mama se relacionó una inflamación persistente con la extirpación de más ganglios linfáticos y con la obesidad.[] No se conoce la relación que existe entre la obesidad y la presentación de linfedema, en cuanto a la respuesta a la dosis. Tampoco ha habido estudios que determinen si la pérdida de peso entre pacientes en riesgo de presentar linfedema reduciría el riesgo. En este momento, no es posible orientar a los pacientes con relación a la respuesta a la dosis y su relación con la pérdida de peso y la reducción del riesgo o la relación del peso con el riesgo más bajo de linfedema incidental. Otros factores de riesgo para la presentación del linfedema son los siguientes: Radiación local (en la región axilar, inguinal, pélvica o supraclavicular). Tumor que causa obstrucción linfática de los ganglios cervicales, torácicos, axilares, pélvicos o abdominales anteriores. Cicatrización patológica de los conductos linfáticos subclavios derecho o izquierdo debida a cirugía o radiación. Tumores intrapélvicos o intrabdominales que afectan o comprimen directamente los vasos linfáticos o la cisterna del quilo y el conducto torácico. Más o menos, alrededor de un tercio de las pacientes (y la mayoría de afroamericanas con cáncer) presentan enfermedad regional y ganglios linfáticos positivos,[] y por tanto requieren de una disección completa de los ganglios linfáticos axilares, muchas se someten a radiación adicional al lecho de los ganglios linfáticos axilares y supraclaviculares. El linfedema es un efecto adverso persistente del tratamiento del cáncer que continua presentándose mucho tiempo después en el futuro, a pesar del aumento en el uso de procedimientos como la biopsia de ganglios linfáticos centinelas. El ejercicio no aumenta el riesgo de aparición de linfedema Tradicionalmente, a los pacientes en riesgo de linfedema se les ha aconsejado no usar el miembro afectado. La razón de este consejo clínico, parece surgir de la noción que la extirpación de ganglios linfáticos alteraban la respuesta del área afectada con inflamación, infección, lesión y trauma y por tanto era prudente evitar excederse en el uso del miembro. Sin embargo, el ejercicio tiene un efecto diferente en el cuerpo en dosis más bajas que en dosis más altas; los ejercicios extremos pueden provocar inflamación y lesión y deben evitarse en paciente con riesgo de linfedema.[] Por el contrario, el ejercicio fisiológico, que avanza de manera lenta, progresiva, cuidadosamente controlado podría de hecho, proveer protección en situaciones cotidianas que requieren esfuerzo de esa parte del cuerpo (es decir, cargar bolsas de la compra, hacer las compras de navidad, o cargar un niño).[] Por tanto, hay pruebas fisiológicas que cuestionan el consejo tradicional para restringir el uso del miembro afectado. Más aún, hay pruebas empíricas que muestran que el ejercicio de la parte superior del cuerpo NO aumenta la aparición de linfedema entre los supervivientes de cáncer de mama.[,];[,,] El más numeroso de estos estudios (N = 204) [][] midió el grupo de la mujeres antes de la cirugía de mama con disección de ganglios linfáticos axilares y se asignó de forma aleatorizada a las participantes a uno de dos programas de rehabilitación: Las mujeres en este grupo (N = 104) no tuvieron restricciones en cuanto a las actividades físicas que usaban el miembro afectado durante 6 meses después de la cirugía. Los pacientes de SRA siguieron un programa supervisado de ejercicio de resistencia progresiva, moderada con entrenamiento de 2 a 3 veces por semana. Los ejercicios de resistencia (tiempo total de ejercicio = 45 minutos) que incluyó un mínimo de 15 repeticiones para cada ejercicio, utilizando una resistencia baja (0,5 kg) durante las primeras 2 semanas. La resistencia aumento de forma individual para cada paciente (sin límite superior) con la meta de mejorar la fortaleza muscular y la resistencia pero siempre usando 15 repeticiones por cada juego de ejercicio. Las mujeres de este grupo (N = 100) se les instruyó para que restringieran la actividad del miembro afectado durante 6 meses después de la cirugía. A los pacientes se les dijo evitaran cualquier actividad física extenuante o pesada como los aeróbicos u otros tipos de ejercicios que incluyen actividad física pesada de los miembros superiores y evitar el cargar o levantar bolsas con abastecimientos del supermercado u otros artículos que pesen más de 3 kg. Al final del segundo año de seguimiento posquirúrgico, la incidencia de nuevos linfedemas fue de 13% en ambos grupos. Es de hace notar que el factor pronóstico más importante por si solo para la aparición del linfedema fue la obesidad.[] En otro estudio aleatorizado grande (N = 134 lo completaron) se comparó una intervención de un año de levantamiento de pesas contra un grupo control no sometido a ejercicio de supervivientes de cáncer de mama, que tenían una enfermedad unilateral y a los cuales se les resecaron al menos dos ganglios linfáticos. Al momento inicial, ningún paciente presentó linfedema. Un programa de levantamiento de pesas progresivo no causó un aumento en la incidencia de linfedema. El estudio fue diseñado como un ensayo de equivalencia pero señaló una incidencia más baja de linfedema en el grupo que levantó pesas (11 contra 17%, con una diferencia significativa de 7 contra 22%, para aquellos a quienes se resecaron cinco o más ganglios linfáticos).[] Los pacientes con riesgo de linfedema y que la tienen, deben ser evaluados por un terapeuta certificado en linfedema que asegure la inocuidad de proseguir con los ejercicios de la parte del cuerpo afectada. (Consultar la página de internet (esta información solo está disponible en inglés) para ubicar centros de terapeutas certificados en linfedema en todos los Estados Unidos.) Los pacientes que presentan linfedema deben vestir ropas de compresión ajustadas durante los ejercicios en los que se use el miembro o parte del cuerpo afectada. Si hay dudas con relación a si hay presencia de linfedema, no hay pruebas sobre si el uso de prendas de vestir sería beneficioso o dañino. Dichas prendas deben estar ajustadas para ser beneficiosas y estas son caras, podrían no estar cubiertas por el seguro médico sin un diagnóstico claro y deben reemplazarse cada 6 meses. Entre las mujeres que no tienen un diagnóstico claro, es probable que el riesgo de evitar actividades de la parte superior del cuerpo, sobrepase el riesgo de involucrarse lentamente en actividad de la parte superior del cuerpo sin ropas de vestir. Los pacientes sin linfedema No necesitan prendas especiales para hacer ejercicios con el miembro en riesgo. Pruebas provenientes de estudios entre supervivientes de cáncer de mama indican que el ejercicio de la parte superior del cuerpo entre mujeres en riesgo de linfedema deben comenzar con una intensidad baja y subir la intensidad lentamente dependiendo de cómo respondan a los síntomas.[];[][] Debe haber un especialista certificado en linfedema al que se debe derivar las mujeres de ser necesario o de presentarse una reaparición o presentación. Si hay pausa en estos ejercicios de una semana o más, se recomienda encarecidamente que las mujeres disminuyan la intensidad de las actividades con la parte superior del cuerpo y luego aumentarla de nuevo otra vez de forma gradual. Cambios en los síntomas (aumento de la pesadez, dolor, hinchazón, inflamación) que dura una semana o más debe ser evaluada en cuanto a un posible brote o presentación. Es posible que el comenzar con intensidad baja y avanzar lentamente es mejor para el miembro afectado que el evitar toda actividad. El linfedema se pone en evidencia mediante manifestaciones clínicas tales como el edema sin fóvea, que por lo general afecta los dedos, en pacientes con factores de riesgo conocidos, como una disección axilar previa. Otras causas de la inflamación de las extremidades que deben tomarse en cuenta en el diagnóstico diferencial y excluirlas mediante estudios apropiados, si resulta indicado, incluyen una trombosis venosa profunda, un cáncer o una infección. Si el diagnóstico no ofrece pruebas durante las evaluaciones clínicas, puede ser necesaria una prueba de imaginología del sistema linfático con linfocentellografía (imaginología con radionúclido). Por lo general, la linfangiografía ya no es la prueba diagnóstica favorita y puede estar contraindicada en pacientes de cáncer debido a la preocupación de que podría contribuir a la diseminación metastásica del tumor. Las técnicas adicionales de imaginología, como la imaginología por resonancia magnética, pueden complementar la información obtenida en la linfocentellografía al proveer detalles anatómicos y ganglionares.[] La amplia variedad de métodos descritos en la literatura médica para evaluar el volumen de la extremidad, así como la carencia de estandarización, presenta dificultades cuando el médico evalúa la extremidad en riesgo. Entre las opciones, se incluye el desplazamiento de agua, las mediciones con cinta, la gammagrafía infrarroja y las mediciones de impedancia bioeléctrica.[] El método que se usa más ampliamente para diagnosticar el linfedema de las extremidades superiores es la medición de la circunferencia de la extremidad superior mediante el uso de puntos anatómicos específicos.[] La medición de la circunferencia del brazo se utiliza para calcular la diferencia de volumen entre el brazo afectado y el no afectado. Las medidas en secuencia se toman en cuatro puntos de ambos brazos: las articulaciones metacarpofalángicas, la muñeca, los 10 cm distales de los epicóndilos laterales y los 15 cm proximales de los epicóndilos laterales. Según algunos expertos, la diferencia de 2 cm o más con el brazo contralateral en cualquier punto se considera clínicamente significativo. Sin embargo, las diferencias de las mediciones específicas entre ambos brazos pueden tener un significado de importancia clínica limitada; por ejemplo, la diferencia de 3 cm entre los brazos de una mujer obesa y los de una mujer delgada. Además, puede haber variaciones anatómicas inherentes en cuanto a la circunferencia entre la extremidad dominante y la no dominante con respecto a la diferencia en la masa muscular y las variaciones después de un tratamiento de cáncer del seno que pueden presentarse con atrofia del brazo ipsilateral o hipertrofia del brazo contralateral.[] Un estudio pequeño en el que se compararon varios métodos para evaluar el linfedema de las extremidades superiores, no mostró la superioridad de ninguno de los métodos.[] Una secuencia de mediciones a lo largo del tiempo, que incluya las mediciones pretratamiento, puede ser más significativa desde el punto de vista clínico. El método de desplazamiento de agua es otra manera de evaluar un edema en el brazo. Normalmente, una diferencia de 200 ml o más entre el brazo afectado y el brazo opuesto se considera el punto límite para definir el linfedema.[] Un método común para clasificar el linfedema usa tres estadios con base en la gravedad del mismo.[] El estadio I es espontáneamente reversible y normalmente se caracteriza por edema con fóvea, aumento en la circunferencia de la extremidad superior y sensación de pesadez. El estadio II se caracteriza por una consistencia esponjosa del tejido, sin signos de edema con fóvea. La fibrosis tisular puede causar luego el endurecimiento de las extremidades y un aumento de tamaño.[] El estadio III, también llamado elefantiasis linfostática, es el estadio más avanzado, pero se observa con poca frecuencia luego del tratamiento del cáncer de mama.[] Otro enfoque que se usa con frecuencia en la clasificación del linfedema consiste en el Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0 (CTCAE), el cual se instituyó a fin de otorgarle un grado a los efectos adversos en el contexto de ensayos clínicos.[] Un ventaja clave del el enfoque CTCAE es que incluye ambas medidas objetivas (discrepancia intramiembro) y subjetiva, evaluación clínica en el diagnóstico del linfedema. Esto permite una posibilidad muy real, de que un paciente pueda presentar linfedema clínicamente significativo tratable, aislado a un segmento de su miembro que no cumpliría con los criterios de discrepancia intramiembro, pero que todavía se le puede otorgar un grado de acuerdo con la gravedad por signos y síntomas, según sigue a continuación: Grado 1: 5 a 10% discrepancia intramiembro en volumen o circunferencias al punto de la mayor diferencia visible; inflamación u oscurecimiento de la arquitectura anatómica bajo inspección cercana; edema con fóvea. Grado 2: más de 10 a 30% de discrepancia intramiembro en volumen o circunferencia; al punto de la mayor diferencia visible; obvio oscurecimiento de la anatomía arquitectónica; obliteración de los colgajos de la piel; deviación obvia del contorno anatómico normal. Grado 3: más de 30% de discrepancia intramiembro en volumen; linforrea; desviación desproporcionada del contorno anatómico normal, que interfieren con la vida cotidiana. Grado 4: evolución hacia una neoplasia (por ejemplo, linfangiosarcoma); se indica amputación; linfedema incapacitante.

Al proceder de esta forma, se puede disminuir la insatisfacción del superviviente de cáncer de mama y la información recibida puede servir como fundamento para tomar decisiones y lidiar con el linfedema en caso de que este se presente más tarde.[] Se debe enseñar a los pacientes a reconocer los síntomas tempranos de edema porque los resultados del tratamiento pueden mejorar de manera significativa si el problema se detecta temprano.[] Para mayor información consultar la subsección El ejercicio no aumenta el riesgo de aparición de linfedema en la sección de este sumario. Entre las recomendaciones generales de carácter anecdótico sobre medidas preventivas, se incluyen las siguientes: Mantener una meticulosa higiene de la piel y las uñas para prevenir abrir una puerta de entrada a infecciones que pueden resultar en celulitis. Cortar las uñas de los pies en línea recta; consultar con un podiatra siempre que sea necesario para prevenir uñas encarnadas e infecciones. Usar hidratantes de la piel y soluciones antibióticas tópicas cuando haya pequeños cortes en la piel como las que produce el papel. Usar en forma gradual bloqueadores de rayos solares y bronceadores. Usar medias (calcetines o zoquetes) de algodón; mantener los pies limpios y secos. Usar guantes de cocina y jardinería, y dedales para coser. Evitar andar descalzo cuando se sale al aire libre. Evitar extracciones de sangre (incluso pinchazos en los dedos), vacunas y líneas de suero intravenoso en el brazo afectado. Usar la extremidad que no está afectada para probar las temperaturas (por ejemplo, del agua del baño o para cocinar), porque la sensibilidad puede estar disminuida. Estar pendiente de signos de infección (fiebre, hinchazón, enrojecimiento, dolor y calor) y consultar con el médico de inmediato para que realice una evaluación. Siempre que sea posible, mantener el brazo o la pierna elevada sobre el nivel del corazón. Evitar que el brazo o pierna afectada reciba una presión que lo restrinja: Vestir ropas y joyas sueltas, sin bandas que aprieten. No sentarse en una sola posición por más de 30 minutos. Cómo impedir que la sangre se acumule en la extremidad afectada Evitar los movimientos circulares rápidos que ocasionan una acumulación centrífuga de líquidos en las partes distales del miembro. Evitar la aplicación de calor local en el miembro porque puede aumentar el flujo de sangre. No mantener el miembro en una posición que dependa de la gravedad por períodos largos. Evitar las ropas apretadas o manguillos para tomar la presión en el brazo afectado porque puede causar un efecto torniquete y obstruir el flujo de linfa. La meta de los centros de tratamiento para el linfedema es controlar la inflamación de las extremidades y disminuir las complicaciones, por la interrupción de los vasos linfáticos subyacente que no se puede corregir. Debido a que los ensayos clínicos que evalúan las medidas farmacológicas por lo general no son eficaces, las medidas no farmacológicas son el pilar principal del tratamiento, con la meta de aumentar al máximo las actividades cotidianas, disminuir el dolor, aumentar la amplitud de movimiento y mejorar el funcionamiento. Los ejercicios que no causan fatiga pueden producir suficiente contracción muscular como para hacer circular la linfa hacia los linfangiomas terminales y reducir la inflamación. Los ejercicios aeróbicos también pueden aumentar el tono del sistema nervioso simpático porque hacen que los vasos linfáticos colectores bombeen con mayor vigor.[] Múltiples estudios indican que el ejercicio, como el de la parte superior del cuerpo, es inocuo en mujeres con linfedema relacionado con cáncer de mama.[] También hay pruebas de que entre las mujeres con linfedema relacionado con el cáncer de mama, que logran levantar pesas de una manera lenta y progresiva, esto las lleva a reducir a la mitad la probabilidad de una exacerbación clínicamente significativa (agudización) que requiera de tratamiento por parte de un fisioterapeuta.[] Un grupo de 141 supervivientes de cáncer de mama con linfedema se asignaron de forma aleatorizada a levantar pesas dos veces por semanas de entrenamiento durante un año (N = 71) o a un grupo de comparación en lista de espera (N = 70). La intervención comenzó a las 13 semanas de entrenamiento supervisado con una resistencia baja o ausente; la cantidad de peso a levantar fue aumentando de manera muy gradual y solo si no se presentaba algún cambio en los síntomas del linfedema o la inflamación. Todas las participantes vistieron ropas de compresión bien ajustadas hechas a la medida que fueron reemplazadas a los 6 meses de la intervención. Las mujeres con linfedema relacionado con el cáncer de mama, deben ser guiadas para que trabajen con un profesional certificado en ejercicios o fisioterapeuta para aprender la forma biomecánica apropiada de hacer ejercicios de levantamiento de pesas antes de iniciar este programa por sí mismas. (Los detalles de esta intervención están disponibles para profesionales certificados en ejercicios y fisioterapeutas en la . La información contenida en este enlace solo está disponible en inglés Se necesita más investigación para realizar una intervención de esta versión que pueda ser ampliamente diseminada. En un estudio piloto pequeño se examinó la inocuidad de una intervención similar a la descrita anteriormente en supervivientes de cáncer con linfedema en las extremidades inferiores debido a melanoma secundario o cánceres urológicos o ginecológicos. En este estudio piloto no controlado, 20% de participantes presentó infección celulítica dentro de los primeros 2 meses después de comenzar un lento y progresivo régimen de levantamiento de pesas.[] Se necesita más investigación para determinar si el levantamiento de pesas es una modalidad de ejercicio inocuo para las supervivientes de cáncer con linfedema de las extremidades inferiores. Las prendas de vestir de compresión graduada (también conocidas como mangas o medias para linfedema) generan mayor presión distal que proximal, lo cual mejora la movilización del líquido del edema. Algunos pacientes pueden necesitar mangas hechas a la medida para lograr un mejor ajuste. El uso de estas vestimentas puede ser de especial importancia en las grandes alturas, como cuando se viaja en avión, debido a que la presión atmosférica ambiental es menor que la presión de salida transcapilar en el interior de los tejidos superficiales y ello puede empeorar el edema. El proceso de vendaje implica el uso de material no elástico para evitar la reacumulación de linfa al reducir la ultrafiltración capilar y hacer óptima la eficacia de la bomba muscular intrínseca. El vendaje puede cambiar un miembro que en principio se resiste a uno con menos edema, lo que resulta en una disminución del volumen del miembro y permite que la colocación de la prenda de vestir o venda se lleve a cabo con éxito.[][] La meta en el cuidado de la piel es reducir la formación de colonias dérmicas de bacteria y hongos, sobre todo en los pliegues, e hidratar la piel para controlar la sequedad y el cuarteo de la piel. La terapia descongestiva compleja es un programa multimodal que consiste en el drenaje manual del linfedema, vendaje de baja elasticidad, ejercicios y cuidado de la piel.[] Los paneles de consenso recomendaron este enfoque como tratamiento primario y como un tratamiento eficaz para el linfedema que no responde a la terapia de compresión elástica estándar.[,] La terapia descongestiva compleja se divide en dos fases sucesivas. La primera fase consiste en un tratamiento enérgico para permitir una reducción sustancial del volumen del linfedema. La segunda fase consiste en un tratamiento de mantenimiento en el hogar. Se encontró que el cumplimiento cabal en el uso de la manga elástica y el vendaje de baja elasticidad es un determinante importante del éxito de la terapia de mantenimiento en el hogar.[] La terapia descongestiva compleja también mostró que mejora el linfedema después de una disección de la ingle.[] Los pacientes deben ser derivados a un terapeuta debidamente entrenado para obtener resultados óptimos. La compresión neumática externa intermitente también puede proveer una mejoría adicional en el manejo del linfedema cuando se usa conjuntamente con la terapia descongestiva linfática. Un ensayo aleatorizado pequeño con 23 mujeres con linfedema reciente relacionado con un cáncer de mama, halló una reducción adicional significativa del volumen cuando se lo comparó con el drenaje linfático manual solo (45% vs. 26%).[][] De manera similar, también se encontraron mejoras en la fase de mantenimiento de la terapia. Entre las preocupaciones relacionadas con el uso de la compresión neumática intermitente se incluye la cantidad óptima de presión y el régimen de tratamiento, y si se necesita la terapia de mantenimiento luego de la reducción inicial del edema.[][] Hay una preocupación teórica de que presiones más altas de 60 mmHg y el uso prolongado pueden, de hecho, lesionar los vasos linfáticos. No se recomienda ningún tratamiento farmacológico crónico para los pacientes de linfedema. Normalmente, los diuréticos no son beneficiosos y pueden promover un agotamiento del volumen intravascular porque el líquido del linfedema no se puede movilizar con facilidad en el espacio vascular. La cumarina se relaciona con una hepatotoxicidad importante y no se ha encontrado que ofrezca beneficio alguno en los ensayos clínicos controlados.[] Los antibióticos deben utilizarse rápidamente en aquellos pacientes con prueba de celulitis; a veces, se necesita su uso intravenoso en los casos de celulitis grave, linfangitis o septicemia. Los resultados de un ensayo pequeño aleatorizado indicaron que el linfedema relacionado con el cáncer de mama puede mejorar con la pérdida de peso.[][] No está claro el mecanismo mediante el cual la obesidad podría predisponer al linfedema, pero entre los mecanismos propuestos están un aumento en el riesgo de complicaciones posoperatorias, tales como infección, reducción de la eficacia de bombeo muscular y separación de los canales linfáticos por la grasa subcutánea.[] Una intervención más grande y de mayor duración sobre pérdida de peso en los pacientes de cáncer con linfedema (incluyendo a aquellos con enfermedad de los miembros inferiores) asegura explorar más allá la pérdida de peso en el manejo de la enfermedad. Los estudios indican que la terapia láser de intensidad baja puede ser eficaz para reducir el linfedema de manera clínicamente significativa en algunas mujeres.[][] [,] Se encontró que dos ciclos de tratamiento con láser fueron eficaces para disminuir el volumen del brazo afectado, el líquido extracelular y el endurecimiento tisular en aproximadamente un tercio de los pacientes con linfedema posmastectomía tres meses después del tratamiento.[] Entre las razones para aplicar la terapia láser se incluyen una posible disminución de la fibrosis, la estimulación de los macrófagos y el sistema inmunitario y, posiblemente, el aumento de la linfangiogénesis.[] Es muy raro que se lleve a cabo una cirugía en pacientes con linfedema relacionado con cáncer. El principal método quirúrgico para tratar el linfedema consiste en extraer la grasa subcutánea y el tejido fibroso con la creación de un colgajo dérmico o sin este, dentro del músculo para estimular una anastomosis linfática que va de lo superficial a lo profundo. Estos métodos no se evaluaron en ensayos clínicos prospectivos, pero un análisis retrospectivo encontró resultados adecuados en solo 30% de los pacientes. Además, muchos pacientes enfrentan complicaciones tales como necrosis de la piel, infección y anomalías sensoriales.[] Por lo general, el paciente oncológico no es apto para este tipo de procedimientos. Otras opciones quirúrgicas incluyen las siguientes: Anastomosis linfático venosa microquirúrgica, en la que se drena la linfa hacia la circulación venosa o los depósitos linfáticos colectores por encima del área de la obstrucción linfática. La terapia manual del linfedema, un tipo de técnica de masaje, implica el uso de un masaje superficial muy ligero con distención de la piel de forma suave y rítmica, idealmente se limita a una presión de 30mmHg a 45 mmHg.[] En comparación con varias otras técnicas de masaje, la terapia manual del linfedema es muy suave al tacto. Los sobos se sienten como una técnica de ""cepillado"". La terapia manual de linfedema comienza en las áreas no afectadas a fin de dirigir la linfa fuera de las extremidades afectadas. Se ha llevado a cabo un número limitado de ensayos en mujeres con cáncer de mama que presentan linfedema. Estos ensayos han significado una reducción en el volumen de los miembros cuando se administra terapia manual para el linfedema como la única forma de intervención o como adjunto al estándar de tratamiento.[-][] Sin embargo, se hace necesario llevar a cabo ensayos aleatorizados controlados a fin de confirmar estos hallazgos preliminares. La terapia manual del linfedema se debe llevar a cabo en un entorno médico estrechamente vigilado, por un médico que ha recibido entrenamiento específico en la terapia manual del linfedema.[] Nunca se ha presentado efectos adversos en los estudios pilotos donde se ha administrado terapia manual del linfedema en mujeres con cáncer de mama. Los efectos adversos de que se tiene conocimiento, están relacionados con la disciplina general de masaje y están en gran parte relacionado con un masajista sin licencia para dar estos masajes o tratamientos que incluyeron masajes profundos y vigorosos. La terapia linfática manual, también conocida como drenaje linfático manual, se les puede enseñar a los pacientes para que se lo administren a sí mismos. A pesar del perfil de inocuidad, se deben tomar en cuenta las siguientes precauciones especiales cuando se administra masaje a los pacientes de cáncer: Evite aplicar masaje directamente en una herida abierta, hematoma o áreas en que la piel está muy irritada y sensible. Evite aplicar masajes directamente a los tumores que se sienten en la superficie de la piel. Evite aplicar masajes en áreas con trombosis venosa profunda aguda. Evite aplicar masajes directamente en el tejido suave radiado cuando la piel está sensible.[] Se ha mantenido bajo investigación la función de otras modalidades integrales en el tratamiento del linfedema secundario. El selenio se ha investigado en el ensayo clínico ; la acupuntura y el moxibustión se estudiaron en el ensayo clínico como opciones de tratamiento del linfedema. Si el linfedema es masivo y resistente al tratamiento o resurge varios años después de la cirugía primaria sin un trauma obvio, se debe iniciar una búsqueda de otras etiologías. Es especialmente importante la exclusión de la recidiva del tumor o el surgimiento de un linfangiosarcoma, que se debe excluir mediante tomografía computarizada o imaginología por resonancia magnética. La complicación del linfangiosarcoma se ve tradicionalmente después de la mastectomía en el brazo linfaedematoso (síndrome de Stewart-Treves). La media de tiempo entre la mastectomía y el linfangiosarcoma es de 10,2 años, con una mediana de supervivencia de 1,3 años. Clínicamente, las lesiones de linfangiosarcoma pueden aparecer inicialmente como azul-rojizas o moradas, con una forma macular o papular en la piel. Las lesiones múltiples son comunes; se pueden presentar nódulos subcutáneos y deberían ser cuidadosamente evaluados en el paciente de linfedema crónico.[] Ridner SH: Pretreatment lymphedema education and identified educational resources in breast cancer patients.

Lymph node surgery for melanoma — codes and concepts 330469005, 396487001, 443497002, 433028008, 234253006, 234256003, 79544006, 314987003, 443493003, 94392001 There are two types of lymph node surgery for melanoma: Lymph node dissection or completion (CLND) [2]. A is used to identify and sample the ‘sentinel’ or first lymph node (or nodes) that potential would encounter if present in vessels draining the site of the melanoma. Sentinel lymph node biopsy is performed in people who do not have swollen at the time of re- of the site — known as wide local excision — and is usually under general [3]. A blue dye is injected into the initial biopsy prior to the wide local excision. This dye is carried by lymphatic channels to the sentinel lymph node or nodes [3]. For the upper limb, the sentinel lymph node basin is usually located in the . For the lower limb, it is typically found in the region. In-transit sentinel lymph nodes located closer to the melanoma site than the regional nodes have been detected in 10% [4]. A truncal melanoma can have a sentinel lymph node in the axilla, the , or both. Lymphatic drainage in the head and neck is unpredictable, with multiple possible locations for sentinel lymph nodes including involvement of multiple basins [5–6]. Lymphoscintigraphy is also used to map the sentinel lymph nodes, using a specialised scanner to detect radiation from a radiotracer combined with the blue dye [7,8]. The sentinel lymph nodes are excised for examination by a who measures the dimensions of any found within the lymph nodes and whether it extends beyond the lymph node (which confers poorer ) [9]. Dye seen in lymph node during sentinel node biopsy Lymph node dissection or completion lymphadenectomy is the removal of all lymph nodes in the basin (eg, axilla, inguinal region, or head and neck) [2]. This is performed under . The pathologist examines all the excised lymph nodes for [2]. Which patients should be considered for lymph node surgery in melanoma? Whether sentinel lymph node biopsy is performed depends on a melanoma patient’s risk for nodal . Opinions vary in which patients it should be performed; the key influence was the publication of the ‘MSLT-1’ study [10]. SLNB is currently considered for: Cutaneous that are greater than 0.8 mm in with an additional adverse factor (eg, high rate or ) [10,11]. Melanomas that are greater than 1 mm in Breslow thickness without other adverse prognostic factors [10,11]. Lymph node dissection is currently considered in two settings: If a positive sentinel lymph node involves a large deposit or there are multiple positive lymph nodes When there is biopsy-proven for metastatic melanoma (ie, the lymph nodes are grossly enlarged) [12]. What are the with lymph node surgery? Contraindications mainly relate to sentinel node biopsy. Sentinel lymph node biopsy is when there has been prior lymph node surgery in the particular basin. It should not be performed  wide local excision, flap, or skin graft because its accuracy is reduced [13]. There is no benefit of performing a sentinel lymph node biopsy if the patient has stage III metastatic disease ( involved lymph nodes, satellite/in-transit disease, or distant ) [11]. Older patients or those with significant comorbidities have greater intraoperative risk. A discussion of risk versus benefit is required. Patients with pure have a lower rate of a positive sentinel lymph node biopsy than other subtypes [14]. A positive sentinel lymph node biopsy gives prognostic information for risk stratification and staging; it does not have benefit. Compared to those who underwent regular observation, those who underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy had no difference in 10-year melanoma-specific survival [10]. Prior to the publication of the results of two studies, ‘DeCOG-SLT’ and ‘MSLT-II’, completion lymph node dissection was recommended for patients with a positive sentinel lymph node biopsy [2,12]. There was no difference in survival between patients who underwent immediate completion lymph node dissection compared with those had undergone regular clinical and surveillance of their lymph node basin with dissection if was detected [2,12]. Immediate lymph node dissection offers disease in the nodal basin, but patients are at risk of surgical complications unlike patients under observation. A scoring system to predict non-sentinel lymph node involvement may help select patients who would benefit from immediate completion lymphadenectomy [15]. provides prognostic information. Negative sentinel lymph node biopsy is reassuring. However, a patient with negative sentinel lymph node biopsy may later lymph node in that nodal basin [16]. The results of sentinel lymph node biopsy may enable access to , , or clinical trials [17,18]. Completion dissection offers immediate control of nodal . What are the risks/disadvantages of lymph node surgery? Complication rates for sentinel lymph node biopsy occur in 6–14% of patients [19,20]. The risks of any lymph node surgery include: Delayed wound healing from bleeding, , or dehiscence Poor cosmetic results or discomfort due to tight scarring Seroma due to leaking lymph fluid, with the risk on the number of sentinel lymph nodes removed to the blue dye used in the procedure, which occurs in about 1 in 400 patients [19,20]. A 5% false-negative risk in the axilla or inguinal lymph node basins [21]. Up to a 20% false-negative risk in the lymph node basin due to its complex drainage [21]. The risks of complications from completion dissection are more common and serious than for sentinel lymph node biopsy, especially , , delayed healing, nerve damage, and tight scar formation [22,23].  is the swelling of the limb to the dissected nodal basin due to disruption of lymphatic fluid return. This can be very disabling for patients with only modest improvement achieved from wearing compression garments and massage/exercise [24]. The risk of lymphoedema is greater with inguinal completion dissection than with axillary dissection. Completion dissection may not prevent the of elsewhere.

Lymph node surgery for melanoma — codes and concepts 330469005, 396487001, 443497002, 433028008, 234253006, 234256003, 79544006, 314987003, 443493003, 94392001 There are two types of lymph node surgery for melanoma: Lymph node dissection or completion (CLND) [2]. A is used to identify and sample the ‘sentinel’ or first lymph node (or nodes) that potential would encounter if present in vessels draining the site of the melanoma. Sentinel lymph node biopsy is performed in people who do not have swollen at the time of re- of the site — known as wide local excision — and is usually under general [3]. A blue dye is injected into the initial biopsy prior to the wide local excision. This dye is carried by lymphatic channels to the sentinel lymph node or nodes [3]. For the upper limb, the sentinel lymph node basin is usually located in the . For the lower limb, it is typically found in the region. In-transit sentinel lymph nodes located closer to the melanoma site than the regional nodes have been detected in 10% [4]. A truncal melanoma can have a sentinel lymph node in the axilla, the , or both. Lymphatic drainage in the head and neck is unpredictable, with multiple possible locations for sentinel lymph nodes including involvement of multiple basins [5–6]. Lymphoscintigraphy is also used to map the sentinel lymph nodes, using a specialised scanner to detect radiation from a radiotracer combined with the blue dye [7,8]. The sentinel lymph nodes are excised for examination by a who measures the dimensions of any found within the lymph nodes and whether it extends beyond the lymph node (which confers poorer ) [9]. Dye seen in lymph node during sentinel node biopsy Lymph node dissection or completion lymphadenectomy is the removal of all lymph nodes in the basin (eg, axilla, inguinal region, or head and neck) [2]. This is performed under . The pathologist examines all the excised lymph nodes for [2]. Which patients should be considered for lymph node surgery in melanoma? Whether sentinel lymph node biopsy is performed depends on a melanoma patient’s risk for nodal . Opinions vary in which patients it should be performed; the key influence was the publication of the ‘MSLT-1’ study [10]. SLNB is currently considered for: Cutaneous that are greater than 0.8 mm in with an additional adverse factor (eg, high rate or ) [10,11]. Melanomas that are greater than 1 mm in Breslow thickness without other adverse prognostic factors [10,11]. Lymph node dissection is currently considered in two settings: If a positive sentinel lymph node involves a large deposit or there are multiple positive lymph nodes When there is biopsy-proven for metastatic melanoma (ie, the lymph nodes are grossly enlarged) [12]. What are the with lymph node surgery? Contraindications mainly relate to sentinel node biopsy. Sentinel lymph node biopsy is when there has been prior lymph node surgery in the particular basin. It should not be performed  wide local excision, flap, or skin graft because its accuracy is reduced [13]. There is no benefit of performing a sentinel lymph node biopsy if the patient has stage III metastatic disease ( involved lymph nodes, satellite/in-transit disease, or distant ) [11]. Older patients or those with significant comorbidities have greater intraoperative risk. A discussion of risk versus benefit is required. Patients with pure have a lower rate of a positive sentinel lymph node biopsy than other subtypes [14]. A positive sentinel lymph node biopsy gives prognostic information for risk stratification and staging; it does not have benefit. Compared to those who underwent regular observation, those who underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy had no difference in 10-year melanoma-specific survival [10]. Prior to the publication of the results of two studies, ‘DeCOG-SLT’ and ‘MSLT-II’, completion lymph node dissection was recommended for patients with a positive sentinel lymph node biopsy [2,12]. There was no difference in survival between patients who underwent immediate completion lymph node dissection compared with those had undergone regular clinical and surveillance of their lymph node basin with dissection if was detected [2,12]. Immediate lymph node dissection offers disease in the nodal basin, but patients are at risk of surgical complications unlike patients under observation. A scoring system to predict non-sentinel lymph node involvement may help select patients who would benefit from immediate completion lymphadenectomy [15]. provides prognostic information. Negative sentinel lymph node biopsy is reassuring. However, a patient with negative sentinel lymph node biopsy may later lymph node in that nodal basin [16]. The results of sentinel lymph node biopsy may enable access to , , or clinical trials [17,18]. Completion dissection offers immediate control of nodal . What are the risks/disadvantages of lymph node surgery? Complication rates for sentinel lymph node biopsy occur in 6–14% of patients [19,20]. The risks of any lymph node surgery include: Delayed wound healing from bleeding, , or dehiscence Poor cosmetic results or discomfort due to tight scarring Seroma due to leaking lymph fluid, with the risk on the number of sentinel lymph nodes removed to the blue dye used in the procedure, which occurs in about 1 in 400 patients [19,20]. A 5% false-negative risk in the axilla or inguinal lymph node basins [21]. Up to a 20% false-negative risk in the lymph node basin due to its complex drainage [21]. The risks of complications from completion dissection are more common and serious than for sentinel lymph node biopsy, especially , , delayed healing, nerve damage, and tight scar formation [22,23].  is the swelling of the limb to the dissected nodal basin due to disruption of lymphatic fluid return. This can be very disabling for patients with only modest improvement achieved from wearing compression garments and massage/exercise [24]. The risk of lymphoedema is greater with inguinal completion dissection than with axillary dissection. Completion dissection may not prevent the of elsewhere.

Lymph node surgery for melanoma — codes and concepts 330469005, 396487001, 443497002, 433028008, 234253006, 234256003, 79544006, 314987003, 443493003, 94392001 There are two types of lymph node surgery for melanoma: Lymph node dissection or completion (CLND) [2]. A is used to identify and sample the ‘sentinel’ or first lymph node (or nodes) that potential would encounter if present in vessels draining the site of the melanoma. Sentinel lymph node biopsy is performed in people who do not have swollen at the time of re- of the site — known as wide local excision — and is usually under general [3]. A blue dye is injected into the initial biopsy prior to the wide local excision. This dye is carried by lymphatic channels to the sentinel lymph node or nodes [3]. For the upper limb, the sentinel lymph node basin is usually located in the . For the lower limb, it is typically found in the region. In-transit sentinel lymph nodes located closer to the melanoma site than the regional nodes have been detected in 10% [4]. A truncal melanoma can have a sentinel lymph node in the axilla, the , or both. Lymphatic drainage in the head and neck is unpredictable, with multiple possible locations for sentinel lymph nodes including involvement of multiple basins [5–6]. Lymphoscintigraphy is also used to map the sentinel lymph nodes, using a specialised scanner to detect radiation from a radiotracer combined with the blue dye [7,8]. The sentinel lymph nodes are excised for examination by a who measures the dimensions of any found within the lymph nodes and whether it extends beyond the lymph node (which confers poorer ) [9]. Dye seen in lymph node during sentinel node biopsy Lymph node dissection or completion lymphadenectomy is the removal of all lymph nodes in the basin (eg, axilla, inguinal region, or head and neck) [2]. This is performed under . The pathologist examines all the excised lymph nodes for [2]. Which patients should be considered for lymph node surgery in melanoma? Whether sentinel lymph node biopsy is performed depends on a melanoma patient’s risk for nodal . Opinions vary in which patients it should be performed; the key influence was the publication of the ‘MSLT-1’ study [10]. SLNB is currently considered for: Cutaneous that are greater than 0.8 mm in with an additional adverse factor (eg, high rate or ) [10,11]. Melanomas that are greater than 1 mm in Breslow thickness without other adverse prognostic factors [10,11]. Lymph node dissection is currently considered in two settings: If a positive sentinel lymph node involves a large deposit or there are multiple positive lymph nodes When there is biopsy-proven for metastatic melanoma (ie, the lymph nodes are grossly enlarged) [12]. What are the with lymph node surgery? Contraindications mainly relate to sentinel node biopsy. Sentinel lymph node biopsy is when there has been prior lymph node surgery in the particular basin. It should not be performed  wide local excision, flap, or skin graft because its accuracy is reduced [13]. There is no benefit of performing a sentinel lymph node biopsy if the patient has stage III metastatic disease ( involved lymph nodes, satellite/in-transit disease, or distant ) [11]. Older patients or those with significant comorbidities have greater intraoperative risk. A discussion of risk versus benefit is required. Patients with pure have a lower rate of a positive sentinel lymph node biopsy than other subtypes [14]. A positive sentinel lymph node biopsy gives prognostic information for risk stratification and staging; it does not have benefit. Compared to those who underwent regular observation, those who underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy had no difference in 10-year melanoma-specific survival [10]. Prior to the publication of the results of two studies, ‘DeCOG-SLT’ and ‘MSLT-II’, completion lymph node dissection was recommended for patients with a positive sentinel lymph node biopsy [2,12]. There was no difference in survival between patients who underwent immediate completion lymph node dissection compared with those had undergone regular clinical and surveillance of their lymph node basin with dissection if was detected [2,12]. Immediate lymph node dissection offers disease in the nodal basin, but patients are at risk of surgical complications unlike patients under observation. A scoring system to predict non-sentinel lymph node involvement may help select patients who would benefit from immediate completion lymphadenectomy [15]. provides prognostic information. Negative sentinel lymph node biopsy is reassuring. However, a patient with negative sentinel lymph node biopsy may later lymph node in that nodal basin [16]. The results of sentinel lymph node biopsy may enable access to , , or clinical trials [17,18]. Completion dissection offers immediate control of nodal . What are the risks/disadvantages of lymph node surgery? Complication rates for sentinel lymph node biopsy occur in 6–14% of patients [19,20]. The risks of any lymph node surgery include: Delayed wound healing from bleeding, , or dehiscence Poor cosmetic results or discomfort due to tight scarring Seroma due to leaking lymph fluid, with the risk on the number of sentinel lymph nodes removed to the blue dye used in the procedure, which occurs in about 1 in 400 patients [19,20]. A 5% false-negative risk in the axilla or inguinal lymph node basins [21]. Up to a 20% false-negative risk in the lymph node basin due to its complex drainage [21]. The risks of complications from completion dissection are more common and serious than for sentinel lymph node biopsy, especially , , delayed healing, nerve damage, and tight scar formation [22,23].  is the swelling of the limb to the dissected nodal basin due to disruption of lymphatic fluid return. This can be very disabling for patients with only modest improvement achieved from wearing compression garments and massage/exercise [24]. The risk of lymphoedema is greater with inguinal completion dissection than with axillary dissection. Completion dissection may not prevent the of elsewhere.

The lymphoid organs also contain other types of cells such as for support. Lymphoid tissue is also associated with such as (MALT). Fluid from circulating blood leaks into the tissues of the body by capillary action, carrying nutrients to the cells. The fluid bathes the tissues as interstitial fluid, collecting waste products, bacteria, and damaged cells, and then drains as lymph into the lymphatic capillaries and lymphatic vessels. These vessels carry the lymph throughout the body, passing through numerous lymph nodes which filter out unwanted materials such as bacteria and damaged cells. Lymph then passes into much larger lymph vessels known as . The drains the right side of the region and the much larger left lymphatic duct, known as the , drains the left side of the body.

Bone marrow is responsible for both the creation of and the production and maturation of , which are important cell types of the immune system. From the bone marrow, B cells immediately join the circulatory system and travel to secondary lymphoid organs in search of pathogens. T cells, on the other hand, travel from the bone marrow to the thymus, where they develop further and mature. Mature T cells then join B cells in search of pathogens. The other 95% of T cells begin a process of , a form of . The thymus increases in size from birth in response to postnatal antigen stimulation. It is most active during the neonatal and pre-adolescent periods. At puberty, by the early teens, the thymus begins to atrophy and regress, with adipose tissue mostly replacing the thymic stroma. However, residual T lymphopoiesis continues throughout adult life. The loss or lack of the thymus results in severe immunodeficiency and subsequent high susceptibility to infection. In most species, the thymus consists of lobules divided by septa which are made up of epithelium; it is therefore often considered an epithelial organ. T cells mature from thymocytes, proliferate, and undergo a selection process in the thymic cortex before entering the medulla to interact with epithelial cells. The thymus provides an inductive environment for the development of T cells from hematopoietic progenitor cells. In addition, thymic stromal cells allow for the selection of a functional and self-tolerant T cell repertoire. Therefore, one of the most important roles of the thymus is the induction of central tolerance.

Further information: A lymph node showing and A is an organized collection of lymphoid tissue, through which the lymph passes on its way back to the blood. Lymph nodes are located at intervals along the lymphatic system. Several bring in lymph, which percolates through the substance of the lymph node, and is then drained out by an . Of the nearly 800 lymph nodes in the human body, about 300 are located in the head and neck. Many are grouped in clusters in different regions, as in the underarm and abdominal areas. Lymph node clusters are commonly found at the proximal ends of limbs (groin, armpits) and in the neck, where lymph is collected from regions of the body likely to sustain pathogen contamination from injuries. Lymph nodes are particularly numerous in the in the chest, neck, pelvis, , , and in association with the blood vessels of the intestines. The substance of a lymph node consists of lymphoid follicles in an outer portion called the . The inner portion of the node is called the , which is surrounded by the cortex on all sides except for a portion known as the . The hilum presents as a depression on the surface of the lymph node, causing the otherwise spherical lymph node to be bean-shaped or ovoid. The efferent lymph vessel directly emerges from the lymph node at the hilum. The arteries and veins supplying the lymph node with blood enter and exit through the hilum. The region of the lymph node called the paracortex immediately surrounds the medulla. Unlike the cortex, which has mostly immature T cells, or , the paracortex has a mixture of immature and mature T cells. Lymphocytes enter the lymph nodes through specialised found in the paracortex. A lymph follicle is a dense collection of lymphocytes, the number, size, and configuration of which change in accordance with the functional state of the lymph node. For example, the follicles expand significantly when encountering a foreign antigen. The selection of , or , occurs in the of the lymph nodes. Secondary lymphoid tissue provides the environment for the foreign or altered native molecules (antigens) to interact with the lymphocytes.

TLOs are regulated differently from the normal process whereby lymphoid tissues are formed during , being dependent on and cells, but still drain and transport lymphocytes in response to the same chemical messengers and gradients. TLOs typically contain far fewer lymphocytes, and assume an immune role only when challenged with that result in . They achieve this by importing the lymphocytes from blood and lymph. TLOs often have an active , surrounded by a network of follicular dendritic cells (FDCs). TLOs play an important role in the immune response to cancer. Patients with TLOs in the vicinity of their tumors tend to have a better prognosis, although the opposite is true for certain cancers. TLOs that contain an active tend to have a better prognosis than those with TLOs without a germinal center. The reason that these patients tend to live longer is thought to be the immune response against the tumor, which is mediated by the TLOs. TLOs may also promote an anti-tumor response when patients are treated with immunotherapy. TLOs have been referred to in many different ways, including as tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) and ectopic lymphoid structures (ELS). When associated with colorectal cancer, they are often referred to as a Crohn's-like lymphoid reaction. Lymphoid tissue associated with the lymphatic system is concerned with immune functions in defending the body against and the spread of . It consists of formed of , with various types of (white blood cells), mostly enmeshed in it, through which the lymph passes. Regions of the lymphoid tissue that are densely packed with lymphocytes are known as . Lymphoid tissue can either be structurally well organized as lymph nodes or may consist of loosely organized lymphoid follicles known as the (MALT). The also has lymphatic vessels. The search for T cell gateways into and out of the uncovered functional lining the , anatomically integrated into the membrane surrounding the brain. The , also called lymph vessels, are thin-walled vessels that conduct lymph between different parts of the body. They include the tubular vessels of the , and the larger collecting vessels–the and the (the left lymphatic duct). The lymph capillaries are mainly responsible for the absorption of interstitial fluid from the tissues, while lymph vessels propel the absorbed fluid forward into the larger collecting ducts, where it ultimately returns to the bloodstream via one of the . The tissues of the lymphatic system are responsible for maintaining the balance of the . Its network of capillaries and collecting lymphatic vessels work to efficiently drain and transport extravasated fluid, along with proteins and antigens, back to the circulatory system. Numerous intraluminal valves in the vessels ensure a unidirectional flow of lymph without reflux. Two valve systems, a primary and a secondary valve system, are used to achieve this unidirectional flow. The capillaries are blind-ended, and the valves at the ends of capillaries use specialised junctions together with anchoring filaments to allow a unidirectional flow to the primary vessels. The collecting lymphatics, however, act to propel the lymph by the combined actions of the intraluminal valves and lymphatic muscle cells. Lymphatic tissues begin to develop by the end of the fifth week of embryonic development. Lymphatic vessels develop from that arise from developing veins, which are derived from . The first lymph sacs to appear are the paired jugular lymph sacs at the junction of the internal jugular and subclavian veins. From the jugular lymph sacs, lymphatic capillary plexuses spread to the thorax, upper limbs, neck, and head. Some of the plexuses enlarge and form lymphatic vessels in their respective regions. Each jugular lymph sac retains at least one connection with its jugular vein, the left one developing into the superior portion of the thoracic duct. The next lymph sac to appear is the unpaired retroperitoneal lymph sac at the root of the mesentery of the intestine. It develops from the primitive vena cava and mesonephric veins. Capillary plexuses and lymphatic vessels spread from the retroperitoneal lymph sac to the abdominal viscera and diaphragm. The sac establishes connections with the cisterna chyli but loses its connections with neighbouring veins. The last of the lymph sacs, the paired posterior lymph sacs, develop from the iliac veins. The posterior lymph sacs produce capillary plexuses and lymphatic vessels of the abdominal wall, pelvic region, and lower limbs. The posterior lymph sacs join the and lose their connections with adjacent veins. With the exception of the anterior part of the sac from which the cisterna chyli develops, all lymph sacs become invaded by mesenchymal cells and are converted into groups of lymph nodes. The develops from mesenchymal cells between layers of the dorsal mesentery of the stomach. The arises as an outgrowth of the third pharyngeal pouch. The lymphatic system has multiple interrelated functions: It is responsible for the removal of from tissues It absorbs and transports and as from the digestive system It transports to and from the lymph nodes into the bones The lymph transports , such as , to the lymph nodes where an immune response is stimulated. Nutrients in food are absorbed via (greatly enlarged in the picture) to blood and lymph. Long-chain (and other with similar fat solubility like some medicines) are absorbed to the lymph and move in it enveloped inside . They move via the thoracic duct of the lymphatic system and finally enter the blood via the left subclavian vein, thus bypassing the liver's completely. called are at the beginning of the , predominantly in the small intestine. While most other nutrients absorbed by the are passed on to the to drain via the into the for processing, fats () are passed on to the lymphatic system to be transported to the blood circulation via the . (There are exceptions, for example are fatty acid esters of glycerol that passively diffuse from the GI tract to the portal system.) The enriched lymph originating in the lymphatics of the is called . The nutrients that are released into the circulatory system are processed by the , having passed through the systemic circulation. The lymphatic system plays a major role in the body's immune system, as the primary site for cells relating to including and . Cells in the lymphatic system react to or found by the cells directly or by other . When an antigen is recognized, an immunological cascade begins involving the activation and recruitment of more and more cells, the production of and and the recruitment of other immunological cells such as . The study of lymphatic drainage of various organs is important in the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of cancer. The lymphatic system, because of its closeness to many tissues of the body, is responsible for carrying cancerous cells between the various parts of the body in a process called . The intervening lymph nodes can trap the cancer cells. If they are not successful in destroying the cancer cells the nodes may become sites of secondary tumours. refers to one or more enlarged lymph nodes. Small groups or individually enlarged lymph nodes are generally in response to or . This is called lymphadenopathy. When many lymph nodes in different areas of the body are involved, this is called lymphadenopathy. Generalised lymphadenopathy may be caused by such as , and , such as and , and , including both cancers of tissue within lymph nodes, discussed below, and of cancerous cells from other parts of the body, that have arrived via the lymphatic system. is the caused by the accumulation of lymph, which may occur if the lymphatic system is damaged or has malformations. It usually affects limbs, though the face, neck and abdomen may also be affected.

In his work , he briefly mentioned the lymph nodes in one sentence. Rufus of , a Roman physician, identified the axillary, inguinal and mesenteric lymph nodes as well as the thymus during the 1st to 2nd century AD. The first mention of lymphatic vessels was in the 3rd century BC by , a Greek anatomist living in , who incorrectly concluded that the ""absorptive veins of the lymphatics,"" by which he meant the (lymph vessels of the intestines), drained into the , and thus into the liver. The findings of Ruphus and Herophilos were further propagated by the Greek physician , who described the lacteals and mesenteric lymph nodes which he observed in his dissection of apes and pigs in the 2nd century AD. In the mid 16th century, (discoverer of the ), described what is now known as the lacteals as ""coursing over the intestines full of yellow matter."" In about 1563 , a professor of anatomy, described the thoracic duct in horses as The next breakthrough came when in 1622 a physician, , identified lymphatic vessels of the intestines in dogs and termed them which are now known as simply the lacteals. The lacteals were termed the fourth kind of vessels (the other three being the artery, vein and nerve, which was then believed to be a type of vessel), and disproved Galen's assertion that chyle was carried by the veins. But, he still believed that the lacteals carried the chyle to the liver (as taught by Galen). He also identified the thoracic duct but failed to notice its connection with the lacteals. This connection was established by in 1651, who found a white fluid mixing with blood in a dog's heart. He suspected that fluid to be as its flow increased when abdominal pressure was applied. He traced this fluid to the thoracic duct, which he then followed to a chyle-filled sac he called the which is now known as the ; further investigations led him to find that lacteals' contents enter the venous system via the thoracic duct. Thus, it was proven convincingly that the lacteals did not terminate in the , thus disproving Galen's second idea: that the chyle flowed to the liver. drew the earliest sketches of the lacteals in humans in 1647. The idea that blood recirculates through the body rather than being produced anew by the liver and the heart was first accepted as a result of works of —a work he published in 1628. In 1652, (1630–1702), a Swede, discovered certain transparent vessels in the liver that contained clear fluid (and not white), and thus named them . He also learned that they emptied into the thoracic duct and that they had valves. He announced his findings in the court of , but did not publish his findings for a year, and in the interim similar findings were published by , who additionally published that such vessels are present everywhere in the body, not just in the liver. He is also the one to have named them ""lymphatic vessels."" This had resulted in a bitter dispute between one of Bartholin's pupils, Martin Bogdan, and Rudbeck, whom he accused of . Galen's ideas prevailed in medicine until the 17th century. It was thought that blood was produced by the liver from chyle contaminated with ailments by the intestine and stomach, to which various spirits were added by other organs, and that this blood was consumed by all the organs of the body. This theory required that the blood be consumed and produced many times over. Even in the 17th century, his ideas were defended by some physicians. , of the , was the first to describe the function of the lymphatic system in detail. . Lithograph by Pierre Roche Vigneron.

If you’ve never had a rash or itch there before, it’s a good idea to consult a doctor. Treatment varies, depending on the cause of the rash. Home remedies may also relieve the symptoms. Usually, a vaginal rash will feel uncomfortable and itchy. Your symptoms may get worse if you scratch the area. Most causes of vaginal rash aren’t medically serious and can be cured. But sometimes an underlying condition is serious or incurable. is the most common cause of vaginal rash. According to a , it’s responsible for about 50 percent of the cases of vaginal itching in adult women. It also can affect children. Usually, contact dermatitis caused by a reaction to a skin allergen such as cleaning or skin products, or clothes. Topical steroids are used to treat inflammation. These include low-dose or higher dose . These shouldn’t be used long term, as they thin the skin. In severe cases, a healthcare provider may give you these drugs as an injection. In some cases, or drugs may be prescribed for pain. is also called when the vulva is involved. The vulva is the external part of the genitals surrounding the opening to the vagina. According to the , the following are the most common vaginitis causes: occurs when certain bacteria multiply and change the normal bacterial balance in your vagina. most commonly involve the fungus . You normally have some of this fungus in your vaginal area. But certain factors can cause a decrease of good bacteria in your vagina, allowing to overgrow. (trich) is caused by the protozoan parasite . It’s spread person to person through intercourse. Some symptoms are particular to the type of infection: Bacterial infections usually involve a yellowish or grayish discharge that may smell like fish. Yeast infections may have a white discharge that looks like cottage cheese. Trichomoniasis may have a strong odor and greenish-yellow discharge. According to the CDC, about of infected people don’t have any symptoms. Yeast infections are treated with over-the-counter (OTC) or prescription antifungals. Bacterial infections are treated with prescription antibiotic or antibacterial cream. Trichomoniasis is treated with antibiotics, such as (Flagyl) or tinidazole (Tindamax). is an autoimmune condition affecting the skin, including the . Psoriasis lesions on the vulva are more common in children than adults. It doesn’t affect the inside of the vagina. A reported that women with psoriasis commonly had vaginal itching. The estimates that between one-third and two-thirds of people with psoriasis will at some point have genital psoriasis. In addition to itching, there are symmetrical red plaques in the vulva area, with no scaling. These can also be present in the anal area. Psoriasis is usually treated topically with low-strength . You can also try . is a common viral infection that affects the skin. It’s contagious and spreads through contact, including sexual intercourse. Symptoms include bumps between 2 and 5 millimeters (mm) in diameter that have these characteristics: The virus only lives on the skin’s surface. For most healthy people, the bumps disappear over time without treatment. When this happens, the infection is no longer contagious. In other cases, an outpatient procedure can be used to treat the infection. A rash is caused by the mite which burrows into the top layer of your skin to lay its eggs. The skin’s reaction to the mites produces little red bumps that are intensely itchy. The mites are easily transmitted person to person, including via sexual intercourse. You can also pick up mites from infected clothing, towels, or bedding. The main symptom of scabies is severe itchiness, especially at night. Scratching can open the skin to bacterial infection. The usual treatment for scabies is prescription . are tiny parasitic insects that infest pubic hair in the genital area. They feed on human blood. They are transmitted by sexual contact. You can also catch them from contact with the bedding, towels, or clothing of someone who has lice. Lice don’t infest the vagina, but they can make the genital area itchy. The crab-like insects may be visible, and you may see their eggs (nits). Pubic lice are usually , such as permethrin (Nix). is caused by the herpes simplex virus, usually type 2 (HSV-2). It’s one of the most common sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Once you have the virus, it stays inside your body’s nerve cells and can cause future outbreaks. Recurrent outbreaks are usually less severe and shorter. Symptoms appear four to seven days after sexual transmission. They include small, painful, or burning blisters and lesions around the vagina, buttocks, and anus that last up to three weeks. These lesions may rupture, ooze pus, and crust over. Your vulva may then become inflamed, swollen, and painful. The following are also symptoms of genital herpes: There isn’t a cure for herpes, but drugs like (Zovirax), , or (Valtrex) can relieve the severity of the outbreak and shorten the time it lasts. is an STI caused by the bacteria . It’s a progressive disease with four stages, and is disabling and even fatal if not treated. In the primary stage of syphilis, a small sore called a chancre develops at the infection site. It usually appears three to four weeks after the initial transmission of the bacteria. The chancre is painless but highly contagious. Because it’s not painful, it sometimes goes unnoticed. The chancre resolves after about three weeks, but the bacteria continue to spread through your body. In the secondary stage of syphilis, a rash appears, including on your vagina. Other symptoms include: Syphilis is treated with or other antibiotics for people allergic to penicillin. Highly contagious are caused by some types of the human papillomavirus (HPV). They’re one of the most common STIs. They usually appear in clusters, but there may be only one. They can also appear in your mouth, throat, or anal area. They have a range of traits: In color, they vary from light (flesh-toned and pearly) to dark (purple, gray, or brown). The warts can be tiny to large in size, round or flat in shape. While usually painless, they can become uncomfortably large, irritated, or itchy. Often, genital warts will go away on their own within a year, so you may want to wait. Treating the warts can shrink them, but the virus will still be present. Prescription drugs used to treat the warts include: A doctor can also remove the warts in an outpatient procedure. Neurodermatitis is an itchy skin condition also called . It’s not contagious. It can develop anywhere on your body. In the genital area, it often affects the vulva. Scratching intensifies the itching and is thought to irritate the nerve endings in the area you’re scratching. The nerves then appear to signal to you that there’s an itch. The exact cause isn’t known, but neurodermatitis may be triggered by an insect bite or stress. It also may occur secondary to another condition, such as contact dermatitis or diabetic neuropathy. As you keep scratching the vaginal itch, the area becomes thick and leathery (lichenified). Neurodermatitis is treated with an OTC or prescription medication to relieve the itching. are sores that appear in this area. They can be either extremely painful or painless. The most common causes are STIs, as well as bacterial or fungal infections. Noninfectious causes include: Vulvar ulcers might start out looking like bumps, a rash, or broken skin. Other symptoms include: is a small swelling on one of the glands that secrete lubricating fluid on each side of the vaginal opening. The cyst fills with fluid when the gland is injured or infected. The cyst may become infected and filled with pus, forming an . The Bartholin’s cyst is often painless and slow-growing. But there may be swelling and redness near the vaginal opening, and discomfort during sex or other activities. may include OTC pain relievers or an outpatient procedure to remove the cyst. results from your immune system attacking your skin cells or the cells of your mucous membranes, including the vagina. This skin condition isn’t contagious. Lichen planus is treated with topical steroids. Long-term treatment is recommended in the erosive type of lichen planus, because there’s a small risk of . is rare and usually affects only the vulva. It occurs mostly in prepubertal girls and postmenopausal women. It’s characterized by a white plaque in the shape of a figure eight around the vulva and anus. In children, it sometimes resolves on its own. In adults, it can’t be cured. But its symptoms can be treated with topical corticosteroids or immune-modulating medications like pimecrolimus (Elidel). pubic hair shaft that becomes infected and forms a red bump (overlapping skin folds increase friction and sweat, leading to vaginal irritation) The most likely causes of a rash around the vagina are contact dermatitis and vaginitis. Vaginal discomfort may also be caused by a Bartholin’s cyst. Many factors can be responsible for swelling and redness of your labia (the “lips” around the vagina), including: If your rash is contagious, talk with a doctor about when you can safely have sexual intercourse. Also discuss how to prevent other kinds of transmission. If you’re pregnant, ask about transmission to your baby. Stopping the itch is most important. Scratching aggravates the rash. Eliminate anything that could be irritating your skin, such as detergents and soaps, dryer sheets, talcum powders, and skin creams. Wear loose clothing and cotton underwear, and avoid synthetic materials. Don’t use vaginal sprays or douches (unless your doctor has recommended it). Use a fragrance-free moisturizer to prevent dryness. Use , which have antifungal properties. Use , which an also be effective against yeast and bacterial infections. Try a to reduce itchiness. It will also help a corticosteroid penetrate your skin better. Eat yogurt with live cultures to help prevent yeast infections. Wipe from front to back after you have a bowel movement. Use a barrier method, such as condoms, during intercourse. It’s a good idea to see a doctor if you haven’t had a vaginal rash before. You might also want to consult a skin doctor (dermatologist) or an infectious disease specialist who may have more experience with a range of conditions, including STIs. Once the cause of your rash is identified and you have a successful remedy, you may be able to treat a recurrence of the rash yourself. A doctor will examine you and take a medical history. They may be able to identify the cause by looking at your rash. The doctor may take a swab from the area if there is vaginal discharge, or a skin scrape or to look at the cells under a microscope. They’ll be able to see a parasite like scabies, or identify psoriasis cells under the microscope. A may be used to identify herpes simplex or syphilis. You may be referred to a , dermatologist, or an infectious disease specialist for treatment. Practicing good hygiene is important. So is maintaining a healthy diet and lifestyle. Being in good shape can help you ward off infections. using barrier methods when having sex, such as condoms or dental dams not sharing towels and clothing that may have come in contact with an open lesion avoiding irritants (if you have contact dermatitis) Vaginal rashes are treatable, and symptoms can be alleviated with medication and home remedies. In some cases, the underlying disease (such as herpes or psoriasis) has no cure, but the symptoms can be managed with medication. It’s important to see a doctor to diagnose and treat the cause of your rash. Sometimes you may have to work with a doctor over time to find the right treatment plan for you and to prevent the rash from recurring.

MELESSA PHILLIPS, M.D., University of Mississippi Medical Center, Jackson, Mississippi Abstract Abstract The American Geriatric Society currently recommends screening mammography for women up to 85 years of age whose life expectancy is three years or longer. The value of clinical breast examinations in older women needs further study. Total mastectomy and partial mastectomy with postoperative radiation therapy yield similar results in localized breast cancer. Postoperative irradiation may be avoided in women with small tumors (2.5 cm or less in diameter) who have undergone quadrantectomy. Lymph node dissection is important for tumor staging but significantly increases the risks and morbidity of surgery. Lymph node mapping may obviate the need for lymphadenectomy in many older women. Adjuvant hormonal therapy for at least two years appears to be beneficial in all women with hormone-receptor–rich tumors. Adjuvant chemotherapy is indicated in women with lymph node involvement or high-risk tumors with no lymph node involvement. Unless life-threatening metastases are present, hormonal therapy is the first approach to metastatic cancer. Chemotherapy is indicated if endocrine therapy is unsuccessful or life-threatening metastases are present. Most chemotherapy regimens appear to be well tolerated, even by women over 70 years of age. Special treatment should be employed for metastases to tumor sanctuaries (i.e., brain, eyes), the long bones, the spine and the chest wall. Breast cancer is the most common cause of cancer deaths in women over 65 years of age. The multidisciplinary approach to this cancer includes prevention, early detection through appropriate screening, treatment of localized tumors and management of advanced disease. The family physician may assume a key role in these interventions by providing education and support to patients and their families. The removal of age-related barriers to breast cancer prevention and treatment is also an important task of the family physician. Abstract Breast cancer becomes more prevalent with age. Data from the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results Program indicate that the incidence of breast cancer increases up to 80 years of age and plateaus between 80 and 85 years of age (). More than 50 percent of breast cancers occur in women 65 years of age and older. With increasing age, the risk of comorbid conditions and cancer-related death also increases. As many as 50 percent of women 65 years of age and older who develop breast cancer die of the disease. Even when a woman survives, breast cancer causes significant morbidity and disability. Decisions related to the prevention and treatment of breast cancer in older women need to be individualized. Factors that must be considered include the woman's risk of breast cancer, the aggressiveness of the cancer and the woman's life expectancy. Abstract Known and possible risk factors for breast cancer in postmenopausal women are listed in . Family history appears to be a risk factor even for older women. However, familial prevalence does not necessarily imply inheritance, because environmental conditions in the same household (e.g., dietary habits, substances in the air) hypothetically may cause a cluster of cancers in a family. Only a negligible proportion of breast cancers in older women are associated with known genetic mutations. Endocrine risk factors for breast cancer are dominated by unopposed exposure to estrogen. These risks include early menarche, late menopause, late first pregnancy, android obesity and hormone replacement therapy. Android obesity, defined as a ratio of 0.71 or greater between the body circumferences measured at the waist and the hips, is associated with decreased circulating concentrations of sex-hormone–binding globulin and an increased concentration of free estrogen. A particular concern in older women is hormone replacement therapy, which currently involves the administration of estrogen alone or in combination with progestin in an effort to minimize the risk of endometrial cancer. The role of hormone replacement therapy in the pathogenesis of breast cancer is controversial. Some studies indicate that the incidence of breast cancer increases somewhat with the estrogen dosage and the duration of treatment. Other studies suggest that the increased incidence of breast cancer observed in women who have received long-term hormone replacement therapy may be related to the more prolonged survival of these women. Conjugated estrogens in dosages of 0.625 mg or less are not associated with breast cancer, but these dosages may be too low to ameliorate the symptoms of menopause, including hot flushes and vaginal atrophy. No evidence exists that the addition of progestin influences the risk of breast cancer. The risks and benefits of hormone replacement therapy should be carefully balanced. One detailed analysis demonstrated that hormone replacement therapy has positive effects on survival and quality of life in virtually all circumstances. Hormone replacement is certainly indicated in women with a family history of coronary artery disease and/or severe menopausal symptoms. While alternative approaches to osteoporosis prevention are now available, estrogen replacement still seems to represent the best tested therapy for managing this condition. Alcohol consumption has a definite etiologic role in breast cancer. The association between dietary fat and breast cancer is controversial. Finally, exposure to ionizing radiation increases the risk of breast cancer. Abstract According to both clinical observations and laboratory studies, breast cancer becomes more indolent in the aged. Thus, as women age, the prevalence of non–life-threatening metastases appears to increase, while the incidence of life-threatening metastases tends to decrease. The risk of death due to metastatic disease also decreases with advancing age. One explanation for the more indolent course of breast cancer in older women is that the prevalence of hormone-receptor–rich, well-differentiated and slowly proliferating neoplasms increases with age. The ability of the host to support tumor growth may also decrease with age. Abstract Chemoprevention with estrogen antagonists is the most promising form of primary breast cancer prevention in older women. A recent meta-analysis reviewing the effects of adjuvant tamoxifen therapy in approximately 75,000 women with early breast cancer showed a 36 percent reduction in new contralateral cancers in the tamoxifen-treated group over a 15-year follow-up period. Three ongoing clinical trials in the United States, the United Kingdom and Italy are examining the potential benefits of tamoxifen for breast cancer prevention in postmenopausal women. However, the risks of prolonged tamoxifen administration, including deep venous thrombosis, endometrial cancer, hot flushes and vaginal discharge, may limit the use of this preventive strategy. Secondary prevention through the screening of asymptomatic women is the most established form of breast cancer prevention. Aging may affect screening results. Since the prevalence of breast cancer increases with age, the positive predictive value of screening tests may improve with the age of the population screened. Conversely, the death-preventing effects of screening may progressively wane due to competing causes of death. The benefits of screening mammography are first seen three to seven years after the initial mammography. Thus, women with a life expectancy of three years or longer may theoretically benefit from screening. One area that merits further study is the effect of breast cancer screening on quality of life in older women. Early diagnosis of breast cancer may prevent the complications of locally advanced disease. Currently available screening tests include breast self-examination, clinical examination of the breast and mammography. The value of breast self-examination in reducing breast cancer mortality is marginal. At best, self-examination may heighten the awareness of breast cancer and promote health maintenance. Physicians and patients should be well aware of the low sensitivity of breast self-examination and the fact that it cannot substitute for more effective screening strategies. When performed by a trained health care professional, the clinical breast examination may detect some cancers not found by mammography. The clinical breast examination requires no special equipment and may be performed during any office visit. The examination appears to be particularly convenient with older women, who tend to see their physician on a regular basis. In both the Breast Cancer Detection Demonstration Project and the Canadian study, most tumors diagnosable by mammography only were carcinomas in situ with negligible metastatic potential. Furthermore, the addition of mammography to clinical examination of the breast in the Canadian study failed to reduce the mortality rate for breast cancer in women 50 to 59 years of age. The positive predictive value of the clinical breast examination may improve with the age of the patient, due to the increased prevalence of breast cancer and the development of more atrophic breasts. At least eight prospective controlled trials and five historically controlled trials have examined the value of serial screening mammography in asymptomatic women. In the majority of these trials, screening mammography led to a 20 to 30 percent reduction in the breast cancer mortality rate for women 50 to 65 years of age. The benefits of mammography in women older than 65 years have been less well established, primarily because this age group was excluded or underrepresented in most of the trials. The American Geriatric Society currently recommends that screening mammography be performed in older women up to 85 years of age if their life expectancy is three years or longer. This approach has been supported by a recent decision analysis. Social and cultural barriers once limited the use of cancer screening in most older women. In the past decade, however, some form of breast cancer screening has been performed in the majority of older women, in part because of public education efforts. Support from family physicians appears to be essential to removing any remaining barriers to screening. Abstract Breast cancer may be treated with surgery,irradiation, hormonal agents and chemocytotoxic drugs. These modalities may be used separately or in combination, based on the stage of the disease and the characteristics of the patient. Surgery includes treatment of the primary breast tumor and dissection of the ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes. Currently, primary tumors are seldom treated with radical mastectomy. A total mastectomy spares the pectoralis minor muscle, while a partial mastectomy (i.e., lumpectomy) is targeted at preserving the breast. Types of lumpectomy include quadrantectomy and lesser procedures. Both total mastectomy and partial mastectomy may be performed under local anesthesia. Lymph node mapping may eventually make lymph node dissection obsolete. This technique allows intraoperative identification and sampling of the so-called “sentinel lymph node” (the first lymph node receiving lymphatic drainage from the breast). When the sentinel lymph node has no tumor involvement, the risk of other lymph node involvement appears to be negligible. More studies are needed to confirm these findings. Radiation therapy for breast cancer involves external-beam irradiation. It is generally used in addition to surgery or for the palliation of pain. Hormonal therapy may be used as an adjuvant treatment for breast cancer. It is also used to prevent systemic recurrence of localized disease and to manage metastatic cancer. In general, hormonal therapy is not indicated for treatment of tumors that are poor in hormone receptors. The dosages and side effects of the hormonal agents most commonly used to treat breast cancer are listed in .

The long-term effects of tamoxifen are of special interest because the drug has been used extensively in the adjuvant management of breast cancer. Tamoxifen has some estrogen-like activities that may be particularly beneficial in older women. These include delay of osteoporosis and prevention of coronary deaths. However, the potential association of tamoxifen and endometrial cancer has raised some serious concerns about long-term therapy. Tamoxifen may increase the risk of endometrial cancer by 20 to 40 percent. Endometrial cancer can usually be diagnosed at an early stage and completely resected. If the patient undergoes serial transvaginal ultrasound examinations, early detection is more likely. Mortality from tamoxifen-induced endometrial cancer has been negligible. Anastrozole (Arimidex) is a new aromatase inhibitor that is being used to treat breast cancer. This compound is better tolerated than aminoglutethimide (Cytadren), and corticosteroid supplementation is not required. Cytotoxic chemotherapy has a major role in the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer and the management of metastatic disease. Commonly used cytotoxic drugs include cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan), methotrexate (Rheumatrex), fluorouracil, the anthracyclines (doxorubicin [Adriamycin, Rubex] and epirubicin), mitoxantrone (Novantrone), the taxanes (paclitaxel [Taxol] and docetaxel [Taxotere]) and vinorelbine (Navelbine). The few studies that have explored the tolerance of breast cancer chemotherapy found a comparable incidence of complications in women both older and younger than 65 years of age. However, the older women in these studies had negligible comorbidity and therefore may not be representative of the older population at large. Furthermore, very few of the women were over 80 years of age. Thus, virtually no information is available concerning the tolerance of chemotherapy by the very aged. Some important steps may be taken to minimize the complications of cytotoxic chemotherapy in older women. First, the dosages of renally excretable drugs, such as methotrexate, should be adjusted to the creatinine clearance in the individual patient. Second, when alternative drugs are available, the agent with the lowest risk of complications should be selected. For example, mitoxantrone and doxorubicin have comparable activity, but mitoxantrone appears to be better tolerated in terms of cardiac toxicity, alopecia, nausea, vomiting and fatigue. Third, antidotes to chemotherapy toxicity, such as hemopoietic growth factors to ameliorate myelotoxicity or desrazoxane (Zinecard) to prevent anthracycline cardiotoxicity, may make chemotherapy more tolerable in older patients. Abstract With the widespread use of screening mammography, the diagnosis of carcinoma in situ has become increasingly common. Carcinoma in situ presently accounts for approximately 17 percent of newly diagnosed breast cancers. Of the carcinomas in situ, 85 percent are ductal and 15 percent are lobular. Ductal carcinoma in situ is treated with mastectomy or partial mastectomy followed by postoperative irradiation. Since lymph node involvement is rare in ductal carcinoma in situ, routine lymph node dissection is not indicated. This cancer is often multicentric and is associated with a high risk of local recurrence after partial mastectomy. It is extremely important that local recurrences be controlled, because they may be associated with invasive and metastatic cancer. One recent study showed that local recurrences are more likely with large tumors (2.5 cm or more in diameter) with aneuploidy and poor histologic differentiation. Lobular carcinoma in situ has similar risks of local and contralateral recurrence. Thus, it is managed with either local excision or bilateral mastectomy. Local excision with mammographic follow-up appears to be the most sensible treatment. The treatment of localized breast cancer involves control of the primary tumor, lymph node dissection and, in selected cases, systemic therapy. The same degree of local control is achieved with total mastectomy or partial mastectomy in combination with postoperative irradiation. Dissection may be limited to axillary levels I and II when the lymph nodes at these levels are free of tumor. This approach decreases the risk of lymphedema and brachial neuropathy. Lymph node mapping may eliminate the need for axillary dissection in the majority of breast cancers. In specific clinical situations, adjuvant systemic therapy prolongs both disease-free survival and overall survival in patients with localized breast cancer.  The decision to use systemic treatment is determined by the risk of systemic recurrence (). Treatment guidelines formulated by an international consensus panel (St. Gallien conference) are presented in . Age may affect all aspects of localized breast cancer management. Major controversial issues include the use of postoperative radiation therapy after partial mastectomy, nonoperative management of primary breast cancer and adjuvant systemic therapy.

J Natl Cancer Inst 1995;87:1441–5. Postoperative irradiation reduces the local recurrence rate and allows preservation of the breast, but it does not appear to affect patient survival. Furthermore, postoperative irradiation increases the cost of treatment. The six weeks of daily radiation treatments may be very inconvenient for older women. The local recurrence rate for tumors with a diameter of 2.5 cm or less may be only 3 percent at five years in women 55 years of age and older. Thus, postoperative irradiation may be unnecessary in older women with small tumors who have undergone quadrantectomy. Of the studies that have explored the non-surgical management of localized breast cancer in women 70 years of age and older, the Cancer Research Campaign Trial has produced the most definitive results. In this trial, patients were randomized to receive tamoxifen therapy alone or to undergo partial mastectomy with adjuvant tamoxifen therapy. Of the patients treated nonsurgically, 40 percent had disease progression requiring surgery within two years. The nonsurgical approach appears to be inferior to standard treatment and therefore should be used only in patients in whom surgery is contraindicated. Controversy also exists concerning indications for tamoxifen therapy and the duration of this treatment. The indications for adjuvant systemic chemotherapy in older women with localized breast cancer are also controversial. Adjuvant tamoxifen therapy has been found to prolong both disease-free survival and overall survival in all postmenopausal women with localized breast cancer, including those older than 70 years of age. A minimum of two years of adjuvant tamoxifen treatment is necessary to affect patient survival, and additional benefits may be seen with up to five years of treatment. The National Cancer Institute recently recommended that adjuvant tamoxifen therapy not be continued beyond five years, except in ongoing clinical trials. In part, this recommendation was based on the fact that a recent update of the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project B-14 comparing five and 10 years of tamoxifen therapy failed to demonstrate any benefits from treatment beyond five years. Other influencing factors were the concerns about tamoxifen-induced endometrial cancer and the development of tamoxifen resistance. Three questions summarize the controversies related to adjuvant chemotherapy: Is chemotherapy of any value in older women? Which form of chemotherapy, if any, should be used? Which conditions are indications for adjuvant chemotherapy? Several controlled clinical trials have shown that adjuvant chemotherapy delays breast cancer recurrence in postmenopausal women, but none of the trials has conclusively demonstrated a reduction in the breast cancer mortality rate. A meta-analysis of several trials showed a 13 percent decrease in the breast cancer mortality rate for women 50 to 59 years of age and a 10 percent reduction for women 60 to 69 years of age. No reduction in mortality occurred in women 70 years of age and older, although this age group represented a small minority of the study subjects. The age-related decline in mortality reduction is not surprising, considering the increased prevalence of other causes of death. Thus, survival alone may not be an appropriate parameter to test the value of adjuvant chemotherapy in older patients. Measures incorporating quality of life may be more appropriate. With respect to determining which chemotherapeutic agents are more effective, combinations that include doxorubicin appear to be preferable in older women with positive axillary lymph nodes. In women with negative lymph nodes, less toxic combinations, such as methotrexate and fluorouracil, may be adequate. The St. Gallien conference provided an adequate set of indications for adjuvant chemotherapy in older women with breast cancer. Older women seldom present with locally advanced disease. In most cases, stage IIIA disease results from the neglect of a smaller tumor. The breast cancer is then managed with surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy. Surgical treatment, including mastectomy with postoperative irradiation of the chest wall, may be required to prevent chest wall recurrence. Since stage IIIB breast cancer is very aggressive, local treatment alone is of limited benefit. Current treatment of stage IIIB breast cancer includes preoperative chemotherapy (and hormonal therapy, if the tumor is rich in hormone receptors), followed by surgery and radiation therapy. Chemotherapy should include an anthracycline. With this approach, a five-year survival rate of 30 to 40 percent may be obtainable. Metastatic breast cancer requires systemic treatment. Estrogen antagonists are front-line agents if the patient has not been exposed to them previously and if life-threatening metastases (hepatic or lymphangitic lung metastases) are not present. If the tumor progresses during treatment with estrogen antagonists, alternative hormonal therapies may be used to treat hormone-receptor–positive tumors, and chemotherapy may be used to treat hormone-receptor–poor tumors (). In the presence of life-threatening metastases, chemotherapy is generally indicated, because this treatment works more rapidly than hormonal therapy. Suggested approach to the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in older women. (HR+ = hormone-receptor–rich tumor; HR– = hormone-receptor–poor tumor) Suggested approach to the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in older women. (HR+ = hormone-receptor–rich tumor; HR– = hormone-receptor–poor tumor) Metastases to tumor sanctuaries, such as the brain or the eyes, require radiation therapy. A single brain metastasis may also be resected. Metastases to the long bones increase the risk of pathologic fractures, while metastases to the spine may cause spinal cord compression. When 50 percent or more of the cortex of a long bone is destroyed, orthopedic fixation of the bone is indicated. While waiting for surgery, the patient should be instructed not to bear weight on the at-risk bone. The use of crutches or a wheelchair is recommended. Painful metastases to the spine should be evaluated with myelography or magnetic resonance imaging. In the presence of epidural extension, emergency radiation therapy and corticosteroid treatment are indicated. Single chest-wall metastasis requires both local and systemic treatment. Local treatment involves surgery (when feasible) or radiation therapy. The duration of systemic treatment has not been definitely established. Hormonal therapy may be used for at least two years to treat hormone-receptor–rich tumors. Six courses of chemotherapy may be used to treat hormone-receptor–poor tumors. With this approach, more than 50 percent of patients are alive and free of disease five years from the time of chest-wall recurrence. Choose a single article, issue, or full-access subscription.

Learn about some of the more common and possible symptoms. If you have sex—oral, anal or vaginal intercourse and genital touching—you can get an STD, also called a sexually transmitted infection (STI). Straight or gay, married or single, you're vulnerable to STIs and STI symptoms. Thinking or hoping your partner doesn't have an STI is no protection—you need to know for sure. And although condoms, when properly used, are highly effective for reducing transmission of some STDs, no method is foolproof. STI symptoms aren't always obvious. If you think you have STI symptoms or have been exposed to an STI, see a doctor. Some STIs are easy to treat and cure; others require more-complicated treatment to manage them. It's essential to be evaluated, and—if diagnosed with an STI—get treated. It's also essential to inform your partner or partners so that they can be evaluated and treated. If untreated, STIs can increase your risk of acquiring another STI such as HIV. This happens because an STI can stimulate an immune response in the genital area or cause sores, either of which might raise the risk of HIV transmission. Some untreated STIs can also lead to infertility, organ damage, certain types of cancer or death. Many STIs have no signs or symptoms (asymptomatic). Even with no symptoms, however, you can pass the infection to your sex partners. So it's important to use protection, such as a condom, during sex. And visit your doctor regularly for STI screening, so you can identify and treat an infection before you can pass it on. Some of the following diseases, such as hepatitis, can also be transmitted without sexual contact, by coming into contact with an infected person's blood. Others, such as gonorrhea, can only be transmitted through sexual contact. Chlamydia is a bacterial infection of your genital tract. Chlamydia may be difficult to detect because early-stage infections often cause few or no signs and symptoms. When they do occur, they usually start one to three weeks after you've been exposed to chlamydia. Even when signs and symptoms occur, they're often mild and passing, making them easy to overlook. Gonorrhea is a bacterial infection of your genital tract. It can also grow in your mouth, throat, eyes and anus. The first gonorrhea symptoms generally appear within 10 days after exposure. However, some people may be infected for months before signs or symptoms occur. Thick, cloudy or bloody discharge from the penis or vagina Heavy menstrual bleeding or bleeding between periods Trichomoniasis is a common STI caused by a microscopic, one-celled parasite called Trichomonas vaginalis. This organism spreads during sexual intercourse with someone who already has the infection. The organism usually infects the urinary tract in men, but often causes no symptoms. Trichomoniasis typically infects the vagina in women. When trichomoniasis causes symptoms, they may appear within five to 28 days of exposure and range from mild irritation to severe inflammation. Clear, white, greenish or yellowish vaginal discharge HIV is an infection with the human immunodeficiency virus. HIV interferes with your body's ability to fight off viruses, bacteria and fungi that cause illness, and it can lead to AIDS, a chronic, life-threatening disease. When first infected with HIV, you may have no symptoms. Some people develop a flu-like illness, usually two to six weeks after being infected. Still, the only way you know if you have HIV is to be tested. These early signs and symptoms usually disappear within a week to a month and are often mistaken for those of another viral infection. During this period, you're highly infectious. More-persistent or -severe symptoms of HIV infection may not appear for 10 years or more after the initial infection. As the virus continues to multiply and destroy immune cells, you may develop mild infections or chronic signs and symptoms such as: Swollen lymph nodes—often one of the first signs of HIV infection Signs and symptoms of late-stage HIV infection include: Shaking chills or fever higher than 100.4 F (38 C) for several weeks Swelling of lymph nodes for more than three months Highly contagious, genital herpes is caused by a type of the herpes simplex virus (HSV) that enters your body through small breaks in your skin or mucous membranes. Most people with HSV never know they have it, because they have no signs or symptoms or the signs and symptoms are so mild they go unnoticed. When signs and symptoms are noticeable, the first episode is generally the worst. Some people never have a second episode. Others, however, can have recurrent episodes for decades. When present, genital herpes signs and symptoms may include: Small red bumps, blisters (vesicles) or open sores (ulcers) in the genital, anal and nearby areas Pain or itching around the genital area, buttocks and inner thighs The initial symptom of genital herpes usually is pain or itching, beginning within a few weeks after exposure to an infected sexual partner. After several days, small red bumps may appear. They then rupture, becoming ulcers that ooze or bleed. Eventually, scabs form and the ulcers heal. In women, sores can erupt in the vaginal area, external genitals, buttocks, anus or cervix. In men, sores can appear on the penis, scrotum, buttocks, anus or thighs, or inside the tube from the bladder through the penis (urethra). Ulcers can make urination painful. You may also have pain and tenderness in your genital area until the infection clears. During an initial episode, you may have flu-like signs and symptoms, such as a headache, muscle aches and fever, as well as swollen lymph nodes in your groin. In some cases, the infection can be active and contagious even when sores aren't present. Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and genital warts symptoms HPV infection is one of the most common types of STIs. Some forms put women at high risk of cervical cancer. Other forms cause genital warts. HPV usually has no signs or symptoms. The signs and symptoms of genital warts include: Small, flesh-colored or gray swellings in your genital area Several warts close together that take on a cauliflower shape Often, however, genital warts cause no symptoms. Genital warts may be as small as 1 millimeter in diameter or may multiply into large clusters. In women, genital warts can grow on the vulva, the walls of the vagina, the area between the external genitals and the anus, and the cervix. In men, they may occur on the tip or shaft of the penis, the scrotum, or the anus. Genital warts can also develop in the mouth or throat of a person who has had oral sex with an infected person. Hepatitis A, hepatitis B and hepatitis C are all contagious viral infections that affect your liver. Hepatitis B and C are the most serious of the three, but each can cause your liver to become inflamed. Some people never develop signs or symptoms. But for those who do, signs and symptoms may occur several weeks after exposure and may include: Abdominal pain or discomfort, especially in the area of your liver on your right side beneath your lower ribs Yellowing of your skin and the whites of your eyes (jaundice) Syphilis is a bacterial infection. The disease affects your genitals, skin and mucous membranes, but it can also involve many other parts of your body, including your brain and your heart. The signs and symptoms of syphilis may occur in four stages—primary, secondary, latent and tertiary. There's also a condition known as congenital syphilis, which occurs when a pregnant woman with syphilis passes the disease to her unborn infant. Congenital syphilis can be disabling, even life-threatening, so it's important for a pregnant woman with syphilis to be treated. The first sign of syphilis, which may occur from 10 days to three months after exposure, may be a small, painless sore (chancre) on the part of your body where the infection was transmitted, usually your genitals, rectum, tongue or lips. A single chancre is typical, but there may be multiple sores. The sore typically heals without treatment, but the underlying disease remains and may reappear in the second (secondary) or third (tertiary) stage. Signs and symptoms of secondary syphilis may begin three to six weeks after the chancre appears, and may include: Rash marked by red or reddish-brown, penny-sized sores over any area of your body, including your palms and soles These signs and symptoms may disappear without treatment within a few weeks or repeatedly come and go for as long as a year. In some people, a period called latent syphilis—in which no symptoms are present—may follow the secondary stage. Signs and symptoms may never return, or the disease may progress to the tertiary stage. Without treatment, syphilis bacteria may spread, leading to serious internal organ damage and death years after the original infection. Some of the signs and symptoms of tertiary syphilis include: At any stage, syphilis can affect the nervous system. Neurosyphilis may cause no signs or symptoms, or it can cause: If you suspect you have these or other STIs or that you may have been exposed to one, see your doctor for testing.

d794ab12-be37-4db9-ac60-2199c1fa6443,"— Any time you break the skin on your body, platelets rush to the site to form a clot and limit blood loss. This clot can harden into a , which acts as a protective layer on the surface of the skin and allows new skin cells to form beneath it. When a scab forms on a scraped knee, you understand it’s part of the healing process. When a scab appears on your penis, it can be a much more puzzling and possibly alarming experience. There are several reasons why a scab might form on your penis. It could be a sign of a common skin condition, such as . Or it could be a more serious symptom of a sexually transmitted infection (STI). See pictures and learn about the possible causes for a scab on your penis, as well as treatment and prevention options. A scab may form on your penis because you have a that’s causing blisters, rashes, or scabs to form anywhere on your body. No doubt, a skin problem forming on your penis can be more painful than other areas. A skin condition affecting the penis may require different treatment from what is used for the same issue affecting a less sensitive part of the body. Some common skin problems that may affect the penis include: is a skin condition characterized by an abnormally rapid skin cell cycle. New skin cells are produced faster than necessary, resulting in the accumulation of dead skin cells on the surface. These areas can look like dry, scaly patches or scabs. Because the skin of the penis is so sensitive, treatment of can be more complicated than treating psoriasis on other parts of the body. Some topical medicines can help slow down skin cell production and relieve the pain and itch that often accompany psoriasis. Low doses of may also be effective. Triggered by a virus, appears as whitish bumps on the skin. The bumps can appear anywhere, including the penis. Picking at them can cause a scab to form, and more easily cause the infection to spread. Skin-to-skin contact with someone who has the virus can lead to molluscum contagiosum, as can contact with towels or other surfaces containing the virus. Scabs or can also result from allergies to a new , the on a condom, or any of several allergens. In addition to dry skin, you may also experience watery eyes and sinus congestion. If latex is the cause, try latex-free condoms, such as those made from silicone or polyurethane. Pictures of common skin conditions that may affect the penis Not all STIs cause sores or other noticeable changes to your penis. But bumps, sores, rashes, and scabs are among the common signs of a sexually transmitted disease (STD) — a commonly used, but less accurate, term for STI. To help identify which, if any, STI you may have developed, it’s helpful to understand what the scab looks like and what other symptoms may be present. Here’s a rundown on some of the more common STIs that can cause penis scabs. When symptoms of start to appear — two days to two weeks after exposure to the virus — they’re usually in the form of small bumps or blisters on the penis. The blisters can soon become oozing or bleeding ulcers, and then they form scabs as the ulcers heal. These same symptoms may also develop elsewhere in the genital area and be accompanied by pain and itching. Genital herpes has no cure, but antiviral medications may help control symptoms. Two commonly prescribed medications are (Zovirax) and (Valtrex). is a virus that causes genital warts. However, you can have an HPV infection and not develop genital warts. In some cases, genital warts are barely visible. You can also have larger flesh-colored bumps on and around your penis. Genital warts may be itchy, but they’re usually painless. Scratching them can cause scabs to form and prolong the healing process. Your body’s own immune system may fight off the infection, so the warts could disappear without any treatment. If not, your doctor may prescribe topical cream or ointment specifically made for genital warts. You shouldn’t use over-the-counter wart-removal products on your penis. Last-resort treatments include (freezing the warts off) and surgery. can be a life-threatening disease if not diagnosed and treated properly. This bacterial infection can cause one or more sores to form on the penis. This sore, called a chancre, is usually painless and may go unnoticed. A scab may soon form over the sore, and it may fade within a few weeks, even without antibiotic treatment. However, with infection still present, a rash can then develop on the trunk and later affect the rest of the body. Accompanying symptoms include fatigue, muscle aches, and swollen lymph nodes. Syphilis is easy to treat in its early stages. An injection of the antibiotic penicillin is often enough. However, if the infection has lingered for over a year, additional injections may be needed. is another bacterial infection that’s usually transmitted through sexual contact. It can cause an ulcer and then a scab to form on or near the penis. These sores may be quite painful. The lymph nodes in the groin may also become swollen and painful on one or both sides. Antibiotics are usually effective at treating chancroid. In severe cases, though, a scar may remain. Lymphogranuloma venereum is caused by a type of , a common sexually transmitted bacterial infection. The first symptom is usually one or more sores on the penis that may be painless. The sores may scab over even as you remain contagious. Swelling and pain in nearby lymph nodes may follow. Antibiotics, such as tetracycline, are usually enough to treat the condition and keep you from transmitting the virus to others. The appearance of bumps, scabs, or other changes to the skin of your penis should prompt a visit to a doctor or other healthcare professional. You may be advised to see a dermatologist, urologist, or even an infectious disease specialist if it appears that an infection has triggered your symptoms. In some cases, a small tissue sample from a bump or scab may be sent to a lab for analysis. The results can confirm a diagnosis. If the scabs or sores are painful, or you notice pain and swelling in the lymph nodes near your groin, seek a medical evaluation as soon as possible. You may want to visit an emergency room or an urgent care center. If you’re prescribed antibiotic or antiviral medication therapy, you may still be contagious while taking the medication. Be sure to discuss with your healthcare provider when it’s safe for you to resume sexual activity. To help prevent an STI, you and your sexual partner should be screened for potential infections by a healthcare professional. Be aware that a condition such as syphilis can lie dormant without any obvious symptoms for years. Regular STI screening is a good idea for anyone who is sexually active, especially for those with a new partner or multiple partners. Wearing a during vaginal and anal sex can provide effective protection against many STIs. can also provide protection during oral sex. However, remember that any type of skin-to-skin contact with someone who has a contagious skin condition can put you at risk. Good personal hygiene is also essential. In addition to showering regularly and wearing clean underclothes, you should also avoid sharing towels with others who may have a contagious skin condition. There are plenty of reasons why a scab might form on your penis. But because many conditions produce similar symptoms, it’s important to get a proper diagnosis as soon as possible. Some of the conditions that cause a scab on your penis can lead to very serious health conditions, and they can be contagious. Whether it’s an STI or a more benign condition, early diagnosis and treatment gives you a better chance at healing with fewer health complications. Early treatment helps prevent the spread of contagious infections. — Your penis tip, shaft, or foreskin can get cut for many reasons. A cut is usually nothing to worry about.

fe1f2d04-a05b-4110-8227-0df4b098ad1b,"Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research Breast Cancer Treatment (Adult) (PDQ®)–Health Professional Version This summary discusses primary epithelial breast cancers in women. The breast is rarely affected by other tumors such as lymphomas, sarcomas, or melanomas. Refer to the following PDQ summaries for more information on these cancer types: Breast cancer also affects men and children and may occur during pregnancy, although it is rare in these populations. Refer to the following PDQ summaries for more information: Estimated new cases and deaths from breast cancer (women only) in the United States in 2020:[] Breast cancer is the most common noncutaneous cancer in U.S. women, with an estimated 48,530 cases of female breast ductal carcinoma and 276,480 cases of invasive disease in 2020.[] Thus, fewer than one of six women diagnosed with breast cancer die of the disease. By comparison, it is estimated that about 63,220 American women will die of lung cancer in 2020.[] Men account for 1% of breast cancer cases and breast cancer deaths (refer to the section in the PDQ summary on for more information). Widespread adoption of screening increases breast cancer incidence in a given population and changes the characteristics of cancers detected, with increased incidence of lower-risk cancers, premalignant lesions, and ductal carcinoma (DCIS). (Refer to the section in the section in the PDQ summary on for more information.) Population studies from the United States [] and the United Kingdom [] demonstrate an increase in DCIS and invasive breast cancer incidence since the 1970s, attributable to the widespread adoption of both postmenopausal hormone therapy and screening mammography. In the last decade, women have refrained from using postmenopausal hormones, and breast cancer incidence has declined, but not to the levels seen before the widespread use of screening mammography.[] Increasing age is the most important risk factor for most cancers. Other risk factors for breast cancer include the following: Major inheritance susceptibility.[,] Germline mutation of the and genes and other breast cancer susceptibility genes.[,] Estrogen (endogenous).[-] Menstrual history (early menarche/late menopause).[,] Hormone therapy history. Combination estrogen plus progestin hormone replacement therapy. Personal history of benign breast disease (BBD) (proliferative forms of BBD).[-] Age-specific risk estimates are available to help counsel and design screening strategies for women with a family history of breast cancer.[,] Of all women with breast cancer, 5% to 10% may have a germline mutation of the genes and .[] Specific mutations of and are more common in women of Jewish ancestry.[] The estimated lifetime risk of developing breast cancer for women with and mutations is 40% to 85%. Carriers with a history of breast cancer have an increased risk of contralateral disease that may be as high as 5% per year.[] Male mutation carriers also have an increased risk of breast cancer.[] Mutations in either the or the gene also confer an increased risk of ovarian cancer [,] or other primary cancers.[,] Once a or mutation has been identified, other family members can be referred for genetic counseling and testing.[-] (Refer to the PDQ summaries on ; ; and for more information.) (Refer to the PDQ summary on for more information about factors that increase the risk of breast cancer.) Protective factors and interventions to reduce the risk of female breast cancer include the following: Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs).[] Risk-reducing oophorectomy or ovarian ablation.[-] (Refer to the PDQ summary on for more information about factors that decrease the risk of breast cancer.) Clinical trials have established that screening asymptomatic women using mammography, with or without clinical breast examination, decreases breast cancer mortality. (Refer to the PDQ summary on for more information.) When breast cancer is suspected, patient management generally includes the following: The following tests and procedures are used to diagnose breast cancer: Breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), if clinically indicated. Pathologically, breast cancer can be a multicentric and bilateral disease. Bilateral disease is somewhat more common in patients with infiltrating lobular carcinoma. At 10 years after diagnosis, the risk of a primary breast cancer in the contralateral breast ranges from 3% to 10%, although endocrine therapy decreases that risk.[-] The development of a contralateral breast cancer is associated with an increased risk of distant recurrence.[] When / mutation carriers were diagnosed before age 40 years, the risk of a contralateral breast cancer reached nearly 50% in the ensuing 25 years.[,] Patients who have breast cancer will undergo bilateral mammography at the time of diagnosis to rule out synchronous disease. To detect either recurrence in the ipsilateral breast in patients treated with breast-conserving surgery or a second primary cancer in the contralateral breast, patients will continue to have regular breast physical examinations and mammograms. The role of MRI in screening the contralateral breast and monitoring women treated with breast-conserving therapy continues to evolve. Because an increased detection rate of mammographically occult disease has been demonstrated, the selective use of MRI for additional screening is occurring more frequently despite the absence of randomized, controlled data. Because only 25% of MRI-positive findings represent malignancy, pathologic confirmation before treatment is recommended. Whether this increased detection rate will translate into improved treatment outcome is unknown.[-] Breast cancer is commonly treated by various combinations of surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and hormone therapy. Prognosis and selection of therapy may be influenced by the following clinical and pathology features (based on conventional histology and immunohistochemistry):[] Estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) status of the tumor. Human epidermal growth factor type 2 receptor (HER2/neu) overexpression and/or amplification. Histologic type. Breast cancer is classified into a variety of histologic types, some of which have prognostic importance. Favorable histologic types include mucinous, medullary, and tubular carcinomas.[-] The use of molecular profiling in breast cancer includes the following:[] Gene profile testing by microarray assay or reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (e.g., MammaPrint, Oncotype DX). On the basis of ER, PR, and HER2/neu results, breast cancer is classified as one of the following types: ER, PR, and HER2 status are important in determining prognosis and in predicting response to endocrine and HER2-directed therapy. The American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of American Pathologists consensus panel has published guidelines to help standardize the performance, interpretation, and reporting of assays used to assess the ER-PR status by immunohistochemistry and HER2 status by immunohistochemistry and hybridization.[,] The first gene profile test to be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration was the MammaPrint gene signature. The 70-gene signature classifies tumors into high- and low-risk prognostic categories. [-] The aim of the (NCT00433589) trial (see below) is to determine the clinical usefulness and patient benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy . The Oncotype DX 21 gene assay is the gene profile test with the most extensive clinical validation thus far and applies to hormone receptor–positive breast cancer. A 21-gene recurrence score is generated based on the level of expression of each of the 21 genes: The following trials describe the prognostic and predictive value of multigene assays in early breast cancer: The prognostic ability of the Oncotype DX 21-gene assay was assessed in two randomized trials. The National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project () trial randomly assigned patients to receive tamoxifen or placebo; the results favoring tamoxifen changed clinical practice in the late 1980s.[] Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue was available for 668 patients. The 10-year distant recurrence risk for patients treated with tamoxifen was 7% for those with a low recurrence score, 14% for those with an intermediate recurrence score, and 31% for those with high recurrence score ( < .001).[] A community-based, case-control study examined the prognostic ability of the recurrence score to predict breast cancer deaths after 10 years in a group of tamoxifen-treated patients and observed a similar prognostic pattern to that seen in patients from NSABP B-14.[] The use of Oncotype Dx to predict benefit from chemotherapy in patients with node-negative, ER-positive breast cancer was initially assessed in a prospective-retrospective way using the tamoxifen alone (n = 227) and the combination arms (n = 424) of the trial.[] Patients in the NSABP B-20 trial were randomly assigned to receive tamoxifen alone or tamoxifen concurrently with methotrexate and fluorouracil (MF) or cyclophosphamide with MF (CMF).[] The 10-year distant disease-free survival (DFS) improved from 60% to 88% by adding chemotherapy to tamoxifen in the high-risk group, while no benefit was observed in the low recurrence score group.[] Similar findings were reported in the prospective-retrospective evaluation of the Southwestern Oncology Group trial in hormone receptor–positive lymph node-positive postmenopausal patients treated with tamoxifen with or without cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil.[] However, the sample size in this analysis was small, follow-up was only 5 years, and the prognostic impact of having positive nodes needs to be taken into consideration. Of note, both analyses (NSABP B-20 and S8814) were underpowered for any conclusive predictive analysis among patients identified as having an intermediate recurrence score. Results from the prospective, randomized (NCT00310180) trial indicate that chemotherapy is unlikely to provide substantial benefit to patients older than 50 years with ER-PR–positive and node-negative disease and a recurrence score of 11 to 25.[] In this study, a low-risk score was defined as less than 11, an intermediate score was 11 to 25, and a high-risk score was greater than 25. These cut points differ from those described above. Patients in this study with a low-risk score were found to have very low rates of recurrence at 5 years with endocrine therapy.[] Rate of invasive DFS was 93.8% at 5 years and 84.0% at 9 years. Rate of freedom from recurrence of breast cancer at a distant site was 99.3% at 5 years and 96.8% at 9 years. Rate of freedom from recurrence of breast cancer at a distant or local-regional site was 98.7% at 5 years and 95.0% at 9 years. Rate of overall survival (OS) was 98.0% at 5 years and 93.7% at 9 years. In the middle-risk group in the TAILORx study (recurrence score, 11–25), 6,907 women were randomly assigned to endocrine therapy alone or endocrine therapy plus chemotherapy.[] Of these, 3,399 women on the endocrine therapy-alone arm and 3,312 women on the endocrine therapy-plus-chemotherapy arm were available for an analysis according to the randomized treatment assignments. After a median follow-up of 90 months, the difference in invasive DFS, the main study endpoint, met the prespecified noninferiority criterion ( > .10 for a test of no difference after 835 events had occurred) suggesting the noninferiority of endocrine therapy compared with endocrine therapy plus chemotherapy. In this population, the 9-year invasive DFS was 83.3% for endocrine therapy alone and 84.3% for endocrine therapy plus chemotherapy (hazard ratio [HR], 1.08; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.94–1.24; = .26).[][] One hundred eighty-five patients in the endocrine-only arm received chemotherapy, and 608 patients in the endocrine therapy-plus-chemotherapy arm did not receive their assigned chemotherapy. In an analysis based on the actual treatment received, the HR for invasive DFS was 1.14 (95% CI, 0.99–1.31; =.06). Outcomes for the other endpoints examined (freedom of distant breast cancer recurrence, freedom from local and distant recurrence, and OS) were similar between the two treatment arms and none were significant at < 0.10. There was a significant interaction between treatment assignment and age ( = .03) with respect to invasive DFS, suggesting that chemotherapy might be beneficial in women younger than 50 years with recurrence scores ranging from 11 to 25. A secondary analysis of TAILORx demonstrated that integration of clinical risk (assessed by tumor size and grade) adds prognostic information to the recurrence score in women with a recurrence score of at least 11; however, clinical risk was not predictive of a chemotherapy benefit.[] The interaction between age and chemotherapy benefit was further explored in this secondary analysis. Among women aged 50 years or younger, rates of distant recurrence were lower with chemotherapy in the setting of recurrence scores of 16 to 20 and high clinical risk; and in the setting of recurrence scores of 21 to 25, regardless of clinical risk. The majority of women received tamoxifen as their endocrine therapy. It is not certain if any of the observed benefits of chemotherapy are attributable to ovarian function suppression and if they could be achieved through endocrine therapy. The (NCT00433589) trial tested whether adding MammaPrint genomic risk to a clinical-risk classification (modified from Adjuvant! Online) might guide more appropriate choices of chemotherapy in women with node negative- or 1-to-3 node-positive disease.[][] Unlike the TAILORx study, which only had hormone receptor–positive patients, this trial included hormone receptor–negative patients. In this prospective study, women with both genomic and clinical high-risk classification received chemotherapy, while those with both genomic and clinical low-risk classification did not receive chemotherapy. Participants with discordant results (clinical high-risk- with genomic low-risk classification, or clinical low-risk- with genomic high-risk classification) were randomly assigned to receive or not receive chemotherapy. A total of 1,550 women with high clinical risk and low genomic risk, and 592 women with low clinical risk and high genomic risk, were randomly assigned to receive or not receive chemotherapy. The primary goal of the study was to determine whether patients with high clinical risk, but low genomic risk, who did not receive chemotherapy had a 5-year survival rate without distant metastases (primary study endpoint) of 92% or lower (a noninferiority design). This endpoint was met because the observed rate in the group was 94.7% (95% CI, 92.5%–96.2%). However, among patients with high clinical risk but low genomic risk, the rate of 5-year survival without distant metastases was 1.5% higher in the arm that did receive chemotherapy than in the arm that did not receive chemotherapy, although the study was not powered to detect a difference between these arms (HR chemotherapy vs. no chemotherapy, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.50–1.21; = .27) Patients in the low clinical risk group with high genomic risk did well, and there was little evidence of benefit from chemotherapy in this group (5-year survival without distant metastases, 95.8% with chemotherapy vs. 95.0% without; HR, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.59–2.28; = .66). Results from the prospective, randomized (NCT01272037) trial will help to determine if there is a benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with ER-positive-, node-positive early breast cancer treated with endocrine therapy, and a recurrence score below 25. Many other gene-based assays may guide treatment decisions in patients with early breast cancer (e.g., Predictor Analysis of Microarray 50 [PAM50] Risk of Recurrence [ROR] score, EndoPredict, Breast Cancer Index). Although certain rare inherited mutations, such as those of and , predispose women to develop breast cancer, prognostic data on / mutation carriers who have developed breast cancer are conflicting. These women are at greater risk of developing contralateral breast cancer. (Refer to the Prognosis of - and -related breast cancer section of the PDQ summary for more information.) After careful consideration, patients with severe symptoms may be treated with hormone replacement therapy.

Hum Pathol 35 (9): 1051-2, 2004.  The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system provides a strategy for grouping patients with respect to prognosis. Therapeutic decisions are formulated in part according to staging categories but also according to other clinical factors such as the following, some of which are included in the determination of stage: Estrogen-receptor and progesterone-receptor levels in the tumor tissue. Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2/neu) status in the tumor. The standards used to define biomarker status are described as follows: ER expression is measured primarily by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Any staining of 1% of cells or more is considered positive for ER.[] PR expression is measured primarily by IHC. Any staining of 1% of cells or more is considered positive for PR. HER2 is measured primarily by either IHC to assess expression of the HER2 protein or by hybridization (ISH) to assess gene copy number. The American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of American Pathologists consensus panel has published guidelines for cases when either IHC or ISH testing is equivocal.[] Possible negative results: HER2/chromosome enumeration probe (CEP17) ratio <2.0 copy number <4 Possible equivocal results: (requires performing alternative ISH test to confirm equivocal or IHC if not previously performed) HER2/CEP17 ratio <2.0 copy number ≥4 but <6 Possible positive results: The AJCC has designated staging by TNM (tumor, node, metastasis) classification to define breast cancer.[] The grade of the tumor is determined by its morphologic features, such as tubule formation, nuclear pleomorphism, and mitotic count. Table 2. Definition of Primary Tumor (T) – Clinical and Pathological Reprinted with permission from AJCC: Breast, revised version. In: Amin MB, Edge SB, Greene FL, et al., eds.: . 8th ed. New York, NY: Springer, 2017, pp. 4–96. Lobular carcinoma is a benign entity and is removed from TNM staging in the , 8th ed. Rules for Classification - The anatomic TNM system is a method for coding extent of disease. This is done by assigning a category of extent of disease for the tumor (T), regional lymph nodes (N), and distant metastases (M). T, N, and M are assigned by clinical means and by adding surgical findings and pathological information to the clinical information. The documented prognostic impact of postneoadjuvant extent of disease and response to therapy warrant clear definitions of the use of the prefix and response to therapy. The use of neoadjuvant therapy does not change the clinical (pretreatment) stage. As per TNM rules, the anatomic component of clinical stage is identified with the prefix (e.g., cT). In addition, clinical staging can include the use of fine-needle aspiration (FNA) or core-needle biopsy and sentinel lymph node biopsy before neoadjuvant therapy. These are denoted with the postscripts and , respectively. Nodal metastases confirmed by FNA or core-needle biopsy are classified as macrometastases (cN1), regardless of the size of the tumor focus in the final pathological specimen. For example, if, prior to neoadjuvant systemic therapy, a patient with a 1 cm primary has no palpable nodes but has an ultrasound-guided FNA biopsy of an axillary lymph node that is positive, the patient will be categorized as cN1 (f) for clinical (pretreatment) staging and is assigned to Stage IIA. Likewise, if the patient has a positive axillary sentinel node identified before neoadjuvant systemic therapy, the tumor is categorized as cN1 (sn) (Stage IIA). As per TNM rules, in the absence of pathological T evaluation (removal of the primary tumor), which is identified with prefix (e.g., pT), microscopic evaluation of nodes before neoadjuvant therapy, even by complete removal such as sentinel node biopsy, is still classified as clinical (cN). Paget disease of the nipple NOT associated with invasive carcinoma and/or DCIS in the underlying breast parenchyma. Carcinomas in the breast parenchyma associated with Paget disease are categorized based on the size and characteristics of the parenchymal disease, although the presence of Paget disease should still be noted. Tumor >1 mm but ≤5 mm in greatest dimension (round any measurement >1.0–1.9 mm to 2 mm). Tumor of any size with direct extension to the chest wall and/or to the skin (ulceration or macroscopic nodules); invasion of the dermis alone does not qualify as T4. Extension to the chest wall; invasion or adherence to pectoralis muscle in the absence of invasion of chest wall structures does not qualify as T4. Ulceration and/or ipsilateral macroscopic satellite nodules and/or edema (including peau d'orange) of the skin that does not meet the criteria for inflammatory carcinoma. Inflammatory carcinoma (see Rules for Classification). Table 3. Definition of Regional Lymph Nodes – Clinical (cN) Reprinted with permission from AJCC: Breast, revised version. In: Amin MB, Edge SB, Greene FL, et al., eds.: . 8th ed. New York, NY: Springer, 2017, pp. 4–96. (sn) and (f) suffixes should be added to the N category to denote confirmation of metastasis by sentinel node biopsy or fine-needle aspiration/core needle biopsy, respectively. The cNX category is used sparingly in cases where regional lymph nodes have previously been surgically removed or where there is no documentation of physical examination of the axilla. cN1mi is rarely used but may be appropriate in cases where sentinel node biopsy is performed before tumor resection, most likely to occur in cases treated with neoadjuvant therapy. Regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed (e.g., previously removed). No regional lymph node metastases (by imaging or clinical examination). Metastases to movable ipsilateral Level I, II axillary lymph nodes(s). Micrometastases (approximately 200 cells, >0.2 mm, but ≤2.0 mm). Metastases in ipsilateral Level I, II axillary lymph nodes that are clinically fixed or matted; in ipsilateral internal mammary nodes in the absence of axillary lymph node metastases. Metastases in ipsilateral Level I, II axillary lymph nodes fixed to one another (matted) or to other structures. Metastases only in ipsilateral internal mammary nodes in the absence of axillary lymph node metastases. Metastases in ipsilateral infraclavicular (Level Ill axillary) lymph node(s) with or without Level l, II axillary lymph node involvement; in ipsilateral internal mammary lymph node(s) with Level l, II axillary lymph node metastases; metastases in ipsilateral supraclavicular lymph node(s) with or without axillary or internal mammary lymph node involvement. Metastases in ipsilateral infraclavicular lymph node(s). Metastases in ipsilateral internal mammary lymph node(s) and axillary lymph node(s). Metastases in ipsilateral supraclavicular lymph node(s).

(sn) and (f) suffixes should be added to the N category to denote confirmation of metastasis by sentinel node biopsy or fine-needle aspiration/core needle biopsy, respectively, with NO further resection of nodes. Regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed (e.g., not removed for pathological study or previously removed). No regional lymph node metastasis identified or ITCs only. ITCs only (malignant cell clusters ≤0.2 mm) in regional lymph node(s). Positive molecular findings by RT-PCR; no ITCs detected.

The Anatomic Stage Group table is used in regions of the world where tumor grading and/or biomarker testing for ER, PR, and HER2 are not routinely available. (Refer to .) Clinical Prognostic Stage Group. The Clinical Prognostic Stage Group table is used for all patients in the United States. Patients who have neoadjuvant therapy as their initial treatment should have the clinical prognostic stage and the observed degree of response to treatment recorded, but these patients are not assigned a pathological prognostic stage. (Refer to .) Pathological Prognostic Stage Group. The Pathological Prognostic Stage Group table is used for all patients in the United States who have surgery as initial treatment and have pathological T and N information reported. (Refer to .) In the United States, cancer registries and clinicians must use the Clinical and Pathological Prognostic Stage Group tables for reporting. It is expected that testing is performed for grade, HER2, ER, and PR status and that results are reported for all cases of invasive cancer in the United States.

If a patient presents with M1 disease before receiving neoadjuvant systemic therapy, the stage is Stage IV and remains Stage IV regardless of response to neoadjuvant therapy. 7. Stage designation may be changed if postsurgical imaging studies reveal the presence of distant metastases, provided the studies are performed within 4 months of diagnosis in the absence of disease progression, and provided the patient has not received neoadjuvant therapy. 8. Staging following neoadjuvant therapy is denoted with a or prefix to the T and N classification. There is no anatomic stage group assigned if there is a complete pathological response (pCR) to neoadjuvant therapy, for example, ypT0, ypN0, cM0. Any T (Tis, T1, T0, T2, T3, T4; Any N = N0, N1mi, N1, N2, N3, M1) The Clinical Prognostic Stage is used for clinical classification and staging of patients in the United States with invasive breast cancer. It uses TNM information based on the patient’s history, physical examination, imaging results (not required for clinical staging), and biopsies. Table 9.

Because N1mi categorization requires evaluation of the entire node, and cannot be assigned on the basis of an fine-needle aspiration or core biopsy, N1mi can only be used with Clinical Prognostic Staging when clinical staging is based on a resected lymph node in the absence of resection of the primary cancer, such as in the situation where sentinel node biopsy is performed before receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy or endocrine therapy. 2. For cases with lymph node involvement with no evidence of primary tumor (e.g., T0, N1, etc.) or with breast ductal carcinoma (e.g.,Tis, N1, etc.), the grade, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), estrogen receptor, and progesterone receptor information from the tumor in the lymph node should be used for assigning stage group. 3. For cases where HER2 is determined to be by hybridization (fluorescence hybridization or chromogenic hybridization) testing under the 2013 American Society of Clinical Oncologists/College of American Pathologists HER2 testing guidelines, the HER2- category should be used for staging in the Pathological Prognostic Stage Group table.[,] 4.

Modified radical mastectomy (removal of the entire breast with axillary dissection of levels I and II) with or without breast reconstruction and sentinel node biopsy with or without axillary lymph node dissection for positive SLNs. Axillary node–negative breast cancer (postmastectomy): Axillary node–positive breast cancer (postmastectomy): For one to three nodes, the role of regional radiation therapy to the infra/supraclavicular nodes, internal mammary nodes, axillary nodes, and chest wall is unclear. For four or more nodes or extranodal involvement, regional radiation therapy is advised. Axillary node–negative or positive breast cancer (post–breast-conserving therapy): Therapy depends on many factors including stage, grade, molecular status of the tumor (e.g., estrogen receptor [ER], progesterone receptor [PR], human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 [HER2/neu], or triple-negative [ER-negative, PR-negative, and HER2/neu–negative] status). Adjuvant treatment options may include the following: Stages I, II, IIIA, and operable IIIC breast cancer often require a multimodal approach to treatment. The diagnostic biopsy and surgical procedure that will be used as primary treatment should be performed as two separate procedures: In many cases, the diagnosis of breast carcinoma is made by core needle biopsy. After the presence of a malignancy is confirmed by biopsy, the following surgical treatment options can be discussed with the patient before a therapeutic procedure is selected: Modified radical mastectomy (removal of the entire breast with axillary dissection of levels I and II) with or without breast reconstruction. To guide the selection of adjuvant therapy, many factors including stage, grade, and molecular status of the tumor (e.g., ER, PR, HER2/neu, or triple-negative status) are considered.[-] Selection of a local therapeutic approach depends on the following:[] Options for surgical management of the primary tumor include the following: All histologic types of invasive breast cancer may be treated with breast-conserving surgery plus radiation therapy.[] However, the presence of inflammatory breast cancer, regardless of histologic subtype, is a contraindication to breast-conserving therapy. The presence of multifocal disease in the breast and a history of collagen vascular disease are relative contraindications to breast-conserving therapy. Surgical staging of the axilla should also be performed. Survival is equivalent with any of these options, as documented in the trial of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) (EORTC-10801) [] and other prospective randomized trials.[-] Also, a retrospective study of 753 patients who were divided into three groups based on hormone receptor status (ER positive or PR positive; ER negative and PR negative but HER2/neu positive; and triple negative) found no differences in disease control within the breast in patients treated with standard breast-conserving surgery; however, there are not yet substantive data to support this finding.[] The rate of local recurrence in the breast after conservative treatment is low and varies slightly with the surgical technique used (e.g., lumpectomy, quadrantectomy, segmental mastectomy, and others). Whether completely clear microscopic margins are necessary has been debated.[-] However, a multidisciplinary consensus panel recently used margin width and ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence from a meta-analysis of 33 studies (N = 28,162 patients) as the primary evidence base for a new consensus regarding margins in stage I and stage II breast cancer patients treated with breast-conserving surgery plus radiation therapy. Results of the meta-analysis include the following:[] Positive margins (ink on invasive carcinoma or ductal carcinoma ) were associated with a twofold increase in the risk of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence compared with negative margins. More widely clear margins were not found to significantly decrease the rate of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence compared with no ink on tumor. Thus, it was recommended that the use of no ink on tumor be the new standard for an adequate margin in invasive cancer. There was no evidence that more widely clear margins reduced ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence for young patients or for those with unfavorable biology, lobular cancers, or cancers with an extensive intraductal component. For patients undergoing partial mastectomy, margins may be positive after primary surgery, often leading to re-excision. A clinical trial of 235 patients with stage 0 to III breast cancer who underwent partial mastectomy, with or without resection of selective margins, randomly assigned patients to have additional cavity shave margins resected (shave group) or not (no-shave group).[] Patients in the shave group had a significantly lower rate of positive margins than those in the no-shave group (19% vs. 34%, = .01) and a lower rate of second surgery for clearing margins (10% vs. 21%, = .02).[][] Axillary node status remains the most important predictor of outcome in breast cancer patients. Evidence is insufficient to recommend that lymph node staging can be omitted in most patients with invasive breast cancer. Several groups have attempted to define a population of women in whom the probability of nodal metastasis is low enough to preclude axillary node biopsy. In these single-institution case series, the prevalence of positive nodes in patients with T1a tumors ranged from 9% to 16%.[,] Another series reported the incidence of axillary node relapse in patients with T1a tumors treated without axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) was 2%.[][] The axillary lymph nodes are staged to aid in determining prognosis and therapy. SLN biopsy is the initial standard axillary staging procedure performed in women with invasive breast cancer. The SLN is defined as any node that receives drainage directly from the primary tumor; therefore, allowing for more than one SLN, which is often the case. Studies have shown that the injection of technetium Tc 99m-labeled sulfur colloid, vital blue dye, or both around the tumor or biopsy cavity, or in the subareolar area, and subsequent drainage of these compounds to the axilla results in the identification of the SLN in 92% to 98% of patients.[,] These reports demonstrate a 97.5% to 100% concordance between SLN biopsy and complete ALND.[-] Because of the following body of evidence, SLN biopsy is the standard initial surgical staging procedure of the axilla for women with invasive breast cancer. SLN biopsy alone is associated with less morbidity than axillary lymphadenectomy. A randomized trial of 1,031 women compared SLN biopsy followed by ALND when the SLN was positive with ALND in all patients.[][] Quality of life (QOL) at 1 year (as assessed by the frequency of patients experiencing a clinically significant deterioration in the Trial Outcome Index of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast scale) was superior in the SLN biopsy group (23% deteriorating in the SLN biopsy group vs. 35% in the ALND group; = .001). Arm function was also better in the SLN group. The National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project’s ( [NCT00003830]) multicenter, phase III trial randomly assigned women (N = 5,611) to undergo either SLN plus ALND or SLN resection alone, with ALND only if the SLNs were positive.[][] The study showed no detectable difference in overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and regional control. OS was 91.8% for SLN plus ALND versus 90.3% for SLN resection alone ( = .12). Because of the following trial results, ALND is unnecessary after a positive SLN biopsy in patients with limited SLN-positive breast cancer treated with breast conservation or mastectomy, radiation, and systemic therapy. Evidence (ALND after a positive SLN biopsy in patients with limited SLN-positive breast cancer): A multicenter, randomized clinical trial sought to determine whether ALND is required after an SLN biopsy reveals an SLN metastasis of breast cancer. This phase III noninferiority trial planned to randomly assign 1,900 women with clinical T1 or T2 invasive breast cancer without palpable adenopathy and with one to two SLNs containing metastases identified by frozen section to undergo ALND or no further axillary treatment. All patients underwent lumpectomy, tangential whole-breast radiation therapy, and appropriate systemic therapy; OS was the primary endpoint. Because of enrollment challenges, a total of 891 women out of a target enrollment of 1,900 women were randomly assigned to one of the two treatment arms.[][] At a median follow-up of 6.3 years, 5-year OS was 91.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 89.1%–94.5%) with ALND and 92.5% (95% CI, 90.0–95.1%) with SLN biopsy alone. The secondary endpoint of 5-year DFS was 82.2% (95% CI, 78.3%–86.3%) with ALND and 83.9% (95% CI, 80.2%–87.9%) with SLN biopsy alone. In a similarly designed trial, 929 women with breast tumors smaller than 5 cm and SLN involvement smaller than 2 mm were randomly assigned to ALND or no ALND.[][] Patients without axillary dissection had fewer DFS events (hazard ratio [HR], 0.78; 95% CI, 0.55–1.11). The (NCT00014612) trial studied ALND and axillary radiation therapy after identification of a positive sentinel node.[][] ALND and axillary radiation therapy provided excellent and comparable axillary control for patients with T1 or T2 primary breast cancer and no palpable lymphadenopathy who underwent breast-conserving therapy or mastectomy. The use of axillary radiation therapy was also associated with significantly less morbidity. For patients who require an ALND, the standard evaluation usually involves only a level I and II dissection, thereby removing a satisfactory number of nodes for evaluation (i.e., at least 6–10), while reducing morbidity from the procedure. For patients who opt for a total mastectomy, reconstructive surgery may be performed at the time of the mastectomy (i.e., immediate reconstruction) or at some subsequent time (i.e., delayed reconstruction).[-] Breast contour can be restored by the following: Submuscular insertion of an artificial implant (silicone- or saline-filled). If an immediate implant cannot technically be performed, a tissue expander can be inserted beneath the pectoral muscle. Saline is injected into the expander to stretch the tissues for a period of weeks or months until the desired volume is obtained. The tissue expander is then replaced by a permanent implant. (Visit the U. S. Food and Drug Administration's [] website for more information on breast implants.) Muscle flaps require a considerably more complicated and prolonged operative procedure, and blood transfusions may be required. After breast reconstruction, radiation therapy can be delivered to the chest wall and regional nodes in either the adjuvant or local recurrent disease setting. Radiation therapy after reconstruction with a breast prosthesis may affect cosmesis, and the incidence of capsular fibrosis, pain, or the need for implant removal may be increased.[] Radiation therapy is regularly employed after breast-conserving surgery. Radiation therapy is also indicated for high-risk postmastectomy patients. The main goal of adjuvant radiation therapy is to eradicate residual disease thus reducing local recurrence.[] For women who are treated with breast-conserving surgery without radiation therapy, the risk of recurrence in the conserved breast is substantial (>20%) even in confirmed axillary lymph node–negative women.[] Although all trials assessing the role of radiation therapy in breast-conserving therapy have shown highly statistically significant reductions in local recurrence rate, no single trial has demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in mortality. However, a large meta-analysis demonstrated a significant reduction in risk of recurrence and breast cancer death.[] Thus, evidence supports the use of whole-breast radiation therapy after breast-conserving surgery. Evidence (breast-conserving surgery followed by radiation therapy): A 2011 meta-analysis of 17 clinical trials performed by the Early Breast Cancer Trialists’ Collaborative Group (EBCTCG), which included over 10,000 women with early-stage breast cancer, supported whole-breast radiation therapy after breast-conserving surgery.[][] Whole-breast radiation therapy resulted in a significant reduction in the 10-year risk of recurrence compared with breast-conserving surgery alone (19% for whole-breast radiation therapy vs. 35% for breast-conserving surgery alone; relative risk (RR) = 0.52; 95% CI, 0.48–0.56) and a significant reduction in the 15-year risk of breast cancer death (21% for whole-breast radiation therapy vs. 25% for breast-conserving surgery alone; RR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.75–0.90). Regarding radiation dosing and schedule, the following has been noted: Conventional whole-breast radiation therapy is delivered to the whole breast (with or without regional lymph nodes) in 1.8 Gy to 2 Gy daily fractions over about 5 to 6 weeks to a total dose of 45 Gy to 50 Gy. A further radiation boost is commonly given to the tumor bed. Two randomized trials conducted in Europe have shown that using boosts of 10 Gy to 16 Gy reduces the risk of local recurrence from 4.6% to 3.6% at 3 years ( = .044),[][] and from 7.3% to 4.3% at 5 years ( < .001).[][] Results were similar after a median follow-up of 17.2 years.[][] If a boost is used, it can be delivered either by external-beam radiation therapy, generally with electrons, or by using an interstitial radioactive implant.[] Administering a radiation boost may, however, be associated with unfavorable quality-of-life outcomes.[] Some studies show that a shorter fractionation schedule of 42.5 Gy over 3 to 4 weeks is a reasonable alternative for some breast cancer patients. A noninferiority trial of 1,234 randomly assigned patients with node-negative invasive breast cancer analyzed locoregional recurrence rates with conventional whole-breast radiation therapy versus a shorter fractionation schedule.[] The 10-year locoregional relapse rate among women who received shorter fractionation was not inferior to conventional whole-breast radiation therapy (6.2% for a shorter fractionation schedule vs. 6.7% for whole-breast radiation therapy with absolute difference, 0.5 percentage points; 95% CI, −2.5 to 3.5).[][ Similarly, a combined analysis of the randomized United Kingdom Standardisation of Breast Radiotherapy trials (START), (START-A [ISRCTN59368779]) and START-B [ISRCTN59368779]), which collectively randomly assigned 4,451 women with completely excised invasive (pT1–3a, pN0–1, M0) early-stage breast cancer after breast-conserving surgery to receive conventional whole-breast radiation therapy dosing or shorter fractionation, revealed no difference in a 10-year locoregional relapse rate.[][] A meta-analysis that included the three trials mentioned above plus six others confirmed that differences with respect to local recurrence or cosmesis between shorter and conventional fractionation schedules were neither statistically nor clinically significant.[] Additional studies are needed to determine whether shorter fractionation is appropriate for women with higher nodal disease burden.[] Regional nodal irradiation is routinely given postmastectomy to patients with involved lymph nodes; however, its role in patients who have breast-conserving surgery and whole-breast irradiation has been less clear. A randomized trial () of 1,832 women showed that administering regional nodal irradiation after breast-conserving surgery and whole-breast irradiation reduces the risk of recurrence (10-year DFS, 82.0% vs. 77.0%; HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.61–0.94; = .01) but does not affect survival (10-year OS, 82.8% vs. 81.8%; HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.72–1.13; = .38).[][] Similar findings were reported from the EORTC trial (). Women with a centrally or medially located primary tumor with or without axillary node involvement, or an externally located tumor with axillary involvement, were randomly assigned to receive whole-breast or thoracic-wall irradiation in addition to regional nodal irradiation or not. Breast-conserving surgery was performed for 76.1% of the study population, and the remaining study population underwent mastectomy. No improvement in OS was seen at 10 years among patients who underwent regional nodal irradiation when compared with patients who did not undergo regional nodal radiation (82.3% vs. 80.7%, = .06). Distant DFS was improved among patients who underwent regional nodal irradiation when compared with patients who did not undergo regional nodal irradiation (78% vs. 75%, = .02).[][] A meta-analysis that combined the results of the two trials mentioned above found a marginally statistically significant difference in OS (HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.78–0.99; = .034; absolute difference, 1.6% at 5 years).[] Postoperative chest wall and regional lymph node adjuvant radiation therapy has traditionally been given to selected patients considered at high risk for locoregional failure after mastectomy. Patients at highest risk for local recurrence have one or more of the following:[-] Very close or positive deep margins of resection of the primary tumor. In this high-risk group, radiation therapy can decrease locoregional recurrence, even among those patients who receive adjuvant chemotherapy.[] Patients with one to three involved nodes without any of the high-risk factors are at low risk of local recurrence, and the value of routine use of adjuvant radiation therapy in this setting is unclear. Evidence (postoperative radiation therapy in patients with one to three involved lymph nodes): The 2005 EBCTCG meta-analysis of 42,000 women in 78 randomized treatment comparisons indicated that radiation therapy is beneficial, regardless of the number of lymph nodes involved.[][] For women with node-positive disease postmastectomy and axillary clearance (removal of axillary lymph nodes and surrounding fat), radiation therapy reduced the 5-year local recurrence risk from 23% to 6% (absolute gain, 17%; 95% CI, 15.2%–18.8%). This translated into a significant reduction ( = .002) in breast cancer mortality, 54.7% versus 60.1%, with an absolute gain of 5.4% (95% CI, 2.9%–7.9%). In subgroup analyses, the 5-year local recurrence rate was reduced by 12% (95% CI, 8%–16%) for women with one to three involved lymph nodes and by 14% (95% CI, 10%–18%) for women with four or more involved lymph nodes. In an updated meta-analysis of 1,314 women with axillary dissection and one to three positive nodes, radiation therapy reduced locoregional recurrence (2 [2-sided significance level] < .00001), overall recurrence (RR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.57–0.82; 2 = .00006), and breast cancer mortality (RR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.67–0.95; 2 = .01).[][] In contrast, for women at low risk of local recurrence with node-negative disease, the absolute reduction in 5-year local recurrence was only 4% ( = .002; 95% CI, 1.8%–6.2%), and there was not a statistically significant reduction in 15-year breast cancer mortality (absolute gain, 1.0%; > .1; 95% CI, -0.8%–2.8%). Further, an analysis of NSABP trials showed that even in patients with large (>5 cm) primary tumors and negative axillary lymph nodes, the risk of isolated locoregional recurrence was low enough (7.1%) that routine locoregional radiation therapy was not warranted.[] The optimal sequence of adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy after breast-conserving surgery has been studied. Based on the following studies, delaying radiation therapy for several months after breast-conserving surgery until the completion of adjuvant chemotherapy does not appear to have a negative impact on overall outcome. Additionally, initiating chemotherapy soon after breast-conserving surgery may be preferable for patients at high risk of distant dissemination. Evidence (timing of postoperative radiation therapy): In a randomized trial, patients received one of the following regimens:[][] Chemotherapy first (n = 122), consisting of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracil (5-FU), and prednisone (CMFP) plus doxorubicin repeated every 21 days for four cycles, followed by breast radiation. Breast radiation first (n = 122), followed by the same chemotherapy. With a median follow-up of 5 years, OS was 73% for the radiation-first group and 81% for the chemotherapy-first group ( = .11). The 5-year crude rate of first recurrence by site was 5% in the radiation-first group and 14% in the chemotherapy-first group for local recurrence and 32% in the radiation-first group and 20% in the chemotherapy-first group for distant or regional recurrence or both. This difference in the pattern of recurrence was of borderline statistical significance ( = .07). Further analyses revealed that differences in recurrence patterns persisted for most subgroups except for those who had either negative tumor margins or one to three positive lymph nodes. For these two subgroups, sequence assignment made little difference in local or distant recurrence rates, although the statistical power of these subgroup analyses was low. Potential explanations for the increase in distant recurrence noted in the radiation-first group are that chemotherapy was delayed for a median of 17 weeks after surgery, and that this group received lower chemotherapy dosages because of increased myelosuppression. Two additional randomized trials, though not specifically designed to address the timing of radiation therapy and adjuvant chemotherapy, do add useful information. In the NSABP-B-15 trial, patients who had undergone breast-conserving surgery received either one course of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-FU (CMF) (n = 194) followed by radiation therapy followed by five additional cycles of CMF, or they received four cycles of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC) (n = 199) followed by radiation therapy.[][] No differences in DFS, distant DFS, and OS were observed between these two arms. The International Breast Cancer Study Group trials VI and VII also varied the timing of radiation therapy with CMF adjuvant chemotherapy and reported results similar to NSABP-B-15.[] These studies showed that delaying radiation therapy for 2 to 7 months after surgery had no effect on the rate of local recurrence. These findings have been confirmed in a meta-analysis.[][] In an unplanned analysis of patients treated on a phase III trial evaluating the benefit of adding trastuzumab in HER2/neu–positive breast cancer patients, there was no associated increase in acute adverse events or frequency of cardiac events in patients who received concurrent adjuvant radiation therapy and trastuzumab.[] Therefore, delivering radiation therapy concomitantly with trastuzumab appears to be safe and avoids additional delay in radiation therapy treatment initiation. Late toxic effects of radiation therapy are uncommon and can be minimized with current radiation delivery techniques and with careful delineation of the target volume. Late effects of radiation include the following: In a retrospective analysis of 1,624 women treated with conservative surgery and adjuvant breast radiation at a single institution, the overall incidence of symptomatic radiation pneumonitis was 1.0% at a median follow-up of 77 months.[] The incidence of pneumonitis increased to 3.0% with the use of a supraclavicular radiation field and to 8.8% when concurrent chemotherapy was administered. The incidence was only 1.3% in patients who received sequential chemotherapy.[][] Controversy existed as to whether adjuvant radiation therapy to the left chest wall or breast, with or without inclusion of the regional lymphatics, was associated with increased cardiac mortality. In women treated with radiation therapy before 1980, an increased cardiac death rate was noted after 10 to 15 years, compared with women with nonradiated or right-side-only radiated breast cancer.[,-] This was probably caused by the radiation received by the left myocardium. Modern radiation therapy techniques introduced in the 1990s minimized deep radiation to the underlying myocardium when left-sided chest wall or left-breast radiation was used. Cardiac mortality decreased accordingly.[,] An analysis of the National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (SEER) data from 1973 to 1989 that reviewed deaths caused by ischemic heart disease in women who received breast or chest wall radiation showed that since 1980, no increased death rate resulting from ischemic heart disease in women who received left chest wall or breast radiation was found.[,][] Lymphedema remains a major quality-of-life concern for breast cancer patients. Single-modality treatment of the axilla (surgery or radiation) is associated with a low incidence of arm edema. In patients who receive axillary dissection, adjuvant radiation therapy increases the risk of arm edema. Edema occurs in 2% to 10% of patients who receive axillary dissection alone compared with 13% to 18% of patients who receive axillary dissection and adjuvant radiation therapy.[-] (Refer to the PDQ summary on for more information.) Radiation injury to the brachial plexus after adjuvant nodal radiation therapy is a rare clinical entity for breast cancer patients. In a single-institution study using current radiation techniques, 449 breast cancer patients treated with postoperative radiation therapy to the breast and regional lymphatics were monitored for 5.5 years to assess the rate of brachial plexus injury.[] The diagnosis of such injury was made clinically with computerized tomography (CT) to distinguish radiation injury from tumor recurrence. When 54 Gy in 30 fractions was delivered to the regional nodes, the incidence of symptomatic brachial plexus injury was 1.0%, compared with 5.9% when increased fraction sizes (45 Gy in 15 fractions) were used. One report suggested an increase in contralateral breast cancer for women younger than 45 years who received chest wall radiation therapy after mastectomy.[] No increased risk of contralateral breast cancer occurred in women aged 45 years and older who received radiation therapy.[] Techniques to minimize the radiation dose to the contralateral breast are used to keep the absolute risk as low as possible.[] The rate of second malignancy after adjuvant radiation therapy is very low. Sarcomas in the treated field are rare, with a long-term risk of 0.2% at 10 years.[] In nonsmokers, the risk of lung cancer as a result of radiation exposure during treatment is minimal when current dosimetry techniques are used. Smokers, however, may have a small increased risk of lung cancer in the ipsilateral lung.[] The (NCT00282035) trial randomly assigned 2,135 women aged 40 years or older with ductal carcinoma or node-negative breast cancer treated by breast conserving surgery to receive either external-beam accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) (38.5 Gy in ten fractions delivered twice per day over 5–8 days) or whole-breast irradiation (42.5 Gy in 16 fractions delivered once per day over 21 days, or 50 Gy in 25 fractions once per day over 35 days).[] Sixty-five ipsilateral breast tumor recurrences were observed, 37 in the APBI group, and 28 in the whole-breast irradiation group. In patients treated with APBI, the 5-year cumulative rate of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence was 2.3% (95% CI, 1.4%–3.2%) and the 8-year cumulative rate was 3.0% (95% CI, 1.9–4.0). In patients treated with whole-breast irradiation, the 5-year cumulative rate of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence was 1.7% (range, 0.9%–2.5%) and the 8-year cumulative rate was 2.8% (range, 1.8%–3.9%). The HR for APBI versus whole-breast irradiation was 1.27 (90% CI, 0.84–1.91). Thus, the upper bound of the estimated 90% CI did not exceed the noninferiority margin of 2.02. The APBI arm was associated with less short-term, but more long-term toxicity.[][] The (NCT00103181) trial randomly assigned 4,216 women to whole-breast irradiation or APBI.[] Whole-breast irradiation was delivered in 25 daily fractions of 50 Gy over 5 weeks, with or without a supplemental boost to the tumor bed, and APBI was delivered as 34 Gy of brachytherapy or 38.5 Gy of external-bream radiation therapy in 10 fractions, over 5 treatment days within an 8-day period. At a median follow-up of 10.2 years (interquartile range, 7.5–11.5), 90 (4%) of 2,089 women eligible for the primary outcome in the APBI group and 71 (3%) of 2,036 women in the whole-breast irradiation group had an ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (HR, 1.22; 90% CI, 0.94–1.58). The results did not meet the prespecified criterion for equivalence, an HR of 1.50 or less. Toxicity was not substantially different between the arms.[][] Stage and molecular features determine the need for adjuvant systemic therapy and the choice of modalities used. For example, hormone receptor (ER and/or PR)–positive patients will receive hormone therapy. HER2 overexpression is an indication for using adjuvant trastuzumab, usually in combination with chemotherapy. When neither HER2 overexpression nor hormone receptors are present (i.e., ), adjuvant therapy relies on chemotherapeutic regimens, which may be combined with investigational targeted approaches. An international consensus panel proposed a risk classification system and systemic therapy treatment options.[] This classification, with some modification, is described below: Table 11. Systemic Treatment for Early Breast Cancer by Subtype HER2 = human epidermal growth factor receptor 2; LN = lymph node; PR = progesterone receptor. Use endocrine therapy if also hormone receptor–positive May consider omitting chemotherapy plus anti-HER2 for small node-negative tumors May consider omitting chemotherapy for small node-negative tumors The selection of therapy is most appropriately based on knowledge of an individual’s risk of tumor recurrence balanced against the short-term and long-term risks of adjuvant treatment. This approach allows clinicians to help individuals determine if the gains anticipated from treatment are reasonable for their situation. The treatment options described below should be modified based on both patient and tumor characteristics. Table 12. Adjuvant Systemic Treatment Options for Women With Stages I, II, IIIA, and Operable IIIC Breast Cancer ER = estrogen receptor; PR = progesterone receptor. Premenopausal, hormone receptor–positive (ER or PR) Ovarian function suppression plus aromatase inhibitor Premenopausal, hormone receptor–negative (ER or PR) Postmenopausal, hormone receptor–positive (ER or PR) Upfront aromatase inhibitor therapy or tamoxifen followed by aromatase inhibitor with or without chemotherapy Postmenopausal, hormone receptor–negative (ER or PR) Adjuvant chemotherapy 1970s to 2000: Anthracycline-based regimens versus cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-FU (CMF) The EBCTCG meta-analysis analyzed 11 trials that began from 1976 to 1989 in which women were randomly assigned to receive regimens containing anthracyclines (e.g., doxorubicin or epirubicin) or CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-FU). The result of the overview analysis comparing CMF and anthracycline-containing regimens suggested a slight advantage for the anthracycline regimens in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women.[] The EBCTCG overview analysis directly compared anthracycline-containing regimens (mostly 6 months of 5-FU, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide [FEC] or fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide [FAC]) with CMF (either PO or intravenous [IV]) in approximately 14,000 women, 64% of whom were younger than 50 years.[] Compared with CMF, anthracycline-based regimens were associated with a modest but statistically significant 11% proportional reduction in the annual risk of disease recurrence, and a 16% reduction in the annual risk of death. In each case, the absolute difference in outcomes between anthracycline-based and CMF-type chemotherapy was about 3% at 5 years and 4% at 10 years.[][] Of note, few women older than 70 years were studied, and specific conclusions could not be reached for this age group. Importantly, these data were derived from clinical trials in which patients were not selected for adjuvant therapy according to hormone-receptor status, and the trials were initiated before the advent of taxane-containing, dose-dense, or trastuzumab-based therapy.[] As a result, the data may not reflect treatment outcomes based on evolving treatment patterns. Study results suggest that tumor characteristics (i.e., node-positive breast cancer with HER2/neu overexpression) may predict anthracycline-responsiveness. Evidence (anthracycline-based regimen in women with HER2/neu amplification): Data from retrospective analyses of randomized clinical trials suggest that, in patients with node-positive breast cancer, the benefit from standard-dose versus lower-dose adjuvant cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and 5-FU (CAF),[] or the addition of doxorubicin to the adjuvant regimen,[] is restricted to those patients whose tumors overexpress HER2/neu.[] A retrospective analysis of the HER2/neu status of 710 premenopausal, node-positive women was undertaken to see the effects of adjuvant chemotherapy with CMF or cyclophosphamide, epirubicin, and 5-FU(CEF).[][] HER2/neu was measured using fluorescence hybridization, polymerase chain reaction, and immunohistochemical methods. The study confirmed previous data indicating that the amplification of HER2/neu was associated with a decrease in relapse-free survival (RFS) and OS. In patients with HER2/neu amplification, the RFS and OS were increased by CEF. In the absence of HER2/neu amplification, CEF and CMF were similar with regard to RFS (HR for relapse, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.71–1.18; = .049) and OS (HR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.83–1.44; = .68). Similar results were seen in a meta-analysis that included 5,354 patients in whom HER2 status was known from eight randomized trials (including the one just described) comparing anthracycline-containing regimens with non–anthracycline-containing regimens.[] Adjuvant chemotherapy 2000s to present: The role of adding taxanes to adjuvant therapy Several trials have addressed the benefit of adding a taxane (paclitaxel or docetaxel) to an anthracycline-based adjuvant chemotherapy regimen for women with node-positive breast cancer. Evidence (adding a taxane to an anthracycline-based regimen): A literature-based meta-analysis of 13 studies demonstrated that the inclusion of a taxane improved both DFS and OS (DFS: HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.79–0.87; < .001; OS: HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.79–0.91; < .001).[][] Five-year absolute survival differences were 5% for DFS and 3% for OS in favor of taxane-containing regimens. There were no differences in benefit observed in patient subsets defined by nodal status, hormone-receptor status, or age and menopausal status. There was also no apparent difference in efficacy between the two agents. However, none of the studies that were reviewed involved a direct comparison between paclitaxel and docetaxel. A U.S. intergroup study (CLB-9344 [NT00897026]) randomly assigned women with node-positive tumors to three dose levels of doxorubicin (60, 75, and 90 mg/m) and a fixed dose of cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m) every 3 weeks for four cycles. After AC (doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide) chemotherapy, patients were randomly assigned for a second time to receive paclitaxel (175 mg/m) every 3 weeks for four cycles or no further therapy, and women with hormone receptor-positive tumors also received tamoxifen for 5 years.[][] Although the dose-escalation of doxorubicin was not beneficial, the addition of paclitaxel resulted in statistically significant improvements in DFS (5%) and OS (3%). The NSABP-B-28 (NCT01420185) trial randomly assigned 3,060 women with node-positive breast cancer to receive four cycles of postoperative AC or four cycles of AC followed by four cycles of paclitaxel. Women younger than 50 years with receptor-positive disease and all women older than 50 years received tamoxifen.[][] DFS was significantly improved by the addition of paclitaxel (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.72–0.96; = .006; 5-year DFS, 76% vs. 72%). The difference in OS was small (HR, 0.93), however, and not statistically significant ( = .46). In the Breast Cancer International Research Group's trial (BCIRG-001), the FAC regimen was compared with the docetaxel plus doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (TAC) regimen in 1,491 women with node-positive disease. Six cycles of either regimen were given as adjuvant postoperative therapy.[,][] There was a 75% DFS rate at 5 years in the TAC group compared with a 68% DFS rate in the FAC group ( = .001). TAC was associated with a 30% overall lower risk of death (5% absolute difference) than was FAC (HR, 0.70; 98% CI, 0.53–0.91; < .008). Anemia, neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, and infections were more common in the TAC group. No deaths were associated with infections in either group. (Refer to the PDQ summary on for information on anemia.) An Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group–led intergroup trial ( [NCT00004125]) involving 4,950 patients compared, in a factorial design, two schedules (weekly and every 3 weeks) of the two drugs (docetaxel vs. paclitaxel) after standard-dose AC chemotherapy given every 3 weeks.[][] Study findings include the following: There was no difference observed in the overall comparison with regard to DFS of docetaxel to paclitaxel (odds ratio [OR], 1.03; 95% CI, 0.91–1.16; = .61) or between the 1-week and 3-week schedules (OR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.94–1.20; = .33). There was a significant association between the drug administered and schedule for both DFS (0.003) and OS (0.01). Thus, compared with paclitaxel given every 3 weeks, paclitaxel given weekly improved both DFS (OR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.01–1.57; = .006) and OS (OR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.02–1.72; = .01). Docetaxel given every 3 weeks was also superior in DFS to paclitaxel given every 3 weeks (OR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.00–1.52; = .02), but the difference was not statistically significant for OS (OR, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.88–1.46; = .25). Docetaxel given weekly was not superior to paclitaxel given every 3 weeks. There was no stated basis for expecting that varying the schedule of administration would have opposite effects for the two drugs. Historically, adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer was given on an every 3-week schedule. Studies sought to determine whether decreasing the duration between chemotherapy cycles could improve clinical outcomes. The overall results of these studies support the use of dose-dense chemotherapy for women with HER2-negative breast cancer. Evidence (administration of dose-dense chemotherapy in women with HER2-negative breast cancer): A U.S. intergroup trial ( [NCT00003088]) of 2,005 node-positive patients compared, in a 2 × 2 factorial design, the use of concurrent AC followed by paclitaxel with sequential doxorubicin, paclitaxel, and cyclophosphamide given every 2 weeks with filgrastim or every 3 weeks.[][] At a median follow-up of 68 months, dose-dense treatment improved DFS, the primary end point, in all patient populations (HR, 0.80; = .018), but not OS (HR, 0.85; = .12).[][] There was no interaction between density and sequence. Severe neutropenia was less frequent in patients who received the dose-dense regimens.[][] An Italian trial () compared two versus three weekly doses of epirubicin plus cyclophosphamide (with or without 5-FU) in a factorial design, with a result similar to a U.S. intergroup trial; however, this trial also demonstrated a difference in OS.[] For the dose-density comparison, DFS at 5 years was 81% (95% CI, 79–84) in patients treated every 2 weeks and 76% (95% CI, 74–79) in patients treated every 3 weeks (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.65–0.92; = .004). OS rates at 5 years were 94% (95% CI, 93–96) and 89% (95% CI, 87–91; HR, 0.65; 0.51–0.84; = .001).[][] A meta-analysis of dose-dense versus standard dosing included data from eight trials including 17,188 patients.[] The patients who received dose-dense chemotherapy had better OS (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.79–0.93; = .0001) and DFS (HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.77–0.91; < .0001) than those on the conventional schedule. A statistically significant OS benefit was observed in patients with ER-negative tumors (HR, 0.8; = .002) but not in those with ER-positive breast cancer (HR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.82–1.05; = .25). A meta-analysis of 26 randomized trials that included 37,298 women treated with anthracycline- and taxane-containing chemotherapy compared standard regimens (administered every 3–4 weeks) with more dose-intense regimens. Regimens that increased dose intensity by shortening the interval between cycles (i.e., dose-dense therapy or administration of the same dose over a shorter time period) and regimens that increased dose intensity by administering individual drugs in sequence to allow for higher doses (i.e., sequential scheduling).[] Patients who received more dose-intense regimens had superior recurrence-free survival (28.0% vs. 31.4%; RR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.82–0.89; < .0001) and OS (18.9% vs. 21.3%; RR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.83–0.92; < .0001) at 10 years. The difference was present and statistically significant in receptor-positive and receptor-negative subgroups. A randomized, phase III, double-blinded study () demonstrated noninferiority for the duration of severe neutropenia of a biosimilar filgrastim, EP2006, compared with the U.S.-licensed product.[][] Docetaxel and cyclophosphamide is an acceptable adjuvant chemotherapy regimen. The regimen of docetaxel and cyclophosphamide (TC) compared with AC (doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide) was studied in 1,016 women with stage I or stage II invasive breast cancer. Patients were randomly assigned to receive four cycles of either TC or AC as adjuvant postoperative therapy.[,][] At 7 years, the DFS and OS demonstrated that four cycles of TC were superior to standard AC for both DFS and OS.[] DFS was significantly superior for TC compared with AC (81% vs. 75%, HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.56–0.98; = .033). OS was significantly superior for TC compared with AC (87% vs. 82%, HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.50–0.97; = .032). Patients had fewer cardiac-related toxic effects with TC than with AC, but they had more myalgia, arthralgia, edema, and febrile neutropenia.[] The optimal time to initiate adjuvant therapy is uncertain. A retrospective, observational study has reported the following: A single-institution study of early-stage breast cancer patients diagnosed between 1997 and 2011 revealed that delays in initiation of adjuvant chemotherapy adversely affected survival outcomes.[][] Initiation of chemotherapy 61 days or more after surgery was associated with adverse outcomes among patients with stage II breast cancer (distant relapse-free survival: HR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.02–1.43) and stage III breast cancer (OS: HR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.26–2.46; RFS: HR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.01–1.76; and distant relapse-free survival: HR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.02–1.80). Patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) tumors and those with HER2-positive tumors treated with trastuzumab who started chemotherapy 61 days or more after surgery had worse survival (TNBC: HR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.09–2.18; HER2-positive: HR, 3.09; 95% CI, 1.49–6.39) than did those who initiated treatment in the first 30 days after surgery. Because of the weaknesses and limitations of this study design, the optimal time to initiate adjuvant chemotherapy remains uncertain. Adjuvant chemotherapy is associated with several well-characterized toxic effects that vary according to the individual drugs used in each regimen. Common toxic effects include the following: Less common, but serious, toxic effects include the following: (Refer to the PDQ summary on ; for information on mucositis, refer to the PDQ summary on Oral Complications of Chemotherapy and Head/Neck Radiation; for information on symptoms associated with premature menopause, refer to the PDQ summary on .) The use of anthracycline-containing regimens, however—particularly those containing an increased dose of cyclophosphamide—has been associated with a cumulative risk of developing acute leukemia of 0.2% to 1.7% at 5 years.[,] This risk increases to more than 4% in patients receiving high cumulative doses of both epirubicin (>720 mg/m) and cyclophosphamide (>6,300 mg/m).[] Cognitive impairment has been reported to occur after the administration of some chemotherapy regimens.[] However, data on this topic from prospective, randomized studies are lacking. The EBCTCG meta-analysis revealed that women who received adjuvant combination chemotherapy did have a 20% (standard deviation = 10) reduction in the annual odds of developing contralateral breast cancer.[] This small proportional reduction translated into an absolute benefit that was marginally statistically significant, but indicated that chemotherapy did not increase the risk of contralateral disease. In addition, the analysis showed no statistically significant increase in deaths attributed to other cancers or to vascular causes among all women randomly assigned to receive chemotherapy. For HER2/neu–negative breast cancer, there is no single adjuvant chemotherapy regimen that is considered standard or superior to another. Preferred regimen options vary by institution, geographic region, and clinician. Some of the most important data on the benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy came from the EBCTCG, which reviews data from global breast cancer trials every 5 years. In the 2011 EBCTCG meta-analysis, adjuvant chemotherapy using an anthracycline-based regimen compared with no treatment revealed significant improvement in the risk of recurrence (RR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.68–0.79), significant reduction in breast cancer mortality (RR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.72–0.85), and significant reduction in overall mortality (RR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.78–0.91), which translated into an absolute survival gain of 5%.[] TNBC is defined as the absence of staining for ER, PR, and HER2/neu. TNBC is insensitive to some of the most effective therapies available for breast cancer treatment including HER2-directed therapy such as trastuzumab and endocrine therapies such as tamoxifen or the aromatase inhibitors. Combination cytotoxic chemotherapy administered in a dose-dense or metronomic schedule remains the standard therapy for early-stage TNBC.[] Evidence (neoadjuvant chemotherapy on a dose-dense or metronomic schedule for TNBC): A prospective analysis studied 1,118 patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy at a single institution, of whom 255 (23%) had TNBC.[][] The study observed that patients with TNBC had higher pathologic complete response (pCR) rates than did non-TNBC patients (22% vs. 11%; = .034). Improved pCR rates may be important because in some studies, pCR is associated with improved long-term outcomes. Platinum agents have emerged as drugs of interest for the treatment of TNBC. However, there is no established role for adding them to the treatment of early-stage TNBC outside of a clinical trial. One trial that treated 28 women with stage II or stage III TNBC with four cycles of neoadjuvant cisplatin resulted in a 22% pCR rate.[][] A randomized clinical trial, (NCT00861705), evaluated the benefit of carboplatin added to paclitaxel and doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting. The (NCT00532727) is evaluating carboplatin versus docetaxel in the metastatic setting. These trials will help to define the role of platinum agents for the treatment of TNBC. Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor agents The PARP inhibitors are being evaluated in clinical trials for patients with mutations and in TNBC.[] PARPs are a family of enzymes involved in multiple cellular processes, including DNA repair. Because TNBC shares multiple clinicopathologic features with -mutated breast cancers, which harbor dysfunctional DNA repair mechanisms, it is possible that PARP inhibition, in conjunction with the loss of DNA repair via BRCA-dependent mechanisms, would result in synthetic lethality and augmented cell death. Treatment options for HER2-positive early breast cancer: Standard treatment for HER2-positive early breast cancer is 1 year of adjuvant trastuzumab therapy. Several phase III clinical trials have addressed the role of the anti-HER2/neu antibody, trastuzumab, as adjuvant therapy for patients with HER2-overexpressing cancers. Study results confirm the benefit of 12 months of adjuvant trastuzumab therapy. The Herceptin Adjuvant (HERA) ( [NCT00045032]) trial examined whether the administration of trastuzumab was effective as adjuvant treatment for HER2-positive breast cancer if used after completion of the primary treatment. For most patients, primary treatment consisted of an anthracycline-containing chemotherapy regimen given preoperatively or postoperatively, plus or minus locoregional radiation therapy. Trastuzumab was given every 3 weeks starting within 7 weeks of the completion of primary treatment.[][] Patients were randomly assigned to one of three study arms: Of the patients in the comparison of 1 year of trastuzumab versus observation group, the median age was 49 years, about 33% had node-negative disease, and nearly 50% had hormone receptor (ER and PR)–negative disease.[] One year of trastuzumab versus observation: After a median follow-up of 11 years,[] the finding was that 1 year of trastuzumab improved DFS (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.68–0.86; 10-year DFS, 72% vs. 66%; < .0001), despite a crossover of 52% of the patients on observation. One year of trastuzumab also improved OS (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.64–0.86; 12-year OS, 79% vs. 73%; < .0001).[][] One year versus 2 years of trastuzumab: After a median follow-up of 11 years, there was no benefit to an additional year of trastuzumab for DFS (HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.89–1.17). Symptomatic cardiac events occurred in 1% of the patients on trastuzumab and in 0.1% of the observation group. In the combined analysis of the (NCT00004067) and intergroup (NCT00005970) trials, trastuzumab was given weekly, concurrently, or immediately after the paclitaxel component of the AC with paclitaxel regimen.[,][] The HERA results were confirmed in a joint analysis of the two studies, with a combined enrollment of 3,676 patients. A highly statistically significant improvement in DFS (HR, 0.48; < .001; 3-year DFS, 87% vs. 75%) was observed, as was a significant improvement in OS (HR, 0.67; = .015; 3-year OS, 94.3% in the trastuzumab group vs. 91.7% in the control group; 4-year OS, 91.4% in the trastuzumab group vs. 86.6% in the control group).[] Patients treated with trastuzumab experienced a longer DFS, with a 52% lower risk of a DFS event (HR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.39–0.59; < .001), corresponding to an absolute difference in DFS of 11.8% at 3 years and 18% at 4 years. The risk of distant recurrence in patients treated with trastuzumab was 53% lower (HR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.37–0.61; < .001), and the risk of death was 33% lower (HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.48–0.93; = .015).[] In an updated analysis with a median follow-up of 8.4 years, the addition of trastuzumab to chemotherapy led to a 37% relative improvement in OS (HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.54–0.73; < .001) and an increase in the 10-year OS rate from 75.2% to 84%.[] In the (NCT00021255) trial, 3,222 women with early-stage HER2-overexpressing breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive AC followed by docetaxel (AC-T), AC followed by docetaxel plus trastuzumab (AC-T plus trastuzumab), or docetaxel, carboplatin, plus trastuzumab (TCH, a non–anthracycline-containing regimen).[][] A significant DFS and OS benefit was seen in both groups treated with trastuzumab compared with the control group that did not receive trastuzumab. For patients receiving AC-T plus trastuzumab, the 5-year DFS rate was 84% (HR for the comparison with AC-T, 0.64; < .001), and the OS rate was 92% (HR, 0.63; < .001). For patients receiving TCH, the 5-year DFS rate was 81% (HR, 0.75; = .04), and the OS rate was 91% (HR, 0.77; = .04). The control group had a 5-year DFS rate of 75% and an OS rate of 87%. The authors stated that there was no significant difference in DFS or OS between the two trastuzumab-containing regimens. However, the study was not powered to detect equivalence between the two trastuzumab-containing regimens. The rates of congestive heart failure (CHF) and cardiac dysfunction were significantly higher in the group receiving AC-T plus trastuzumab than in the TCH group ( < .001). These trial findings raise the question of whether anthracyclines are needed for the adjuvant treatment of HER2-overexpressing breast cancer. The group receiving AC-trastuzumab showed a small but not statistically significant benefit over TCH. This trial supports the use of TCH as an alternative adjuvant regimen for women with early-stage HER2-overexpressing breast cancer, particularly in those with concerns about cardiac toxic effects. The Finland Herceptin (FINHER) study assessed the impact of a much shorter course of trastuzumab. In this trial, 232 women younger than 67 years with node-positive or high-risk (>2 cm tumor size) node-negative HER2-overexpressing breast cancer were given nine weekly infusions of trastuzumab concurrently with docetaxel or vinorelbine followed by FEC.[][] At a 3-year median follow-up, the risk of recurrence and/or death was significantly reduced in patients receiving trastuzumab (HR, 0.41; = .01; 95% CI, 0.21–0.83; 3-year DFS, 89% vs. 78%). The difference in OS (HR, 0.41) was not statistically significant ( = .07; 95% CI, 0.16–1.08). Several studies have compared 6 months of trastuzumab administration to 12 months.[-] In an interim analysis of the (NCT00381901) trial, the 2-year DFS rate was 93.8% (95% CI, 92.6–94.9) in the 12-month group and 91.1% (89.7–92.4) in the 6-month group (HR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.05–1.56; noninferiority, = .29).[][] In the final analysis, after 704 events were observed, the adjusted HR was 1.08 (95% CI, 0.93–1.25), and the prespecified noninferiority HR of 1.15 was not excluded. Similar results were noted in a much smaller study of 481 patients led by the Hellenic Oncology Research Group.[][] In contrast, the (NCT00712140) trial, which enrolled 4,088 patients who experienced 512 DFS events at the time of analysis, excluded its prespecified noninferiority margin (HR, 1.07; 90% CI, 0.93−1.24; noninferiority, = .011).[][] The (NCT00593697) trial compared 9 weeks of trastuzumab to 1 year of trastuzumab in 2,174 women with HER-2 positive breast cancer.[] Noninferiority of the 9-week treatment could not be demonstrated for DFS (HR, 1.39; 2-sided 90% CI, 1.12−1.72).[][] Several studies have evaluated the use of subcutaneous (SQ) trastuzumab in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings. Cardiac events associated with adjuvant trastuzumab have been reported in multiple studies. Key study results include the following: In the HERA () trial, severe CHF (New York Heart Association class III–IV) occurred in 0.6% of patients treated with trastuzumab.[] Symptomatic CHF occurred in 1.7% of patients in the trastuzumab arm and 0.06% of patients in the observation arm. In the (NCT00004067) trial, 31 of 850 patients in the trastuzumab arm had confirmed symptomatic cardiac events, compared with 5 of 814 patients in the control arm.[] The 3-year cumulative incidence of cardiac events for trastuzumab-treated patients was 4.1%, compared with 0.8% of patients in the control arm (95% CI, 1.7%–4.9%). In the trial, 39 cardiac events were reported in the three arms over a 3-year period. The 3-year cumulative incidence of cardiac events was 0.35% in arm A (no trastuzumab), 3.5% in arm B (trastuzumab after paclitaxel), and 2.5% in arm C, (trastuzumab concomitant with paclitaxel). In the (BCIRG 006) (NCT00021255) trial, clinically symptomatic cardiac events were detected in 0.38% of patients in the AC/docetaxel (AC-D) arm, 1.87% of patients in the AC/docetaxel/trastuzumab (AC-DH) arm, and 0.37% of patients in the docetaxel/carboplatin/trastuzumab (DCbH) arm.[] There was also a statistically significant higher incidence of asymptomatic and persistent decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in the AC-DH arm than with either the AC-D or DCbH arms. In the FINHER trial, none of the patients who received trastuzumab experienced clinically significant cardiac events. LVEF was preserved in all of the women receiving trastuzumab, but the number of patients receiving adjuvant trastuzumab was very low.[] Lapatinib is a small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is capable of dual-receptor inhibition of both epidermal growth factor receptor and HER2. There are no data supporting the use of lapatinib as part of adjuvant treatment of early-stage HER2/neu–positive breast cancer. Evidence (against the use of lapatinib for HER2-positive early breast cancer): In the Adjuvant Lapatinib and/or Trastuzumab Treatment Optimization trial ( [NCT00553358]), the role of lapatinib (in combination with, in sequence to, in comparison with, or as an alternative to trastuzumab) in the adjuvant setting was investigated.[][] In the primary analysis, at the median follow-up of 4.5 years (range, 1 day–6.4 years), a 16% reduction in the HR for DFS was observed in the lapatinib-plus-trastuzumab arm, compared with the trastuzumab-alone arm (555 DFS events; HR, 0.84; 97.5% CI, 0.70–1.02; = .048), which was not statistically significant at the .025 significance level. The HR for DFS for the superiority comparison of trastuzumab to lapatinib versus trastuzumab alone in the intention-to-treat population was 0.96 (97.5% CI, 0.80–1.15; = .61). The 4-year OS was 95% for the lapatinib-plus-trastuzumab arm, 95% for the trastuzumab-to-lapatinib arm, and 94% for the trastuzumab-alone arm. The HR for OS was 0.80 (95% CI, 0.62–1.03; = .078) for the comparison of lapatinib plus trastuzumab versus trastuzumab alone and 0.91 (95% CI, 0.71–1.16; = .433) for the comparison of trastuzumab to lapatinib versus trastuzumab alone. The lapatinib-versus-trastuzumab component of the study was closed because, at interim analysis, the HR for DFS was 1.52 in favor of trastuzumab alone and noninferiority was excluded. Combination therapy with lapatinib and trastuzumab also resulted in worsened grade 3 diarrhea (15% vs. 1%), grade 3 rash (5% vs. 1%), and grade 3 hepatobiliary adverse events (3% vs. 1%) compared with trastuzumab alone. Pertuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to a distinct epitope on the extracellular domain of the HER2 receptor and inhibits dimerization. Its use, in combination with trastuzumab, has been evaluated in a randomized trial in the postoperative setting. The Breast Intergroup (BIG) trial enrolled 4,805 women with HER2-positive cancer cells in a blinded comparison study for 12 months of trastuzumab plus placebo versus 12 months of trastuzumab plus pertuzumab, which were given in conjunction with standard chemotherapy and hormone therapy.[] At the time of the final analysis of the primary endpoint (breast cancer, RFS), there was a significant difference in favor of the combination regimen (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.66–1.00; = .045; 3-year invasive DFS, 94.1% vs. 93.2%). There was no statistically significant difference in OS at the first interim analysis for this endpoint. Patients receiving pertuzumab had more grade 3 diarrhea (9.8% vs. 3.7%) and were more likely to develop heart failure (0.6% vs. 0.2%). Neratinib is an irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor of HER1, HER2, and HER4, which has been approved by the FDA for the extended adjuvant treatment of patients with early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer, to follow adjuvant trastuzumab-based therapy. In the (NCT00878709) trial, the safety and efficacy of 12 months of adjuvant neratinib was investigated in patients with early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer (n = 2,840) who had completed neoadjuvant trastuzumab up to 2 years before randomization. Patients received neratinib 240 mg oral daily for 1 year or a placebo.[][] After a median follow-up of 5.2 years (interquartile range, 2.1–5.3), patients in the neratinib group had significantly fewer invasive DFS events than those in the placebo group (neratinib group, 116 events vs. placebo group, 163 events; stratified HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.57–0.92; = .0083). The 5-year invasive DFS was 90.2% (95% CI, 88.3–91.8) in the neratinib group and 87.7% (85.7–89.4) in the placebo group.[] The most common grade 1 to 2 adverse events included diarrhea (neratinib, 55% vs. placebo, 34%), nausea (41% vs. 21%), fatigue (25% vs. 20%), vomiting (23% vs. 8%), and abdominal pain (22% vs. 10%). Prophylactic loperamide is recommended on the FDA label during the first 56 days of therapy, and as needed thereafter to help manage diarrhea. The most common grade 3 to 4 adverse event was diarrhea (neratinib, 40% vs. placebo, 2%). All other grade 3 to 4 adverse events occurred in 2% or less of patients. Much of the evidence presented in the following sections on therapy for women with hormone receptor–positive disease has been considered in an American Society of Clinical Oncology guideline that describes several options for the management of these patients.[] Five years of adjuvant endocrine therapy has been shown to substantially reduce the risks of locoregional and distant recurrence, contralateral breast cancer, and death from breast cancer. The optimal duration of endocrine therapy is unclear, with the preponderance of evidence supporting at least 5 years of endocrine therapy. A meta-analysis of 88 clinical trials involving 62,923 women with hormone receptor–positive breast cancer who were disease free after 5 years of endocrine therapy showed a steady risk of late recurrence 5 to 20 years after diagnosis.[][] The risk of distant recurrence correlated with the original tumor (T) and node (N) status, with risks ranging from 10% to 41%. Tamoxifen has been shown to be of benefit to women with hormone receptor–positive breast cancer. Evidence (tamoxifen for hormone receptor–positive early breast cancer): The EBCTCG performed a meta-analysis of systemic treatment of early breast cancer by hormone, cytotoxic, or biologic therapy methods in randomized trials involving 144,939 women with stage I or stage II breast cancer. An analysis published in 2005 included information on 80,273 women in 71 trials of adjuvant tamoxifen.[][] In this analysis, the benefit of tamoxifen was found to be restricted to women with hormone receptor–positive or hormone receptor–unknown breast tumors. In these women, the 15-year absolute reduction associated with 5 years of use was 12% for recurrence and 9% for mortality. Allocation to approximately 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen reduces the annual breast cancer death rate by 31%, largely irrespective of the use of chemotherapy and of age (<50 years, 50–69 years, ≥70 years), PR status, or other tumor characteristics. The meta-analysis also confirmed the benefit of adjuvant tamoxifen in hormone receptor–positive premenopausal women. Women younger than 50 years obtained a degree of benefit from 5 years of tamoxifen similar to that obtained by older women. In addition, the proportional reductions in both recurrence and mortality associated with tamoxifen use were similar in women with either node-negative or node-positive breast cancer, but the absolute improvement in survival at 10 years was greater in the node-positive breast cancer group (5.3% vs. 12.5% with 5 years of use). Similar results were found in the IBCSG-13-93 trial.[] Of 1,246 women with stage II disease, only the women with hormone receptor–positive disease benefited from tamoxifen. The optimal duration of tamoxifen use has been addressed by the EBCTCG meta-analysis and by several large randomized trials.[,-] Ten years of tamoxifen therapy has been shown to be superior to shorter durations of tamoxifen therapy. The EBCTCG meta-analysis demonstrated that 5 years of tamoxifen was superior to shorter durations. The following results were reported:[] A highly significant advantage of 5 years versus 1 to 2 years of tamoxifen with respect to the risk of recurrence (proportionate reduction, 15.2%; <.001) and a less significant advantage with respect to mortality (proportionate reduction, 7.9%; = .01) was observed. Long-term follow-up of the Adjuvant Tamoxifen Longer Against Shorter ( [NCT00003016]) trial demonstrated that 10 years of tamoxifen therapy was superior to 5 years of tamoxifen therapy. Between 1996 and 2005, 12,894 women with early breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive 10 years or 5 years of tamoxifen therapy. The following results were reported:[][] Study results revealed that 10 years of tamoxifen reduced the risk of breast cancer recurrence (617 recurrences for 10 years of tamoxifen vs. 711 recurrences for 5 years of tamoxifen; = .002), reduced breast-cancer mortality (331 deaths for 10 years of tamoxifen vs. 397 deaths for 5 years of tamoxifen; = .01), and reduced overall mortality (639 deaths for 10 years of tamoxifen vs. 722 deaths for 5 years of tamoxifen; = .01). Of note, from the time of the original breast cancer diagnosis, the benefits of 10 years of therapy were less extreme before than after year 10. At 15 years from the time of diagnosis, breast cancer mortality was 15% at 10 years and 12.2% at 5 years. Compared with 5 years, 10 years of tamoxifen therapy increased the risk of the following: Pulmonary embolus RR, 1.87; (95% CI, 1.13–3.07; = .01). Ischemic heart disease RR, 0.76; (95% CI, 0.6–0.95; = .02). Endometrial cancer RR, 1.74; (95% CI, 1.30–2.34; = .0002). Notably, the cumulative risk of endometrial cancer during years 5 to 14 from breast cancer diagnosis was 3.1% for women who received 10 years of tamoxifen versus 1.6% for women who received 5 years of tamoxifen. The mortality for years 5 to 14 was 12.2 versus 15 for an absolute mortality reduction of 2.8%. The results of the ATLAS trial indicated that for women who remained premenopausal after 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen, continued tamoxifen for 5 more years was beneficial.[] Women who have become menopausal after 5 years of tamoxifen may also be treated with AIs. (Refer to the section in the section of this summary for more information.) Because of the results of an EBCTCG analysis, the use of tamoxifen in women who received adjuvant chemotherapy does not attenuate the benefit of chemotherapy.[] However, concurrent use of tamoxifen with chemotherapy is less effective than sequential administration.[] Evidence suggests ovarian ablation alone is not an effective substitute for other systemic therapies.[-] Further, the addition of ovarian ablation to chemotherapy and/or tamoxifen has not been found to significantly improve outcomes.[,-] The largest study ( [NCT00066690]) to examine the addition of ovarian ablation to tamoxifen with or without chemotherapy randomly assigned 2,033 premenopausal women (53% of whom had received previous chemotherapy) to receive tamoxifen or tamoxifen plus ovarian suppression with triptorelin or ablation with surgery or radiation therapy.[][] Upon initial report, with a median follow-up of 5.6 years, there was no significant difference in the primary outcome of DFS (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.66–1.04; = .10); 5-year DFS was 86% in the tamoxifen-plus-ovarian-suppression group versus 84.7% in the tamoxifen-alone group. However, updated results with a median follow-up of 8 years, demonstrated improved DFS with tamoxifen plus ovarian suppression compared with tamoxifen alone (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.62–0.93, = .009); the 8-year DFS was 83.2% in the tamoxifen-plus-ovarian-suppression group versus 78.9% in the tamoxifen-alone group. In addition, OS at 8 years was improved with tamoxifen plus ovarian suppression compared with tamoxifen alone (HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.48–0.92; = .01); 8-year OS was 93.3% in the tamoxifen-plus-ovarian-suppression group versus 91.5% in the tamoxifen-alone group. Despite overall negative initial results, subgroup analysis suggested a benefit with ovarian suppression in women who underwent chemotherapy and remained premenopausal afterwards. Follow-up results at 8 years, however, did not demonstrate heterogeneity of treatment effect according to whether chemotherapy was administered, although recurrences were more frequent among patients who received chemotherapy. AIs have been compared with tamoxifen in premenopausal women in whom ovarian function was suppressed or ablated. The results of these studies have been conflicting. Evidence (comparison of an AI with tamoxifen in premenopausal women): In one study (), 1,803 women who received goserelin were randomly assigned to a 2 × 2 factorial design trial that compared anastrozole and tamoxifen, with or without zoledronic acid.[] At a median follow-up of 62 months, there was no difference in DFS (HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.81–1.44; = .59). OS was superior with tamoxifen (HR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.08–2.83; = .02). In two unblinded studies that were analyzed together ( [NCT00066703] and [NCT00066690]), exemestane was also compared with tamoxifen in 4,690 premenopausal women who underwent ovarian ablation.[] The use of exemestane resulted in a significant difference in DFS (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.67–0.90; < .001; 8-year DFS, 86.8% in the exemestane-ovarian suppression group vs. 82.8% in the tamoxifen-ovarian-suppression group).[][] The 8-year rate of freedom from distant recurrence was also higher in the exemestane-ovarian-suppression group (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.66–0.96; = .02); 8-year rate of freedom from distant recurrence was 91.8% in the exemestane-ovarian-suppression group versus 89.7% in the tamoxifen-ovarian-suppression group. Despite improvements in DFS and freedom from distant recurrence, no difference in OS was observed with the use of exemestane in combination with ovarian suppression compared with tamoxifen in combination with ovarian suppression (HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.79–1.22; = .84; 8-year OS, 93.4% in the exemestane-ovarian suppression group vs. 93.3% in the tamoxifen-ovarian-suppression group).[][] A follow-up report on the differences in QOL for the exemestane-ovarian-suppression group versus the tamoxifen-ovarian-suppression group observed the following (the differences cited below were all significant at < .001 and occurred in patients who did and did not receive chemotherapy):[] Patients who received tamoxifen plus ovarian function suppression were more affected by hot flushes and sweats over 5 years than were those who received exemestane plus ovarian function suppression, although these symptoms improved. Patients who received exemestane plus ovarian function suppression reported more vaginal dryness, greater loss of sexual interest, and difficulties becoming aroused than did patients who received tamoxifen plus ovarian function suppression; these differences persisted over time. An increase in bone or joint pain was more pronounced, particularly in the short term, in patients who received exemestane plus ovarian function suppression than in patients who received tamoxifen plus ovarian function suppression. Changes in global QOL indicators from baseline were small and similar between treatments over the 5 years.[][] In postmenopausal women, the use of AIs in sequence with or as a substitute for tamoxifen has been the subject of multiple studies, the results of which have been summarized in an individual patient-level meta-analysis.[] Evidence (AI vs. tamoxifen as initial therapy in postmenopausal women): A large, randomized trial of 9,366 patients compared the use of the AI anastrozole and the combination of anastrozole and tamoxifen with tamoxifen alone as adjuvant therapy for postmenopausal patients with lymph node-negative or lymph node-positive disease. Most (84%) of the patients in the study were hormone receptor-positive. Slightly more than 20% had received chemotherapy.[]; [][] With a median follow-up of 33.3 months, no benefit in DFS was observed for the combination arm relative to tamoxifen alone.[] Patients on anastrozole, however, had a significantly longer DFS (HR, 0.83) than those on tamoxifen. In an analysis conducted after a median follow-up of 100 months among hormone receptor-positive patients, DFS was significantly ( = .003) longer in patients on anastrozole (HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.76–0.94), but OS was not improved (HR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.86–1.11; = .7).[] Patients on tamoxifen more frequently developed endometrial cancer and cerebrovascular accidents, whereas patients on anastrozole had more fracture episodes. The frequency of myocardial infarction was similar in both groups. Except for a continued increased frequency of endometrial cancer in the tamoxifen group, these differences did not persist in the posttreatment period.[] A large, double-blinded, randomized trial of 8,010 postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer compared the use of letrozole with tamoxifen given continuously for 5 years or with crossover to the alternate drug at 2 years.[] An updated analysis from the International Breast Cancer Study Group ( [NCT00004205]) reported results on the 4,922 women who received tamoxifen or letrozole for 5 years at a median follow-up of 51 months.[][] DFS was significantly superior in patients treated with letrozole (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.71–0.95; = .007; 5-year DFS, 84.0% vs. 81.1%). OS was not significantly different in patients treated with letrozole (HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.75–1.11; = .35). In the meta-analysis, which included 9,885 women from multiple trials, the 10-year recurrence risk was 19.1% in the AI group versus 22.7% in the tamoxifen group (RR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.73–0.88; < .001). The overall 10-year mortality rate was also reduced from 24.0% to 21.3%. (RR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.8–0.97; = .01).[][] Sequential tamoxifen and AI versus 5 years of tamoxifen Several trials and meta-analyses have examined the effect of switching to anastrozole or exemestane to complete a total of 5 years of therapy after 2 to 3 years of tamoxifen.[-] The evidence, as described below, indicates that sequential tamoxifen and AI is superior to remaining on tamoxifen for 5 years. Evidence (sequential tamoxifen and AI vs. 5 years of tamoxifen): Two trials carried out in sequence by the same group enrolled a total of 828 patients and were reported together; one trial used aminoglutethimide as the AI, and the other trial used anastrozole. After a median follow-up of 78 months, an improvement in all-cause mortality (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.42–0.88; = .007) was observed in the AI groups.[][] Two other trials were reported together.[] A total of 3,224 patients were randomly assigned after 2 years of tamoxifen to continue tamoxifen for a total of 5 years or to take anastrozole for 3 years. There was a significant difference in event-free survival (EFS) (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, = .0009), but not in OS (5-year OS, 97% CI for the switched arm vs. 96% CI for the tamoxifen-alone arm; = .16).[][] A large, double-blinded, randomized trial ( [ICCG-96OEXE031-C1396-BIG9702]) (NCT00003418) of 4,742 patients compared continuing tamoxifen with switching to exemestane for a total of 5 years of therapy in women who had received 2 to 3 years of tamoxifen.[][] After the second planned interim analysis, when median follow-up for patients on the study was 30.6 months, the results were released because of a highly significant ( < .005) difference in DFS (HR, 0.68) favoring the exemestane arm.[] After a median follow-up of 55.7 months, the HR for DFS was 0.76 (95% CI, 0.66–0.88; = .001) in favor of exemestane.[][] At 2.5 years after random assignment, 3.3% fewer patients on exemestane had developed a DFS event (95% CI, 1.6–4.9). The HR for OS was 0.85 (95% CI, 0.7–1.02; = .08).[] In the meta-analysis, which included 11,798 patients from six trials, the 10-year recurrence rate was reduced from 19% to 17% in the AI-containing groups (RR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.75–0.91; = .0001). The overall 10-year mortality was 17.5% in the tamoxifen group and 14.6% in the AI-containing group (RR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.73–0.91; = .0002).[][] Sequential tamoxifen and AI for 5 years versus 5 years of an AI The evidence indicates that there is no benefit to the sequential use of tamoxifen and an AI for 5 years over 5 years of an AI. Evidence (sequential use of tamoxifen and an AI vs. 5 years of an AI): A large, randomized trial of 9,779 patients compared DFS of postmenopausal women with hormone receptor–positive breast cancer between initial treatment with sequential tamoxifen for 2.5 to 3 years followed by exemestane for a total of 5 years versus exemestane alone for 5 years. The primary endpoints were DFS at 2.75 years and 5.0 years.[][] Five-year DFS was 85% in the sequential group and 86% in the exemestane-alone group (HR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.88–1.08; = .60). Similarly in the (NCT00004205) trial, two sequential arms were compared with 5 years of letrozole.[][] There was no difference in DFS when the two sequential arms were compared with 5 years of letrozole (letrozole to tamoxifen HR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.91–1.23; = .45 and tamoxifen to letrozole HR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.92–1.25; = .36). The (NCT00541086) trial, which was not included in the meta-analysis, compared 2 years of tamoxifen followed by 3 years of one of the three AIs with 5 years of an AI. No significant difference in 5-year DFS was found between the two approaches (88.5% for switching; 89.8% for upfront AI; HR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.73–1.08; = .23).[] In the meta-analysis, which included 12,779 patients from the trials, the 7-year recurrence rate was slightly reduced from 14.5% to 13.8% in the groups that received 5 years of an AI (RR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.81–0.99; = .045). Overall mortality at 7 years was 9.3% in the tamoxifen-followed-by-AI groups and 8.2% in the AI-alone groups (RR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.78–1.03; = .11).[][] The mild androgen activity of exemestane prompted a randomized trial that evaluated whether exemestane might be preferable to anastrozole, in terms of its efficacy (i.e., EFS) and toxicity, as upfront therapy for postmenopausal women diagnosed with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.[][] The (NCT00066573) trial randomly assigned 7,576 postmenopausal women to receive 5 years of anastrozole or exemestane. At a median follow-up of 4.1 years, no difference in efficacy was seen (HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.87–1.18; = .86).[][] The two therapies also were not significantly different in terms of impact on bone mineral density or fracture rates.[][] In the Femara Versus Anastrozole Clinical Evaluation ( [NCT00248170]) study, 4,136 patients with hormone receptor-positive disease were randomly assigned to receive either letrozole or anastrozole.[] There was no significant difference in DFS (HR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.80–1.07; = .3150) at the time of a final analysis that was conducted when there were 709 of the planned 959 events. There were no substantial differences in adverse events between the arms. In the trial, 3,697 patients with HR-positive disease were randomly assigned among the three AIs either for 5 years or after 2 years of tamoxifen. No significant difference in 5-year DFS (90.0% for anastrozole, 88.0% for exemestane, and 89.4% for letrozole; = .24) was noted among the three AIs.[] The evidence, as described below, indicates that switching to an AI after 5 years of tamoxifen is superior to stopping tamoxifen at that time. A large, double-blinded, randomized trial ( [NCT00003140]) of 5,187 patients compared the use of letrozole versus placebo in receptor-positive postmenopausal women who received tamoxifen for approximately 5 years (range, 4.5–6.0) years.[][] After the first planned interim analysis, when median follow-up for patients in the study was 2.4 years, the results were unblinded because of a highly significant ( < .008) difference in DFS (HR, 0.57), favoring the letrozole arm.[] After 3 years of follow-up, 4.8% of the women on the letrozole arm had developed recurrent disease or new primaries versus 9.8% on the placebo arm (95% CI for the difference, 2.7%–7.3%). Because of the early unblinding of the study, longer-term comparative data on the risks and benefits of letrozole in this setting will not be available.[,] An updated analysis including all events before unblinding confirmed the results of the interim analysis.[] In addition, a statistically significant improvement in distant DFS was found for patients who received letrozole (HR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.43–0.84; = .002). Although no statistically significant difference was found in the total study population, the lymph node-positive patients who received letrozole also experienced a statistically significant improvement in OS (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.38–0.98; = .04), although the value was not corrected for multiple comparisons. The (NCT00016432) trial that was designed to compare 5 years of exemestane with placebo after 5 years of tamoxifen was stopped prematurely when the results of became available. At the time of analysis, 560 of the 783 patients who were randomly assigned to receive exemestane remained on that drug and 344 of the 779 patients who were randomly assigned to receive placebo had crossed over to exemestane.[][] An intent-to-treat analysis of the primary study endpoint, DFS, demonstrated a nonsignificant benefit of exemestane (HR, 0.68; = .07). The optimal duration of AI therapy is uncertain, and multiple trials have evaluated courses longer than 5 years. Evidence regarding extension of endocrine therapy beyond 5 years of initial AI-based adjuvant therapy: A double-blind, randomized, phase III trial assessed the effect of an additional 5 years of letrozole versus placebo in 1,918 women who had received 5 years of an AI.[] Patients who received previous tamoxifen therapy were included. Most women on the study (70.6%) had received 4.5 to 6 years of adjuvant tamoxifen, but a significant proportion of them (20.7%) had been treated initially with an AI. At a median follow-up of 6.3 years, DFS, the primary study endpoint, was significantly improved in patients randomly assigned to receive letrozole (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.48–0.91; = .01), and 5-year DFS was improved from 91% to 95%.[][] OS rates showed no difference (HR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.73–1.28; = .83). More patients on letrozole had fractures (14%) than did patients on placebo (9%) ( = .001). QOL was assessed with the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) and Menopause-Specific QOL (MENQOL) instruments. More than 85% of participants completed yearly assessments over a 5-year period. No between-group differences were found on the four MENQOL subscales or on the SF-36 summary score. SF-36 role-emotional and bodily pain scores were statistically significantly worse ( = .03) among patients receiving letrozole, but the differences observed were fewer than the minimum clinically important differences for the SF-36 instrument. A randomized phase III study assessed the effect of an additional 2.5 years of letrozole versus 5 years of letrozole in 1,824 women who received 5 years of an AI.[][] DFS events were similar in both groups (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.74–1.16). The distant metastasis-free interval was also similar (HR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.78–1.45). A subgroup analysis did not identify patients who benefited from 5-year extended therapy. This study did not show that 10 years of AI therapy was superior to 7.5 years of AI therapy. A phase III trial ( [NCT00382070]) randomly assigned, in a double-blind fashion, 3,966 women who received 5 years of initial adjuvant therapy with an AI or received tamoxifen for 2 to 3 years followed by an AI to receive 5 mg of letrozole or placebo for 5 additional years.[][] The planned analysis of DFS was carried out after a median follow-up of 6.9 years. The 7-year DFS was 81.3% in the placebo group and 84.7% in the letrozole group (HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.73–0.999; = .048). The observed difference was not statistically significant when interim analyses were accounted for. There were no statistically significant differences in adverse events between the arms. A phase III trial conducted by the IBCSG ( [NCT00553410]) randomly assigned 4,851 eligible receptor-positive postmenopausal women who had completed 5 years of adjuvant therapy with an AI, a selective estrogen receptor modulator, or both, to receive 2.5 mg of letrozole daily for 5 years or to an intermittent schedule in which there was a 3-month break at the end of each of the first 4 years, but not in the final year.[] There was no observed advantage to the intermittent schedule with respect to DFS (HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.93–1.26; = .31) or in the frequency of adverse events.[][] A phase III trial conducted by the Dutch Breast Cancer Study Group ( [NCT00301457]) randomly assigned 1,860 eligible receptor-positive postmenopausal women who had received 2 to 3 years of tamoxifen to receive either 3 or 6 years of anastrozole (1 mg daily).[] At 3 years, 1,660 of these women were free of disease: among them, DFS was observed to be improved, but not statistically significantly so, on the extended-therapy arm (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.62–1.02).[][] Myalgia and osteoporosis/osteopenia were more frequent on the extended-therapy arm. The phase III ABCSG-16 study, published in abstract form, enrolled 3,484 postmenopausal women with hormone receptor–positive breast cancer who had completed 5 years of endocrine therapy with tamoxifen and/or an AI to either 2 or 5 years of extended therapy with anastrozole. The primary endpoint was DFS. Secondary endpoints included OS, time to contralateral breast cancer, time to second primary cancer, fractures, and toxicity.[] After 10 years of follow-up, there was no difference in DFS between the two arms (71.1% for the 2-year course vs. 70.3% for the 5-year course [HR, 0.997; 95% CI, 0.86–1.15; = .982]). In addition, there was no difference in OS, time to second primary cancer, and time to contralateral breast cancer between the arms. There was an insignificant trend towards more fractures in the 5-year arm. Both bisphosphonates and denosumab have been evaluated as adjuvant therapies for early-stage breast cancer; however, the role of these agents as adjuvant therapy for early-stage breast cancer is unclear. Compared with denosumab, the amount of evidence supporting bisphosphonates is greater, and there is evidence supporting breast cancer mortality—an endpoint that is more clinically relevant. Evidence (bisphosphonates in the treatment of early breast cancer): A meta-analysis has been conducted that included the individual patient data of 18,766 patients from 26 adjuvant trials of bisphosphonates of any type.[] Overall, reductions associated with bisphosphonate use in recurrence (RR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.87–1.01; 2 = .08), distant recurrence (RR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.85–0.99; 2 = .03), and breast cancer mortality (RR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.83–0.99; 2 = .04) were of only borderline significance, but the reduction in bone recurrence was more definite (RR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.73–0.94; 2 = .004). In a prespecified subgroup analysis, among premenopausal women, treatment had no apparent effect on any outcome, but among 11,767 postmenopausal women, it produced highly significant reductions in recurrence (RR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.78–0.94; 2 = .002), distant recurrence (RR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.74–0.92; 2 = .0003), bone recurrence (RR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.60–0.86; 2 = .0002), and breast cancer mortality (RR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.73–0.93; 2 = .002).[] The (NCT00556374) trial randomly assigned 3,435 postmenopausal women with receptor-positive breast cancer who were receiving an AI to receive denosumab or a placebo every 6 months during AI therapy.[] The patients were unblinded when results related to bone events were reported, and patients on placebo were allowed to cross over to the active drug. In an intent-to-treat analysis according to the original assignment, DFS, a secondary endpoint, was improved in patients randomly assigned to receive denosumab (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.69–0.98; = .0260; 5-year DFS, 89.2% vs. 87.3%).[][] The frequency of adverse events was similar in the two groups. The (NCT01077154) trial randomly assigned 4,509 women with stage II or stage III breast cancer to receive denosumab or placebo.[] The primary endpoint of bone metastasis-free survival was not significantly different between the groups (median, not reached in either group; HR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.82−1.14; = .70).[][] Preoperative chemotherapy, also known as primary or neoadjuvant chemotherapy, has traditionally been administered in patients with locally advanced breast cancer to reduce tumor volume and allow for definitive surgery. In addition, preoperative chemotherapy is being used for some patients with primary operable stage II or stage III breast cancer. A meta-analysis of multiple, randomized clinical trials performed in 2005 demonstrated that preoperative chemotherapy is associated with identical DFS and OS compared with the administration of the same therapy in the adjuvant setting.[][] In 2019, the Early Breast Cancer Trialists’ Collaborative Group performed a meta-analysis using individual patient data from 4,756 women who participated in 10 trials that compared neoadjuvant chemotherapy with the same regimen given in the adjuvant setting.[] Compared with adjuvant therapy, neoadjuvant therapy was associated with an increased frequency of breast conservation (65% vs. 49%). There were no differences between neoadjuvant chemotherapy and adjuvant therapy in distant recurrence, breast cancer mortality, or death from any cause; however, neoadjuvant therapy was associated with higher 15-year local recurrence (21.4% vs. 15.9%; rate ratio, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.17−1.61; = .001).[][] Current consensus opinion for use of preoperative chemotherapy recommends anthracycline- and taxane-based therapy, and prospective trials suggest that preoperative anthracycline- and taxane-based therapy is associated with higher response rates than alternative regimens (e.g., anthracycline alone).[,][] A potential advantage of preoperative systemic therapy is the increased likelihood of success with definitive local therapy in those presenting with locally-advanced, unresectable disease. It may also offer benefit to carefully selected patients with primary operable disease by enhancing the likelihood of breast conservation and providing prognostic information where pCR is obtained. In these cases, a patient can be informed that there is a very low risk of recurrence compared with a situation in which a large amount of residual disease remains. pCR has been utilized as a surrogate endpoint for long-term outcomes, such as DFS, EFS, and OS, in preoperative clinical trials in breast cancer. A pooled analysis (CTNeoBC) of 11 preoperative randomized trials (n = 11,955) determined that pCR, defined as no residual invasive cancer in the breast and axillary nodes with presence or absence of cancer (ypT0/is ypN0 or ypT0 ypN0), provided a better association with improved outcomes compared with eradication of invasive tumor from the breast alone (ypT0/is).[] pCR could not be validated in this study as a surrogate endpoint for improved EFS and OS.[][] Because of a strong association of pCR with substantially improved outcomes in individual patients with more aggressive subtypes of breast cancer, the FDA has supported use of pCR as an endpoint in preoperative clinical trials for patients with high-risk, early-stage breast cancer. Postoperative radiation therapy may also be omitted in a patient with histologically negative axillary nodes after preoperative therapy, irrespective of lymph node status before preoperative therapy, allowing for tailoring of treatment to the individual. Potential disadvantages with this approach include the inability to determine an accurate pathological stage after preoperative chemotherapy. However, the knowledge of the presence of residual disease may provide more personalized prognostic information, as noted above. Patient selection, staging, treatment, and follow-up Multidisciplinary management of patients undergoing preoperative therapy by an experienced team is essential to optimize the following: Decision to administer adjuvant radiation therapy. The tumor histology, grade, and receptor status are carefully evaluated before preoperative therapy is initiated. Patients whose tumors have a pure lobular histology, low grade, or high hormone-receptor expression and HER2-negative status are less likely to respond to chemotherapy and should be considered for primary surgery, especially when the nodes are clinically negative. Even if adjuvant chemotherapy is administered after surgery in these cases, a third-generation regimen (anthracycline-taxane based) may be avoided. Before beginning preoperative therapy, the extent of the disease within the breast and regional lymph nodes should be assessed. Staging of systemic disease may include the following:[] Baseline breast imaging is performed when breast-conserving therapy is desired to identify the tumor location and exclude multicentric disease. Suspicious abnormalities are usually biopsied before beginning treatment and a marker placed at the center of the breast tumor(s). When possible, suspicious axillary nodes may be biopsied before initiation of systemic treatment. The optimal timing of sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy has not been established in patients receiving preoperative therapy. The following points should be considered: If suspicious lymph nodes are positive for malignancy at baseline, an SLN biopsy may be performed after preoperative therapy but is associated with a high false-negative rate. If the procedure is performed with both radiocolloid and blue dye and at least two nodes are sampled (provides 10.8% false-negative rate) and are negative, then axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) may be omitted.[][]; [][]; [][] Alternatively, it is acceptable in this circumstance to perform ALND, based on the possibility of undetected positive nodes. In patients with clinically negative nodes, SLN biopsy may be performed before preoperative therapy because of the false-negative rates observed when performed after preoperative therapy.[] If the SLN biopsy is negative, ALND can be omitted. If SLN biopsy is performed after preoperative chemotherapy, the baseline clinical and postchemotherapy pathological nodal status should be taken into consideration when deciding whether ALND is necessary. ALND is usually performed in the setting of node-positivity. When considering preoperative therapy, treatment options include the following: For HER2-negative breast tumors, an anthracycline-taxane based chemotherapy regimen. For HER2-positive disease, chemotherapy and HER2-targeted therapy. Ideally, the entire treatment regimen is administered before surgery. For postmenopausal women with hormone receptor–positive breast cancer, chemotherapy is an option. For those who cannot be given chemotherapy, preoperative endocrine therapy may be an option. For premenopausal women with hormone–responsive cancer, the use of preoperative endocrine therapy is under investigation. Regular clinical assessment of response to therapy is necessary after beginning preoperative therapy. Repeat radiographic assessment is also required if breast conservation is the surgical goal. Patients with progressive disease during preoperative therapy may either transition to a non–cross-resistant regimen or proceed to surgery, if feasible.[,] Although switching to a non–cross-resistant regimen results in a higher pCR rate than continuing the same therapy, there is no clear evidence that other breast cancer outcomes are improved with this approach. Early trials examined whether anthracycline-based regimens used in the adjuvant setting would prolong DFS and OS when used in the preoperative setting. The evidence supports higher rates of breast-conserving therapy with the use of a preoperative anthracycline chemotherapy regimen than with postoperative use, but no improvement in survival was noted with the preoperative strategy. Evidence (preoperative anthracycline-based regimen): A randomized clinical trial (NSABP-B-18) was designed to determine whether the preoperative combination of four cycles of AC would more effectively prolong DFS and OS than the same chemotherapy given in the adjuvant setting.[-][] After preoperative therapy, 36% of the patients had a complete clinical response. More patients treated with preoperative chemotherapy were able to have breast-conserving procedures as compared with those patients in the postoperative chemotherapy group (68% vs. 60%; .001). No statistically significant difference existed, however, in DFS, distant DFS, or OS in the patients who received preoperative chemotherapy as compared with those who received postoperative chemotherapy. An EORTC randomized trial (EORTC-10902) likewise demonstrated no improvement in DFS or OS but showed an increased frequency of conservative surgery with the use of preoperative versus postoperative FEC chemotherapy.[][] To improve the results observed with AC alone, a taxane was added to the chemotherapy regimen. The following study results support the addition of a taxane to an anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimen for HER2-negative breast tumors. Evidence (anthracycline-taxane–based chemotherapy regimen): In an effort to improve on the results observed with AC alone, the NSABP ( [NCT00002707]) trial was conducted.[][] The administration of preoperative AC followed by docetaxel was associated with a higher clinical complete response rate compared with the administration of AC alone (63.6% for AC followed by docetaxel and 40.1% for AC alone; < .001); a higher pCR rate was also observed (26.1% for AC followed by docetaxel and 13.7% for AC alone; < .001). Data from NSABP B-27 and the Aberdeen Breast Group Trial support the use of anthracycline-taxane–based regimens in women with initial response or with relative resistance to anthracyclines.[] Alternative anthracycline-taxane schedules have also been evaluated (concurrent TAC) and appear similar in efficacy to the sequential approach described above.[][] The phase III (NCT01583426) trial investigated an alternative taxane (nab-paclitaxel) in patients with untreated primary breast cancer.[] Patients (n = 1,229) were randomly assigned to receive 12 weeks of nab-paclitaxel or paclitaxel followed by epirubicin and cyclophosphamide (EC) for four cycles. The pCR rate was higher in the nab-paclitaxel arm (233 patients, 38%; 95% CI, 35%–42%) when compared with the paclitaxel arm (174 patients, 29%; 95% CI, 25%–33%).[][] However, in the (NCT01822314) trial that compared neoadjuvant nab-paclitaxel with paclitaxel followed by anthracycline-based therapy, no significant difference in pCR was observed, and neutropenia and peripheral neuropathy were more frequent in the nab-paclitaxel arm.[] Differences in taxane dose and schedule may explain the different findings in the GeparSepto and ETNA trials. The incorporation of many additional cytotoxic agents to anthracycline-taxane–based regimens has not offered a significant additional benefit to breast conservation or pCR rate in unselected breast cancer populations.[][] Promising results have been observed, however, with the addition of carboplatin to anthracycline-taxane combination chemotherapy regimens in patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Future definitive studies evaluating survival endpoints and the identification of biomarkers of response or resistance are necessary before the addition of carboplatin to standard preoperative chemotherapy can be considered a new standard of care. Evidence (adding carboplatin to an anthracycline-taxane–based chemotherapy regimen in patients with TNBC): In the (NCT01426880) trial, carboplatin was added to an anthracycline-taxane–based backbone.[][] Higher pCR rates were observed with the addition of carboplatin to an anthracycline-taxane–based backbone compared with anthracycline-taxane alone (36.9% vs. 53.2%; = .005) in patients with TNBC. Three-year DFS was higher for patients with TNBC randomly assigned to the carboplatin arm (86.1% vs. 75.8%; HR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.34−0.93), but OS did not differ.[] The more intensive regimen was also associated with increased toxicity and treatment discontinuations (39% vs. 48%). The (NCT00861705) trial compared an anthracycline-taxane backbone alone with an anthracycline-taxane backbone-plus-carboplatin in patients with stage II and stage III TNBC.[][] The pCR rate for the breast and axilla was 54% for the anthracycline-taxane backbone-plus-carboplatin group versus 41% for the anthracycline-taxane backbone-alone group ( = .0029) A 2018 meta-analysis of nine phase II or III randomized trials that evaluated the addition of carboplatin to various chemotherapy backbones for neoadjuvant treatment of TNBC confirmed higher pCR (pooled OR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.46−2.62; < .001), but at the expense of greater hematologic toxicity.[] Two of the nine trials reported survival outcomes and observed no difference in EFS or OS with the use of neoadjuvant carboplatin. Importantly, results of studies in the adjuvant and metastatic settings have not demonstrated an OS benefit with the addition of bevacizumab to chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone. However, the addition of bevacizumab to preoperative chemotherapy has been associated with an increased pCR rate alongside increased toxicity such as hypertension, cardiac toxicity, hand-foot syndrome, and mucositis (e.g., [NCT00408408] and [NCT00567554]).[,][] However, it is not clear that the modest benefit observed will translate into a longer term survival advantage. The randomized, double blind, phase III (NCT03036488) trial evaluated the addition of immunotherapy to neoadjuvant chemotherapy for patients with stage II and stage III TNBC.[] Participants were randomly assigned 2:1 to receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy (paclitaxel plus carboplatin followed by doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide) with either neoadjuvant and adjuvant pembrolizumab or neoadjuvant and adjuvant placebo. Co-primary endpoints were pCR rate and EFS. pCR rate, as reported at the time of the first interim analysis for the first 602 participants (pembrolizumab arm, 401; placebo arm, 201), favored the pembrolizumab arm. pCR was observed in 64.8% of patients in the pembrolizumab arm and 51.2% of patients in the placebo arm (estimated treatment difference, 13.6%; 95% CI, 5.4%−21.8%; < .001). Approximately 80% of tumors were positive for programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), but the benefits of pembrolizumab regarding pCR were observed regardless of PD-L1 status. EFS data are immature, but appear to favor pembrolizumab numerically (HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.43−0.93). Grade 3 or higher adverse events occurred in 76.8% of participants in the pembrolizumab arm and 72.2% of participants in the placebo arm. Serious treatment-related adverse events occurred in 32.5% of participants in the pembrolizumab arm and 19.5% of participants in the placebo arm. Grade 3 or higher skin rashes, infusion reactions, and adrenal insufficiency were more frequent in the pembrolizumab arm. Longer term follow-up with regard to EFS and toxicity will inform the use of pembrolizumab in the neoadjuvant treatment of TNBC. Key issues that remain to be clarified include identification of a predictive biomarker, the optimal chemotherapy backbone, and the role of adjuvant pembrolizumab after neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus pembrolizumab. After the success in the adjuvant setting, initial reports from phase II studies indicated improved pCR rates when trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody that binds the extracellular domain of HER2, was added to preoperative anthracycline-taxane–based regimens.[][] This has been confirmed in phase III studies.[,] The phase III NeOAdjuvant Herceptin (NOAH) study randomly assigned patients with HER2-positive locally advanced or inflammatory breast cancers to undergo preoperative chemotherapy with or without 1 year of trastuzumab therapy.[][] Study results confirmed that the addition of trastuzumab to preoperative chemotherapy resulted not only in improved clinical responses (87% vs. 74%) and pathologic responses (breast and axilla, 38% vs. 19%) but also in EFS, the primary outcome.[][] After a median follow-up of 5.4 years, the EFS benefit was 58% with the addition of trastuzumab to chemotherapy (95% CI, 48–66) and 43% (95% CI, 34–52) in patients in the chemotherapy group. The unadjusted HR for EFS between the two randomized HER2-positive treatment groups was 0.64 (95% CI, 0.44–0.93; two-sided log-rank = .016). EFS was strongly associated with pCR in patients who received trastuzumab.[] Symptomatic cardiac failure occurred in two patients who received concurrent doxorubicin and trastuzumab for two cycles. Close cardiac monitoring of LVEF and the total dose of doxorubicin not exceeding 180 mg/m accounted for the relatively low number of declines in LVEF and only two cardiac events. (Refer to the section in this summary for more information.)[][] Due to concern about co-administration of trastuzumab and anthracyclines, a phase III trial ( [NCT00513292]) randomly assigned patients with operable HER2-positive breast cancer to receive trastuzumab sequential to or concurrent with the anthracycline component (5-FU, epirubicin, cyclophosphamide) of the preoperative chemotherapy regimen.[][] pCR was the primary outcome. There was no significant difference in pCR rate in the breast between the arms (56.5% sequential, 54.2% concurrent; difference, 2.3% with 95% CI, -9.3–13.9). Asymptomatic declines in LVEF during preoperative chemotherapy were identified in similar proportions of patients in each arm. DFS and OS were secondary outcomes. After median follow-up of 5.1 years, there was no difference in DFS (HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.56−1.83, = .96) or OS (HR, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.48−2.88; = .73) between the sequential and concurrent arms.[] The conclusion was that concurrent administration of trastuzumab with anthracyclines is not warranted based on these findings. A subcutaneous formulation of trastuzumab has also been approved. The (NCT01566721) trial evaluated the safety and tolerability of self-administered versus clinician-administered SQ trastuzumab in stage I to stage III HER2-positive breast cancer.[] Chemotherapy was administered concurrently or sequentially. A phase III ( [NCT00950300]) trial also demonstrated that the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of preoperative SQ trastuzumab is noninferior to the IV formulation. This international, open-label trial (n = 596) randomly assigned women with operable, locally advanced, or inflammatory HER2-positive breast cancer to undergo preoperative chemotherapy (anthracycline-taxane–based), with either SQ-administered or IV-administered trastuzumab every 3 weeks before surgery. Patients received adjuvant trastuzumab to complete 1 year of therapy.[][] The pCR rates between the arms differed by 4.7% (95% CI, 4.0–13.4); 40.7% in the IV-administered group versus 45.4% in the SQ-administered group, demonstrating noninferiority for the SQ formulation. EFS and OS were secondary endpoints. Six-year EFS was 65% in both arms (HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.74−1.29). Six-year OS was 84% in both arms (HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.61−1.45).[] Newer HER2-targeted therapies (lapatinib, pertuzumab) have also been investigated. It appears that dual targeting of the HER2 receptor results in an increase in pCR rate; however, no survival advantage has been demonstrated to date with this approach.[,] Pertuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to a distinct epitope on the extracellular domain of the HER2 receptor and inhibits dimerization. Pertuzumab, in combination with trastuzumab with or without chemotherapy, has been evaluated in two preoperative clinical trials to improve on the pCR rates observed with trastuzumab and chemotherapy. In the open-label, randomized, phase II (NCT00545688) trial,[] 417 women with tumors that were larger than 2 cm or node-positive, and who had HER2-positive breast cancer, were randomly assigned to one of four preoperative regimens:[][] The pCR rates were 29% for docetaxel plus trastuzumab, 46% for docetaxel plus trastuzumab and pertuzumab, 17% for pertuzumab plus trastuzumab, and 24% for docetaxel plus pertuzumab. Therefore, the highest pCR rate was seen in the preoperative treatment arm with dual HER2 blockade plus chemotherapy. The addition of pertuzumab to the docetaxel-plus-trastuzumab combination did not appear to increase toxic effects, including the risk of cardiac adverse events. Despite the high pCR rate observed with dual HER2 blockade plus chemotherapy, PFS and DFS rates were not improved, although the NeoSPHERE trial was not powered to detect differences in long-term efficacy outcomes.[] The open-label, randomized, phase II (NCT00976989) trial sought to evaluate the tolerability and activity associated with trastuzumab and pertuzumab.[][] All 225 women with tumors that were larger than 2 cm or node positive, and who had operable, locally advanced, or inflammatory HER2-positive breast cancer, were randomly assigned to one of three preoperative regimens: Concurrent FEC plus trastuzumab plus pertuzumab (×3) followed by concurrent docetaxel plus trastuzumab plus pertuzumab. FEC alone (×3) followed by concurrent docetaxel plus trastuzumab plus pertuzumab (×3). Concurrent docetaxel and carboplatin plus trastuzumab plus pertuzumab (×6). The pCR rate was equivalent across all three treatment arms: (62% for concurrent FEC plus trastuzumab plus pertuzumab followed by concurrent docetaxel plus trastuzumab plus pertuzumab; 57% for FEC alone followed by concurrent docetaxel plus trastuzumab plus pertuzumab; and 66% for concurrent docetaxel and carboplatin plus trastuzumab plus pertuzumab). All three arms were associated with a low incidence of cardiac adverse events of 5% or less. Because of these studies, the FDA-granted for the use of pertuzumab as part of a preoperative treatment for women with early-stage, HER2-positive breast cancer whose tumors are larger than 2 cm or node-positive. The FDA approval of pertuzumab was subsequently converted to regular approval following the results of the confirmatory (NCT01358877) trial, a randomized, phase III, adjuvant study for women with HER2-positive breast cancer, which demonstrated improved invasive DFS with the combination of chemotherapy and dual HER2-targeted therapy with pertuzumab plus trastuzumab compared with chemotherapy and trastuzumab alone.[] Pertuzumab is now approved both in combination with trastuzumab and chemotherapy for the neoadjuvant therapy of locally advanced, inflammatory, or early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer, which is larger than 2 cm or node-positive, as part of a complete treatment regimen and in combination with chemotherapy and trastuzumab as adjuvant treatment for HER2-positive early breast cancer at a high risk of recurrence. Lapatinib is a small-molecule kinase inhibitor that is capable of dual receptor inhibition of both epidermal growth factor receptor and HER2. Study results do not support the use of lapatinib in the preoperative setting. Evidence (against the use of lapatinib for HER2-positive early breast cancer): The role of lapatinib in the preoperative setting was examined in the [NCT00567554] trial.[] This phase III trial randomly assigned women with HER2-positive early-stage breast cancer to receive chemotherapy with trastuzumab or chemotherapy with lapatinib, with pCR as the primary endpoint.[][] pCR in the chemotherapy and lapatinib arm was significantly lower than it was with chemotherapy and trastuzumab (22.7% vs. 30.3%; = .04). Other endpoints of DFS, RFS, and OS have not been reported. (NCT00770809) was a phase III trial that randomly assigned patients with stage II and III HER2-positive breast cancer to receive either paclitaxel plus trastuzumab or paclitaxel plus trastuzumab plus lapatinib. The primary endpoint of the study was pCR in the breast.[] [] pCR in patients who received paclitaxel plus trastuzumab was 46% (95% CI, 37%–55%), and pCR in the patients who received paclitaxel plus trastuzumab plus lapatinib was 56% (95% CI, 47%–65%; = .13), indicating no benefit with the addition of lapatinib. The [NCT00553358] phase III trial randomly assigned 455 women with HER2-positive early-stage breast cancer (tumor size >2 cm) to receive preoperative lapatinib, or preoperative trastuzumab, or preoperative lapatinib plus trastuzumab. This anti-HER2 therapy was given alone for 6 weeks and then weekly paclitaxel was added to the regimen for an additional 12 weeks. The primary endpoint of this study was pCR. pCR was significantly higher in the lapatinib-plus-trastuzumab combination arm (51.3%; 95% CI, 43.1–59.5) than in the trastuzumab-alone arm (29.5%; 95% CI, 22.4–37.5). No significant difference in pCR was seen between the lapatinib (24.7%, 95% CI, 18.1–32.3) and trastuzumab groups (difference, -4.8%, -17.6 to 8.2; = .34). An updated analysis for the prespecified secondary endpoints of EFS and OS indicate no difference between the groups.[] More definitive efficacy data were provided by the phase III ALLTO () trial that randomly assigned women to receive trastuzumab or trastuzumab plus lapatinib in the adjuvant setting.[] The trial did not meet its primary endpoint of DFS. The doubling in pCR rate observed with the addition of lapatinib to trastuzumab in the NeoALTTO trial did not translate into improved survival outcomes in the ALTTO trial at 4.5 years of median follow-up. This indicates that there is currently no role for the use of lapatinib in the preoperative or adjuvant settings. Cardiac toxic effects with pertuzumab and lapatinib A pooled analysis of cardiac safety in 598 cancer patients treated with pertuzumab was performed using data supplied by Roche and Genentech.[][] Asymptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction was observed in 6.9% of patients receiving pertuzumab alone (n = 331; 95% CI, 4.5–10.2), 3.4% of patients receiving pertuzumab in combination with a non–anthracycline-containing chemotherapy (n = 175; 95% CI, 1.3–7.3), and 6.5% of patients receiving pertuzumab in combination with trastuzumab (n = 93; 95% CI, 2.4–13.5). Symptomatic heart failure was observed in 1 (0.3%), 2 (1.1%), and 1 (1.1%) patients, respectively. A meta-analysis of randomized trials (n = 6) that evaluated the administration of anti-HER2 monotherapy (trastuzumab or lapatinib or pertuzumab) versus dual anti-HER2 therapy (trastuzumab plus lapatinib or trastuzumab plus pertuzumab) was performed.[][] LVEF decline was observed in 3.1% of the patients who received monotherapy (95% CI, 2.2%–4.4%) and 2.9% of the patients who received dual therapy (95% CI, 2.1%–4.1%). Symptomatic heart failure was observed in 0.88% of the patients who received monotherapy (95% CI, 0.47%–1.64%) and 1.49% of the patients who received dual therapy (95% CI, 0.98%–2.23%). Preoperative endocrine therapy may be an option for postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer when chemotherapy is not a suitable option because of comorbidities or performance status. Although the toxicity profile of preoperative hormonal therapy over the course of 3 to 6 months is favorable, the pCR rates obtained (1%–8%) are far lower than have been reported with chemotherapy in unselected populations.[][] Longer duration of preoperative therapy may be required in this patient population. Preoperative tamoxifen was associated with an overall response rate of 33%, with maximum response occurring up to 12 months after therapy in some patients.[] A randomized study of 4, 8, or 12 months of preoperative letrozole in elderly patients who were not fit for chemotherapy indicated that the longer duration of therapy resulted in the highest pCR rate (17.5% vs. 5% vs. 2.5%, -value for trend < .04).[][] AIs have also been compared with tamoxifen in the preoperative setting. Overall objective response and breast-conserving therapy rates with 3 to 4 months of preoperative therapy were either statistically significantly improved in the AI-treated women [] or comparable to tamoxifen-associated outcomes.[] An American College of Surgeons Oncology Group trial is currently comparing the efficacy of anastrozole, letrozole, or exemestane in the preoperative setting. The use of preoperative endocrine therapy in premenopausal women with hormone-responsive breast cancer remains investigational. One clinical trial suggested that there is a benefit to using capecitabine as adjuvant therapy in patients who did not obtain a pCR after preoperative chemotherapy. In a study conducted in Japan and Korea, 910 women with HER2/neu–negative breast cancers, who had residual disease after preoperative chemotherapy with anthracyclines, taxanes, or both, were randomly assigned in a nonblinded fashion to receive 6 to 8 four-weekly cycles of capecitabine or no further chemotherapy.[] The study was terminated because of the results of a planned interim analysis, and a final analysis was done. In the final analysis, which included 887 eligible patients, DFS, the primary endpoint, was statistically significantly prolonged (HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.53–0.92; = .01; 5-year DFS, 74.1% vs. 67.6%). OS, a secondary endpoint, was also longer in the capecitabine group (HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.39–0.90; = .01; 5-year OS, 89.2% vs. 83.6%). In the capecitabine group, 73.4% of the patients experienced hand-foot syndrome of varying degrees of severity. In a phase III trial ( [NCT01772472]), 1,486 women with HER2-positive disease who received a preoperative taxane-containing chemotherapy (with or without an anthracycline) along with trastuzumab with or without a second HER2 targeted agent, but who had residual disease after surgery, were randomly assigned to receive 14 cycles of adjuvant trastuzumab or T-DM1.[][] At the time of a planned interim analysis, invasive DFS (the primary study endpoint) was significantly higher in the T-DM1 group than in the trastuzumab group (HR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.39–0.64; < .001; invasive DFS at 3 years, 88.3% vs. 77%). Data on OS are immature and not significant (HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.47–1.05). Patients receiving T-DM1 were more likely to discontinue treatment because of an adverse event (18% vs. 2.1%) and had a higher frequency of sensory neuropathy (18.6% vs. 6.9%), most cases of which had resolved at the time of the analysis. On subgroup analysis, the benefit of T-DM1 was observed in all subgroups, including participants who received dual HER2 targeted therapy in the preoperative setting. These approaches and participation in clinical trials of novel therapies should be considered for patients with residual disease after preoperative therapy. (NCT02445391) is a randomized phase III clinical trial that randomly assigned patients with residual basal-like TNBC after preoperative therapy to receive platinum-based chemotherapy or capecitabine. (NCT02954874) is a phase III trial evaluating the efficacy of pembrolizumab as adjuvant therapy for patients with residual TNBC (≥1 cm invasive cancer or residual nodes) after preoperative therapy. Radiation therapy is administered after breast conservation in most women who have received preoperative therapy to reduce the risk of locoregional recurrence. Baseline clinical and subsequent pathologic staging should be considered in deciding whether to administer postmastectomy radiation. Other adjuvant systemic treatments may be administered either postoperatively, during, or after completion of adjuvant radiation, including adjuvant hormonal therapy for patients with hormone receptor-positive disease and adjuvant trastuzumab for those with HER2-positive disease. (Refer to the subsection in the section of this summary for more information.) The frequency of follow-up and the appropriateness of screening tests after the completion of primary treatment for stage I, stage II, or stage III breast cancer remain controversial. Evidence from randomized trials indicates that periodic follow-up with bone scans, liver sonography, chest x-rays, and blood tests of liver function does improve survival or quality of life when compared with routine physical examinations.[-] Even when these tests permit earlier detection of recurrent disease, patient survival is unaffected.[] On the basis of these data, acceptable follow-up can be limited to the following for asymptomatic patients who complete treatment for stages I to III breast cancer: Use our to find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are now enrolling patients.

The standard treatment options for locally advanced or inflammatory breast cancer may include the following: Breast-conserving surgery or total mastectomy with axillary lymph node dissection. Initial surgery is generally limited to biopsy to permit the determination of histology, estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor levels, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2/neu) overexpression. The standard chemotherapy regimen for initial treatment is the same as that used in the adjuvant setting (refer to the section of this summary for more information), although trials done solely in patients with locally advanced disease have not shown a statistically significant advantage to dose-dense chemotherapy.[] For patients who respond to preoperative chemotherapy, local therapy may consist of total mastectomy with axillary lymph node dissection followed by postoperative radiation therapy to the chest wall and regional lymphatics. Breast-conserving therapy can be considered for patients with a good partial or complete response to preoperative chemotherapy.[] Subsequent systemic therapy may consist of further chemotherapy. Hormone therapy is administered to patients with ER-positive or ER-unknown tumors. Although the evidence described below has not been replicated, it suggests patients with locally advanced or inflammatory breast cancer should be treated with curative intent. In a retrospective series, 70 patients with locally advanced breast cancer and supraclavicular metastases received preoperative chemotherapy. Patients then received local therapy that consisted of either total mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection or breast-conserving surgery and axillary lymph node dissection before or after radiation therapy. Patients who did not respond to preoperative chemotherapy were treated with surgery and/or radiation therapy. After completion of local therapy, chemotherapy was continued for 4 to 15 cycles, followed by radiation therapy.[] Approximately 32% of patients with ipsilateral supraclavicular node involvement and no evidence of distant metastases (pN3c) had prolonged disease-free survival (DFS) at 10 years with combined-modality therapy. These results have been confirmed in a separate series of patients treated in British Columbia.[] A series of 178 patients with inflammatory breast cancer were treated with a combined-modality approach. Patients were treated with induction chemotherapy, then local therapy (radiation therapy or mastectomy), followed by chemotherapy, and, if mastectomy was performed, radiation therapy.[][] Subsequent trials have confirmed that patients with locally advanced and inflammatory breast cancer can experience long-term DFS when treated with initial chemotherapy.[] All patients are considered candidates for clinical trials to evaluate the most appropriate way to administer the various components of new multimodality regimens. Use our to find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are now enrolling patients. The search can be narrowed by location of the trial, type of treatment, name of the drug, and other criteria. about clinical trials is also available.

Patients with locoregional breast cancer recurrence may become long-term survivors with appropriate therapy. The rates of locoregional recurrence have been reduced over time, and a meta-analysis suggests a recurrence rate of less than 3% in patients treated with breast-conserving surgery and radiation therapy.[] The rates are somewhat higher (up to 10%) for those treated with mastectomy.[] Nine percent to 25% of patients with locoregional recurrence will have distant metastases or locally extensive disease at the time of recurrence.[-] Before treatment for recurrent breast cancer, restaging to evaluate the extent of disease is indicated. Cytologic or histologic documentation of recurrent disease is obtained whenever possible. When therapy is selected, the estrogen-receptor (ER) status, progesterone-receptor (PR) status, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2/neu) status at the time of recurrence and previous treatment are considered, if known. ER status may change at the time of recurrence. In a single small study by the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (MDA-MBDT-8081), 36% of hormone receptor–positive tumors were found to be receptor negative in biopsy specimens isolated at the time of recurrence.[] Patients in this study had no interval treatment. If ER and PR statuses are unknown, then the site(s) of recurrence, disease-free interval, response to previous treatment, and menopausal status are useful in the selection of chemotherapy or hormone therapy.[] Treatment options for locoregional recurrent breast cancer include the following: Patients with locoregional recurrence should be considered for further local treatment (e.g., mastectomy). In one series, the 5-year actuarial rate of relapse for patients treated for invasive recurrence after initial breast conservation and radiation therapy was 52%.[] Treatment options also depend on the site of recurrence, as follows: Cutaneous: A phase III randomized study showed that local control of cutaneous metastases could be achieved with the application of topical miltefosine; however, the drug is not currently available in the United States.[][] Chest wall: Local chest wall recurrence after mastectomy is usually the harbinger of widespread disease, but, in a subset of patients, it may be the only site of recurrence. For patients in this subset, surgery and/or radiation therapy may be curative.[,] Patients with chest wall recurrences of less than 3 cm, axillary and internal mammary node recurrence (not supraclavicular, which has a poorer survival), and a greater-than-2-year disease-free interval before recurrence have the best chance for prolonged survival.[] The 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) rate in one series of such patients was 25%, with a 10-year rate of 15%.[] The locoregional control rate was 57% at 10 years. Systemic therapy should be considered in patients with locoregional recurrence. Breast: In the Chemotherapy as Adjuvant for Locally Recurrent Breast Cancer ( [NCT00074152]) trial, patients with a history of breast-conserving surgery or mastectomy with clear margins and complete excision of an isolated local recurrence of their breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive either chemotherapy of the physician's choice or no chemotherapy. The study was closed early because of poor accrual. The original sample size for a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.74 was 977 patients (347 DFS events) and was revised subsequently to 265 patients (HR, 0.6; 124 DFS events), with only 162 enrolled at the time of study closure.[][] In ER-negative patients, the HR for DFS for chemotherapy versus no chemotherapy was 0.29 (95% CI, 0.13–0.67; 10 years DFS, 70% vs. 34%), whereas in ER-positive patients, the HR was 1.07 (95% CI, 0.57–2.00; 10 years DFS, 50% vs. 59%). The interaction between chemotherapy and ER status with respect to DFS was significant ( = .013).[] This trial supports consideration of adjuvant chemotherapy after complete resection of isolated locoregional recurrence of breast cancer in patients with ER-negative tumors. (Refer to the section of this summary for information about treatment for recurrent metastatic breast cancer.) All patients with recurrent breast cancer are considered candidates for ongoing clinical trials. Use our to find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are now enrolling patients.

Although median survival has been reported to be 18 to 24 months overall,[] survival varies according to subtype. The longest median outcomes have been observed in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive and hormone receptor–positive metastatic breast cancer, and less favorable outcomes have been observed in patients with triple-negative metastatic breast cancer.[] Treatment options for metastatic breast cancer include the following: Hormone therapy (tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors). Surgery, for patients with limited symptomatic metastases. Radiation therapy, for patients with limited symptomatic metastases. Bone-modifying therapy, for patients with bone metastases. In many cases, these therapies are given in sequence and used in various combinations. Cytologic or histologic documentation of metastatic disease, with testing of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor, and HER2 status, should be obtained whenever possible. All patients with metastatic breast cancer are considered candidates for ongoing clinical trials. Endocrine therapy and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor therapy CDK4 and CDK6 have been implicated in the continued proliferation of hormone receptor–positive breast cancer resistant to endocrine therapy. CDK inhibitors have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in combination with endocrine therapy in both first-line and later-line treatment of advanced hormone receptor–positive HER2-negative breast cancer. Three oral CDK4/6 inhibitors are currently available: palbociclib, ribociclib, and abemaciclib. Overall, the addition of CDK 4/6 inhibitors to endocrine therapy is associated with improved breast cancer outcomes and, in general, either maintained or improved quality of life.[-] This benefit was observed across multiple clinicopathological subgroups of breast cancer.[] Evidence (first-line palbociclib and endocrine therapy): (NCT01740427) confirmed the results of the phase II PALOMA-1 trial.[] This phase III, double-blind trial compared placebo plus letrozole with palbociclib plus letrozole as initial therapy for ER-positive postmenopausal patients with advanced disease (n = 666).[] The primary endpoint (investigator-assessed progression-free survival [PFS]) was met with a median PFS of 24.8 months in the palbociclib-plus-letrozole group compared with 14.5 months in the placebo-plus-letrozole group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.58; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.46–0.72; < .001).[][] Patients who received palbociclib experienced more frequent cytopenias (66.4% grade 3 to 4 in palbociclib-treated patients vs. 1.4% in placebo-treated patients). Other common adverse events included nausea, arthralgia, fatigue, and alopecia. The most common grade 3 to 4 adverse events other than neutropenia included leukopenia (24.8% vs. 0%), anemia (5.4% vs. 1.8%), and fatigue (1.8% vs. 0.5%). Ribociclib, another CDK4/6 inhibitor, has also been tested in the first-line setting for postmenopausal patients and premenopausal patients with hormone receptor–positive and HER2-negative recurrent or metastatic breast cancer. Evidence (first-line ribociclib and endocrine therapy): The phase III, placebo-controlled MONALEESA-2 trial () randomly assigned 668 patients to receive first-line ribociclib plus letrozole or placebo plus letrozole.[] The primary endpoint (investigator-assessed PFS) was met. A preplanned interim analysis was performed after 243 patients had disease progression or died, and median duration of follow-up was 15.3 months. After 18 months, the PFS rate was 63.0% (95% CI, 54.6–70.3) in the ribociclib group and 42.2% (95% CI, 34.8–49.5) in the placebo group.[][] OS data were immature at the time of publication. Adverse events in patients included neutropenia in the ribociclib group (74.3%) and in the placebo group (5.2%), nausea (51.5% and 28.5%), infection (50.3% and 42.4%), fatigue (36.5% and 30.0%), and diarrhea (35.0% and 22.1%). These events were mostly grade 1 to 2 with the exception of cytopenia. Grade 3 to 4 neutropenia occurred in 59.3% of patients in the ribociclib group and 0.9% of patients in the placebo group. The rate of febrile neutropenia was 1.5% in the ribociclib group and 0% in the placebo group. An increase in QTcF (QT interval corrected for heart rate according to Fridericia’s formula) interval of more than 60 milliseconds from baseline was observed in nine patients (2.7%) in the ribociclib arm compared with zero patients in the placebo arm. Ribociclib has also been tested in combination with fulvestrant in postmenopausal patients with hormone receptor–positive and HER2-negative recurrent or metastatic breast cancer. The (NCT02422615) trial included patients receiving first-line or second-line therapy. This phase III, placebo-controlled trial randomly assigned 726 patients in a 2:1 ratio to receive ribociclib plus fulvestrant or placebo plus fulvestrant.[] The primary endpoint (investigator-assessed PFS) was met. At the time of final analysis for PFS, the median PFS for the ribociclib group was 20.5 months versus 12.8 months in the placebo group (HR, .593; 95% CI, .480–.732; <.001).[][] OS was superior in the ribociclib group (HR, 0.724; 95% CI, 0.568–0.924;  = .004). The result crossed the prespecified stopping boundary ( = .011) for superior efficacy. Results were similar in all subgroups.[][] Adverse events were similar to those in other studies of CDK4/6 inhibitors. Grade 3 to 4 neutropenia occurred in 53.4% of patients in the ribociclib group and 0.0% of patients in the placebo group. The rate of febrile neutropenia was 1.0% in the ribociclib group and 0% in the placebo group. An increase in QTcF interval of more than 60 milliseconds from baseline was observed in 6.5% of patients in the ribociclib arm and 0.4% in the placebo arm. Ribociclib was also assessed in the first-line setting in a study conducted solely in premenopausal or perimenopausal women receiving either tamoxifen or a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor (AI) plus goserelin.[] In the (NCT02278120) trial, 672 premenopausal patients with hormone receptor–positive and HER2-negative recurrent or metastatic breast cancer, who had not received endocrine therapy for advanced disease, were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to ribociclib or placebo. The primary endpoint (investigator-assessed PFS) was met. At the time of final analysis for PFS, the median PFS for the ribociclib group was 23.8 months versus 13.0 months in the placebo group (HR, .55; 95% CI, 0.44–0.69; < .0001).[][] OS was a secondary endpoint. The combination of ribociclib plus endocrine therapy was associated with longer OS than was endocrine therapy alone (42-month OS, 70.2% vs. 46%; HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.54−0.95, = .01).[][] The survival benefit was observed both in patients who received an AI plus goserelin and in those who received tamoxifen, but it was not statistically significant in the much-smaller tamoxifen group. Adverse events were similar to those in other studies of CDK4/6 inhibitors. Grade 3 to 4 neutropenia occurred in 61% of patients in the ribociclib group and 4% of patients in the placebo group. The rate of febrile neutropenia was 2.0% in the ribociclib group and 1.0% in the placebo group. An increase in QTcF interval of more than 60 milliseconds from baseline was observed in 10.0 % of patients in the ribociclib arm and 2.0% in the placebo arm. Sixty-millisecond increases were more common in patients receiving tamoxifen (16% on ribociclib and 7% on placebo). Abemaciclib, another CDK4/6 inhibitor, has also been tested in the first-line setting for postmenopausal patients with hormone receptor–positive and HER2-negative recurrent or metastatic breast cancer. Evidence (first-line abemaciclib and endocrine therapy): (NCT02246621) was a randomized, double-blind, phase III trial that evaluated first-line abemaciclib or placebo plus a nonsteroidal AI in 493 postmenopausal women with hormone receptor–positive and HER2-negative advanced breast cancer.[] The primary endpoint, investigator-assessed PFS, was met. After a median follow-up of 17.8 months, the PFS was not reached in the abemaciclib arm and was reached at 14.7 months in the placebo arm (HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.41–0.72; = .000021). The side effect profile of abemaciclib differs from the other CDK4/6 inhibitors. Diarrhea was the most frequent adverse event in the abemaciclib arm, although most of the diarrhea cases were grade 1. Neutropenia was more common in the abemaciclib arm; however, only 21.1% of participants experienced grade 3 to 4 neutropenia. Evidence (second-line palbociclib and endocrine therapy): (NCT01942135) is a double-blind, phase III trial of 521 patients with hormone receptor–positive, HER2/neu–negative, advanced breast cancer who had relapsed after or progressed on previous endocrine therapy and were randomly assigned to receive either fulvestrant plus placebo or fulvestrant plus palbociclib. Premenopausal and postmenopausal patients were eligible. Premenopausal patients received goserelin.[][] The final PFS analysis showed a median PFS of 9.5 months on the palbociclib-fulvestrant arm versus 4.6 months on the placebo-fulvestrant arm (HR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.36–0.59; < .0001).[][] Cytopenias, particularly neutropenia, were much more frequent on the palbociclib-containing arm, but febrile neutropenia was very uncommon (1%) in both groups. Patients receiving palbociclib had more-frequent fatigue, nausea, and headache. A prespecified analysis of OS was made after 310 patients had died. A 6.9 month difference in median OS favoring the palbociclib-fulvestrant arm (34.9 months vs. 28.0 months) was found, which did not reach statistical significance (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.64–1.03, = .09).[] In a preplanned subgroup analysis, improved OS was observed in patients who had demonstrated sensitivity to hormone therapy (HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.55−0.94), whereas in patients without sensitivity, OS was not improved in the palbociclib group (HR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.71−1.84; = .12 for interaction). The MONALEESA-3 trial included patients receiving second-line therapy. (Refer to the evidence on first-line ribociclib and endocrine therapy for more information.) The (NCT02107703) study tested abemaciclib (CDK4/6 inhibitor) in a phase III, placebo-controlled trial that randomly assigned 669 patients with hormone receptor–positive and HER2-negative advanced breast cancer (with previous progression on endocrine therapy) to receive abemaciclib plus fulvestrant or placebo plus fulvestrant.[] The primary endpoint (investigator-assessed PFS) was met, with median duration of follow-up of 19.5 months. The median PFS was 16.4 months for the abemaciclib-fulvestrant arm versus 9.3 months for the placebo-fulvestrant arm (HR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.45–0.68; < .001).[][] OS data are mature and demonstrate an improvement in OS for patients receiving abemaciclib, and showed a median OS of 46.7 months for abemaciclib plus fulvestrant versus 37.3 months for placebo (HR, 0.757; 95% CI, 0.606–0.945; = .01).[][] Adverse events included diarrhea in the abemaciclib group (86.4%) and in the placebo group (24.7%), neutropenia (46% and 4%), nausea (45.1% and 22.9%), fatigue (39.9% and 26.9%), and abdominal pain (35.4% and 15.7%). These events were mostly grade 1 to 2. Grade 1 to 2 diarrhea occurred in 73% of the patients in the abemaciclib group and in 24.2% of the placebo group. Anti-diarrheal medicine effectively managed this symptom in most cases, according to the study report. Grade 3 diarrhea occurred in 13.4% of patients in the abemaciclib group and 0.4% of patients in the placebo group. No grade 4 diarrhea was reported. Grade 3 to 4 neutropenia occurred in 25.5% of patients in the abemaciclib group and 1.7% of patients in the placebo group. Febrile neutropenia was reported in six patients in the abemaciclib arm. Single-agent cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor therapy Evidence (single-agent cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor therapy): Single-agent abemaciclib was approved by the FDA for use in hormone receptor–positive, HER2-negative breast cancer with disease progression on or after endocrine therapy and chemotherapy on the basis of results of the (NCT02102490) trial.[] Abemaciclib is the only CDK4/6 inhibitor approved as a single agent. MONARCH 1 was a single-arm phase II study of single-agent abemaciclib in 132 women with hormone receptor–positive and HER2-negative advanced breast cancer that had progressed on at least one line of previous endocrine therapy and at least two lines of previous chemotherapy. The study population was heavily pretreated, and most participants had visceral disease. Patients who had previous CDK inhibitors were excluded. The primary endpoint, investigator-assessed objective response rate, was 19.7% at 12 months (95% CI, 13.3–27.5%). Median PFS was 6.0 months (95% CI, 4.2–7.5 months). The most common adverse event was diarrhea, which occurred in 90.2% of the participants. However, the majority was grade 1 to 2, and only 19.7% of participants experienced grade 3 diarrhea. There was no grade 4 diarrhea. Neutropenia occurred in 97.7% of participants; however, the majority was grade 1 to 2, and only 26.9% of participants experienced grade 3 to 4 neutropenia. Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor therapy plus endocrine therapy Preclinical models and clinical studies suggest that mTOR inhibitors might overcome endocrine resistance. The Breast Cancer Trial of Oral Everolimus ( [NCT00863655]) was a randomized, phase III, placebo-controlled trial in which patients with hormone receptor–positive metastatic breast cancer that is resistant to nonsteroidal aromatase inhibition were randomly assigned to receive either the mTOR inhibitor everolimus plus exemestane, or placebo plus exemestane.[][] At the interim analysis, median PFS was 6.9 months for everolimus plus exemestane and 2.8 months for placebo plus exemestane (HR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.35–0.54; < .001). The addition of everolimus to exemestane was more toxic than was placebo plus exemestane, with the most-common grade 3 or 4 adverse events being stomatitis (8% vs. 1%), anemia (6% vs. <1%), dyspnea (4% vs. 1%), hyperglycemia (4% vs. <1%), fatigue (4% vs. 1%), and pneumonitis (3% vs. 0%). OS differences were not significant after further follow-up.[] (NCT01298713) was an open-label randomized phase II trial comparing tamoxifen to tamoxifen plus everolimus in postmenopausal women whose disease had progressed after receiving an AI in the adjuvant or metastatic setting. The trial randomly assigned 57 women to receive tamoxifen and 54 women to receive the combination therapy.[] Median time to progression was 8.6 months in the combination group and 4.5 months in the tamoxifen group (HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.56−0.81; = .002). Toxicities were greater on the everolimus arm and similar to those in the BOLERO2 trial. In an exploratory analysis, OS was 32.9 months in the tamoxifen group and not reached in the combination group (HR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.24−0.81; = .007).[][] (NCT01797120) was a double-blind randomized phase II trial comparing fulvestrant to fulvestrant plus everolimus in postmenopausal women whose disease had progressed after receiving an AI in the adjuvant or metastatic setting. Sixty-six women were randomly assigned to the combination arm and 65 to fulvestrant alone.[] Median PFS was 10.3 months on the combination arm and 5.1 months on the fulvestrant-alone arm (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.40−0.92; = .02).[][] Toxicities were similar to those in previous studies. The was no observed difference in OS between the arms. The trial (NCT02069093) was a single-arm trial assessing the efficacy of a dexamethasone oral solution (0.5 mg per 5 mL) in the prevention of stomatitis in women receiving exemestane plus everolimus.[] The incidence of grade 2 or worse stomatitis was 2% in the 85 evaluable patients in this study compared with 33% in the BOLERO-2 trial. Activating mutations in are identified in approximately 40% of hormone receptor–positive and HER2-negative breast cancers. Alpelisib is an alpha-specific PI3K inhibitor. (NCT02437318) was a randomized phase III trial comparing alpelisib plus fulvestrant to placebo plus fulvestrant in 572 postmenopausal women with hormone receptor–positive and HER2-negative advanced breast cancer who had received previous endocrine therapy.[][] mutations were confirmed in 341 participants. The primary endpoint was PFS in the cohort of patients with mutations. In this cohort, median PFS was 11 months in the alpelisib-plus-fulvestrant arm compared with 5.7 months in the placebo-plus-fulvestrant arm (HR or HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.50−0.85; < .001). PFS did not differ between arms in the cohort of participants without mutations (median PFS, 7.4 months in the alpelisib-plus-fulvestrant arm vs. 5.6 months in the placebo-plus-fulvestrant arm). OS in the cohort with mutations was a secondary endpoint. OS data are not yet mature. Very few study participants had received previous CDK4/6 inhibitor therapy. Common toxicities associated with alpelisib included hyperglycemia, diarrhea, nausea, anorexia, and rash. Careful monitoring and management of hyperglycemia are required during alpelisib use. Alpelisib is approved by the FDA for use in combination with fulvestrant in advanced -mutated, hormone receptor–positive, HER2-negative breast cancer after previous endocrine therapy. Evidence of mTOR inhibitor activity in HER2-positive breast cancer was shown in the double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase III (NCT01007942) trial.[][] In the BOLERO-3 trial, 569 patients with HER2-positive, trastuzumab-resistant, breast cancer, who had received previous taxane therapy, were randomly assigned to receive either everolimus plus trastuzumab plus vinorelbine, or placebo plus trastuzumab plus vinorelbine. At median follow-up of 20.2 months, median PFS was 7.0 months in the everolimus group versus 5.78 months in the placebo group (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.65–0.95; = .0067). Serious adverse events were reported in 117 patients (42%) in the everolimus group and 55 patients (20%) in the placebo group. Final OS outcomes for this trial have not yet been reported. With the PFS and OS advantages associated with combination therapy with targeted agents and endocrine therapy as discussed above, single-agent endocrine therapy is less frequently used, especially in the first-line setting. However, its use remains appropriate in select cases as first-line therapy and in later-line therapy after progression on targeted therapies and before the use of chemotherapy in cases in which endocrine-sensitive disease is still thought to be present. Commonly used single-agent endocrine therapies include tamoxifen, nonsteroidal AI (letrozole, anastrozole), the steroidal AI exemestane, and fulvestrant. In general, premenopausal women with metastatic breast cancer undergo ovarian suppression or ablation and are treated in the same manner as postmenopausal women. While tamoxifen has been used for many years in treating postmenopausal women with newly metastatic disease that is ER positive, PR positive, or ER/PR unknown, several randomized trials suggest equivalent or superior response rates and PFS for the AI compared with tamoxifen.[-][] A meta-analysis evaluated patients with metastatic disease who were randomly assigned to receive either an AI as their first or second hormone therapy, or standard therapy (tamoxifen or a progestational agent).[][] Patients who received an AI as either their first or second hormone therapy for metastatic disease and were randomly assigned to receive a third-generation drug (anastrozole, letrozole, exemestane, or vorozole) lived longer (HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.82–0.93) than those who received standard therapy (tamoxifen or a progestational agent). Fulvestrant is a selective estrogen receptor degrader that has been studied in the first-line and second-line setting in women with advanced or metastatic breast cancer. (NCT01602380) was a phase III double-blind randomized trial that compared fulvestrant (500 mg) to anastrozole (1 mg) in patients with advanced or metastatic receptor-positive breast cancer who had not received previous endocrine therapy.[] The trial randomly assigned 230 patients to receive fulvestrant and 232 patients to receive anastrozole. Median PFS was 16.6 months in the fulvestrant group and 13.8 months in the anastrozole group (HR, 0.797; 95% CI, 0.637−0.999; = .049).[][] The frequency of adverse events was similar in the two groups, and there was no difference in quality of life. Two randomized trials that enrolled 400 and 451 patients whose disease had progressed after they received tamoxifen demonstrated that fulvestrant yielded results similar to those of anastrozole in terms of its impact on PFS.[,] The proper sequence of these therapies is not known.[,] (NCT00065325) was a phase III double-blind randomized trial that compared fulvestrant given in a loading-dose regimen (500 mg day 0, 250 mg days 14 and 28, and 250 mg every 28 days thereafter) to exemestane (25 mg) in women who had developed progressive disease after previous nonsteroidal AI (anastrozole or letrozole) therapy.[] The trial randomly assigned 351 women to receive fulvestrant and 342 women to receive exemestane. Median time to progression was 3.7 months in both groups (HR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.819−1.133; = .65).[][] The frequency of adverse events was similar in both groups, and there was no difference in quality of life. (NCT00099437) was a double-blind phase III trial that compared two doses of fulvestrant (500 mg vs. 250 mg, each given in a loading-dose schedule) in 736 women whose disease had progressed on previous endocrine therapy.[] PFS was significantly better on the higher-dose arm (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.68–0.94; = .006).[][] Adverse events and quality of life were similar on the two arms. Combination endocrine therapy with an AI and fulvestrant Conflicting results were found in two trials that compared the combination of the antiestrogen fulvestrant (refer to the section on for more information about this drug) and anastrozole with anastrozole alone in the first-line treatment of hormone receptor–positive postmenopausal patients with recurrent or metastatic disease.[,] In both studies, fulvestrant was administered as a 500-mg loading dose on day 1; 250 mg was administered on days 15 and 29, and monthly thereafter; plus, 1 mg of anastrozole was administered daily. The Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) trial included more patients who presented with metastatic disease; the Fulvestrant and Anastrozole Combination Therapy ( [NCT00256698]) study enrolled more patients who had previously received tamoxifen.[,] Evidence (combination endocrine therapy with an AI and fulvestrant): The SWOG trial ( [NCT00075764]), which enrolled 707 patients, demonstrated a statistically significant difference in PFS (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.68–0.94; = .007) and OS (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.65–1.00; = .05).[][] In an analysis done after 5 more years of follow-up, the observed benefits of combined therapy were still present, and the level of significance with respect to OS was greater (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.69–0.98; = .03).[][] In contrast, the FACT trial , which enrolled 514 patients, found no difference in either disease-free survival (DFS) (HR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.81–1.20; = .91) or OS (HR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.76–1.32; = 1.00).[][] Sequencing Therapy for Hormone Receptor–Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer The optimal sequence of therapies for hormone receptor–positive metastatic breast cancer is not known. In general, in the absence of a visceral crisis, most patients receive sequential endocrine-based regimens before transitioning to chemotherapy. On the basis of the PFS and OS improvements mentioned above, a combination of a CDK4/6 inhibitor therapy and endocrine therapy in the first line is an appropriate choice. The treatment for hormone receptor–negative breast cancer is chemotherapy. (Refer to the section of this summary for more information.) Antibody therapy targeting the HER2 pathway has been used since the 1990s and has revolutionized the treatment of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. Several HER2-targeted agents (e.g., trastuzumab, pertuzumab, ado-trastuzumab emtansine, lapatinib) have been approved for treatment of this disease. Approximately 20% to 25% of patients with breast cancer have tumors that overexpress HER2/neu.[] Trastuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to the HER2/neu receptor.[] In patients previously treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy whose tumors overexpress HER2/neu, administration of trastuzumab as a single agent resulted in a response rate of 21%.[][] In a phase III trial, patients with metastatic disease were randomly assigned to receive either chemotherapy alone (doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide or paclitaxel) or the same chemotherapy plus trastuzumab.[][] Patients treated with chemotherapy plus trastuzumab had an OS advantage over those who received chemotherapy alone (25.1 months vs. 20.3 months, = .05).[][] Notably, when combined with doxorubicin, trastuzumab is associated with significant cardiac toxicity.[] Clinical trials comparing multiagent chemotherapy plus trastuzumab with single-agent chemotherapy have yielded conflicting results. In one randomized study of patients with metastatic breast cancer treated with trastuzumab, paclitaxel, and carboplatin, patients tolerated the combination well and had a longer time to disease progression, compared with those treated with trastuzumab and paclitaxel alone.[][] However, no difference in OS, time to disease progression, or response rate was shown in the Breast Cancer International Research Group’s phase III trial ( [NCT00047255]) that compared carboplatin and docetaxel plus trastuzumab versus docetaxel plus trastuzumab as first-line chemotherapy for metastatic HER2-overexpressing breast cancer.[][] Outside of a clinical trial, standard first-line treatment for metastatic HER2-overexpressing breast cancer is single-agent chemotherapy plus trastuzumab. Pertuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to a different epitope at the HER2 extracellular domain than does trastuzumab. The binding of pertuzumab to HER2 prevents dimerization with other ligand-activated HER receptors, most notably HER3. The phase III (NCT00567190) trial assessed the efficacy and safety of pertuzumab plus trastuzumab plus docetaxel versus placebo plus trastuzumab plus docetaxel, in the first-line HER2-positive metastatic setting.[,][] With a median follow-up of 50 months, the median OS was 40.8 months in the control group versus 56.5 months in the pertuzumab group (HR favoring pertuzumab group, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.56–0.84; < .001). Median PFS per investigator assessment was improved by 6.3 months by the addition of pertuzumab (HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.58–0.80). Median OS was 56.5 months in the pertuzumab group compared with 40.8 months in the placebo group (HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.57–0.84; < .001).[] Eight-year landmark OS rates were 37% with the addition of pertuzumab, compared with 23% in the placebo group.[] The toxicity profile was similar in both treatment groups, with no increase in cardiac toxic effects seen in the pertuzumab combination arm. Ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) is an antibody-drug conjugate that incorporates the HER2-targeted antitumor properties of trastuzumab with the cytotoxic activity of the microtubule-inhibitory agent DM1. T-DM1 allows specific intracellular drug delivery to HER2-overexpressing cells, potentially improving the therapeutic index and minimizing exposure of normal tissue. The phase III or TDM4370g (NCT00829166) study was a randomized open-label trial that enrolled 991 patients with HER2-overexpressing, unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who were previously treated with trastuzumab and a taxane.[][] Patients were randomly assigned to receive either T-DM1 or lapatinib plus capecitabine. Median PFS was 9.6 months with T-DM1 versus 6.4 months with lapatinib plus capecitabine (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.55–0.77; < .001). Median OS was longer with trastuzumab emtansine versus lapatinib plus capecitabine (29.9 months vs. 25.9 months; HR, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.64–0.88]).[] The incidences of thrombocytopenia and increased serum aminotransferase levels were higher in patients who received T-DM1, whereas the incidences of diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and palmar-plantar syndrome were higher in patients who received lapatinib plus capecitabine. Further evidence of T-DM1’s activity in metastatic HER2-overexpressed breast cancer was shown in a randomized phase II study of T-DM1 versus trastuzumab plus docetaxel.[][] This trial randomly assigned 137 women with HER2-overexpressed breast cancer in the first-line metastatic setting. At median follow-up of 14 months, median PFS was 9.2 months with trastuzumab plus docetaxel and 14.2 months with T-DM1 (HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.36–0.97). Preliminary OS results were similar between treatment arms. T-DM1 had a favorable safety profile compared with trastuzumab plus docetaxel, with fewer grade 3 adverse events (46.4% vs. 90.9%), adverse events leading to treatment discontinuations (7.2% vs. 40.9%), and serious adverse events (20.3% vs. 25.8%). Evidence of activity of T-DM1 in heavily pretreated patients with metastatic, HER2-overexpressed breast cancer who had received previous trastuzumab and lapatinib was shown in the randomized phase III (NCT01419197) study of T-DM1 versus physician’s choice of treatment.[][] This trial randomly assigned 602 patients in a 2:1 ratio (404 patients assigned to T-DM1 and 198 patients assigned to physician’s choice) and allowed crossover to T-DM1. At a median follow-up of 7.2 months in the T-DM1 group and 6.5 months in the physician’s-choice group, median PFS was 6.2 months in the T-DM1 group and 3.3 months in the physician’s-choice group (HR, 0.528; 95% CI, 0.422–0.661; < .0001). OS was significantly longer with trastuzumab emtansine versus the treatment of physician’s choice (median OS, 22.7 months vs. 15.8 months; HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.54–0.85; = .0007).[] The role of T-DM1 as first-line treatment of metastatic HER2-overexpressed breast cancer was evaluated in the phase III (NCT01120184) trial.[][] This study randomly assigned 1,095 patients to receive either trastuzumab plus taxane, T-DM1 plus placebo, or T-DM1 plus pertuzumab. The median PFS for these treatment groups was 13.7 months for the trastuzumab-plus-taxane group, 14.1 months for the T-DM1-plus-placebo group, and 15.2 months for the T-DM1-plus-pertuzumab group. There was no significant difference in PFS with T-DM1 plus placebo compared with trastuzumab plus taxane (HR, 0.91; 97.5% CI, 0.73–1.13), or with T-DM1 plus pertuzumab compared with trastuzumab plus taxane (HR, 0.87; 97.5% CI, 0.69–1.08). Therefore, neither T-DM1 plus placebo nor T-DM1 plus pertuzumab showed PFS superiority over trastuzumab plus taxane. Trastuzumab deruxtecan is an antibody-drug conjugate that combines trastuzumab with a topoisomerase inhibitor. A phase I study demonstrated antitumor activity in patients with advanced HER2-positive breast cancer who received the drug conjugate.[] A non-blinded single-arm phase II trial () examined the response rate to trastuzumab deruxtecan at a dose of 5.4 mg/kg in 184 patients with HER2-positive breast cancer who had previously received trastuzumab and trastuzumab emtansine.[][] The confirmed response rate on independent central review was 60.9%, with a median response duration of 14.8 months. The impact of trastuzumab deruxtecan on PFS and OS is unknown. A grade 3 or higher adverse event was seen in 57.1% of patients, with 15.2% of patients discontinuing treatment for this reason. Interstitial lung disease developed in 13.6% of patients, and 4 deaths (2.2%) were attributed to this complication. Lapatinib is an orally administered tyrosine kinase inhibitor of both HER2/neu and the epidermal growth factor receptor. Lapatinib plus capecitabine has shown activity in patients who have HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer that progressed after treatment with trastuzumab. A nonblinded randomized trial ( [NCT00078572]) compared the combination of capecitabine and lapatinib with capecitabine alone in 324 patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease that progressed after therapies that included anthracyclines, taxanes, and trastuzumab.[][] Median time-to-disease progression in the lapatinib-plus-capecitabine arm was 8.4 months compared with 4.4 months in the capecitabine-alone arm (HR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.34–0.71; < .001). There was no difference in OS (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.58–1.46; = .72).[][] Patients on combination therapy were more likely to develop diarrhea, rash, and dyspepsia. (Refer to the PDQ summary on for more information about diarrhea.) No data are available on quality of life or treatment after disease progression. Tucatinib is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor highly selective for the kinase domain of HER2 that minimally inhibits the epidermal growth factor receptor. A phase Ib trial in pretreated patients demonstrated activity when tucatinib was combined with trastuzumab and capecitabine. The trial (NCT02614794) compared trastuzumab, capecitabine, and tucatinib with trastuzumab, capecitabine, and placebo in 632 patients who had previously been treated with trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and trastuzumab emtansine and had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1. Patients with and without brain metastases were included.[][] The analysis of the primary study endpoint, PFS, demonstrated a median PFS in the tucatinib combination group of 7.8 months and 5.6 months in the placebo combination group (HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.42–0.71; < .001) In an interim analysis conducted at the time of the PFS analysis, median OS was 21.9 months in the tucatinib combination group and 17.4 months in the placebo combination group (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.50–0.88; = .005) Patients with and without brain metastases benefited from the tucatinib combination. Grade 3 adverse events including diarrhea, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome, and elevated aminotransferase levels were more common in the tucatinib combination group, but occurred in fewer than 15% of patients. For patients with metastatic breast cancer who carry a germline mutation, the oral inhibitor of poly (adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP) has shown activity. and are tumor-suppressor genes that encode proteins involved in DNA repair through the homologous recombination repair pathway. PARP plays a critical role in DNA repair and has been studied as therapy for patients with breast cancer who harbor a germline mutation. The (NCT02000622) trial was a randomized, open-label, phase III trial that randomly assigned 302 patients, in a 2:1 ratio, to receive olaparib (300 mg bid) or standard therapy (either single-agent capecitabine, eribulin, or vinorelbine).[] All patients had received anthracycline and taxane previously in either the adjuvant or metastatic setting, and those with hormone receptor–positive disease had also received endocrine therapy previously. Median PFS was significantly longer in the olaparib group than in the standard therapy group (7.0 months vs. 4.2. months; HR for disease progression or death, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.43–0.80; < .001).[][] OS did not differ between the two treatment groups with median time to death (HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.63–1.29; = .57). Olaparib was less toxic than standard therapy, with a rate of grade 3 or higher adverse events of 36.6% in the olaparib group and 50.5% in the standard therapy group, with anemia, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, headache, and cough occurring more frequently with olaparib; neutropenia, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia, and liver-function test abnormalities occurred more commonly with chemotherapy. Of note, subset analysis suggested that PFS improvement with olaparib appeared greater in the triple-negative breast cancer subgroup (HR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.29–0.63) than in the hormone receptor–positive subgroup (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.55–1.26). The (NCT01945775) trial was a randomized, open label, phase III trial that assigned 431 patients with a deleterious germline or mutation and locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer in a 2:1 ratio to talazoparib (1 mg PO qd) or standard single-agent chemotherapy of the physician’s choice (eribulin, capecitabine, gemcitabine, or vinorelbine).[] All patients had received previous treatment with an anthracycline, taxane, or both. Patients had received three or fewer lines of cytotoxic chemotherapy for advanced breast cancer. Previous platinum therapy in the setting of early breast cancer was permitted if it was completed at least 6 months before progressive disease or if there was no objective progression while on platinum therapy in the advanced-disease setting. Hormone receptor–positive and hormone receptor–negative patients were enrolled. Median PFS was significantly longer in the talazoparib group than in the standard therapy group (8.6 months vs. 5.6 months; HR for disease progression or death, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.41–0.71; < .001). Benefits were observed in all subgroups, although CIs were wide in the subgroup of patients who had received previous platinum therapy. Median OS did not differ between the two groups (22.3 months vs. 19.5 months; HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.55–1.06; = .11), although survival data are not yet mature. The primary toxicity observed with talazoparib was myelosuppression, especially anemia. Patient-reported outcome data demonstrated more favorable effects of talazoparib than standard chemotherapy on quality-of-life measures.[] (Refer to the PDQ summary on for more information.) Patients receiving hormone therapy whose tumors have progressed are candidates for cytotoxic chemotherapy. There are no data suggesting that combination therapy results in an OS benefit over single-agent therapy. Patients with hormone receptor–negative tumors and those with visceral metastases or symptomatic disease are also candidates for cytotoxic agents.[] Single agents that have shown activity in metastatic breast cancer include the following: Anthracyclines. Taxanes. Albumin-bound nanoparticle paclitaxel (ABI-007 or Abraxane).[,] Fluoropyrimidines. Vinca alkaloids. Other. Combination regimens that have shown activity in metastatic breast cancer include the following: CAF: Cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and 5-FU.[] CMF: Cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-FU.[] There are no data suggesting that combination therapy results in an OS benefit over single-agent therapy. An ECOG intergroup study (E-1193) randomly assigned patients to receive paclitaxel and doxorubicin, given both as a combination and sequentially.[] Although response rate and time to disease progression were both better for the combination, survival was the same in both groups.[][]; [,] The selection of therapy in individual patients is influenced by the following: Presence or absence of comorbid medical conditions. Currently, no data support the superiority of any particular regimen. Sequential use of single agents or combinations can be used for patients who relapse with metastatic disease. Combination chemotherapy is often given if there is evidence of rapidly progressive disease or visceral crisis. Combinations of chemotherapy and hormone therapy have not shown an OS advantage over the sequential use of these agents.[,] A systematic review of 17 randomized trials found that the addition of one or more chemotherapy drugs to a chemotherapy regimen in the attempt to intensify the treatment improved tumor response but had no effect on OS.[][] Decisions regarding the duration of chemotherapy may consider the following: The optimal time for patients with responsive or stable disease has been studied by several groups. For patients who attain a complete response to initial therapy, two randomized trials have shown a prolonged DFS after immediate treatment with a different chemotherapy regimen compared with observation and treatment upon relapse.[,][] Neither of these studies, however, showed an improvement in OS for patients who received immediate treatment; in one of these studies,[] survival was actually worse in the group that was treated immediately. Similarly, no difference in survival was noted when patients with partial response or stable disease after initial therapy were randomly assigned to receive either a different chemotherapy versus observation [] or a different chemotherapy regimen given at higher versus lower doses.[][] However, 324 patients who achieved disease control were randomly assigned to maintenance chemotherapy or observation. Patients who received maintenance chemotherapy (paclitaxel and gemcitabine) had improved PFS at 6 months and improved OS. This was associated with an increased rate of adverse events.[][] Because there is no standard approach for treating metastatic disease, patients requiring second-line regimens are good candidates for clinical trials. The addition of atezolizumab, an anti-programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1)–positive antibody, to first-line chemotherapy for patients with hormone receptor–negative and HER2-negative advanced breast cancer was evaluated in the phase III randomized placebo-controlled trial (NCT02425891).[] Participants (N = 902) were randomly assigned 1:1 to atezolizumab plus nanoparticle albumin-bound (nab)-paclitaxel or to placebo plus nab-paclitaxel. Participants were stratified according to the presence of liver metastases (yes/no), receipt of previous taxane therapy (yes/no), and PD-L1 status (positive or negative). PD-L1 score of 1% or greater was defined as positive. Co-primary endpoints included PFS and OS, both of which were evaluated in the intention-to-treat population and in the PD-L1–positive population (n = 369). PFS data are final with a median follow-up of 12.9 months and included the following: In the intention-to-treat population, PFS was improved with the addition of atezolizumab (median PFS, 7.2 months vs. 5.5 months; HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.69–0.92; = .0025). In the PD-L1–positive population, PFS was improved with the addition of atezolizumab (median PFS, 7.5 months vs. 5 months; HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.49–0.78; < .001). OS data are not yet mature. Results of the first interim analysis for OS, performed at the time of the final PFS analysis, included the following: In the intention-to-treat population, there was a nonsignificant trend toward improved OS with the addition of atezolizumab (median OS, 21.3 months vs. 17.6 months; HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.69–1.02; = .08). The study design used hierarchical testing for OS requiring that the OS be statistically significantly improved with atezolizumab in the intention-to-treat population before OS could be compared between the arms in the PD-L1–positive population. Because this requirement was not met at the time of the first interim analysis, a -value could not be determined at that time for the comparison of OS between the two arms in the PD-L1–positive population. Median OS was, however, 9.5 months longer in the atezolizumab arm in the PD-L1–positive population (25 months vs. 15.5 months; HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.45–0.86).[][] Adverse events occurred as expected. Adverse events that were potentially immune-related were more frequent in the atezolizumab arm. Atezolizumab was granted by the FDA for use in combination with protein-bound paclitaxel for patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer whose tumors express PD-L1. Sacituzumab govitecan is an antibody drug conjugate that combines an anti–trophoblast cell-surface antigen 2 antibody with an active metabolite of irinotecan.[] In a phase I/II trial, 108 women with triple-negative breast cancer who had received at least two previous chemotherapy regimens (median, three) were treated with sacituzumab govitecan at a dose of 10 mg/kg intravenously on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle. A response rate of 33.3% (95% CI, 24.6%–43.1%) was observed. The median duration of response was 7.7 months (95% CI, 4.9–10.8).[][] The main toxicity was neutropenia, and four deaths occurred during treatment. The FDA granted accelerated approval to sacituzumab govitecan for patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer after at least two previous lines of therapy. A confirmatory randomized trial is still under way. The potential for anthracycline-induced cardiac toxic effects should be considered in the selection of chemotherapeutic regimens for selected patients. Recognized risk factors for cardiac toxicity include the following: The cardioprotective drug dexrazoxane has been shown to decrease the risk of doxorubicin-induced cardiac toxicity in patients in controlled studies. The use of this agent has permitted patients to receive higher cumulative doses of doxorubicin and has allowed patients with cardiac risk factors to receive doxorubicin.[-] The risk of cardiac toxicity may also be reduced by administering doxorubicin as a continuous intravenous infusion.[] The American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines suggest the use of dexrazoxane in patients with metastatic cancer who have received a cumulative dose of doxorubicin of 300 mg/m or more when further treatment with an anthracycline is likely to be of benefit.[] Dexrazoxane has a similar protective effect in patients receiving epirubicin.[] Surgery may be indicated for select patients. For example, patients may need surgery if the following issues occur: Parenchymal brain or vertebral metastases with spinal cord compression. (Refer to the PDQ summary on for more information; refer to the PDQ summary on for information about pleural and pericardial effusions.) Radiation therapy has a major role in the palliation of localized symptomatic metastases.[] Indications for external-beam radiation therapy include the following: Unresectable central nervous system metastases (i.e., brain, meninges, and spinal cord). After surgery for decompression of intracranial or spinal cord metastases. Strontium chloride Sr 89, a systemically administered radionuclide, can be administered for palliation of diffuse bony metastases.[,] The use of bone-modifying therapy to reduce skeletal morbidity in patients with bone metastases should be considered.[] Results of randomized trials of pamidronate and clodronate in patients with bony metastatic disease show decreased skeletal morbidity.[-][] Zoledronate has been at least as effective as pamidronate.[] The optimal dosing schedule for zoledronate was studied in [Alliance; NCT00869206], which randomly assigned 1,822 patients, 855 of whom had metastatic breast cancer, to receive zoledronic acid every 4 weeks or every 12 weeks.[] Skeletal-related events were similar in both groups, with 260 patients (29.5%) in the zoledronate every-4-week dosing group and 253 patients (28.6%) in the zoledronate every-12-week dosing group experiencing at least one skeletal-related event (risk difference of -0.3% [1-sided 95% CI, -4% to infinity]; < .001 for noninferiority).[][] This study suggests that the longer dosing interval of zoledronate every 12 weeks is a reasonable treatment option. The monoclonal antibody denosumab inhibits the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa beta ligand (RANKL). A meta-analysis of three phase III trials (, , and ) comparing zoledronate versus denosumab for management of bone metastases suggests that denosumab is similar to zoledronate in reducing the risk of a first skeletal-related event.[] (Refer to the PDQ summary on for more information on bisphosphonates.) Bevacizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against all isoforms of vascular endothelial growth factor–A. Its role in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer remains controversial. Evidence (bevacizumab for metastatic breast cancer): The efficacy and safety of bevacizumab as a second- and third-line treatment for patients with metastatic breast cancer were studied in a single, open-label, randomized trial.[] The study enrolled 462 patients who had received previous anthracycline and taxane therapy and were randomly assigned to receive capecitabine with or without bevacizumab.[][] The study failed to demonstrate a statistically significant effect on PFS (4.9 months with combination therapy vs. 4.2 months with capecitabine alone; HR, 0.98) or OS (15.1 months vs. 14.5 months).[][] (NCT00028990), an open-label, randomized, phase III trial, compared paclitaxel alone with paclitaxel and bevacizumab.[][] The trial demonstrated that the addition of bevacizumab to paclitaxel significantly prolonged median PFS compared with paclitaxel alone as the initial treatment for patients with metastatic breast cancer (11.8 months vs. 5.9 months; HR, 0.60; < .001).[][] The addition of bevacizumab did not improve OS (26.7 months vs. 25.2 months; = .16). Notably, patients treated on the bevacizumab-containing arm had significantly higher rates of severe hypertension, proteinuria, cerebrovascular ischemia, and infection. The (NCT00333775) trial randomly assigned 736 patients to receive docetaxel plus either placebo or bevacizumab at 7.5 mg/kg or 15 mg/kg every 3 weeks as the initial treatment for patients with metastatic breast cancer.[][] The combination of docetaxel plus bevacizumab at 15 mg/kg, but not 7.5 mg/kg, modestly improved median PFS compared with placebo (10.1 months vs. 8.1 months) but did not improve OS (30.2 months vs. 31.9 months; = .85).[][] More toxicity was seen in patients in the bevacizumab-containing arms, with significantly higher rates of bleeding and hypertension compared with patients in the placebo arms. The (NCT00262067) trial randomly assigned 1,237 patients in a 2:1 fashion to receive either standard chemotherapy plus bevacizumab or standard chemotherapy plus placebo.[][] Median PFS was longer for each bevacizumab-containing combination (capecitabine cohort: increased from 5.7 months to 8.6 months; HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.56–0.84; log-rank, < .001; and taxane-anthracycline cohort: increased from 8.0 months to 9.2 months; HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.52–0.80; log-rank, < .001).[][] No statistically significant differences in OS between the placebo- and bevacizumab-containing arms were observed. Toxicities associated with bevacizumab were similar to those seen in previous bevacizumab clinical trials. The (NCT00281697) trial studied the efficacy of bevacizumab as a second-line treatment for metastatic breast cancer. This trial randomly assigned 684 patients in a 2:1 fashion to receive either standard chemotherapy plus bevacizumab or standard chemotherapy plus placebo.[][] Median PFS increased from 5.1 to 7.2 months for the bevacizumab-containing treatment arm (stratified HR for PFS, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.64–0.93; = .0072). However, no statistically significant difference in OS was seen (16.4 months for chemotherapy plus placebo vs. 18.0 months for chemotherapy plus bevacizumab, = .3741).[][] Toxicities associated with bevacizumab were similar to those seen in previous clinical trials. In November 2011, because of the consistent finding that bevacizumab improved PFS only modestly but did not improve OS, and given bevacizumab’s considerable toxicity profile, the FDA revoked approval of bevacizumab for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer.

J Clin Oncol 29 (32): 4286-93, 2011.  Ductal carcinoma (DCIS) is a noninvasive condition. DCIS can progress to invasive cancer, but estimates of the probability of this vary widely. Some reports include DCIS in breast cancer statistics. In 2020, DCIS is expected to account for about 18% of all newly diagnosed invasive plus noninvasive breast tumors in the United States.[] For invasive and noninvasive tumors detected by screening, DCIS accounts for approximately 25% of all cases. The frequency of a DCIS diagnosis has increased markedly in the United States since the use of screening mammography became widespread. Very few cases of DCIS present as a palpable mass, with more than 90% being diagnosed by mammography alone.[] DCIS comprises a heterogeneous group of histopathologic lesions that have been classified into the following subtypes primarily because of architectural pattern: Comedo-type DCIS consists of cells that appear cytologically malignant, with the presence of high-grade nuclei, pleomorphism, and abundant central luminal necrosis. Comedo-type DCIS appears to be more aggressive, with a higher probability of associated invasive ductal carcinoma.[] Breast-conserving surgery or mastectomy plus radiation therapy with or without tamoxifen. In the past, the customary treatment for DCIS was mastectomy.[] The rationale for mastectomy included a 30% incidence of multicentric disease, a 40% prevalence of residual tumor at mastectomy after wide excision alone, and a 25% to 50% incidence of in-breast recurrence after limited surgery for palpable tumor, with 50% of those recurrences being invasive carcinoma.[,] The combined local and distant recurrence rate after mastectomy is 1% to 2%. No randomized comparisons of mastectomy versus breast-conserving surgery plus breast radiation therapy are available. Because breast-conserving surgery combined with breast radiation therapy is successful for invasive carcinoma, this conservative approach was extended to DCIS. To determine whether breast-conserving surgery plus radiation therapy was a reasonable approach to the management of DCIS, the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) and the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) have each completed prospective randomized trials in which women with localized DCIS and negative surgical margins after excisional biopsy were randomly assigned to receive either breast radiation therapy (50 Gy) or no further therapy.[-] Evidence (breast-conserving surgery plus radiation therapy to the breast): Of the 818 women enrolled in the NSABP-B-17 trial, 80% were diagnosed by mammography, and 70% of the patients' lesions were 1 cm or smaller. Results were reported at the 12-year actuarial follow-up interval.[]; [][] The overall rate of in-breast tumor recurrence was reduced from 31.7% to 15.7% when radiation therapy was delivered ( < .005). Radiation therapy reduced the occurrence of invasive cancer from 16.8% to 7.7% ( = .001) and recurrent DCIS from 14.6% to 8.0% ( = .001). Nine pathologic features were evaluated for their ability to predict for in-breast recurrence, but only comedo necrosis was determined to be a significant predictor for recurrence. Similarly, of the 1,010 patients enrolled in the EORTC-10853 trial, mammography detected lesions in 71% of the women. Results were reported at a median follow-up of 10.5 years.[][] The overall rate of in-breast tumor recurrence was reduced from 26% to 15% ( < .001), with a similarly effective reduction of invasive recurrence rates (13% to 8%, = .065) and noninvasive recurrence rates (14% to 7%, = .001). In this analysis, parameters associated with an increased risk of in-breast recurrence included age 40 years or younger, palpable disease, intermediate or poorly differentiated DCIS, cribriform or solid growth pattern, and indeterminate margins. Elsewhere, margins of less than 1 mm have been associated with an unacceptable local recurrence rate, even with radiation therapy.[] In both studies, the effect of radiation therapy was consistent across all assessed risk factors. The benefit of administering radiation therapy has been confirmed in a systematic review of four randomized trials (hazard ratio [HR], 0.49; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.41–0.58; < .00001). In this study, the number needed to treat with radiation therapy was nine women to prevent one ipsilateral breast recurrence.[] A large national clinical trial by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group ( [NCT00003857]) comparing breast-conserving surgery and tamoxifen with or without radiation therapy was closed because of poor accrual (636 of planned 1,790 patients accrued). Patients with good-risk DCIS (defined as mammographically detected low- or intermediate-grade DCIS, measuring less than 2.5 cm with margins of 3 mm or more) were enrolled.[] With a median follow-up of 7 years, the ipsilateral local failure rate was low with observation (6.7%; 95% CI, 3.2%–9.6%) but was decreased significantly with the addition of radiation therapy (0.9%; 95% CI, 0.0%–2.2%).[] The results of the NSABP-B-17 and EORTC-10853 trials plus two others were included in a meta-analysis that demonstrated reductions in all ipsilateral breast events (HR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.41–0.58; < .00001), ipsilateral invasive recurrence (HR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.32–0.76; = .001), and ipsilateral DCIS recurrence (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.39–0.95; = .03).[][] After 10 years of follow-up, there was, however, no significant effect on breast cancer mortality, mortality from causes other than breast cancer, or all-cause mortality.[] To identify a favorable group of patients for whom postoperative radiation therapy could be omitted, several pathologic staging systems have been developed and tested retrospectively, but consensus recommendations have not been achieved.[-] The Van Nuys Prognostic Index is one pathologic staging system that combines three predictors of local recurrence (i.e., tumor size, margin width, and pathologic classification). It was used to retrospectively analyze 333 patients treated with either excision alone or excision and radiation therapy.[] Using this prognostic index, patients with favorable lesions who received surgical excision alone had a low recurrence rate (i.e., 2%, with a median follow-up of 79 months). A subsequent analysis of these data was performed to determine the influence of margin width on local control.[] Patients whose excised lesions had margin widths of 10 mm or more in every direction had an extremely low probability of local recurrence with surgery alone (4%, with a mean follow-up of 8 years). Both reviews are retrospective, noncontrolled, and subject to substantial selection bias. In contrast, the prospective NSABP trial did not identify any subset of patients who did not benefit from the addition of radiation therapy to breast-conserving surgery in the management of DCIS.[,,,] To determine whether tamoxifen adds to the efficacy of local therapy in the management of DCIS, the NSABP performed a double-blind prospective trial (NSABP-B-24). In NSABP-B-24, 1,804 women were randomly assigned to receive breast-conserving surgery, radiation therapy (50 Gy), and placebo or breast-conserving surgery, radiation therapy, and tamoxifen (20 mg qd for 5 years).[] Positive or unknown surgical margins were present in 23% of patients. Approximately 80% of the lesions measured 1 cm or smaller, and more than 80% were detected mammographically. Breast cancer events were defined as the presence of new ipsilateral disease, contralateral disease, or metastases. Women in the tamoxifen group had fewer breast cancer events at 5 years than did those treated with a placebo (8.2% vs. 13.4%; = .009).[][] With tamoxifen, ipsilateral invasive breast cancer decreased from 4.2% to 2.1% at 5 years ( = .03). Tamoxifen also decreased the incidence of contralateral breast neoplasms (invasive and noninvasive) from 0.8% per year to 0.4% per year ( = .01). The benefit of tamoxifen extended to patients with positive or uncertain margins.[] (Refer to the PDQ summary on for more information.) No survival advantage was demonstrated for the use of tamoxifen. In NSABP-B-24, 1,804 women were randomly assigned to receive breast-conserving surgery, radiation therapy (50 Gy), and placebo or breast-conserving surgery, radiation therapy, and tamoxifen (20 mg qd for 5 y).[] Positive or unknown surgical margins were present in 23% of patients. Approximately 80% of the lesions measured 1 cm or smaller, and more than 80% were detected mammographically. Breast cancer events were defined as the presence of new ipsilateral disease, contralateral disease, or metastases. No survival advantage was demonstrated for the use of tamoxifen. In the NSABP-B35 double-blind study, 3,104 postmenopausal women with DCIS who were treated with breast-conserving surgery were randomly assigned to receive either adjuvant tamoxifen or anastrozole, in addition to adjuvant radiation therapy. The use of anastrozole was associated with significantly fewer breast cancer events (HR, 0.73; = .023) but no improvement in survival.[][] The Second International Breast Cancer Intervention Study ( [NCT00078832]) trial enrolled 2,980 postmenopausal women in a double-blind comparison of tamoxifen with anastrozole as adjuvant therapy. All of the women had breast conserving surgery, and 71% of them had radiation therapy.[] No difference in the rate of breast cancer recurrence in favor of anastrozole was found (HR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.64–1.23; = .49), and there was no difference in survival. The decision to prescribe endocrine therapy after a diagnosis of DCIS often involves a discussion with the patient about the potential benefits and side effects of each agent.

This section describes the latest changes made to this summary as of the date above. Added to state that administering a radiation boost may, however, be associated with unfavorable quality-of-life outcomes (cited King et al. as reference 48). Added as a new subsection. Added to state that the SOLD (NCT00593697) trial compared 9 weeks of trastuzumab with 1 year of trastuzumab in 2,174 women with HER-2 positive breast cancer; noninferiority of the 9-week treatment could not be demonstrated for disease-free survival (DFS) (cited Joensuu et al. as reference 127). Added to state that the D-CARE (NCT01077154) trial randomly assigned 4,509 women with stage II or stage III breast cancer to receive denosumab or placebo; the primary endpoint of bone metastasis-free survival was not significantly different between the groups (cited Coleman et al. as reference 183 and level of evidence 1iDii). Added to state that in the ETNA (NCT01822314) trial that compared neoadjuvant nab-paclitaxel with paclitaxel followed by anthracycline-based therapy, no significant difference in pathologic complete response (pCR) was observed, and neutropenia and peripheral neuropathy were more frequent in the nab-paclitaxel arm (cited Gianni et al. as reference 202). Added that differences in taxane dose and schedule may explain the different findings in the GeparSepto and ETNA trials. Added about the GeparSixto (NCT01426880) trial to state that 3-year DFS was higher for patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) randomly assigned to the carboplatin arm, but overall survival (OS) did not differ (cited Loibl et al. as reference 205). Added to state that a 2018 meta-analysis of nine phase II or III randomized trials that evaluated the addition of carboplatin to various chemotherapy backbones for neoadjuvant treatment of TNBC confirmed higher pCR, but at the expense of greater hematologic toxicity (cited Poggio et al. as reference 207); added that two of the nine trials reported survival outcomes and no difference in event-free survival (EFS) or OS was observed with the use of neoadjuvant carboplatin. Added to state that the randomized, double blind, phase III KEYNOTE-522 (NCT03036488) trial evaluated the addition of immunotherapy to neoadjuvant chemotherapy for patients with stage II or stage III TNBC. Participants were randomly assigned 2:1 to receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy with either neoadjuvant and adjuvant pembrolizumab or neoadjuvant and adjuvant placebo. Co-primary endpoints were pCR rate and EFS. pCR rate, as reported at the time of the first interim analysis for the first 602 participants, favored the pembrolizumab arm (cited Schmid et al. as reference 210). Added that longer term follow-up with regard to EFS and toxicity will inform the use of pembrolizumab in the neoadjuvant treatment of TNBC. Key issues that remain to be clarified include identification of a predictive biomarker, the optimal chemotherapy backbone, and the role of adjuvant pembrolizumab after neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus pembrolizumab. Revised about the phase III Z1041 (NCT00513292] trial to add that DFS and OS were secondary outcomes. After median follow-up of 5.1 years, there was no difference in DFS or OS between the sequential and concurrent arms (cited Buzdar et al. as reference 216). Added to state that this benefit was observed across multiple clinicopathological subgroups of breast cancer (cited Gao et al. as reference 9). Added to state that 8-year landmark OS rates were 37% with the addition of pertuzumab, compared with 23% in the placebo group (cited Swain et al. as reference 52). Revised to state that the FDA granted accelerated approval to sacituzumab govitecan for patients with metastatic TNBC after at least two previous lines of therapy. A confirmatory randomized trial is still under way. This summary is written and maintained by the , which is editorially independent of NCI.

0529ed78-898d-401b-b41a-45ab54cb11ef,"Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research Breast Cancer Treatment (Adult) (PDQ®)–Health Professional Version This summary discusses primary epithelial breast cancers in women. The breast is rarely affected by other tumors such as lymphomas, sarcomas, or melanomas. Refer to the following PDQ summaries for more information on these cancer types: Breast cancer also affects men and children and may occur during pregnancy, although it is rare in these populations. Refer to the following PDQ summaries for more information: Estimated new cases and deaths from breast cancer (women only) in the United States in 2020:[] Breast cancer is the most common noncutaneous cancer in U.S. women, with an estimated 48,530 cases of female breast ductal carcinoma and 276,480 cases of invasive disease in 2020.[] Thus, fewer than one of six women diagnosed with breast cancer die of the disease. By comparison, it is estimated that about 63,220 American women will die of lung cancer in 2020.[] Men account for 1% of breast cancer cases and breast cancer deaths (refer to the section in the PDQ summary on for more information). Widespread adoption of screening increases breast cancer incidence in a given population and changes the characteristics of cancers detected, with increased incidence of lower-risk cancers, premalignant lesions, and ductal carcinoma (DCIS). (Refer to the section in the section in the PDQ summary on for more information.) Population studies from the United States [] and the United Kingdom [] demonstrate an increase in DCIS and invasive breast cancer incidence since the 1970s, attributable to the widespread adoption of both postmenopausal hormone therapy and screening mammography. In the last decade, women have refrained from using postmenopausal hormones, and breast cancer incidence has declined, but not to the levels seen before the widespread use of screening mammography.[] Increasing age is the most important risk factor for most cancers. Other risk factors for breast cancer include the following: Major inheritance susceptibility.[,] Germline mutation of the and genes and other breast cancer susceptibility genes.[,] Estrogen (endogenous).[-] Menstrual history (early menarche/late menopause).[,] Hormone therapy history. Combination estrogen plus progestin hormone replacement therapy. Personal history of benign breast disease (BBD) (proliferative forms of BBD).[-] Age-specific risk estimates are available to help counsel and design screening strategies for women with a family history of breast cancer.[,] Of all women with breast cancer, 5% to 10% may have a germline mutation of the genes and .[] Specific mutations of and are more common in women of Jewish ancestry.[] The estimated lifetime risk of developing breast cancer for women with and mutations is 40% to 85%. Carriers with a history of breast cancer have an increased risk of contralateral disease that may be as high as 5% per year.[] Male mutation carriers also have an increased risk of breast cancer.[] Mutations in either the or the gene also confer an increased risk of ovarian cancer [,] or other primary cancers.[,] Once a or mutation has been identified, other family members can be referred for genetic counseling and testing.[-] (Refer to the PDQ summaries on ; ; and for more information.) (Refer to the PDQ summary on for more information about factors that increase the risk of breast cancer.) Protective factors and interventions to reduce the risk of female breast cancer include the following: Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs).[] Risk-reducing oophorectomy or ovarian ablation.[-] (Refer to the PDQ summary on for more information about factors that decrease the risk of breast cancer.) Clinical trials have established that screening asymptomatic women using mammography, with or without clinical breast examination, decreases breast cancer mortality. (Refer to the PDQ summary on for more information.) When breast cancer is suspected, patient management generally includes the following: The following tests and procedures are used to diagnose breast cancer: Breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), if clinically indicated. Pathologically, breast cancer can be a multicentric and bilateral disease. Bilateral disease is somewhat more common in patients with infiltrating lobular carcinoma. At 10 years after diagnosis, the risk of a primary breast cancer in the contralateral breast ranges from 3% to 10%, although endocrine therapy decreases that risk.[-] The development of a contralateral breast cancer is associated with an increased risk of distant recurrence.[] When / mutation carriers were diagnosed before age 40 years, the risk of a contralateral breast cancer reached nearly 50% in the ensuing 25 years.[,] Patients who have breast cancer will undergo bilateral mammography at the time of diagnosis to rule out synchronous disease. To detect either recurrence in the ipsilateral breast in patients treated with breast-conserving surgery or a second primary cancer in the contralateral breast, patients will continue to have regular breast physical examinations and mammograms. The role of MRI in screening the contralateral breast and monitoring women treated with breast-conserving therapy continues to evolve. Because an increased detection rate of mammographically occult disease has been demonstrated, the selective use of MRI for additional screening is occurring more frequently despite the absence of randomized, controlled data. Because only 25% of MRI-positive findings represent malignancy, pathologic confirmation before treatment is recommended. Whether this increased detection rate will translate into improved treatment outcome is unknown.[-] Breast cancer is commonly treated by various combinations of surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and hormone therapy. Prognosis and selection of therapy may be influenced by the following clinical and pathology features (based on conventional histology and immunohistochemistry):[] Estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) status of the tumor. Human epidermal growth factor type 2 receptor (HER2/neu) overexpression and/or amplification. Histologic type. Breast cancer is classified into a variety of histologic types, some of which have prognostic importance. Favorable histologic types include mucinous, medullary, and tubular carcinomas.[-] The use of molecular profiling in breast cancer includes the following:[] Gene profile testing by microarray assay or reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (e.g., MammaPrint, Oncotype DX). On the basis of ER, PR, and HER2/neu results, breast cancer is classified as one of the following types: ER, PR, and HER2 status are important in determining prognosis and in predicting response to endocrine and HER2-directed therapy. The American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of American Pathologists consensus panel has published guidelines to help standardize the performance, interpretation, and reporting of assays used to assess the ER-PR status by immunohistochemistry and HER2 status by immunohistochemistry and hybridization.[,] The first gene profile test to be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration was the MammaPrint gene signature. The 70-gene signature classifies tumors into high- and low-risk prognostic categories. [-] The aim of the (NCT00433589) trial (see below) is to determine the clinical usefulness and patient benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy . The Oncotype DX 21 gene assay is the gene profile test with the most extensive clinical validation thus far and applies to hormone receptor–positive breast cancer. A 21-gene recurrence score is generated based on the level of expression of each of the 21 genes: The following trials describe the prognostic and predictive value of multigene assays in early breast cancer: The prognostic ability of the Oncotype DX 21-gene assay was assessed in two randomized trials. The National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project () trial randomly assigned patients to receive tamoxifen or placebo; the results favoring tamoxifen changed clinical practice in the late 1980s.[] Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue was available for 668 patients. The 10-year distant recurrence risk for patients treated with tamoxifen was 7% for those with a low recurrence score, 14% for those with an intermediate recurrence score, and 31% for those with high recurrence score ( < .001).[] A community-based, case-control study examined the prognostic ability of the recurrence score to predict breast cancer deaths after 10 years in a group of tamoxifen-treated patients and observed a similar prognostic pattern to that seen in patients from NSABP B-14.[] The use of Oncotype Dx to predict benefit from chemotherapy in patients with node-negative, ER-positive breast cancer was initially assessed in a prospective-retrospective way using the tamoxifen alone (n = 227) and the combination arms (n = 424) of the trial.[] Patients in the NSABP B-20 trial were randomly assigned to receive tamoxifen alone or tamoxifen concurrently with methotrexate and fluorouracil (MF) or cyclophosphamide with MF (CMF).[] The 10-year distant disease-free survival (DFS) improved from 60% to 88% by adding chemotherapy to tamoxifen in the high-risk group, while no benefit was observed in the low recurrence score group.[] Similar findings were reported in the prospective-retrospective evaluation of the Southwestern Oncology Group trial in hormone receptor–positive lymph node-positive postmenopausal patients treated with tamoxifen with or without cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil.[] However, the sample size in this analysis was small, follow-up was only 5 years, and the prognostic impact of having positive nodes needs to be taken into consideration. Of note, both analyses (NSABP B-20 and S8814) were underpowered for any conclusive predictive analysis among patients identified as having an intermediate recurrence score. Results from the prospective, randomized (NCT00310180) trial indicate that chemotherapy is unlikely to provide substantial benefit to patients older than 50 years with ER-PR–positive and node-negative disease and a recurrence score of 11 to 25.[] In this study, a low-risk score was defined as less than 11, an intermediate score was 11 to 25, and a high-risk score was greater than 25. These cut points differ from those described above. Patients in this study with a low-risk score were found to have very low rates of recurrence at 5 years with endocrine therapy.[] Rate of invasive DFS was 93.8% at 5 years and 84.0% at 9 years. Rate of freedom from recurrence of breast cancer at a distant site was 99.3% at 5 years and 96.8% at 9 years. Rate of freedom from recurrence of breast cancer at a distant or local-regional site was 98.7% at 5 years and 95.0% at 9 years. Rate of overall survival (OS) was 98.0% at 5 years and 93.7% at 9 years. In the middle-risk group in the TAILORx study (recurrence score, 11–25), 6,907 women were randomly assigned to endocrine therapy alone or endocrine therapy plus chemotherapy.[] Of these, 3,399 women on the endocrine therapy-alone arm and 3,312 women on the endocrine therapy-plus-chemotherapy arm were available for an analysis according to the randomized treatment assignments. After a median follow-up of 90 months, the difference in invasive DFS, the main study endpoint, met the prespecified noninferiority criterion ( > .10 for a test of no difference after 835 events had occurred) suggesting the noninferiority of endocrine therapy compared with endocrine therapy plus chemotherapy. In this population, the 9-year invasive DFS was 83.3% for endocrine therapy alone and 84.3% for endocrine therapy plus chemotherapy (hazard ratio [HR], 1.08; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.94–1.24; = .26).[][] One hundred eighty-five patients in the endocrine-only arm received chemotherapy, and 608 patients in the endocrine therapy-plus-chemotherapy arm did not receive their assigned chemotherapy. In an analysis based on the actual treatment received, the HR for invasive DFS was 1.14 (95% CI, 0.99–1.31; =.06). Outcomes for the other endpoints examined (freedom of distant breast cancer recurrence, freedom from local and distant recurrence, and OS) were similar between the two treatment arms and none were significant at < 0.10. There was a significant interaction between treatment assignment and age ( = .03) with respect to invasive DFS, suggesting that chemotherapy might be beneficial in women younger than 50 years with recurrence scores ranging from 11 to 25. A secondary analysis of TAILORx demonstrated that integration of clinical risk (assessed by tumor size and grade) adds prognostic information to the recurrence score in women with a recurrence score of at least 11; however, clinical risk was not predictive of a chemotherapy benefit.[] The interaction between age and chemotherapy benefit was further explored in this secondary analysis. Among women aged 50 years or younger, rates of distant recurrence were lower with chemotherapy in the setting of recurrence scores of 16 to 20 and high clinical risk; and in the setting of recurrence scores of 21 to 25, regardless of clinical risk. The majority of women received tamoxifen as their endocrine therapy. It is not certain if any of the observed benefits of chemotherapy are attributable to ovarian function suppression and if they could be achieved through endocrine therapy. The (NCT00433589) trial tested whether adding MammaPrint genomic risk to a clinical-risk classification (modified from Adjuvant! Online) might guide more appropriate choices of chemotherapy in women with node negative- or 1-to-3 node-positive disease.[][] Unlike the TAILORx study, which only had hormone receptor–positive patients, this trial included hormone receptor–negative patients. In this prospective study, women with both genomic and clinical high-risk classification received chemotherapy, while those with both genomic and clinical low-risk classification did not receive chemotherapy. Participants with discordant results (clinical high-risk- with genomic low-risk classification, or clinical low-risk- with genomic high-risk classification) were randomly assigned to receive or not receive chemotherapy. A total of 1,550 women with high clinical risk and low genomic risk, and 592 women with low clinical risk and high genomic risk, were randomly assigned to receive or not receive chemotherapy. The primary goal of the study was to determine whether patients with high clinical risk, but low genomic risk, who did not receive chemotherapy had a 5-year survival rate without distant metastases (primary study endpoint) of 92% or lower (a noninferiority design). This endpoint was met because the observed rate in the group was 94.7% (95% CI, 92.5%–96.2%). However, among patients with high clinical risk but low genomic risk, the rate of 5-year survival without distant metastases was 1.5% higher in the arm that did receive chemotherapy than in the arm that did not receive chemotherapy, although the study was not powered to detect a difference between these arms (HR chemotherapy vs. no chemotherapy, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.50–1.21; = .27) Patients in the low clinical risk group with high genomic risk did well, and there was little evidence of benefit from chemotherapy in this group (5-year survival without distant metastases, 95.8% with chemotherapy vs. 95.0% without; HR, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.59–2.28; = .66). Results from the prospective, randomized (NCT01272037) trial will help to determine if there is a benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with ER-positive-, node-positive early breast cancer treated with endocrine therapy, and a recurrence score below 25. Many other gene-based assays may guide treatment decisions in patients with early breast cancer (e.g., Predictor Analysis of Microarray 50 [PAM50] Risk of Recurrence [ROR] score, EndoPredict, Breast Cancer Index). Although certain rare inherited mutations, such as those of and , predispose women to develop breast cancer, prognostic data on / mutation carriers who have developed breast cancer are conflicting. These women are at greater risk of developing contralateral breast cancer. (Refer to the Prognosis of - and -related breast cancer section of the PDQ summary for more information.) After careful consideration, patients with severe symptoms may be treated with hormone replacement therapy.

Hum Pathol 35 (9): 1051-2, 2004.  The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system provides a strategy for grouping patients with respect to prognosis. Therapeutic decisions are formulated in part according to staging categories but also according to other clinical factors such as the following, some of which are included in the determination of stage: Estrogen-receptor and progesterone-receptor levels in the tumor tissue. Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2/neu) status in the tumor. The standards used to define biomarker status are described as follows: ER expression is measured primarily by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Any staining of 1% of cells or more is considered positive for ER.[] PR expression is measured primarily by IHC. Any staining of 1% of cells or more is considered positive for PR. HER2 is measured primarily by either IHC to assess expression of the HER2 protein or by hybridization (ISH) to assess gene copy number. The American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of American Pathologists consensus panel has published guidelines for cases when either IHC or ISH testing is equivocal.[] Possible negative results: HER2/chromosome enumeration probe (CEP17) ratio <2.0 copy number <4 Possible equivocal results: (requires performing alternative ISH test to confirm equivocal or IHC if not previously performed) HER2/CEP17 ratio <2.0 copy number ≥4 but <6 Possible positive results: The AJCC has designated staging by TNM (tumor, node, metastasis) classification to define breast cancer.[] The grade of the tumor is determined by its morphologic features, such as tubule formation, nuclear pleomorphism, and mitotic count. Table 2. Definition of Primary Tumor (T) – Clinical and Pathological Reprinted with permission from AJCC: Breast, revised version. In: Amin MB, Edge SB, Greene FL, et al., eds.: . 8th ed. New York, NY: Springer, 2017, pp. 4–96. Lobular carcinoma is a benign entity and is removed from TNM staging in the , 8th ed. Rules for Classification - The anatomic TNM system is a method for coding extent of disease. This is done by assigning a category of extent of disease for the tumor (T), regional lymph nodes (N), and distant metastases (M). T, N, and M are assigned by clinical means and by adding surgical findings and pathological information to the clinical information. The documented prognostic impact of postneoadjuvant extent of disease and response to therapy warrant clear definitions of the use of the prefix and response to therapy. The use of neoadjuvant therapy does not change the clinical (pretreatment) stage. As per TNM rules, the anatomic component of clinical stage is identified with the prefix (e.g., cT). In addition, clinical staging can include the use of fine-needle aspiration (FNA) or core-needle biopsy and sentinel lymph node biopsy before neoadjuvant therapy. These are denoted with the postscripts and , respectively. Nodal metastases confirmed by FNA or core-needle biopsy are classified as macrometastases (cN1), regardless of the size of the tumor focus in the final pathological specimen. For example, if, prior to neoadjuvant systemic therapy, a patient with a 1 cm primary has no palpable nodes but has an ultrasound-guided FNA biopsy of an axillary lymph node that is positive, the patient will be categorized as cN1 (f) for clinical (pretreatment) staging and is assigned to Stage IIA. Likewise, if the patient has a positive axillary sentinel node identified before neoadjuvant systemic therapy, the tumor is categorized as cN1 (sn) (Stage IIA). As per TNM rules, in the absence of pathological T evaluation (removal of the primary tumor), which is identified with prefix (e.g., pT), microscopic evaluation of nodes before neoadjuvant therapy, even by complete removal such as sentinel node biopsy, is still classified as clinical (cN). Paget disease of the nipple NOT associated with invasive carcinoma and/or DCIS in the underlying breast parenchyma. Carcinomas in the breast parenchyma associated with Paget disease are categorized based on the size and characteristics of the parenchymal disease, although the presence of Paget disease should still be noted. Tumor >1 mm but ≤5 mm in greatest dimension (round any measurement >1.0–1.9 mm to 2 mm). Tumor of any size with direct extension to the chest wall and/or to the skin (ulceration or macroscopic nodules); invasion of the dermis alone does not qualify as T4. Extension to the chest wall; invasion or adherence to pectoralis muscle in the absence of invasion of chest wall structures does not qualify as T4. Ulceration and/or ipsilateral macroscopic satellite nodules and/or edema (including peau d'orange) of the skin that does not meet the criteria for inflammatory carcinoma. Inflammatory carcinoma (see Rules for Classification). Table 3. Definition of Regional Lymph Nodes – Clinical (cN) Reprinted with permission from AJCC: Breast, revised version. In: Amin MB, Edge SB, Greene FL, et al., eds.: . 8th ed. New York, NY: Springer, 2017, pp. 4–96. (sn) and (f) suffixes should be added to the N category to denote confirmation of metastasis by sentinel node biopsy or fine-needle aspiration/core needle biopsy, respectively. The cNX category is used sparingly in cases where regional lymph nodes have previously been surgically removed or where there is no documentation of physical examination of the axilla. cN1mi is rarely used but may be appropriate in cases where sentinel node biopsy is performed before tumor resection, most likely to occur in cases treated with neoadjuvant therapy. Regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed (e.g., previously removed). No regional lymph node metastases (by imaging or clinical examination). Metastases to movable ipsilateral Level I, II axillary lymph nodes(s). Micrometastases (approximately 200 cells, >0.2 mm, but ≤2.0 mm). Metastases in ipsilateral Level I, II axillary lymph nodes that are clinically fixed or matted; in ipsilateral internal mammary nodes in the absence of axillary lymph node metastases. Metastases in ipsilateral Level I, II axillary lymph nodes fixed to one another (matted) or to other structures. Metastases only in ipsilateral internal mammary nodes in the absence of axillary lymph node metastases. Metastases in ipsilateral infraclavicular (Level Ill axillary) lymph node(s) with or without Level l, II axillary lymph node involvement; in ipsilateral internal mammary lymph node(s) with Level l, II axillary lymph node metastases; metastases in ipsilateral supraclavicular lymph node(s) with or without axillary or internal mammary lymph node involvement. Metastases in ipsilateral infraclavicular lymph node(s). Metastases in ipsilateral internal mammary lymph node(s) and axillary lymph node(s). Metastases in ipsilateral supraclavicular lymph node(s).

The Anatomic Stage Group table is used in regions of the world where tumor grading and/or biomarker testing for ER, PR, and HER2 are not routinely available. (Refer to .) Clinical Prognostic Stage Group. The Clinical Prognostic Stage Group table is used for all patients in the United States. Patients who have neoadjuvant therapy as their initial treatment should have the clinical prognostic stage and the observed degree of response to treatment recorded, but these patients are not assigned a pathological prognostic stage. (Refer to .) Pathological Prognostic Stage Group. The Pathological Prognostic Stage Group table is used for all patients in the United States who have surgery as initial treatment and have pathological T and N information reported. (Refer to .) In the United States, cancer registries and clinicians must use the Clinical and Pathological Prognostic Stage Group tables for reporting. It is expected that testing is performed for grade, HER2, ER, and PR status and that results are reported for all cases of invasive cancer in the United States.

T2, T3, and T4 tumors with nodal micrometastases (N1mi) are staged using the N1 category. 5. The designation pM0 is not valid; any M0 is clinical. 6. If a patient presents with M1 disease before receiving neoadjuvant systemic therapy, the stage is Stage IV and remains Stage IV regardless of response to neoadjuvant therapy. 7. Stage designation may be changed if postsurgical imaging studies reveal the presence of distant metastases, provided the studies are performed within 4 months of diagnosis in the absence of disease progression, and provided the patient has not received neoadjuvant therapy. 8. Staging following neoadjuvant therapy is denoted with a or prefix to the T and N classification. There is no anatomic stage group assigned if there is a complete pathological response (pCR) to neoadjuvant therapy, for example, ypT0, ypN0, cM0. Any T (Tis, T1, T0, T2, T3, T4; Any N = N0, N1mi, N1, N2, N3, M1) The Clinical Prognostic Stage is used for clinical classification and staging of patients in the United States with invasive breast cancer. It uses TNM information based on the patient’s history, physical examination, imaging results (not required for clinical staging), and biopsies. Table 9.

T1, N1mi, M0, and T0, N1mi, M0 cancers are included for prognostic staging with T1, N0, M0 cancers of the same prognostic factor status. N1 includes N1mi. T2, T3, and T4 cancers and N1mi are included for prognostic staging with T2, N1; T3, N1; and T4, N1, respectively. 1. Because N1mi categorization requires evaluation of the entire node, and cannot be assigned on the basis of an fine-needle aspiration or core biopsy, N1mi can only be used with Clinical Prognostic Staging when clinical staging is based on a resected lymph node in the absence of resection of the primary cancer, such as in the situation where sentinel node biopsy is performed before receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy or endocrine therapy. 2. For cases with lymph node involvement with no evidence of primary tumor (e.g., T0, N1, etc.) or with breast ductal carcinoma (e.g.,Tis, N1, etc.), the grade, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), estrogen receptor, and progesterone receptor information from the tumor in the lymph node should be used for assigning stage group. 3. For cases where HER2 is determined to be by hybridization (fluorescence hybridization or chromogenic hybridization) testing under the 2013 American Society of Clinical Oncologists/College of American Pathologists HER2 testing guidelines, the HER2- category should be used for staging in the Pathological Prognostic Stage Group table.[,] 4. The prognostic value of these Prognostic Stage Groups is based on populations of persons with breast cancer that have been offered and mostly treated with appropriate endocrine and/or systemic chemotherapy (including anti–HER2 therapy).

It includes all information used for clinical staging, surgical findings, and pathological findings following surgery to remove the tumor. Pathological Prognostic Stage is not used for patients treated with neoadjuvant therapy before surgery to remove the tumor.[] Table 10.

Modified radical mastectomy (removal of the entire breast with axillary dissection of levels I and II) with or without breast reconstruction and sentinel node biopsy with or without axillary lymph node dissection for positive SLNs. Axillary node–negative breast cancer (postmastectomy): Axillary node–positive breast cancer (postmastectomy): For one to three nodes, the role of regional radiation therapy to the infra/supraclavicular nodes, internal mammary nodes, axillary nodes, and chest wall is unclear. For four or more nodes or extranodal involvement, regional radiation therapy is advised. Axillary node–negative or positive breast cancer (post–breast-conserving therapy): Therapy depends on many factors including stage, grade, molecular status of the tumor (e.g., estrogen receptor [ER], progesterone receptor [PR], human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 [HER2/neu], or triple-negative [ER-negative, PR-negative, and HER2/neu–negative] status). Adjuvant treatment options may include the following: Stages I, II, IIIA, and operable IIIC breast cancer often require a multimodal approach to treatment. The diagnostic biopsy and surgical procedure that will be used as primary treatment should be performed as two separate procedures: In many cases, the diagnosis of breast carcinoma is made by core needle biopsy. After the presence of a malignancy is confirmed by biopsy, the following surgical treatment options can be discussed with the patient before a therapeutic procedure is selected: Modified radical mastectomy (removal of the entire breast with axillary dissection of levels I and II) with or without breast reconstruction. To guide the selection of adjuvant therapy, many factors including stage, grade, and molecular status of the tumor (e.g., ER, PR, HER2/neu, or triple-negative status) are considered.[-] Selection of a local therapeutic approach depends on the following:[] Options for surgical management of the primary tumor include the following: All histologic types of invasive breast cancer may be treated with breast-conserving surgery plus radiation therapy.[] However, the presence of inflammatory breast cancer, regardless of histologic subtype, is a contraindication to breast-conserving therapy. The presence of multifocal disease in the breast and a history of collagen vascular disease are relative contraindications to breast-conserving therapy. Surgical staging of the axilla should also be performed. Survival is equivalent with any of these options, as documented in the trial of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) (EORTC-10801) [] and other prospective randomized trials.[-] Also, a retrospective study of 753 patients who were divided into three groups based on hormone receptor status (ER positive or PR positive; ER negative and PR negative but HER2/neu positive; and triple negative) found no differences in disease control within the breast in patients treated with standard breast-conserving surgery; however, there are not yet substantive data to support this finding.[] The rate of local recurrence in the breast after conservative treatment is low and varies slightly with the surgical technique used (e.g., lumpectomy, quadrantectomy, segmental mastectomy, and others). Whether completely clear microscopic margins are necessary has been debated.[-] However, a multidisciplinary consensus panel recently used margin width and ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence from a meta-analysis of 33 studies (N = 28,162 patients) as the primary evidence base for a new consensus regarding margins in stage I and stage II breast cancer patients treated with breast-conserving surgery plus radiation therapy. Results of the meta-analysis include the following:[] Positive margins (ink on invasive carcinoma or ductal carcinoma ) were associated with a twofold increase in the risk of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence compared with negative margins. More widely clear margins were not found to significantly decrease the rate of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence compared with no ink on tumor. Thus, it was recommended that the use of no ink on tumor be the new standard for an adequate margin in invasive cancer. There was no evidence that more widely clear margins reduced ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence for young patients or for those with unfavorable biology, lobular cancers, or cancers with an extensive intraductal component. For patients undergoing partial mastectomy, margins may be positive after primary surgery, often leading to re-excision. A clinical trial of 235 patients with stage 0 to III breast cancer who underwent partial mastectomy, with or without resection of selective margins, randomly assigned patients to have additional cavity shave margins resected (shave group) or not (no-shave group).[] Patients in the shave group had a significantly lower rate of positive margins than those in the no-shave group (19% vs. 34%, = .01) and a lower rate of second surgery for clearing margins (10% vs. 21%, = .02).[][] Axillary node status remains the most important predictor of outcome in breast cancer patients. Evidence is insufficient to recommend that lymph node staging can be omitted in most patients with invasive breast cancer. Several groups have attempted to define a population of women in whom the probability of nodal metastasis is low enough to preclude axillary node biopsy. In these single-institution case series, the prevalence of positive nodes in patients with T1a tumors ranged from 9% to 16%.[,] Another series reported the incidence of axillary node relapse in patients with T1a tumors treated without axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) was 2%.[][] The axillary lymph nodes are staged to aid in determining prognosis and therapy. SLN biopsy is the initial standard axillary staging procedure performed in women with invasive breast cancer. The SLN is defined as any node that receives drainage directly from the primary tumor; therefore, allowing for more than one SLN, which is often the case. Studies have shown that the injection of technetium Tc 99m-labeled sulfur colloid, vital blue dye, or both around the tumor or biopsy cavity, or in the subareolar area, and subsequent drainage of these compounds to the axilla results in the identification of the SLN in 92% to 98% of patients.[,] These reports demonstrate a 97.5% to 100% concordance between SLN biopsy and complete ALND.[-] Because of the following body of evidence, SLN biopsy is the standard initial surgical staging procedure of the axilla for women with invasive breast cancer. SLN biopsy alone is associated with less morbidity than axillary lymphadenectomy. A randomized trial of 1,031 women compared SLN biopsy followed by ALND when the SLN was positive with ALND in all patients.[][] Quality of life (QOL) at 1 year (as assessed by the frequency of patients experiencing a clinically significant deterioration in the Trial Outcome Index of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast scale) was superior in the SLN biopsy group (23% deteriorating in the SLN biopsy group vs. 35% in the ALND group; = .001). Arm function was also better in the SLN group. The National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project’s ( [NCT00003830]) multicenter, phase III trial randomly assigned women (N = 5,611) to undergo either SLN plus ALND or SLN resection alone, with ALND only if the SLNs were positive.[][] The study showed no detectable difference in overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and regional control. OS was 91.8% for SLN plus ALND versus 90.3% for SLN resection alone ( = .12). Because of the following trial results, ALND is unnecessary after a positive SLN biopsy in patients with limited SLN-positive breast cancer treated with breast conservation or mastectomy, radiation, and systemic therapy. Evidence (ALND after a positive SLN biopsy in patients with limited SLN-positive breast cancer): A multicenter, randomized clinical trial sought to determine whether ALND is required after an SLN biopsy reveals an SLN metastasis of breast cancer. This phase III noninferiority trial planned to randomly assign 1,900 women with clinical T1 or T2 invasive breast cancer without palpable adenopathy and with one to two SLNs containing metastases identified by frozen section to undergo ALND or no further axillary treatment. All patients underwent lumpectomy, tangential whole-breast radiation therapy, and appropriate systemic therapy; OS was the primary endpoint. Because of enrollment challenges, a total of 891 women out of a target enrollment of 1,900 women were randomly assigned to one of the two treatment arms.[][] At a median follow-up of 6.3 years, 5-year OS was 91.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 89.1%–94.5%) with ALND and 92.5% (95% CI, 90.0–95.1%) with SLN biopsy alone. The secondary endpoint of 5-year DFS was 82.2% (95% CI, 78.3%–86.3%) with ALND and 83.9% (95% CI, 80.2%–87.9%) with SLN biopsy alone. In a similarly designed trial, 929 women with breast tumors smaller than 5 cm and SLN involvement smaller than 2 mm were randomly assigned to ALND or no ALND.[][] Patients without axillary dissection had fewer DFS events (hazard ratio [HR], 0.78; 95% CI, 0.55–1.11). The (NCT00014612) trial studied ALND and axillary radiation therapy after identification of a positive sentinel node.[][] ALND and axillary radiation therapy provided excellent and comparable axillary control for patients with T1 or T2 primary breast cancer and no palpable lymphadenopathy who underwent breast-conserving therapy or mastectomy. The use of axillary radiation therapy was also associated with significantly less morbidity. For patients who require an ALND, the standard evaluation usually involves only a level I and II dissection, thereby removing a satisfactory number of nodes for evaluation (i.e., at least 6–10), while reducing morbidity from the procedure. For patients who opt for a total mastectomy, reconstructive surgery may be performed at the time of the mastectomy (i.e., immediate reconstruction) or at some subsequent time (i.e., delayed reconstruction).[-] Breast contour can be restored by the following: Submuscular insertion of an artificial implant (silicone- or saline-filled). If an immediate implant cannot technically be performed, a tissue expander can be inserted beneath the pectoral muscle. Saline is injected into the expander to stretch the tissues for a period of weeks or months until the desired volume is obtained. The tissue expander is then replaced by a permanent implant. (Visit the U. S. Food and Drug Administration's [] website for more information on breast implants.) Muscle flaps require a considerably more complicated and prolonged operative procedure, and blood transfusions may be required. After breast reconstruction, radiation therapy can be delivered to the chest wall and regional nodes in either the adjuvant or local recurrent disease setting. Radiation therapy after reconstruction with a breast prosthesis may affect cosmesis, and the incidence of capsular fibrosis, pain, or the need for implant removal may be increased.[] Radiation therapy is regularly employed after breast-conserving surgery. Radiation therapy is also indicated for high-risk postmastectomy patients. The main goal of adjuvant radiation therapy is to eradicate residual disease thus reducing local recurrence.[] For women who are treated with breast-conserving surgery without radiation therapy, the risk of recurrence in the conserved breast is substantial (>20%) even in confirmed axillary lymph node–negative women.[] Although all trials assessing the role of radiation therapy in breast-conserving therapy have shown highly statistically significant reductions in local recurrence rate, no single trial has demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in mortality. However, a large meta-analysis demonstrated a significant reduction in risk of recurrence and breast cancer death.[] Thus, evidence supports the use of whole-breast radiation therapy after breast-conserving surgery. Evidence (breast-conserving surgery followed by radiation therapy): A 2011 meta-analysis of 17 clinical trials performed by the Early Breast Cancer Trialists’ Collaborative Group (EBCTCG), which included over 10,000 women with early-stage breast cancer, supported whole-breast radiation therapy after breast-conserving surgery.[][] Whole-breast radiation therapy resulted in a significant reduction in the 10-year risk of recurrence compared with breast-conserving surgery alone (19% for whole-breast radiation therapy vs. 35% for breast-conserving surgery alone; relative risk (RR) = 0.52; 95% CI, 0.48–0.56) and a significant reduction in the 15-year risk of breast cancer death (21% for whole-breast radiation therapy vs. 25% for breast-conserving surgery alone; RR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.75–0.90). Regarding radiation dosing and schedule, the following has been noted: Conventional whole-breast radiation therapy is delivered to the whole breast (with or without regional lymph nodes) in 1.8 Gy to 2 Gy daily fractions over about 5 to 6 weeks to a total dose of 45 Gy to 50 Gy. A further radiation boost is commonly given to the tumor bed. Two randomized trials conducted in Europe have shown that using boosts of 10 Gy to 16 Gy reduces the risk of local recurrence from 4.6% to 3.6% at 3 years ( = .044),[][] and from 7.3% to 4.3% at 5 years ( < .001).[][] Results were similar after a median follow-up of 17.2 years.[][] If a boost is used, it can be delivered either by external-beam radiation therapy, generally with electrons, or by using an interstitial radioactive implant.[] Administering a radiation boost may, however, be associated with unfavorable quality-of-life outcomes.[] Some studies show that a shorter fractionation schedule of 42.5 Gy over 3 to 4 weeks is a reasonable alternative for some breast cancer patients. A noninferiority trial of 1,234 randomly assigned patients with node-negative invasive breast cancer analyzed locoregional recurrence rates with conventional whole-breast radiation therapy versus a shorter fractionation schedule.[] The 10-year locoregional relapse rate among women who received shorter fractionation was not inferior to conventional whole-breast radiation therapy (6.2% for a shorter fractionation schedule vs. 6.7% for whole-breast radiation therapy with absolute difference, 0.5 percentage points; 95% CI, −2.5 to 3.5).[][ Similarly, a combined analysis of the randomized United Kingdom Standardisation of Breast Radiotherapy trials (START), (START-A [ISRCTN59368779]) and START-B [ISRCTN59368779]), which collectively randomly assigned 4,451 women with completely excised invasive (pT1–3a, pN0–1, M0) early-stage breast cancer after breast-conserving surgery to receive conventional whole-breast radiation therapy dosing or shorter fractionation, revealed no difference in a 10-year locoregional relapse rate.[][] A meta-analysis that included the three trials mentioned above plus six others confirmed that differences with respect to local recurrence or cosmesis between shorter and conventional fractionation schedules were neither statistically nor clinically significant.[] Additional studies are needed to determine whether shorter fractionation is appropriate for women with higher nodal disease burden.[] Regional nodal irradiation is routinely given postmastectomy to patients with involved lymph nodes; however, its role in patients who have breast-conserving surgery and whole-breast irradiation has been less clear. A randomized trial () of 1,832 women showed that administering regional nodal irradiation after breast-conserving surgery and whole-breast irradiation reduces the risk of recurrence (10-year DFS, 82.0% vs. 77.0%; HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.61–0.94; = .01) but does not affect survival (10-year OS, 82.8% vs. 81.8%; HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.72–1.13; = .38).[][] Similar findings were reported from the EORTC trial (). Women with a centrally or medially located primary tumor with or without axillary node involvement, or an externally located tumor with axillary involvement, were randomly assigned to receive whole-breast or thoracic-wall irradiation in addition to regional nodal irradiation or not. Breast-conserving surgery was performed for 76.1% of the study population, and the remaining study population underwent mastectomy. No improvement in OS was seen at 10 years among patients who underwent regional nodal irradiation when compared with patients who did not undergo regional nodal radiation (82.3% vs. 80.7%, = .06). Distant DFS was improved among patients who underwent regional nodal irradiation when compared with patients who did not undergo regional nodal irradiation (78% vs. 75%, = .02).[][] A meta-analysis that combined the results of the two trials mentioned above found a marginally statistically significant difference in OS (HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.78–0.99; = .034; absolute difference, 1.6% at 5 years).[] Postoperative chest wall and regional lymph node adjuvant radiation therapy has traditionally been given to selected patients considered at high risk for locoregional failure after mastectomy. Patients at highest risk for local recurrence have one or more of the following:[-] Very close or positive deep margins of resection of the primary tumor. In this high-risk group, radiation therapy can decrease locoregional recurrence, even among those patients who receive adjuvant chemotherapy.[] Patients with one to three involved nodes without any of the high-risk factors are at low risk of local recurrence, and the value of routine use of adjuvant radiation therapy in this setting is unclear. Evidence (postoperative radiation therapy in patients with one to three involved lymph nodes): The 2005 EBCTCG meta-analysis of 42,000 women in 78 randomized treatment comparisons indicated that radiation therapy is beneficial, regardless of the number of lymph nodes involved.[][] For women with node-positive disease postmastectomy and axillary clearance (removal of axillary lymph nodes and surrounding fat), radiation therapy reduced the 5-year local recurrence risk from 23% to 6% (absolute gain, 17%; 95% CI, 15.2%–18.8%). This translated into a significant reduction ( = .002) in breast cancer mortality, 54.7% versus 60.1%, with an absolute gain of 5.4% (95% CI, 2.9%–7.9%). In subgroup analyses, the 5-year local recurrence rate was reduced by 12% (95% CI, 8%–16%) for women with one to three involved lymph nodes and by 14% (95% CI, 10%–18%) for women with four or more involved lymph nodes. In an updated meta-analysis of 1,314 women with axillary dissection and one to three positive nodes, radiation therapy reduced locoregional recurrence (2 [2-sided significance level] < .00001), overall recurrence (RR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.57–0.82; 2 = .00006), and breast cancer mortality (RR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.67–0.95; 2 = .01).[][] In contrast, for women at low risk of local recurrence with node-negative disease, the absolute reduction in 5-year local recurrence was only 4% ( = .002; 95% CI, 1.8%–6.2%), and there was not a statistically significant reduction in 15-year breast cancer mortality (absolute gain, 1.0%; > .1; 95% CI, -0.8%–2.8%). Further, an analysis of NSABP trials showed that even in patients with large (>5 cm) primary tumors and negative axillary lymph nodes, the risk of isolated locoregional recurrence was low enough (7.1%) that routine locoregional radiation therapy was not warranted.[] The optimal sequence of adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy after breast-conserving surgery has been studied. Based on the following studies, delaying radiation therapy for several months after breast-conserving surgery until the completion of adjuvant chemotherapy does not appear to have a negative impact on overall outcome. Additionally, initiating chemotherapy soon after breast-conserving surgery may be preferable for patients at high risk of distant dissemination. Evidence (timing of postoperative radiation therapy): In a randomized trial, patients received one of the following regimens:[][] Chemotherapy first (n = 122), consisting of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracil (5-FU), and prednisone (CMFP) plus doxorubicin repeated every 21 days for four cycles, followed by breast radiation. Breast radiation first (n = 122), followed by the same chemotherapy. With a median follow-up of 5 years, OS was 73% for the radiation-first group and 81% for the chemotherapy-first group ( = .11). The 5-year crude rate of first recurrence by site was 5% in the radiation-first group and 14% in the chemotherapy-first group for local recurrence and 32% in the radiation-first group and 20% in the chemotherapy-first group for distant or regional recurrence or both. This difference in the pattern of recurrence was of borderline statistical significance ( = .07). Further analyses revealed that differences in recurrence patterns persisted for most subgroups except for those who had either negative tumor margins or one to three positive lymph nodes. For these two subgroups, sequence assignment made little difference in local or distant recurrence rates, although the statistical power of these subgroup analyses was low. Potential explanations for the increase in distant recurrence noted in the radiation-first group are that chemotherapy was delayed for a median of 17 weeks after surgery, and that this group received lower chemotherapy dosages because of increased myelosuppression. Two additional randomized trials, though not specifically designed to address the timing of radiation therapy and adjuvant chemotherapy, do add useful information. In the NSABP-B-15 trial, patients who had undergone breast-conserving surgery received either one course of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-FU (CMF) (n = 194) followed by radiation therapy followed by five additional cycles of CMF, or they received four cycles of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC) (n = 199) followed by radiation therapy.[][] No differences in DFS, distant DFS, and OS were observed between these two arms. The International Breast Cancer Study Group trials VI and VII also varied the timing of radiation therapy with CMF adjuvant chemotherapy and reported results similar to NSABP-B-15.[] These studies showed that delaying radiation therapy for 2 to 7 months after surgery had no effect on the rate of local recurrence. These findings have been confirmed in a meta-analysis.[][] In an unplanned analysis of patients treated on a phase III trial evaluating the benefit of adding trastuzumab in HER2/neu–positive breast cancer patients, there was no associated increase in acute adverse events or frequency of cardiac events in patients who received concurrent adjuvant radiation therapy and trastuzumab.[] Therefore, delivering radiation therapy concomitantly with trastuzumab appears to be safe and avoids additional delay in radiation therapy treatment initiation. Late toxic effects of radiation therapy are uncommon and can be minimized with current radiation delivery techniques and with careful delineation of the target volume. Late effects of radiation include the following: In a retrospective analysis of 1,624 women treated with conservative surgery and adjuvant breast radiation at a single institution, the overall incidence of symptomatic radiation pneumonitis was 1.0% at a median follow-up of 77 months.[] The incidence of pneumonitis increased to 3.0% with the use of a supraclavicular radiation field and to 8.8% when concurrent chemotherapy was administered. The incidence was only 1.3% in patients who received sequential chemotherapy.[][] Controversy existed as to whether adjuvant radiation therapy to the left chest wall or breast, with or without inclusion of the regional lymphatics, was associated with increased cardiac mortality. In women treated with radiation therapy before 1980, an increased cardiac death rate was noted after 10 to 15 years, compared with women with nonradiated or right-side-only radiated breast cancer.[,-] This was probably caused by the radiation received by the left myocardium. Modern radiation therapy techniques introduced in the 1990s minimized deep radiation to the underlying myocardium when left-sided chest wall or left-breast radiation was used. Cardiac mortality decreased accordingly.[,] An analysis of the National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (SEER) data from 1973 to 1989 that reviewed deaths caused by ischemic heart disease in women who received breast or chest wall radiation showed that since 1980, no increased death rate resulting from ischemic heart disease in women who received left chest wall or breast radiation was found.[,][] Lymphedema remains a major quality-of-life concern for breast cancer patients. Single-modality treatment of the axilla (surgery or radiation) is associated with a low incidence of arm edema. In patients who receive axillary dissection, adjuvant radiation therapy increases the risk of arm edema. Edema occurs in 2% to 10% of patients who receive axillary dissection alone compared with 13% to 18% of patients who receive axillary dissection and adjuvant radiation therapy.[-] (Refer to the PDQ summary on for more information.) Radiation injury to the brachial plexus after adjuvant nodal radiation therapy is a rare clinical entity for breast cancer patients. In a single-institution study using current radiation techniques, 449 breast cancer patients treated with postoperative radiation therapy to the breast and regional lymphatics were monitored for 5.5 years to assess the rate of brachial plexus injury.[] The diagnosis of such injury was made clinically with computerized tomography (CT) to distinguish radiation injury from tumor recurrence. When 54 Gy in 30 fractions was delivered to the regional nodes, the incidence of symptomatic brachial plexus injury was 1.0%, compared with 5.9% when increased fraction sizes (45 Gy in 15 fractions) were used. One report suggested an increase in contralateral breast cancer for women younger than 45 years who received chest wall radiation therapy after mastectomy.[] No increased risk of contralateral breast cancer occurred in women aged 45 years and older who received radiation therapy.[] Techniques to minimize the radiation dose to the contralateral breast are used to keep the absolute risk as low as possible.[] The rate of second malignancy after adjuvant radiation therapy is very low. Sarcomas in the treated field are rare, with a long-term risk of 0.2% at 10 years.[] In nonsmokers, the risk of lung cancer as a result of radiation exposure during treatment is minimal when current dosimetry techniques are used. Smokers, however, may have a small increased risk of lung cancer in the ipsilateral lung.[] The (NCT00282035) trial randomly assigned 2,135 women aged 40 years or older with ductal carcinoma or node-negative breast cancer treated by breast conserving surgery to receive either external-beam accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) (38.5 Gy in ten fractions delivered twice per day over 5–8 days) or whole-breast irradiation (42.5 Gy in 16 fractions delivered once per day over 21 days, or 50 Gy in 25 fractions once per day over 35 days).[] Sixty-five ipsilateral breast tumor recurrences were observed, 37 in the APBI group, and 28 in the whole-breast irradiation group. In patients treated with APBI, the 5-year cumulative rate of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence was 2.3% (95% CI, 1.4%–3.2%) and the 8-year cumulative rate was 3.0% (95% CI, 1.9–4.0). In patients treated with whole-breast irradiation, the 5-year cumulative rate of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence was 1.7% (range, 0.9%–2.5%) and the 8-year cumulative rate was 2.8% (range, 1.8%–3.9%). The HR for APBI versus whole-breast irradiation was 1.27 (90% CI, 0.84–1.91). Thus, the upper bound of the estimated 90% CI did not exceed the noninferiority margin of 2.02. The APBI arm was associated with less short-term, but more long-term toxicity.[][] The (NCT00103181) trial randomly assigned 4,216 women to whole-breast irradiation or APBI.[] Whole-breast irradiation was delivered in 25 daily fractions of 50 Gy over 5 weeks, with or without a supplemental boost to the tumor bed, and APBI was delivered as 34 Gy of brachytherapy or 38.5 Gy of external-bream radiation therapy in 10 fractions, over 5 treatment days within an 8-day period. At a median follow-up of 10.2 years (interquartile range, 7.5–11.5), 90 (4%) of 2,089 women eligible for the primary outcome in the APBI group and 71 (3%) of 2,036 women in the whole-breast irradiation group had an ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (HR, 1.22; 90% CI, 0.94–1.58). The results did not meet the prespecified criterion for equivalence, an HR of 1.50 or less. Toxicity was not substantially different between the arms.[][] Stage and molecular features determine the need for adjuvant systemic therapy and the choice of modalities used. For example, hormone receptor (ER and/or PR)–positive patients will receive hormone therapy. HER2 overexpression is an indication for using adjuvant trastuzumab, usually in combination with chemotherapy. When neither HER2 overexpression nor hormone receptors are present (i.e., ), adjuvant therapy relies on chemotherapeutic regimens, which may be combined with investigational targeted approaches. An international consensus panel proposed a risk classification system and systemic therapy treatment options.[] This classification, with some modification, is described below: Table 11. Systemic Treatment for Early Breast Cancer by Subtype HER2 = human epidermal growth factor receptor 2; LN = lymph node; PR = progesterone receptor. Use endocrine therapy if also hormone receptor–positive May consider omitting chemotherapy plus anti-HER2 for small node-negative tumors May consider omitting chemotherapy for small node-negative tumors The selection of therapy is most appropriately based on knowledge of an individual’s risk of tumor recurrence balanced against the short-term and long-term risks of adjuvant treatment. This approach allows clinicians to help individuals determine if the gains anticipated from treatment are reasonable for their situation. The treatment options described below should be modified based on both patient and tumor characteristics. Table 12. Adjuvant Systemic Treatment Options for Women With Stages I, II, IIIA, and Operable IIIC Breast Cancer ER = estrogen receptor; PR = progesterone receptor. Premenopausal, hormone receptor–positive (ER or PR) Ovarian function suppression plus aromatase inhibitor Premenopausal, hormone receptor–negative (ER or PR) Postmenopausal, hormone receptor–positive (ER or PR) Upfront aromatase inhibitor therapy or tamoxifen followed by aromatase inhibitor with or without chemotherapy Postmenopausal, hormone receptor–negative (ER or PR) Adjuvant chemotherapy 1970s to 2000: Anthracycline-based regimens versus cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-FU (CMF) The EBCTCG meta-analysis analyzed 11 trials that began from 1976 to 1989 in which women were randomly assigned to receive regimens containing anthracyclines (e.g., doxorubicin or epirubicin) or CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-FU). The result of the overview analysis comparing CMF and anthracycline-containing regimens suggested a slight advantage for the anthracycline regimens in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women.[] The EBCTCG overview analysis directly compared anthracycline-containing regimens (mostly 6 months of 5-FU, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide [FEC] or fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide [FAC]) with CMF (either PO or intravenous [IV]) in approximately 14,000 women, 64% of whom were younger than 50 years.[] Compared with CMF, anthracycline-based regimens were associated with a modest but statistically significant 11% proportional reduction in the annual risk of disease recurrence, and a 16% reduction in the annual risk of death. In each case, the absolute difference in outcomes between anthracycline-based and CMF-type chemotherapy was about 3% at 5 years and 4% at 10 years.[][] Of note, few women older than 70 years were studied, and specific conclusions could not be reached for this age group. Importantly, these data were derived from clinical trials in which patients were not selected for adjuvant therapy according to hormone-receptor status, and the trials were initiated before the advent of taxane-containing, dose-dense, or trastuzumab-based therapy.[] As a result, the data may not reflect treatment outcomes based on evolving treatment patterns. Study results suggest that tumor characteristics (i.e., node-positive breast cancer with HER2/neu overexpression) may predict anthracycline-responsiveness. Evidence (anthracycline-based regimen in women with HER2/neu amplification): Data from retrospective analyses of randomized clinical trials suggest that, in patients with node-positive breast cancer, the benefit from standard-dose versus lower-dose adjuvant cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and 5-FU (CAF),[] or the addition of doxorubicin to the adjuvant regimen,[] is restricted to those patients whose tumors overexpress HER2/neu.[] A retrospective analysis of the HER2/neu status of 710 premenopausal, node-positive women was undertaken to see the effects of adjuvant chemotherapy with CMF or cyclophosphamide, epirubicin, and 5-FU(CEF).[][] HER2/neu was measured using fluorescence hybridization, polymerase chain reaction, and immunohistochemical methods. The study confirmed previous data indicating that the amplification of HER2/neu was associated with a decrease in relapse-free survival (RFS) and OS. In patients with HER2/neu amplification, the RFS and OS were increased by CEF. In the absence of HER2/neu amplification, CEF and CMF were similar with regard to RFS (HR for relapse, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.71–1.18; = .049) and OS (HR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.83–1.44; = .68). Similar results were seen in a meta-analysis that included 5,354 patients in whom HER2 status was known from eight randomized trials (including the one just described) comparing anthracycline-containing regimens with non–anthracycline-containing regimens.[] Adjuvant chemotherapy 2000s to present: The role of adding taxanes to adjuvant therapy Several trials have addressed the benefit of adding a taxane (paclitaxel or docetaxel) to an anthracycline-based adjuvant chemotherapy regimen for women with node-positive breast cancer. Evidence (adding a taxane to an anthracycline-based regimen): A literature-based meta-analysis of 13 studies demonstrated that the inclusion of a taxane improved both DFS and OS (DFS: HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.79–0.87; < .001; OS: HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.79–0.91; < .001).[][] Five-year absolute survival differences were 5% for DFS and 3% for OS in favor of taxane-containing regimens. There were no differences in benefit observed in patient subsets defined by nodal status, hormone-receptor status, or age and menopausal status. There was also no apparent difference in efficacy between the two agents. However, none of the studies that were reviewed involved a direct comparison between paclitaxel and docetaxel. A U.S. intergroup study (CLB-9344 [NT00897026]) randomly assigned women with node-positive tumors to three dose levels of doxorubicin (60, 75, and 90 mg/m) and a fixed dose of cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m) every 3 weeks for four cycles. After AC (doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide) chemotherapy, patients were randomly assigned for a second time to receive paclitaxel (175 mg/m) every 3 weeks for four cycles or no further therapy, and women with hormone receptor-positive tumors also received tamoxifen for 5 years.[][] Although the dose-escalation of doxorubicin was not beneficial, the addition of paclitaxel resulted in statistically significant improvements in DFS (5%) and OS (3%). The NSABP-B-28 (NCT01420185) trial randomly assigned 3,060 women with node-positive breast cancer to receive four cycles of postoperative AC or four cycles of AC followed by four cycles of paclitaxel. Women younger than 50 years with receptor-positive disease and all women older than 50 years received tamoxifen.[][] DFS was significantly improved by the addition of paclitaxel (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.72–0.96; = .006; 5-year DFS, 76% vs. 72%). The difference in OS was small (HR, 0.93), however, and not statistically significant ( = .46). In the Breast Cancer International Research Group's trial (BCIRG-001), the FAC regimen was compared with the docetaxel plus doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (TAC) regimen in 1,491 women with node-positive disease. Six cycles of either regimen were given as adjuvant postoperative therapy.[,][] There was a 75% DFS rate at 5 years in the TAC group compared with a 68% DFS rate in the FAC group ( = .001). TAC was associated with a 30% overall lower risk of death (5% absolute difference) than was FAC (HR, 0.70; 98% CI, 0.53–0.91; < .008). Anemia, neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, and infections were more common in the TAC group. No deaths were associated with infections in either group. (Refer to the PDQ summary on for information on anemia.) An Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group–led intergroup trial ( [NCT00004125]) involving 4,950 patients compared, in a factorial design, two schedules (weekly and every 3 weeks) of the two drugs (docetaxel vs. paclitaxel) after standard-dose AC chemotherapy given every 3 weeks.[][] Study findings include the following: There was no difference observed in the overall comparison with regard to DFS of docetaxel to paclitaxel (odds ratio [OR], 1.03; 95% CI, 0.91–1.16; = .61) or between the 1-week and 3-week schedules (OR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.94–1.20; = .33). There was a significant association between the drug administered and schedule for both DFS (0.003) and OS (0.01). Thus, compared with paclitaxel given every 3 weeks, paclitaxel given weekly improved both DFS (OR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.01–1.57; = .006) and OS (OR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.02–1.72; = .01). Docetaxel given every 3 weeks was also superior in DFS to paclitaxel given every 3 weeks (OR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.00–1.52; = .02), but the difference was not statistically significant for OS (OR, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.88–1.46; = .25). Docetaxel given weekly was not superior to paclitaxel given every 3 weeks. There was no stated basis for expecting that varying the schedule of administration would have opposite effects for the two drugs. Historically, adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer was given on an every 3-week schedule. Studies sought to determine whether decreasing the duration between chemotherapy cycles could improve clinical outcomes. The overall results of these studies support the use of dose-dense chemotherapy for women with HER2-negative breast cancer. Evidence (administration of dose-dense chemotherapy in women with HER2-negative breast cancer): A U.S. intergroup trial ( [NCT00003088]) of 2,005 node-positive patients compared, in a 2 × 2 factorial design, the use of concurrent AC followed by paclitaxel with sequential doxorubicin, paclitaxel, and cyclophosphamide given every 2 weeks with filgrastim or every 3 weeks.[][] At a median follow-up of 68 months, dose-dense treatment improved DFS, the primary end point, in all patient populations (HR, 0.80; = .018), but not OS (HR, 0.85; = .12).[][] There was no interaction between density and sequence. Severe neutropenia was less frequent in patients who received the dose-dense regimens.[][] An Italian trial () compared two versus three weekly doses of epirubicin plus cyclophosphamide (with or without 5-FU) in a factorial design, with a result similar to a U.S. intergroup trial; however, this trial also demonstrated a difference in OS.[] For the dose-density comparison, DFS at 5 years was 81% (95% CI, 79–84) in patients treated every 2 weeks and 76% (95% CI, 74–79) in patients treated every 3 weeks (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.65–0.92; = .004). OS rates at 5 years were 94% (95% CI, 93–96) and 89% (95% CI, 87–91; HR, 0.65; 0.51–0.84; = .001).[][] A meta-analysis of dose-dense versus standard dosing included data from eight trials including 17,188 patients.[] The patients who received dose-dense chemotherapy had better OS (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.79–0.93; = .0001) and DFS (HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.77–0.91; < .0001) than those on the conventional schedule. A statistically significant OS benefit was observed in patients with ER-negative tumors (HR, 0.8; = .002) but not in those with ER-positive breast cancer (HR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.82–1.05; = .25). A meta-analysis of 26 randomized trials that included 37,298 women treated with anthracycline- and taxane-containing chemotherapy compared standard regimens (administered every 3–4 weeks) with more dose-intense regimens. Regimens that increased dose intensity by shortening the interval between cycles (i.e., dose-dense therapy or administration of the same dose over a shorter time period) and regimens that increased dose intensity by administering individual drugs in sequence to allow for higher doses (i.e., sequential scheduling).[] Patients who received more dose-intense regimens had superior recurrence-free survival (28.0% vs. 31.4%; RR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.82–0.89; < .0001) and OS (18.9% vs. 21.3%; RR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.83–0.92; < .0001) at 10 years. The difference was present and statistically significant in receptor-positive and receptor-negative subgroups. A randomized, phase III, double-blinded study () demonstrated noninferiority for the duration of severe neutropenia of a biosimilar filgrastim, EP2006, compared with the U.S.-licensed product.[][] Docetaxel and cyclophosphamide is an acceptable adjuvant chemotherapy regimen. The regimen of docetaxel and cyclophosphamide (TC) compared with AC (doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide) was studied in 1,016 women with stage I or stage II invasive breast cancer. Patients were randomly assigned to receive four cycles of either TC or AC as adjuvant postoperative therapy.[,][] At 7 years, the DFS and OS demonstrated that four cycles of TC were superior to standard AC for both DFS and OS.[] DFS was significantly superior for TC compared with AC (81% vs. 75%, HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.56–0.98; = .033). OS was significantly superior for TC compared with AC (87% vs. 82%, HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.50–0.97; = .032). Patients had fewer cardiac-related toxic effects with TC than with AC, but they had more myalgia, arthralgia, edema, and febrile neutropenia.[] The optimal time to initiate adjuvant therapy is uncertain. A retrospective, observational study has reported the following: A single-institution study of early-stage breast cancer patients diagnosed between 1997 and 2011 revealed that delays in initiation of adjuvant chemotherapy adversely affected survival outcomes.[][] Initiation of chemotherapy 61 days or more after surgery was associated with adverse outcomes among patients with stage II breast cancer (distant relapse-free survival: HR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.02–1.43) and stage III breast cancer (OS: HR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.26–2.46; RFS: HR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.01–1.76; and distant relapse-free survival: HR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.02–1.80). Patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) tumors and those with HER2-positive tumors treated with trastuzumab who started chemotherapy 61 days or more after surgery had worse survival (TNBC: HR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.09–2.18; HER2-positive: HR, 3.09; 95% CI, 1.49–6.39) than did those who initiated treatment in the first 30 days after surgery. Because of the weaknesses and limitations of this study design, the optimal time to initiate adjuvant chemotherapy remains uncertain. Adjuvant chemotherapy is associated with several well-characterized toxic effects that vary according to the individual drugs used in each regimen. Common toxic effects include the following: Less common, but serious, toxic effects include the following: (Refer to the PDQ summary on ; for information on mucositis, refer to the PDQ summary on Oral Complications of Chemotherapy and Head/Neck Radiation; for information on symptoms associated with premature menopause, refer to the PDQ summary on .) The use of anthracycline-containing regimens, however—particularly those containing an increased dose of cyclophosphamide—has been associated with a cumulative risk of developing acute leukemia of 0.2% to 1.7% at 5 years.[,] This risk increases to more than 4% in patients receiving high cumulative doses of both epirubicin (>720 mg/m) and cyclophosphamide (>6,300 mg/m).[] Cognitive impairment has been reported to occur after the administration of some chemotherapy regimens.[] However, data on this topic from prospective, randomized studies are lacking. The EBCTCG meta-analysis revealed that women who received adjuvant combination chemotherapy did have a 20% (standard deviation = 10) reduction in the annual odds of developing contralateral breast cancer.[] This small proportional reduction translated into an absolute benefit that was marginally statistically significant, but indicated that chemotherapy did not increase the risk of contralateral disease. In addition, the analysis showed no statistically significant increase in deaths attributed to other cancers or to vascular causes among all women randomly assigned to receive chemotherapy. For HER2/neu–negative breast cancer, there is no single adjuvant chemotherapy regimen that is considered standard or superior to another. Preferred regimen options vary by institution, geographic region, and clinician. Some of the most important data on the benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy came from the EBCTCG, which reviews data from global breast cancer trials every 5 years. In the 2011 EBCTCG meta-analysis, adjuvant chemotherapy using an anthracycline-based regimen compared with no treatment revealed significant improvement in the risk of recurrence (RR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.68–0.79), significant reduction in breast cancer mortality (RR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.72–0.85), and significant reduction in overall mortality (RR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.78–0.91), which translated into an absolute survival gain of 5%.[] TNBC is defined as the absence of staining for ER, PR, and HER2/neu. TNBC is insensitive to some of the most effective therapies available for breast cancer treatment including HER2-directed therapy such as trastuzumab and endocrine therapies such as tamoxifen or the aromatase inhibitors. Combination cytotoxic chemotherapy administered in a dose-dense or metronomic schedule remains the standard therapy for early-stage TNBC.[] Evidence (neoadjuvant chemotherapy on a dose-dense or metronomic schedule for TNBC): A prospective analysis studied 1,118 patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy at a single institution, of whom 255 (23%) had TNBC.[][] The study observed that patients with TNBC had higher pathologic complete response (pCR) rates than did non-TNBC patients (22% vs. 11%; = .034). Improved pCR rates may be important because in some studies, pCR is associated with improved long-term outcomes. Platinum agents have emerged as drugs of interest for the treatment of TNBC. However, there is no established role for adding them to the treatment of early-stage TNBC outside of a clinical trial. One trial that treated 28 women with stage II or stage III TNBC with four cycles of neoadjuvant cisplatin resulted in a 22% pCR rate.[][] A randomized clinical trial, (NCT00861705), evaluated the benefit of carboplatin added to paclitaxel and doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting. The (NCT00532727) is evaluating carboplatin versus docetaxel in the metastatic setting. These trials will help to define the role of platinum agents for the treatment of TNBC. Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor agents The PARP inhibitors are being evaluated in clinical trials for patients with mutations and in TNBC.[] PARPs are a family of enzymes involved in multiple cellular processes, including DNA repair. Because TNBC shares multiple clinicopathologic features with -mutated breast cancers, which harbor dysfunctional DNA repair mechanisms, it is possible that PARP inhibition, in conjunction with the loss of DNA repair via BRCA-dependent mechanisms, would result in synthetic lethality and augmented cell death. Treatment options for HER2-positive early breast cancer: Standard treatment for HER2-positive early breast cancer is 1 year of adjuvant trastuzumab therapy. Several phase III clinical trials have addressed the role of the anti-HER2/neu antibody, trastuzumab, as adjuvant therapy for patients with HER2-overexpressing cancers. Study results confirm the benefit of 12 months of adjuvant trastuzumab therapy. The Herceptin Adjuvant (HERA) ( [NCT00045032]) trial examined whether the administration of trastuzumab was effective as adjuvant treatment for HER2-positive breast cancer if used after completion of the primary treatment. For most patients, primary treatment consisted of an anthracycline-containing chemotherapy regimen given preoperatively or postoperatively, plus or minus locoregional radiation therapy. Trastuzumab was given every 3 weeks starting within 7 weeks of the completion of primary treatment.[][] Patients were randomly assigned to one of three study arms: Of the patients in the comparison of 1 year of trastuzumab versus observation group, the median age was 49 years, about 33% had node-negative disease, and nearly 50% had hormone receptor (ER and PR)–negative disease.[] One year of trastuzumab versus observation: After a median follow-up of 11 years,[] the finding was that 1 year of trastuzumab improved DFS (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.68–0.86; 10-year DFS, 72% vs. 66%; < .0001), despite a crossover of 52% of the patients on observation. One year of trastuzumab also improved OS (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.64–0.86; 12-year OS, 79% vs. 73%; < .0001).[][] One year versus 2 years of trastuzumab: After a median follow-up of 11 years, there was no benefit to an additional year of trastuzumab for DFS (HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.89–1.17). Symptomatic cardiac events occurred in 1% of the patients on trastuzumab and in 0.1% of the observation group. In the combined analysis of the (NCT00004067) and intergroup (NCT00005970) trials, trastuzumab was given weekly, concurrently, or immediately after the paclitaxel component of the AC with paclitaxel regimen.[,][] The HERA results were confirmed in a joint analysis of the two studies, with a combined enrollment of 3,676 patients. A highly statistically significant improvement in DFS (HR, 0.48; < .001; 3-year DFS, 87% vs. 75%) was observed, as was a significant improvement in OS (HR, 0.67; = .015; 3-year OS, 94.3% in the trastuzumab group vs. 91.7% in the control group; 4-year OS, 91.4% in the trastuzumab group vs. 86.6% in the control group).[] Patients treated with trastuzumab experienced a longer DFS, with a 52% lower risk of a DFS event (HR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.39–0.59; < .001), corresponding to an absolute difference in DFS of 11.8% at 3 years and 18% at 4 years. The risk of distant recurrence in patients treated with trastuzumab was 53% lower (HR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.37–0.61; < .001), and the risk of death was 33% lower (HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.48–0.93; = .015).[] In an updated analysis with a median follow-up of 8.4 years, the addition of trastuzumab to chemotherapy led to a 37% relative improvement in OS (HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.54–0.73; < .001) and an increase in the 10-year OS rate from 75.2% to 84%.[] In the (NCT00021255) trial, 3,222 women with early-stage HER2-overexpressing breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive AC followed by docetaxel (AC-T), AC followed by docetaxel plus trastuzumab (AC-T plus trastuzumab), or docetaxel, carboplatin, plus trastuzumab (TCH, a non–anthracycline-containing regimen).[][] A significant DFS and OS benefit was seen in both groups treated with trastuzumab compared with the control group that did not receive trastuzumab. For patients receiving AC-T plus trastuzumab, the 5-year DFS rate was 84% (HR for the comparison with AC-T, 0.64; < .001), and the OS rate was 92% (HR, 0.63; < .001). For patients receiving TCH, the 5-year DFS rate was 81% (HR, 0.75; = .04), and the OS rate was 91% (HR, 0.77; = .04). The control group had a 5-year DFS rate of 75% and an OS rate of 87%. The authors stated that there was no significant difference in DFS or OS between the two trastuzumab-containing regimens. However, the study was not powered to detect equivalence between the two trastuzumab-containing regimens. The rates of congestive heart failure (CHF) and cardiac dysfunction were significantly higher in the group receiving AC-T plus trastuzumab than in the TCH group ( < .001). These trial findings raise the question of whether anthracyclines are needed for the adjuvant treatment of HER2-overexpressing breast cancer. The group receiving AC-trastuzumab showed a small but not statistically significant benefit over TCH. This trial supports the use of TCH as an alternative adjuvant regimen for women with early-stage HER2-overexpressing breast cancer, particularly in those with concerns about cardiac toxic effects. The Finland Herceptin (FINHER) study assessed the impact of a much shorter course of trastuzumab. In this trial, 232 women younger than 67 years with node-positive or high-risk (>2 cm tumor size) node-negative HER2-overexpressing breast cancer were given nine weekly infusions of trastuzumab concurrently with docetaxel or vinorelbine followed by FEC.[][] At a 3-year median follow-up, the risk of recurrence and/or death was significantly reduced in patients receiving trastuzumab (HR, 0.41; = .01; 95% CI, 0.21–0.83; 3-year DFS, 89% vs. 78%). The difference in OS (HR, 0.41) was not statistically significant ( = .07; 95% CI, 0.16–1.08). Several studies have compared 6 months of trastuzumab administration to 12 months.[-] In an interim analysis of the (NCT00381901) trial, the 2-year DFS rate was 93.8% (95% CI, 92.6–94.9) in the 12-month group and 91.1% (89.7–92.4) in the 6-month group (HR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.05–1.56; noninferiority, = .29).[][] In the final analysis, after 704 events were observed, the adjusted HR was 1.08 (95% CI, 0.93–1.25), and the prespecified noninferiority HR of 1.15 was not excluded. Similar results were noted in a much smaller study of 481 patients led by the Hellenic Oncology Research Group.[][] In contrast, the (NCT00712140) trial, which enrolled 4,088 patients who experienced 512 DFS events at the time of analysis, excluded its prespecified noninferiority margin (HR, 1.07; 90% CI, 0.93−1.24; noninferiority, = .011).[][] The (NCT00593697) trial compared 9 weeks of trastuzumab to 1 year of trastuzumab in 2,174 women with HER-2 positive breast cancer.[] Noninferiority of the 9-week treatment could not be demonstrated for DFS (HR, 1.39; 2-sided 90% CI, 1.12−1.72).[][] Several studies have evaluated the use of subcutaneous (SQ) trastuzumab in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings. Cardiac events associated with adjuvant trastuzumab have been reported in multiple studies. Key study results include the following: In the HERA () trial, severe CHF (New York Heart Association class III–IV) occurred in 0.6% of patients treated with trastuzumab.[] Symptomatic CHF occurred in 1.7% of patients in the trastuzumab arm and 0.06% of patients in the observation arm. In the (NCT00004067) trial, 31 of 850 patients in the trastuzumab arm had confirmed symptomatic cardiac events, compared with 5 of 814 patients in the control arm.[] The 3-year cumulative incidence of cardiac events for trastuzumab-treated patients was 4.1%, compared with 0.8% of patients in the control arm (95% CI, 1.7%–4.9%). In the trial, 39 cardiac events were reported in the three arms over a 3-year period. The 3-year cumulative incidence of cardiac events was 0.35% in arm A (no trastuzumab), 3.5% in arm B (trastuzumab after paclitaxel), and 2.5% in arm C, (trastuzumab concomitant with paclitaxel). In the (BCIRG 006) (NCT00021255) trial, clinically symptomatic cardiac events were detected in 0.38% of patients in the AC/docetaxel (AC-D) arm, 1.87% of patients in the AC/docetaxel/trastuzumab (AC-DH) arm, and 0.37% of patients in the docetaxel/carboplatin/trastuzumab (DCbH) arm.[] There was also a statistically significant higher incidence of asymptomatic and persistent decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in the AC-DH arm than with either the AC-D or DCbH arms. In the FINHER trial, none of the patients who received trastuzumab experienced clinically significant cardiac events. LVEF was preserved in all of the women receiving trastuzumab, but the number of patients receiving adjuvant trastuzumab was very low.[] Lapatinib is a small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is capable of dual-receptor inhibition of both epidermal growth factor receptor and HER2. There are no data supporting the use of lapatinib as part of adjuvant treatment of early-stage HER2/neu–positive breast cancer. Evidence (against the use of lapatinib for HER2-positive early breast cancer): In the Adjuvant Lapatinib and/or Trastuzumab Treatment Optimization trial ( [NCT00553358]), the role of lapatinib (in combination with, in sequence to, in comparison with, or as an alternative to trastuzumab) in the adjuvant setting was investigated.[][] In the primary analysis, at the median follow-up of 4.5 years (range, 1 day–6.4 years), a 16% reduction in the HR for DFS was observed in the lapatinib-plus-trastuzumab arm, compared with the trastuzumab-alone arm (555 DFS events; HR, 0.84; 97.5% CI, 0.70–1.02; = .048), which was not statistically significant at the .025 significance level. The HR for DFS for the superiority comparison of trastuzumab to lapatinib versus trastuzumab alone in the intention-to-treat population was 0.96 (97.5% CI, 0.80–1.15; = .61). The 4-year OS was 95% for the lapatinib-plus-trastuzumab arm, 95% for the trastuzumab-to-lapatinib arm, and 94% for the trastuzumab-alone arm. The HR for OS was 0.80 (95% CI, 0.62–1.03; = .078) for the comparison of lapatinib plus trastuzumab versus trastuzumab alone and 0.91 (95% CI, 0.71–1.16; = .433) for the comparison of trastuzumab to lapatinib versus trastuzumab alone. The lapatinib-versus-trastuzumab component of the study was closed because, at interim analysis, the HR for DFS was 1.52 in favor of trastuzumab alone and noninferiority was excluded. Combination therapy with lapatinib and trastuzumab also resulted in worsened grade 3 diarrhea (15% vs. 1%), grade 3 rash (5% vs. 1%), and grade 3 hepatobiliary adverse events (3% vs. 1%) compared with trastuzumab alone. Pertuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to a distinct epitope on the extracellular domain of the HER2 receptor and inhibits dimerization. Its use, in combination with trastuzumab, has been evaluated in a randomized trial in the postoperative setting. The Breast Intergroup (BIG) trial enrolled 4,805 women with HER2-positive cancer cells in a blinded comparison study for 12 months of trastuzumab plus placebo versus 12 months of trastuzumab plus pertuzumab, which were given in conjunction with standard chemotherapy and hormone therapy.[] At the time of the final analysis of the primary endpoint (breast cancer, RFS), there was a significant difference in favor of the combination regimen (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.66–1.00; = .045; 3-year invasive DFS, 94.1% vs. 93.2%). There was no statistically significant difference in OS at the first interim analysis for this endpoint. Patients receiving pertuzumab had more grade 3 diarrhea (9.8% vs. 3.7%) and were more likely to develop heart failure (0.6% vs. 0.2%). Neratinib is an irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor of HER1, HER2, and HER4, which has been approved by the FDA for the extended adjuvant treatment of patients with early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer, to follow adjuvant trastuzumab-based therapy. In the (NCT00878709) trial, the safety and efficacy of 12 months of adjuvant neratinib was investigated in patients with early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer (n = 2,840) who had completed neoadjuvant trastuzumab up to 2 years before randomization. Patients received neratinib 240 mg oral daily for 1 year or a placebo.[][] After a median follow-up of 5.2 years (interquartile range, 2.1–5.3), patients in the neratinib group had significantly fewer invasive DFS events than those in the placebo group (neratinib group, 116 events vs. placebo group, 163 events; stratified HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.57–0.92; = .0083). The 5-year invasive DFS was 90.2% (95% CI, 88.3–91.8) in the neratinib group and 87.7% (85.7–89.4) in the placebo group.[] The most common grade 1 to 2 adverse events included diarrhea (neratinib, 55% vs. placebo, 34%), nausea (41% vs. 21%), fatigue (25% vs. 20%), vomiting (23% vs. 8%), and abdominal pain (22% vs. 10%). Prophylactic loperamide is recommended on the FDA label during the first 56 days of therapy, and as needed thereafter to help manage diarrhea. The most common grade 3 to 4 adverse event was diarrhea (neratinib, 40% vs. placebo, 2%). All other grade 3 to 4 adverse events occurred in 2% or less of patients. Much of the evidence presented in the following sections on therapy for women with hormone receptor–positive disease has been considered in an American Society of Clinical Oncology guideline that describes several options for the management of these patients.[] Five years of adjuvant endocrine therapy has been shown to substantially reduce the risks of locoregional and distant recurrence, contralateral breast cancer, and death from breast cancer. The optimal duration of endocrine therapy is unclear, with the preponderance of evidence supporting at least 5 years of endocrine therapy. A meta-analysis of 88 clinical trials involving 62,923 women with hormone receptor–positive breast cancer who were disease free after 5 years of endocrine therapy showed a steady risk of late recurrence 5 to 20 years after diagnosis.[][] The risk of distant recurrence correlated with the original tumor (T) and node (N) status, with risks ranging from 10% to 41%. Tamoxifen has been shown to be of benefit to women with hormone receptor–positive breast cancer. Evidence (tamoxifen for hormone receptor–positive early breast cancer): The EBCTCG performed a meta-analysis of systemic treatment of early breast cancer by hormone, cytotoxic, or biologic therapy methods in randomized trials involving 144,939 women with stage I or stage II breast cancer. An analysis published in 2005 included information on 80,273 women in 71 trials of adjuvant tamoxifen.[][] In this analysis, the benefit of tamoxifen was found to be restricted to women with hormone receptor–positive or hormone receptor–unknown breast tumors. In these women, the 15-year absolute reduction associated with 5 years of use was 12% for recurrence and 9% for mortality. Allocation to approximately 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen reduces the annual breast cancer death rate by 31%, largely irrespective of the use of chemotherapy and of age (<50 years, 50–69 years, ≥70 years), PR status, or other tumor characteristics. The meta-analysis also confirmed the benefit of adjuvant tamoxifen in hormone receptor–positive premenopausal women. Women younger than 50 years obtained a degree of benefit from 5 years of tamoxifen similar to that obtained by older women. In addition, the proportional reductions in both recurrence and mortality associated with tamoxifen use were similar in women with either node-negative or node-positive breast cancer, but the absolute improvement in survival at 10 years was greater in the node-positive breast cancer group (5.3% vs. 12.5% with 5 years of use). Similar results were found in the IBCSG-13-93 trial.[] Of 1,246 women with stage II disease, only the women with hormone receptor–positive disease benefited from tamoxifen. The optimal duration of tamoxifen use has been addressed by the EBCTCG meta-analysis and by several large randomized trials.[,-] Ten years of tamoxifen therapy has been shown to be superior to shorter durations of tamoxifen therapy. The EBCTCG meta-analysis demonstrated that 5 years of tamoxifen was superior to shorter durations. The following results were reported:[] A highly significant advantage of 5 years versus 1 to 2 years of tamoxifen with respect to the risk of recurrence (proportionate reduction, 15.2%; <.001) and a less significant advantage with respect to mortality (proportionate reduction, 7.9%; = .01) was observed. Long-term follow-up of the Adjuvant Tamoxifen Longer Against Shorter ( [NCT00003016]) trial demonstrated that 10 years of tamoxifen therapy was superior to 5 years of tamoxifen therapy. Between 1996 and 2005, 12,894 women with early breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive 10 years or 5 years of tamoxifen therapy. The following results were reported:[][] Study results revealed that 10 years of tamoxifen reduced the risk of breast cancer recurrence (617 recurrences for 10 years of tamoxifen vs. 711 recurrences for 5 years of tamoxifen; = .002), reduced breast-cancer mortality (331 deaths for 10 years of tamoxifen vs. 397 deaths for 5 years of tamoxifen; = .01), and reduced overall mortality (639 deaths for 10 years of tamoxifen vs. 722 deaths for 5 years of tamoxifen; = .01). Of note, from the time of the original breast cancer diagnosis, the benefits of 10 years of therapy were less extreme before than after year 10. At 15 years from the time of diagnosis, breast cancer mortality was 15% at 10 years and 12.2% at 5 years. Compared with 5 years, 10 years of tamoxifen therapy increased the risk of the following: Pulmonary embolus RR, 1.87; (95% CI, 1.13–3.07; = .01). Ischemic heart disease RR, 0.76; (95% CI, 0.6–0.95; = .02). Endometrial cancer RR, 1.74; (95% CI, 1.30–2.34; = .0002). Notably, the cumulative risk of endometrial cancer during years 5 to 14 from breast cancer diagnosis was 3.1% for women who received 10 years of tamoxifen versus 1.6% for women who received 5 years of tamoxifen. The mortality for years 5 to 14 was 12.2 versus 15 for an absolute mortality reduction of 2.8%. The results of the ATLAS trial indicated that for women who remained premenopausal after 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen, continued tamoxifen for 5 more years was beneficial.[] Women who have become menopausal after 5 years of tamoxifen may also be treated with AIs. (Refer to the section in the section of this summary for more information.) Because of the results of an EBCTCG analysis, the use of tamoxifen in women who received adjuvant chemotherapy does not attenuate the benefit of chemotherapy.[] However, concurrent use of tamoxifen with chemotherapy is less effective than sequential administration.[] Evidence suggests ovarian ablation alone is not an effective substitute for other systemic therapies.[-] Further, the addition of ovarian ablation to chemotherapy and/or tamoxifen has not been found to significantly improve outcomes.[,-] The largest study ( [NCT00066690]) to examine the addition of ovarian ablation to tamoxifen with or without chemotherapy randomly assigned 2,033 premenopausal women (53% of whom had received previous chemotherapy) to receive tamoxifen or tamoxifen plus ovarian suppression with triptorelin or ablation with surgery or radiation therapy.[][] Upon initial report, with a median follow-up of 5.6 years, there was no significant difference in the primary outcome of DFS (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.66–1.04; = .10); 5-year DFS was 86% in the tamoxifen-plus-ovarian-suppression group versus 84.7% in the tamoxifen-alone group. However, updated results with a median follow-up of 8 years, demonstrated improved DFS with tamoxifen plus ovarian suppression compared with tamoxifen alone (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.62–0.93, = .009); the 8-year DFS was 83.2% in the tamoxifen-plus-ovarian-suppression group versus 78.9% in the tamoxifen-alone group. In addition, OS at 8 years was improved with tamoxifen plus ovarian suppression compared with tamoxifen alone (HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.48–0.92; = .01); 8-year OS was 93.3% in the tamoxifen-plus-ovarian-suppression group versus 91.5% in the tamoxifen-alone group. Despite overall negative initial results, subgroup analysis suggested a benefit with ovarian suppression in women who underwent chemotherapy and remained premenopausal afterwards. Follow-up results at 8 years, however, did not demonstrate heterogeneity of treatment effect according to whether chemotherapy was administered, although recurrences were more frequent among patients who received chemotherapy. AIs have been compared with tamoxifen in premenopausal women in whom ovarian function was suppressed or ablated. The results of these studies have been conflicting. Evidence (comparison of an AI with tamoxifen in premenopausal women): In one study (), 1,803 women who received goserelin were randomly assigned to a 2 × 2 factorial design trial that compared anastrozole and tamoxifen, with or without zoledronic acid.[] At a median follow-up of 62 months, there was no difference in DFS (HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.81–1.44; = .59). OS was superior with tamoxifen (HR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.08–2.83; = .02). In two unblinded studies that were analyzed together ( [NCT00066703] and [NCT00066690]), exemestane was also compared with tamoxifen in 4,690 premenopausal women who underwent ovarian ablation.[] The use of exemestane resulted in a significant difference in DFS (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.67–0.90; < .001; 8-year DFS, 86.8% in the exemestane-ovarian suppression group vs. 82.8% in the tamoxifen-ovarian-suppression group).[][] The 8-year rate of freedom from distant recurrence was also higher in the exemestane-ovarian-suppression group (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.66–0.96; = .02); 8-year rate of freedom from distant recurrence was 91.8% in the exemestane-ovarian-suppression group versus 89.7% in the tamoxifen-ovarian-suppression group. Despite improvements in DFS and freedom from distant recurrence, no difference in OS was observed with the use of exemestane in combination with ovarian suppression compared with tamoxifen in combination with ovarian suppression (HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.79–1.22; = .84; 8-year OS, 93.4% in the exemestane-ovarian suppression group vs. 93.3% in the tamoxifen-ovarian-suppression group).[][] A follow-up report on the differences in QOL for the exemestane-ovarian-suppression group versus the tamoxifen-ovarian-suppression group observed the following (the differences cited below were all significant at < .001 and occurred in patients who did and did not receive chemotherapy):[] Patients who received tamoxifen plus ovarian function suppression were more affected by hot flushes and sweats over 5 years than were those who received exemestane plus ovarian function suppression, although these symptoms improved. Patients who received exemestane plus ovarian function suppression reported more vaginal dryness, greater loss of sexual interest, and difficulties becoming aroused than did patients who received tamoxifen plus ovarian function suppression; these differences persisted over time. An increase in bone or joint pain was more pronounced, particularly in the short term, in patients who received exemestane plus ovarian function suppression than in patients who received tamoxifen plus ovarian function suppression. Changes in global QOL indicators from baseline were small and similar between treatments over the 5 years.[][] In postmenopausal women, the use of AIs in sequence with or as a substitute for tamoxifen has been the subject of multiple studies, the results of which have been summarized in an individual patient-level meta-analysis.[] Evidence (AI vs. tamoxifen as initial therapy in postmenopausal women): A large, randomized trial of 9,366 patients compared the use of the AI anastrozole and the combination of anastrozole and tamoxifen with tamoxifen alone as adjuvant therapy for postmenopausal patients with lymph node-negative or lymph node-positive disease. Most (84%) of the patients in the study were hormone receptor-positive. Slightly more than 20% had received chemotherapy.[]; [][] With a median follow-up of 33.3 months, no benefit in DFS was observed for the combination arm relative to tamoxifen alone.[] Patients on anastrozole, however, had a significantly longer DFS (HR, 0.83) than those on tamoxifen. In an analysis conducted after a median follow-up of 100 months among hormone receptor-positive patients, DFS was significantly ( = .003) longer in patients on anastrozole (HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.76–0.94), but OS was not improved (HR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.86–1.11; = .7).[] Patients on tamoxifen more frequently developed endometrial cancer and cerebrovascular accidents, whereas patients on anastrozole had more fracture episodes. The frequency of myocardial infarction was similar in both groups. Except for a continued increased frequency of endometrial cancer in the tamoxifen group, these differences did not persist in the posttreatment period.[] A large, double-blinded, randomized trial of 8,010 postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer compared the use of letrozole with tamoxifen given continuously for 5 years or with crossover to the alternate drug at 2 years.[] An updated analysis from the International Breast Cancer Study Group ( [NCT00004205]) reported results on the 4,922 women who received tamoxifen or letrozole for 5 years at a median follow-up of 51 months.[][] DFS was significantly superior in patients treated with letrozole (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.71–0.95; = .007; 5-year DFS, 84.0% vs. 81.1%). OS was not significantly different in patients treated with letrozole (HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.75–1.11; = .35). In the meta-analysis, which included 9,885 women from multiple trials, the 10-year recurrence risk was 19.1% in the AI group versus 22.7% in the tamoxifen group (RR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.73–0.88; < .001). The overall 10-year mortality rate was also reduced from 24.0% to 21.3%. (RR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.8–0.97; = .01).[][] Sequential tamoxifen and AI versus 5 years of tamoxifen Several trials and meta-analyses have examined the effect of switching to anastrozole or exemestane to complete a total of 5 years of therapy after 2 to 3 years of tamoxifen.[-] The evidence, as described below, indicates that sequential tamoxifen and AI is superior to remaining on tamoxifen for 5 years. Evidence (sequential tamoxifen and AI vs. 5 years of tamoxifen): Two trials carried out in sequence by the same group enrolled a total of 828 patients and were reported together; one trial used aminoglutethimide as the AI, and the other trial used anastrozole. After a median follow-up of 78 months, an improvement in all-cause mortality (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.42–0.88; = .007) was observed in the AI groups.[][] Two other trials were reported together.[] A total of 3,224 patients were randomly assigned after 2 years of tamoxifen to continue tamoxifen for a total of 5 years or to take anastrozole for 3 years. There was a significant difference in event-free survival (EFS) (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, = .0009), but not in OS (5-year OS, 97% CI for the switched arm vs. 96% CI for the tamoxifen-alone arm; = .16).[][] A large, double-blinded, randomized trial ( [ICCG-96OEXE031-C1396-BIG9702]) (NCT00003418) of 4,742 patients compared continuing tamoxifen with switching to exemestane for a total of 5 years of therapy in women who had received 2 to 3 years of tamoxifen.[][] After the second planned interim analysis, when median follow-up for patients on the study was 30.6 months, the results were released because of a highly significant ( < .005) difference in DFS (HR, 0.68) favoring the exemestane arm.[] After a median follow-up of 55.7 months, the HR for DFS was 0.76 (95% CI, 0.66–0.88; = .001) in favor of exemestane.[][] At 2.5 years after random assignment, 3.3% fewer patients on exemestane had developed a DFS event (95% CI, 1.6–4.9). The HR for OS was 0.85 (95% CI, 0.7–1.02; = .08).[] In the meta-analysis, which included 11,798 patients from six trials, the 10-year recurrence rate was reduced from 19% to 17% in the AI-containing groups (RR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.75–0.91; = .0001). The overall 10-year mortality was 17.5% in the tamoxifen group and 14.6% in the AI-containing group (RR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.73–0.91; = .0002).[][] Sequential tamoxifen and AI for 5 years versus 5 years of an AI The evidence indicates that there is no benefit to the sequential use of tamoxifen and an AI for 5 years over 5 years of an AI. Evidence (sequential use of tamoxifen and an AI vs. 5 years of an AI): A large, randomized trial of 9,779 patients compared DFS of postmenopausal women with hormone receptor–positive breast cancer between initial treatment with sequential tamoxifen for 2.5 to 3 years followed by exemestane for a total of 5 years versus exemestane alone for 5 years. The primary endpoints were DFS at 2.75 years and 5.0 years.[][] Five-year DFS was 85% in the sequential group and 86% in the exemestane-alone group (HR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.88–1.08; = .60). Similarly in the (NCT00004205) trial, two sequential arms were compared with 5 years of letrozole.[][] There was no difference in DFS when the two sequential arms were compared with 5 years of letrozole (letrozole to tamoxifen HR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.91–1.23; = .45 and tamoxifen to letrozole HR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.92–1.25; = .36). The (NCT00541086) trial, which was not included in the meta-analysis, compared 2 years of tamoxifen followed by 3 years of one of the three AIs with 5 years of an AI. No significant difference in 5-year DFS was found between the two approaches (88.5% for switching; 89.8% for upfront AI; HR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.73–1.08; = .23).[] In the meta-analysis, which included 12,779 patients from the trials, the 7-year recurrence rate was slightly reduced from 14.5% to 13.8% in the groups that received 5 years of an AI (RR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.81–0.99; = .045). Overall mortality at 7 years was 9.3% in the tamoxifen-followed-by-AI groups and 8.2% in the AI-alone groups (RR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.78–1.03; = .11).[][] The mild androgen activity of exemestane prompted a randomized trial that evaluated whether exemestane might be preferable to anastrozole, in terms of its efficacy (i.e., EFS) and toxicity, as upfront therapy for postmenopausal women diagnosed with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.[][] The (NCT00066573) trial randomly assigned 7,576 postmenopausal women to receive 5 years of anastrozole or exemestane. At a median follow-up of 4.1 years, no difference in efficacy was seen (HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.87–1.18; = .86).[][] The two therapies also were not significantly different in terms of impact on bone mineral density or fracture rates.[][] In the Femara Versus Anastrozole Clinical Evaluation ( [NCT00248170]) study, 4,136 patients with hormone receptor-positive disease were randomly assigned to receive either letrozole or anastrozole.[] There was no significant difference in DFS (HR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.80–1.07; = .3150) at the time of a final analysis that was conducted when there were 709 of the planned 959 events. There were no substantial differences in adverse events between the arms. In the trial, 3,697 patients with HR-positive disease were randomly assigned among the three AIs either for 5 years or after 2 years of tamoxifen. No significant difference in 5-year DFS (90.0% for anastrozole, 88.0% for exemestane, and 89.4% for letrozole; = .24) was noted among the three AIs.[] The evidence, as described below, indicates that switching to an AI after 5 years of tamoxifen is superior to stopping tamoxifen at that time. A large, double-blinded, randomized trial ( [NCT00003140]) of 5,187 patients compared the use of letrozole versus placebo in receptor-positive postmenopausal women who received tamoxifen for approximately 5 years (range, 4.5–6.0) years.[][] After the first planned interim analysis, when median follow-up for patients in the study was 2.4 years, the results were unblinded because of a highly significant ( < .008) difference in DFS (HR, 0.57), favoring the letrozole arm.[] After 3 years of follow-up, 4.8% of the women on the letrozole arm had developed recurrent disease or new primaries versus 9.8% on the placebo arm (95% CI for the difference, 2.7%–7.3%). Because of the early unblinding of the study, longer-term comparative data on the risks and benefits of letrozole in this setting will not be available.[,] An updated analysis including all events before unblinding confirmed the results of the interim analysis.[] In addition, a statistically significant improvement in distant DFS was found for patients who received letrozole (HR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.43–0.84; = .002). Although no statistically significant difference was found in the total study population, the lymph node-positive patients who received letrozole also experienced a statistically significant improvement in OS (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.38–0.98; = .04), although the value was not corrected for multiple comparisons. The (NCT00016432) trial that was designed to compare 5 years of exemestane with placebo after 5 years of tamoxifen was stopped prematurely when the results of became available. At the time of analysis, 560 of the 783 patients who were randomly assigned to receive exemestane remained on that drug and 344 of the 779 patients who were randomly assigned to receive placebo had crossed over to exemestane.[][] An intent-to-treat analysis of the primary study endpoint, DFS, demonstrated a nonsignificant benefit of exemestane (HR, 0.68; = .07). The optimal duration of AI therapy is uncertain, and multiple trials have evaluated courses longer than 5 years. Evidence regarding extension of endocrine therapy beyond 5 years of initial AI-based adjuvant therapy: A double-blind, randomized, phase III trial assessed the effect of an additional 5 years of letrozole versus placebo in 1,918 women who had received 5 years of an AI.[] Patients who received previous tamoxifen therapy were included. Most women on the study (70.6%) had received 4.5 to 6 years of adjuvant tamoxifen, but a significant proportion of them (20.7%) had been treated initially with an AI. At a median follow-up of 6.3 years, DFS, the primary study endpoint, was significantly improved in patients randomly assigned to receive letrozole (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.48–0.91; = .01), and 5-year DFS was improved from 91% to 95%.[][] OS rates showed no difference (HR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.73–1.28; = .83). More patients on letrozole had fractures (14%) than did patients on placebo (9%) ( = .001). QOL was assessed with the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) and Menopause-Specific QOL (MENQOL) instruments. More than 85% of participants completed yearly assessments over a 5-year period. No between-group differences were found on the four MENQOL subscales or on the SF-36 summary score. SF-36 role-emotional and bodily pain scores were statistically significantly worse ( = .03) among patients receiving letrozole, but the differences observed were fewer than the minimum clinically important differences for the SF-36 instrument. A randomized phase III study assessed the effect of an additional 2.5 years of letrozole versus 5 years of letrozole in 1,824 women who received 5 years of an AI.[][] DFS events were similar in both groups (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.74–1.16). The distant metastasis-free interval was also similar (HR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.78–1.45). A subgroup analysis did not identify patients who benefited from 5-year extended therapy. This study did not show that 10 years of AI therapy was superior to 7.5 years of AI therapy. A phase III trial ( [NCT00382070]) randomly assigned, in a double-blind fashion, 3,966 women who received 5 years of initial adjuvant therapy with an AI or received tamoxifen for 2 to 3 years followed by an AI to receive 5 mg of letrozole or placebo for 5 additional years.[][] The planned analysis of DFS was carried out after a median follow-up of 6.9 years. The 7-year DFS was 81.3% in the placebo group and 84.7% in the letrozole group (HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.73–0.999; = .048). The observed difference was not statistically significant when interim analyses were accounted for. There were no statistically significant differences in adverse events between the arms. A phase III trial conducted by the IBCSG ( [NCT00553410]) randomly assigned 4,851 eligible receptor-positive postmenopausal women who had completed 5 years of adjuvant therapy with an AI, a selective estrogen receptor modulator, or both, to receive 2.5 mg of letrozole daily for 5 years or to an intermittent schedule in which there was a 3-month break at the end of each of the first 4 years, but not in the final year.[] There was no observed advantage to the intermittent schedule with respect to DFS (HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.93–1.26; = .31) or in the frequency of adverse events.[][] A phase III trial conducted by the Dutch Breast Cancer Study Group ( [NCT00301457]) randomly assigned 1,860 eligible receptor-positive postmenopausal women who had received 2 to 3 years of tamoxifen to receive either 3 or 6 years of anastrozole (1 mg daily).[] At 3 years, 1,660 of these women were free of disease: among them, DFS was observed to be improved, but not statistically significantly so, on the extended-therapy arm (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.62–1.02).[][] Myalgia and osteoporosis/osteopenia were more frequent on the extended-therapy arm. The phase III ABCSG-16 study, published in abstract form, enrolled 3,484 postmenopausal women with hormone receptor–positive breast cancer who had completed 5 years of endocrine therapy with tamoxifen and/or an AI to either 2 or 5 years of extended therapy with anastrozole. The primary endpoint was DFS. Secondary endpoints included OS, time to contralateral breast cancer, time to second primary cancer, fractures, and toxicity.[] After 10 years of follow-up, there was no difference in DFS between the two arms (71.1% for the 2-year course vs. 70.3% for the 5-year course [HR, 0.997; 95% CI, 0.86–1.15; = .982]). In addition, there was no difference in OS, time to second primary cancer, and time to contralateral breast cancer between the arms. There was an insignificant trend towards more fractures in the 5-year arm. Both bisphosphonates and denosumab have been evaluated as adjuvant therapies for early-stage breast cancer; however, the role of these agents as adjuvant therapy for early-stage breast cancer is unclear. Compared with denosumab, the amount of evidence supporting bisphosphonates is greater, and there is evidence supporting breast cancer mortality—an endpoint that is more clinically relevant. Evidence (bisphosphonates in the treatment of early breast cancer): A meta-analysis has been conducted that included the individual patient data of 18,766 patients from 26 adjuvant trials of bisphosphonates of any type.[] Overall, reductions associated with bisphosphonate use in recurrence (RR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.87–1.01; 2 = .08), distant recurrence (RR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.85–0.99; 2 = .03), and breast cancer mortality (RR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.83–0.99; 2 = .04) were of only borderline significance, but the reduction in bone recurrence was more definite (RR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.73–0.94; 2 = .004). In a prespecified subgroup analysis, among premenopausal women, treatment had no apparent effect on any outcome, but among 11,767 postmenopausal women, it produced highly significant reductions in recurrence (RR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.78–0.94; 2 = .002), distant recurrence (RR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.74–0.92; 2 = .0003), bone recurrence (RR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.60–0.86; 2 = .0002), and breast cancer mortality (RR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.73–0.93; 2 = .002).[] The (NCT00556374) trial randomly assigned 3,435 postmenopausal women with receptor-positive breast cancer who were receiving an AI to receive denosumab or a placebo every 6 months during AI therapy.[] The patients were unblinded when results related to bone events were reported, and patients on placebo were allowed to cross over to the active drug. In an intent-to-treat analysis according to the original assignment, DFS, a secondary endpoint, was improved in patients randomly assigned to receive denosumab (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.69–0.98; = .0260; 5-year DFS, 89.2% vs. 87.3%).[][] The frequency of adverse events was similar in the two groups. The (NCT01077154) trial randomly assigned 4,509 women with stage II or stage III breast cancer to receive denosumab or placebo.[] The primary endpoint of bone metastasis-free survival was not significantly different between the groups (median, not reached in either group; HR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.82−1.14; = .70).[][] Preoperative chemotherapy, also known as primary or neoadjuvant chemotherapy, has traditionally been administered in patients with locally advanced breast cancer to reduce tumor volume and allow for definitive surgery. In addition, preoperative chemotherapy is being used for some patients with primary operable stage II or stage III breast cancer. A meta-analysis of multiple, randomized clinical trials performed in 2005 demonstrated that preoperative chemotherapy is associated with identical DFS and OS compared with the administration of the same therapy in the adjuvant setting.[][] In 2019, the Early Breast Cancer Trialists’ Collaborative Group performed a meta-analysis using individual patient data from 4,756 women who participated in 10 trials that compared neoadjuvant chemotherapy with the same regimen given in the adjuvant setting.[] Compared with adjuvant therapy, neoadjuvant therapy was associated with an increased frequency of breast conservation (65% vs. 49%). There were no differences between neoadjuvant chemotherapy and adjuvant therapy in distant recurrence, breast cancer mortality, or death from any cause; however, neoadjuvant therapy was associated with higher 15-year local recurrence (21.4% vs. 15.9%; rate ratio, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.17−1.61; = .001).[][] Current consensus opinion for use of preoperative chemotherapy recommends anthracycline- and taxane-based therapy, and prospective trials suggest that preoperative anthracycline- and taxane-based therapy is associated with higher response rates than alternative regimens (e.g., anthracycline alone).[,][] A potential advantage of preoperative systemic therapy is the increased likelihood of success with definitive local therapy in those presenting with locally-advanced, unresectable disease. It may also offer benefit to carefully selected patients with primary operable disease by enhancing the likelihood of breast conservation and providing prognostic information where pCR is obtained. In these cases, a patient can be informed that there is a very low risk of recurrence compared with a situation in which a large amount of residual disease remains. pCR has been utilized as a surrogate endpoint for long-term outcomes, such as DFS, EFS, and OS, in preoperative clinical trials in breast cancer. A pooled analysis (CTNeoBC) of 11 preoperative randomized trials (n = 11,955) determined that pCR, defined as no residual invasive cancer in the breast and axillary nodes with presence or absence of cancer (ypT0/is ypN0 or ypT0 ypN0), provided a better association with improved outcomes compared with eradication of invasive tumor from the breast alone (ypT0/is).[] pCR could not be validated in this study as a surrogate endpoint for improved EFS and OS.[][] Because of a strong association of pCR with substantially improved outcomes in individual patients with more aggressive subtypes of breast cancer, the FDA has supported use of pCR as an endpoint in preoperative clinical trials for patients with high-risk, early-stage breast cancer. Postoperative radiation therapy may also be omitted in a patient with histologically negative axillary nodes after preoperative therapy, irrespective of lymph node status before preoperative therapy, allowing for tailoring of treatment to the individual. Potential disadvantages with this approach include the inability to determine an accurate pathological stage after preoperative chemotherapy. However, the knowledge of the presence of residual disease may provide more personalized prognostic information, as noted above. Patient selection, staging, treatment, and follow-up Multidisciplinary management of patients undergoing preoperative therapy by an experienced team is essential to optimize the following: Decision to administer adjuvant radiation therapy. The tumor histology, grade, and receptor status are carefully evaluated before preoperative therapy is initiated. Patients whose tumors have a pure lobular histology, low grade, or high hormone-receptor expression and HER2-negative status are less likely to respond to chemotherapy and should be considered for primary surgery, especially when the nodes are clinically negative. Even if adjuvant chemotherapy is administered after surgery in these cases, a third-generation regimen (anthracycline-taxane based) may be avoided. Before beginning preoperative therapy, the extent of the disease within the breast and regional lymph nodes should be assessed. Staging of systemic disease may include the following:[] Baseline breast imaging is performed when breast-conserving therapy is desired to identify the tumor location and exclude multicentric disease. Suspicious abnormalities are usually biopsied before beginning treatment and a marker placed at the center of the breast tumor(s). When possible, suspicious axillary nodes may be biopsied before initiation of systemic treatment. The optimal timing of sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy has not been established in patients receiving preoperative therapy. The following points should be considered: If suspicious lymph nodes are positive for malignancy at baseline, an SLN biopsy may be performed after preoperative therapy but is associated with a high false-negative rate. If the procedure is performed with both radiocolloid and blue dye and at least two nodes are sampled (provides 10.8% false-negative rate) and are negative, then axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) may be omitted.[][]; [][]; [][] Alternatively, it is acceptable in this circumstance to perform ALND, based on the possibility of undetected positive nodes. In patients with clinically negative nodes, SLN biopsy may be performed before preoperative therapy because of the false-negative rates observed when performed after preoperative therapy.[] If the SLN biopsy is negative, ALND can be omitted. If SLN biopsy is performed after preoperative chemotherapy, the baseline clinical and postchemotherapy pathological nodal status should be taken into consideration when deciding whether ALND is necessary. ALND is usually performed in the setting of node-positivity. When considering preoperative therapy, treatment options include the following: For HER2-negative breast tumors, an anthracycline-taxane based chemotherapy regimen. For HER2-positive disease, chemotherapy and HER2-targeted therapy. Ideally, the entire treatment regimen is administered before surgery. For postmenopausal women with hormone receptor–positive breast cancer, chemotherapy is an option. For those who cannot be given chemotherapy, preoperative endocrine therapy may be an option. For premenopausal women with hormone–responsive cancer, the use of preoperative endocrine therapy is under investigation. Regular clinical assessment of response to therapy is necessary after beginning preoperative therapy. Repeat radiographic assessment is also required if breast conservation is the surgical goal. Patients with progressive disease during preoperative therapy may either transition to a non–cross-resistant regimen or proceed to surgery, if feasible.[,] Although switching to a non–cross-resistant regimen results in a higher pCR rate than continuing the same therapy, there is no clear evidence that other breast cancer outcomes are improved with this approach. Early trials examined whether anthracycline-based regimens used in the adjuvant setting would prolong DFS and OS when used in the preoperative setting. The evidence supports higher rates of breast-conserving therapy with the use of a preoperative anthracycline chemotherapy regimen than with postoperative use, but no improvement in survival was noted with the preoperative strategy. Evidence (preoperative anthracycline-based regimen): A randomized clinical trial (NSABP-B-18) was designed to determine whether the preoperative combination of four cycles of AC would more effectively prolong DFS and OS than the same chemotherapy given in the adjuvant setting.[-][] After preoperative therapy, 36% of the patients had a complete clinical response. More patients treated with preoperative chemotherapy were able to have breast-conserving procedures as compared with those patients in the postoperative chemotherapy group (68% vs. 60%; .001). No statistically significant difference existed, however, in DFS, distant DFS, or OS in the patients who received preoperative chemotherapy as compared with those who received postoperative chemotherapy. An EORTC randomized trial (EORTC-10902) likewise demonstrated no improvement in DFS or OS but showed an increased frequency of conservative surgery with the use of preoperative versus postoperative FEC chemotherapy.[][] To improve the results observed with AC alone, a taxane was added to the chemotherapy regimen. The following study results support the addition of a taxane to an anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimen for HER2-negative breast tumors. Evidence (anthracycline-taxane–based chemotherapy regimen): In an effort to improve on the results observed with AC alone, the NSABP ( [NCT00002707]) trial was conducted.[][] The administration of preoperative AC followed by docetaxel was associated with a higher clinical complete response rate compared with the administration of AC alone (63.6% for AC followed by docetaxel and 40.1% for AC alone; < .001); a higher pCR rate was also observed (26.1% for AC followed by docetaxel and 13.7% for AC alone; < .001). Data from NSABP B-27 and the Aberdeen Breast Group Trial support the use of anthracycline-taxane–based regimens in women with initial response or with relative resistance to anthracyclines.[] Alternative anthracycline-taxane schedules have also been evaluated (concurrent TAC) and appear similar in efficacy to the sequential approach described above.[][] The phase III (NCT01583426) trial investigated an alternative taxane (nab-paclitaxel) in patients with untreated primary breast cancer.[] Patients (n = 1,229) were randomly assigned to receive 12 weeks of nab-paclitaxel or paclitaxel followed by epirubicin and cyclophosphamide (EC) for four cycles. The pCR rate was higher in the nab-paclitaxel arm (233 patients, 38%; 95% CI, 35%–42%) when compared with the paclitaxel arm (174 patients, 29%; 95% CI, 25%–33%).[][] However, in the (NCT01822314) trial that compared neoadjuvant nab-paclitaxel with paclitaxel followed by anthracycline-based therapy, no significant difference in pCR was observed, and neutropenia and peripheral neuropathy were more frequent in the nab-paclitaxel arm.[] Differences in taxane dose and schedule may explain the different findings in the GeparSepto and ETNA trials. The incorporation of many additional cytotoxic agents to anthracycline-taxane–based regimens has not offered a significant additional benefit to breast conservation or pCR rate in unselected breast cancer populations.[][] Promising results have been observed, however, with the addition of carboplatin to anthracycline-taxane combination chemotherapy regimens in patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Future definitive studies evaluating survival endpoints and the identification of biomarkers of response or resistance are necessary before the addition of carboplatin to standard preoperative chemotherapy can be considered a new standard of care. Evidence (adding carboplatin to an anthracycline-taxane–based chemotherapy regimen in patients with TNBC): In the (NCT01426880) trial, carboplatin was added to an anthracycline-taxane–based backbone.[][] Higher pCR rates were observed with the addition of carboplatin to an anthracycline-taxane–based backbone compared with anthracycline-taxane alone (36.9% vs. 53.2%; = .005) in patients with TNBC. Three-year DFS was higher for patients with TNBC randomly assigned to the carboplatin arm (86.1% vs. 75.8%; HR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.34−0.93), but OS did not differ.[] The more intensive regimen was also associated with increased toxicity and treatment discontinuations (39% vs. 48%). The (NCT00861705) trial compared an anthracycline-taxane backbone alone with an anthracycline-taxane backbone-plus-carboplatin in patients with stage II and stage III TNBC.[][] The pCR rate for the breast and axilla was 54% for the anthracycline-taxane backbone-plus-carboplatin group versus 41% for the anthracycline-taxane backbone-alone group ( = .0029) A 2018 meta-analysis of nine phase II or III randomized trials that evaluated the addition of carboplatin to various chemotherapy backbones for neoadjuvant treatment of TNBC confirmed higher pCR (pooled OR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.46−2.62; < .001), but at the expense of greater hematologic toxicity.[] Two of the nine trials reported survival outcomes and observed no difference in EFS or OS with the use of neoadjuvant carboplatin. Importantly, results of studies in the adjuvant and metastatic settings have not demonstrated an OS benefit with the addition of bevacizumab to chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone. However, the addition of bevacizumab to preoperative chemotherapy has been associated with an increased pCR rate alongside increased toxicity such as hypertension, cardiac toxicity, hand-foot syndrome, and mucositis (e.g., [NCT00408408] and [NCT00567554]).[,][] However, it is not clear that the modest benefit observed will translate into a longer term survival advantage. The randomized, double blind, phase III (NCT03036488) trial evaluated the addition of immunotherapy to neoadjuvant chemotherapy for patients with stage II and stage III TNBC.[] Participants were randomly assigned 2:1 to receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy (paclitaxel plus carboplatin followed by doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide) with either neoadjuvant and adjuvant pembrolizumab or neoadjuvant and adjuvant placebo. Co-primary endpoints were pCR rate and EFS. pCR rate, as reported at the time of the first interim analysis for the first 602 participants (pembrolizumab arm, 401; placebo arm, 201), favored the pembrolizumab arm. pCR was observed in 64.8% of patients in the pembrolizumab arm and 51.2% of patients in the placebo arm (estimated treatment difference, 13.6%; 95% CI, 5.4%−21.8%; < .001). Approximately 80% of tumors were positive for programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), but the benefits of pembrolizumab regarding pCR were observed regardless of PD-L1 status. EFS data are immature, but appear to favor pembrolizumab numerically (HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.43−0.93). Grade 3 or higher adverse events occurred in 76.8% of participants in the pembrolizumab arm and 72.2% of participants in the placebo arm. Serious treatment-related adverse events occurred in 32.5% of participants in the pembrolizumab arm and 19.5% of participants in the placebo arm. Grade 3 or higher skin rashes, infusion reactions, and adrenal insufficiency were more frequent in the pembrolizumab arm. Longer term follow-up with regard to EFS and toxicity will inform the use of pembrolizumab in the neoadjuvant treatment of TNBC. Key issues that remain to be clarified include identification of a predictive biomarker, the optimal chemotherapy backbone, and the role of adjuvant pembrolizumab after neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus pembrolizumab. After the success in the adjuvant setting, initial reports from phase II studies indicated improved pCR rates when trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody that binds the extracellular domain of HER2, was added to preoperative anthracycline-taxane–based regimens.[][] This has been confirmed in phase III studies.[,] The phase III NeOAdjuvant Herceptin (NOAH) study randomly assigned patients with HER2-positive locally advanced or inflammatory breast cancers to undergo preoperative chemotherapy with or without 1 year of trastuzumab therapy.[][] Study results confirmed that the addition of trastuzumab to preoperative chemotherapy resulted not only in improved clinical responses (87% vs. 74%) and pathologic responses (breast and axilla, 38% vs. 19%) but also in EFS, the primary outcome.[][] After a median follow-up of 5.4 years, the EFS benefit was 58% with the addition of trastuzumab to chemotherapy (95% CI, 48–66) and 43% (95% CI, 34–52) in patients in the chemotherapy group. The unadjusted HR for EFS between the two randomized HER2-positive treatment groups was 0.64 (95% CI, 0.44–0.93; two-sided log-rank = .016). EFS was strongly associated with pCR in patients who received trastuzumab.[] Symptomatic cardiac failure occurred in two patients who received concurrent doxorubicin and trastuzumab for two cycles. Close cardiac monitoring of LVEF and the total dose of doxorubicin not exceeding 180 mg/m accounted for the relatively low number of declines in LVEF and only two cardiac events. (Refer to the section in this summary for more information.)[][] Due to concern about co-administration of trastuzumab and anthracyclines, a phase III trial ( [NCT00513292]) randomly assigned patients with operable HER2-positive breast cancer to receive trastuzumab sequential to or concurrent with the anthracycline component (5-FU, epirubicin, cyclophosphamide) of the preoperative chemotherapy regimen.[][] pCR was the primary outcome. There was no significant difference in pCR rate in the breast between the arms (56.5% sequential, 54.2% concurrent; difference, 2.3% with 95% CI, -9.3–13.9). Asymptomatic declines in LVEF during preoperative chemotherapy were identified in similar proportions of patients in each arm. DFS and OS were secondary outcomes. After median follow-up of 5.1 years, there was no difference in DFS (HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.56−1.83, = .96) or OS (HR, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.48−2.88; = .73) between the sequential and concurrent arms.[] The conclusion was that concurrent administration of trastuzumab with anthracyclines is not warranted based on these findings. A subcutaneous formulation of trastuzumab has also been approved. The (NCT01566721) trial evaluated the safety and tolerability of self-administered versus clinician-administered SQ trastuzumab in stage I to stage III HER2-positive breast cancer.[] Chemotherapy was administered concurrently or sequentially. A phase III ( [NCT00950300]) trial also demonstrated that the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of preoperative SQ trastuzumab is noninferior to the IV formulation. This international, open-label trial (n = 596) randomly assigned women with operable, locally advanced, or inflammatory HER2-positive breast cancer to undergo preoperative chemotherapy (anthracycline-taxane–based), with either SQ-administered or IV-administered trastuzumab every 3 weeks before surgery. Patients received adjuvant trastuzumab to complete 1 year of therapy.[][] The pCR rates between the arms differed by 4.7% (95% CI, 4.0–13.4); 40.7% in the IV-administered group versus 45.4% in the SQ-administered group, demonstrating noninferiority for the SQ formulation. EFS and OS were secondary endpoints. Six-year EFS was 65% in both arms (HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.74−1.29). Six-year OS was 84% in both arms (HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.61−1.45).[] Newer HER2-targeted therapies (lapatinib, pertuzumab) have also been investigated. It appears that dual targeting of the HER2 receptor results in an increase in pCR rate; however, no survival advantage has been demonstrated to date with this approach.[,] Pertuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to a distinct epitope on the extracellular domain of the HER2 receptor and inhibits dimerization. Pertuzumab, in combination with trastuzumab with or without chemotherapy, has been evaluated in two preoperative clinical trials to improve on the pCR rates observed with trastuzumab and chemotherapy. In the open-label, randomized, phase II (NCT00545688) trial,[] 417 women with tumors that were larger than 2 cm or node-positive, and who had HER2-positive breast cancer, were randomly assigned to one of four preoperative regimens:[][] The pCR rates were 29% for docetaxel plus trastuzumab, 46% for docetaxel plus trastuzumab and pertuzumab, 17% for pertuzumab plus trastuzumab, and 24% for docetaxel plus pertuzumab. Therefore, the highest pCR rate was seen in the preoperative treatment arm with dual HER2 blockade plus chemotherapy. The addition of pertuzumab to the docetaxel-plus-trastuzumab combination did not appear to increase toxic effects, including the risk of cardiac adverse events. Despite the high pCR rate observed with dual HER2 blockade plus chemotherapy, PFS and DFS rates were not improved, although the NeoSPHERE trial was not powered to detect differences in long-term efficacy outcomes.[] The open-label, randomized, phase II (NCT00976989) trial sought to evaluate the tolerability and activity associated with trastuzumab and pertuzumab.[][] All 225 women with tumors that were larger than 2 cm or node positive, and who had operable, locally advanced, or inflammatory HER2-positive breast cancer, were randomly assigned to one of three preoperative regimens: Concurrent FEC plus trastuzumab plus pertuzumab (×3) followed by concurrent docetaxel plus trastuzumab plus pertuzumab. FEC alone (×3) followed by concurrent docetaxel plus trastuzumab plus pertuzumab (×3). Concurrent docetaxel and carboplatin plus trastuzumab plus pertuzumab (×6). The pCR rate was equivalent across all three treatment arms: (62% for concurrent FEC plus trastuzumab plus pertuzumab followed by concurrent docetaxel plus trastuzumab plus pertuzumab; 57% for FEC alone followed by concurrent docetaxel plus trastuzumab plus pertuzumab; and 66% for concurrent docetaxel and carboplatin plus trastuzumab plus pertuzumab). All three arms were associated with a low incidence of cardiac adverse events of 5% or less. Because of these studies, the FDA-granted for the use of pertuzumab as part of a preoperative treatment for women with early-stage, HER2-positive breast cancer whose tumors are larger than 2 cm or node-positive. The FDA approval of pertuzumab was subsequently converted to regular approval following the results of the confirmatory (NCT01358877) trial, a randomized, phase III, adjuvant study for women with HER2-positive breast cancer, which demonstrated improved invasive DFS with the combination of chemotherapy and dual HER2-targeted therapy with pertuzumab plus trastuzumab compared with chemotherapy and trastuzumab alone.[] Pertuzumab is now approved both in combination with trastuzumab and chemotherapy for the neoadjuvant therapy of locally advanced, inflammatory, or early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer, which is larger than 2 cm or node-positive, as part of a complete treatment regimen and in combination with chemotherapy and trastuzumab as adjuvant treatment for HER2-positive early breast cancer at a high risk of recurrence. Lapatinib is a small-molecule kinase inhibitor that is capable of dual receptor inhibition of both epidermal growth factor receptor and HER2. Study results do not support the use of lapatinib in the preoperative setting. Evidence (against the use of lapatinib for HER2-positive early breast cancer): The role of lapatinib in the preoperative setting was examined in the [NCT00567554] trial.[] This phase III trial randomly assigned women with HER2-positive early-stage breast cancer to receive chemotherapy with trastuzumab or chemotherapy with lapatinib, with pCR as the primary endpoint.[][] pCR in the chemotherapy and lapatinib arm was significantly lower than it was with chemotherapy and trastuzumab (22.7% vs. 30.3%; = .04). Other endpoints of DFS, RFS, and OS have not been reported. (NCT00770809) was a phase III trial that randomly assigned patients with stage II and III HER2-positive breast cancer to receive either paclitaxel plus trastuzumab or paclitaxel plus trastuzumab plus lapatinib. The primary endpoint of the study was pCR in the breast.[] [] pCR in patients who received paclitaxel plus trastuzumab was 46% (95% CI, 37%–55%), and pCR in the patients who received paclitaxel plus trastuzumab plus lapatinib was 56% (95% CI, 47%–65%; = .13), indicating no benefit with the addition of lapatinib. The [NCT00553358] phase III trial randomly assigned 455 women with HER2-positive early-stage breast cancer (tumor size >2 cm) to receive preoperative lapatinib, or preoperative trastuzumab, or preoperative lapatinib plus trastuzumab. This anti-HER2 therapy was given alone for 6 weeks and then weekly paclitaxel was added to the regimen for an additional 12 weeks. The primary endpoint of this study was pCR. pCR was significantly higher in the lapatinib-plus-trastuzumab combination arm (51.3%; 95% CI, 43.1–59.5) than in the trastuzumab-alone arm (29.5%; 95% CI, 22.4–37.5). No significant difference in pCR was seen between the lapatinib (24.7%, 95% CI, 18.1–32.3) and trastuzumab groups (difference, -4.8%, -17.6 to 8.2; = .34). An updated analysis for the prespecified secondary endpoints of EFS and OS indicate no difference between the groups.[] More definitive efficacy data were provided by the phase III ALLTO () trial that randomly assigned women to receive trastuzumab or trastuzumab plus lapatinib in the adjuvant setting.[] The trial did not meet its primary endpoint of DFS. The doubling in pCR rate observed with the addition of lapatinib to trastuzumab in the NeoALTTO trial did not translate into improved survival outcomes in the ALTTO trial at 4.5 years of median follow-up. This indicates that there is currently no role for the use of lapatinib in the preoperative or adjuvant settings. Cardiac toxic effects with pertuzumab and lapatinib A pooled analysis of cardiac safety in 598 cancer patients treated with pertuzumab was performed using data supplied by Roche and Genentech.[][] Asymptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction was observed in 6.9% of patients receiving pertuzumab alone (n = 331; 95% CI, 4.5–10.2), 3.4% of patients receiving pertuzumab in combination with a non–anthracycline-containing chemotherapy (n = 175; 95% CI, 1.3–7.3), and 6.5% of patients receiving pertuzumab in combination with trastuzumab (n = 93; 95% CI, 2.4–13.5). Symptomatic heart failure was observed in 1 (0.3%), 2 (1.1%), and 1 (1.1%) patients, respectively. A meta-analysis of randomized trials (n = 6) that evaluated the administration of anti-HER2 monotherapy (trastuzumab or lapatinib or pertuzumab) versus dual anti-HER2 therapy (trastuzumab plus lapatinib or trastuzumab plus pertuzumab) was performed.[][] LVEF decline was observed in 3.1% of the patients who received monotherapy (95% CI, 2.2%–4.4%) and 2.9% of the patients who received dual therapy (95% CI, 2.1%–4.1%). Symptomatic heart failure was observed in 0.88% of the patients who received monotherapy (95% CI, 0.47%–1.64%) and 1.49% of the patients who received dual therapy (95% CI, 0.98%–2.23%). Preoperative endocrine therapy may be an option for postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer when chemotherapy is not a suitable option because of comorbidities or performance status. Although the toxicity profile of preoperative hormonal therapy over the course of 3 to 6 months is favorable, the pCR rates obtained (1%–8%) are far lower than have been reported with chemotherapy in unselected populations.[][] Longer duration of preoperative therapy may be required in this patient population. Preoperative tamoxifen was associated with an overall response rate of 33%, with maximum response occurring up to 12 months after therapy in some patients.[] A randomized study of 4, 8, or 12 months of preoperative letrozole in elderly patients who were not fit for chemotherapy indicated that the longer duration of therapy resulted in the highest pCR rate (17.5% vs. 5% vs. 2.5%, -value for trend < .04).[][] AIs have also been compared with tamoxifen in the preoperative setting. Overall objective response and breast-conserving therapy rates with 3 to 4 months of preoperative therapy were either statistically significantly improved in the AI-treated women [] or comparable to tamoxifen-associated outcomes.[] An American College of Surgeons Oncology Group trial is currently comparing the efficacy of anastrozole, letrozole, or exemestane in the preoperative setting. The use of preoperative endocrine therapy in premenopausal women with hormone-responsive breast cancer remains investigational. One clinical trial suggested that there is a benefit to using capecitabine as adjuvant therapy in patients who did not obtain a pCR after preoperative chemotherapy. In a study conducted in Japan and Korea, 910 women with HER2/neu–negative breast cancers, who had residual disease after preoperative chemotherapy with anthracyclines, taxanes, or both, were randomly assigned in a nonblinded fashion to receive 6 to 8 four-weekly cycles of capecitabine or no further chemotherapy.[] The study was terminated because of the results of a planned interim analysis, and a final analysis was done. In the final analysis, which included 887 eligible patients, DFS, the primary endpoint, was statistically significantly prolonged (HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.53–0.92; = .01; 5-year DFS, 74.1% vs. 67.6%). OS, a secondary endpoint, was also longer in the capecitabine group (HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.39–0.90; = .01; 5-year OS, 89.2% vs. 83.6%). In the capecitabine group, 73.4% of the patients experienced hand-foot syndrome of varying degrees of severity. In a phase III trial ( [NCT01772472]), 1,486 women with HER2-positive disease who received a preoperative taxane-containing chemotherapy (with or without an anthracycline) along with trastuzumab with or without a second HER2 targeted agent, but who had residual disease after surgery, were randomly assigned to receive 14 cycles of adjuvant trastuzumab or T-DM1.[][] At the time of a planned interim analysis, invasive DFS (the primary study endpoint) was significantly higher in the T-DM1 group than in the trastuzumab group (HR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.39–0.64; < .001; invasive DFS at 3 years, 88.3% vs. 77%). Data on OS are immature and not significant (HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.47–1.05). Patients receiving T-DM1 were more likely to discontinue treatment because of an adverse event (18% vs. 2.1%) and had a higher frequency of sensory neuropathy (18.6% vs. 6.9%), most cases of which had resolved at the time of the analysis. On subgroup analysis, the benefit of T-DM1 was observed in all subgroups, including participants who received dual HER2 targeted therapy in the preoperative setting. These approaches and participation in clinical trials of novel therapies should be considered for patients with residual disease after preoperative therapy. (NCT02445391) is a randomized phase III clinical trial that randomly assigned patients with residual basal-like TNBC after preoperative therapy to receive platinum-based chemotherapy or capecitabine. (NCT02954874) is a phase III trial evaluating the efficacy of pembrolizumab as adjuvant therapy for patients with residual TNBC (≥1 cm invasive cancer or residual nodes) after preoperative therapy. Radiation therapy is administered after breast conservation in most women who have received preoperative therapy to reduce the risk of locoregional recurrence. Baseline clinical and subsequent pathologic staging should be considered in deciding whether to administer postmastectomy radiation. Other adjuvant systemic treatments may be administered either postoperatively, during, or after completion of adjuvant radiation, including adjuvant hormonal therapy for patients with hormone receptor-positive disease and adjuvant trastuzumab for those with HER2-positive disease. (Refer to the subsection in the section of this summary for more information.) The frequency of follow-up and the appropriateness of screening tests after the completion of primary treatment for stage I, stage II, or stage III breast cancer remain controversial. Evidence from randomized trials indicates that periodic follow-up with bone scans, liver sonography, chest x-rays, and blood tests of liver function does improve survival or quality of life when compared with routine physical examinations.[-] Even when these tests permit earlier detection of recurrent disease, patient survival is unaffected.[] On the basis of these data, acceptable follow-up can be limited to the following for asymptomatic patients who complete treatment for stages I to III breast cancer: Use our to find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are now enrolling patients.

The standard treatment options for locally advanced or inflammatory breast cancer may include the following: Breast-conserving surgery or total mastectomy with axillary lymph node dissection. Initial surgery is generally limited to biopsy to permit the determination of histology, estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor levels, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2/neu) overexpression. The standard chemotherapy regimen for initial treatment is the same as that used in the adjuvant setting (refer to the section of this summary for more information), although trials done solely in patients with locally advanced disease have not shown a statistically significant advantage to dose-dense chemotherapy.[] For patients who respond to preoperative chemotherapy, local therapy may consist of total mastectomy with axillary lymph node dissection followed by postoperative radiation therapy to the chest wall and regional lymphatics. Breast-conserving therapy can be considered for patients with a good partial or complete response to preoperative chemotherapy.[] Subsequent systemic therapy may consist of further chemotherapy. Hormone therapy is administered to patients with ER-positive or ER-unknown tumors. Although the evidence described below has not been replicated, it suggests patients with locally advanced or inflammatory breast cancer should be treated with curative intent. In a retrospective series, 70 patients with locally advanced breast cancer and supraclavicular metastases received preoperative chemotherapy. Patients then received local therapy that consisted of either total mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection or breast-conserving surgery and axillary lymph node dissection before or after radiation therapy. Patients who did not respond to preoperative chemotherapy were treated with surgery and/or radiation therapy. After completion of local therapy, chemotherapy was continued for 4 to 15 cycles, followed by radiation therapy.[] Approximately 32% of patients with ipsilateral supraclavicular node involvement and no evidence of distant metastases (pN3c) had prolonged disease-free survival (DFS) at 10 years with combined-modality therapy. These results have been confirmed in a separate series of patients treated in British Columbia.[] A series of 178 patients with inflammatory breast cancer were treated with a combined-modality approach. Patients were treated with induction chemotherapy, then local therapy (radiation therapy or mastectomy), followed by chemotherapy, and, if mastectomy was performed, radiation therapy.[][] Subsequent trials have confirmed that patients with locally advanced and inflammatory breast cancer can experience long-term DFS when treated with initial chemotherapy.[] All patients are considered candidates for clinical trials to evaluate the most appropriate way to administer the various components of new multimodality regimens.

Patients with locoregional breast cancer recurrence may become long-term survivors with appropriate therapy. The rates of locoregional recurrence have been reduced over time, and a meta-analysis suggests a recurrence rate of less than 3% in patients treated with breast-conserving surgery and radiation therapy.[] The rates are somewhat higher (up to 10%) for those treated with mastectomy.[] Nine percent to 25% of patients with locoregional recurrence will have distant metastases or locally extensive disease at the time of recurrence.[-] Before treatment for recurrent breast cancer, restaging to evaluate the extent of disease is indicated. Cytologic or histologic documentation of recurrent disease is obtained whenever possible. When therapy is selected, the estrogen-receptor (ER) status, progesterone-receptor (PR) status, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2/neu) status at the time of recurrence and previous treatment are considered, if known. ER status may change at the time of recurrence. In a single small study by the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (MDA-MBDT-8081), 36% of hormone receptor–positive tumors were found to be receptor negative in biopsy specimens isolated at the time of recurrence.[] Patients in this study had no interval treatment. If ER and PR statuses are unknown, then the site(s) of recurrence, disease-free interval, response to previous treatment, and menopausal status are useful in the selection of chemotherapy or hormone therapy.[] Treatment options for locoregional recurrent breast cancer include the following: Patients with locoregional recurrence should be considered for further local treatment (e.g., mastectomy). In one series, the 5-year actuarial rate of relapse for patients treated for invasive recurrence after initial breast conservation and radiation therapy was 52%.[] Treatment options also depend on the site of recurrence, as follows: Cutaneous: A phase III randomized study showed that local control of cutaneous metastases could be achieved with the application of topical miltefosine; however, the drug is not currently available in the United States.[][] Chest wall: Local chest wall recurrence after mastectomy is usually the harbinger of widespread disease, but, in a subset of patients, it may be the only site of recurrence. For patients in this subset, surgery and/or radiation therapy may be curative.[,] Patients with chest wall recurrences of less than 3 cm, axillary and internal mammary node recurrence (not supraclavicular, which has a poorer survival), and a greater-than-2-year disease-free interval before recurrence have the best chance for prolonged survival.[] The 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) rate in one series of such patients was 25%, with a 10-year rate of 15%.[] The locoregional control rate was 57% at 10 years. Systemic therapy should be considered in patients with locoregional recurrence. Breast: In the Chemotherapy as Adjuvant for Locally Recurrent Breast Cancer ( [NCT00074152]) trial, patients with a history of breast-conserving surgery or mastectomy with clear margins and complete excision of an isolated local recurrence of their breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive either chemotherapy of the physician's choice or no chemotherapy. The study was closed early because of poor accrual. The original sample size for a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.74 was 977 patients (347 DFS events) and was revised subsequently to 265 patients (HR, 0.6; 124 DFS events), with only 162 enrolled at the time of study closure.[][] In ER-negative patients, the HR for DFS for chemotherapy versus no chemotherapy was 0.29 (95% CI, 0.13–0.67; 10 years DFS, 70% vs. 34%), whereas in ER-positive patients, the HR was 1.07 (95% CI, 0.57–2.00; 10 years DFS, 50% vs. 59%). The interaction between chemotherapy and ER status with respect to DFS was significant ( = .013).[] This trial supports consideration of adjuvant chemotherapy after complete resection of isolated locoregional recurrence of breast cancer in patients with ER-negative tumors.

Although median survival has been reported to be 18 to 24 months overall,[] survival varies according to subtype. The longest median outcomes have been observed in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive and hormone receptor–positive metastatic breast cancer, and less favorable outcomes have been observed in patients with triple-negative metastatic breast cancer.[] Treatment options for metastatic breast cancer include the following: Hormone therapy (tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors). Surgery, for patients with limited symptomatic metastases. Radiation therapy, for patients with limited symptomatic metastases. Bone-modifying therapy, for patients with bone metastases. In many cases, these therapies are given in sequence and used in various combinations. Cytologic or histologic documentation of metastatic disease, with testing of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor, and HER2 status, should be obtained whenever possible. All patients with metastatic breast cancer are considered candidates for ongoing clinical trials. Endocrine therapy and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor therapy CDK4 and CDK6 have been implicated in the continued proliferation of hormone receptor–positive breast cancer resistant to endocrine therapy. CDK inhibitors have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in combination with endocrine therapy in both first-line and later-line treatment of advanced hormone receptor–positive HER2-negative breast cancer. Three oral CDK4/6 inhibitors are currently available: palbociclib, ribociclib, and abemaciclib. Overall, the addition of CDK 4/6 inhibitors to endocrine therapy is associated with improved breast cancer outcomes and, in general, either maintained or improved quality of life.[-] This benefit was observed across multiple clinicopathological subgroups of breast cancer.[] Evidence (first-line palbociclib and endocrine therapy): (NCT01740427) confirmed the results of the phase II PALOMA-1 trial.[] This phase III, double-blind trial compared placebo plus letrozole with palbociclib plus letrozole as initial therapy for ER-positive postmenopausal patients with advanced disease (n = 666).[] The primary endpoint (investigator-assessed progression-free survival [PFS]) was met with a median PFS of 24.8 months in the palbociclib-plus-letrozole group compared with 14.5 months in the placebo-plus-letrozole group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.58; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.46–0.72; < .001).[][] Patients who received palbociclib experienced more frequent cytopenias (66.4% grade 3 to 4 in palbociclib-treated patients vs. 1.4% in placebo-treated patients). Other common adverse events included nausea, arthralgia, fatigue, and alopecia. The most common grade 3 to 4 adverse events other than neutropenia included leukopenia (24.8% vs. 0%), anemia (5.4% vs. 1.8%), and fatigue (1.8% vs. 0.5%). Ribociclib, another CDK4/6 inhibitor, has also been tested in the first-line setting for postmenopausal patients and premenopausal patients with hormone receptor–positive and HER2-negative recurrent or metastatic breast cancer. Evidence (first-line ribociclib and endocrine therapy): The phase III, placebo-controlled MONALEESA-2 trial () randomly assigned 668 patients to receive first-line ribociclib plus letrozole or placebo plus letrozole.[] The primary endpoint (investigator-assessed PFS) was met. A preplanned interim analysis was performed after 243 patients had disease progression or died, and median duration of follow-up was 15.3 months. After 18 months, the PFS rate was 63.0% (95% CI, 54.6–70.3) in the ribociclib group and 42.2% (95% CI, 34.8–49.5) in the placebo group.[][] OS data were immature at the time of publication. Adverse events in patients included neutropenia in the ribociclib group (74.3%) and in the placebo group (5.2%), nausea (51.5% and 28.5%), infection (50.3% and 42.4%), fatigue (36.5% and 30.0%), and diarrhea (35.0% and 22.1%). These events were mostly grade 1 to 2 with the exception of cytopenia. Grade 3 to 4 neutropenia occurred in 59.3% of patients in the ribociclib group and 0.9% of patients in the placebo group. The rate of febrile neutropenia was 1.5% in the ribociclib group and 0% in the placebo group. An increase in QTcF (QT interval corrected for heart rate according to Fridericia’s formula) interval of more than 60 milliseconds from baseline was observed in nine patients (2.7%) in the ribociclib arm compared with zero patients in the placebo arm. Ribociclib has also been tested in combination with fulvestrant in postmenopausal patients with hormone receptor–positive and HER2-negative recurrent or metastatic breast cancer. The (NCT02422615) trial included patients receiving first-line or second-line therapy. This phase III, placebo-controlled trial randomly assigned 726 patients in a 2:1 ratio to receive ribociclib plus fulvestrant or placebo plus fulvestrant.[] The primary endpoint (investigator-assessed PFS) was met. At the time of final analysis for PFS, the median PFS for the ribociclib group was 20.5 months versus 12.8 months in the placebo group (HR, .593; 95% CI, .480–.732; <.001).[][] OS was superior in the ribociclib group (HR, 0.724; 95% CI, 0.568–0.924;  = .004). The result crossed the prespecified stopping boundary ( = .011) for superior efficacy. Results were similar in all subgroups.[][] Adverse events were similar to those in other studies of CDK4/6 inhibitors. Grade 3 to 4 neutropenia occurred in 53.4% of patients in the ribociclib group and 0.0% of patients in the placebo group. The rate of febrile neutropenia was 1.0% in the ribociclib group and 0% in the placebo group. An increase in QTcF interval of more than 60 milliseconds from baseline was observed in 6.5% of patients in the ribociclib arm and 0.4% in the placebo arm. Ribociclib was also assessed in the first-line setting in a study conducted solely in premenopausal or perimenopausal women receiving either tamoxifen or a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor (AI) plus goserelin.[] In the (NCT02278120) trial, 672 premenopausal patients with hormone receptor–positive and HER2-negative recurrent or metastatic breast cancer, who had not received endocrine therapy for advanced disease, were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to ribociclib or placebo. The primary endpoint (investigator-assessed PFS) was met. At the time of final analysis for PFS, the median PFS for the ribociclib group was 23.8 months versus 13.0 months in the placebo group (HR, .55; 95% CI, 0.44–0.69; < .0001).[][] OS was a secondary endpoint. The combination of ribociclib plus endocrine therapy was associated with longer OS than was endocrine therapy alone (42-month OS, 70.2% vs. 46%; HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.54−0.95, = .01).[][] The survival benefit was observed both in patients who received an AI plus goserelin and in those who received tamoxifen, but it was not statistically significant in the much-smaller tamoxifen group. Adverse events were similar to those in other studies of CDK4/6 inhibitors. Grade 3 to 4 neutropenia occurred in 61% of patients in the ribociclib group and 4% of patients in the placebo group. The rate of febrile neutropenia was 2.0% in the ribociclib group and 1.0% in the placebo group. An increase in QTcF interval of more than 60 milliseconds from baseline was observed in 10.0 % of patients in the ribociclib arm and 2.0% in the placebo arm. Sixty-millisecond increases were more common in patients receiving tamoxifen (16% on ribociclib and 7% on placebo). Abemaciclib, another CDK4/6 inhibitor, has also been tested in the first-line setting for postmenopausal patients with hormone receptor–positive and HER2-negative recurrent or metastatic breast cancer. Evidence (first-line abemaciclib and endocrine therapy): (NCT02246621) was a randomized, double-blind, phase III trial that evaluated first-line abemaciclib or placebo plus a nonsteroidal AI in 493 postmenopausal women with hormone receptor–positive and HER2-negative advanced breast cancer.[] The primary endpoint, investigator-assessed PFS, was met. After a median follow-up of 17.8 months, the PFS was not reached in the abemaciclib arm and was reached at 14.7 months in the placebo arm (HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.41–0.72; = .000021). The side effect profile of abemaciclib differs from the other CDK4/6 inhibitors. Diarrhea was the most frequent adverse event in the abemaciclib arm, although most of the diarrhea cases were grade 1. Neutropenia was more common in the abemaciclib arm; however, only 21.1% of participants experienced grade 3 to 4 neutropenia. Evidence (second-line palbociclib and endocrine therapy): (NCT01942135) is a double-blind, phase III trial of 521 patients with hormone receptor–positive, HER2/neu–negative, advanced breast cancer who had relapsed after or progressed on previous endocrine therapy and were randomly assigned to receive either fulvestrant plus placebo or fulvestrant plus palbociclib. Premenopausal and postmenopausal patients were eligible. Premenopausal patients received goserelin.[][] The final PFS analysis showed a median PFS of 9.5 months on the palbociclib-fulvestrant arm versus 4.6 months on the placebo-fulvestrant arm (HR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.36–0.59; < .0001).[][] Cytopenias, particularly neutropenia, were much more frequent on the palbociclib-containing arm, but febrile neutropenia was very uncommon (1%) in both groups. Patients receiving palbociclib had more-frequent fatigue, nausea, and headache. A prespecified analysis of OS was made after 310 patients had died. A 6.9 month difference in median OS favoring the palbociclib-fulvestrant arm (34.9 months vs. 28.0 months) was found, which did not reach statistical significance (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.64–1.03, = .09).[] In a preplanned subgroup analysis, improved OS was observed in patients who had demonstrated sensitivity to hormone therapy (HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.55−0.94), whereas in patients without sensitivity, OS was not improved in the palbociclib group (HR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.71−1.84; = .12 for interaction). The MONALEESA-3 trial included patients receiving second-line therapy. (Refer to the evidence on first-line ribociclib and endocrine therapy for more information.) The (NCT02107703) study tested abemaciclib (CDK4/6 inhibitor) in a phase III, placebo-controlled trial that randomly assigned 669 patients with hormone receptor–positive and HER2-negative advanced breast cancer (with previous progression on endocrine therapy) to receive abemaciclib plus fulvestrant or placebo plus fulvestrant.[] The primary endpoint (investigator-assessed PFS) was met, with median duration of follow-up of 19.5 months. The median PFS was 16.4 months for the abemaciclib-fulvestrant arm versus 9.3 months for the placebo-fulvestrant arm (HR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.45–0.68; < .001).[][] OS data are mature and demonstrate an improvement in OS for patients receiving abemaciclib, and showed a median OS of 46.7 months for abemaciclib plus fulvestrant versus 37.3 months for placebo (HR, 0.757; 95% CI, 0.606–0.945; = .01).[][] Adverse events included diarrhea in the abemaciclib group (86.4%) and in the placebo group (24.7%), neutropenia (46% and 4%), nausea (45.1% and 22.9%), fatigue (39.9% and 26.9%), and abdominal pain (35.4% and 15.7%). These events were mostly grade 1 to 2. Grade 1 to 2 diarrhea occurred in 73% of the patients in the abemaciclib group and in 24.2% of the placebo group. Anti-diarrheal medicine effectively managed this symptom in most cases, according to the study report. Grade 3 diarrhea occurred in 13.4% of patients in the abemaciclib group and 0.4% of patients in the placebo group. No grade 4 diarrhea was reported. Grade 3 to 4 neutropenia occurred in 25.5% of patients in the abemaciclib group and 1.7% of patients in the placebo group. Febrile neutropenia was reported in six patients in the abemaciclib arm. Single-agent cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor therapy Evidence (single-agent cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor therapy): Single-agent abemaciclib was approved by the FDA for use in hormone receptor–positive, HER2-negative breast cancer with disease progression on or after endocrine therapy and chemotherapy on the basis of results of the (NCT02102490) trial.[] Abemaciclib is the only CDK4/6 inhibitor approved as a single agent. MONARCH 1 was a single-arm phase II study of single-agent abemaciclib in 132 women with hormone receptor–positive and HER2-negative advanced breast cancer that had progressed on at least one line of previous endocrine therapy and at least two lines of previous chemotherapy. The study population was heavily pretreated, and most participants had visceral disease. Patients who had previous CDK inhibitors were excluded. The primary endpoint, investigator-assessed objective response rate, was 19.7% at 12 months (95% CI, 13.3–27.5%). Median PFS was 6.0 months (95% CI, 4.2–7.5 months). The most common adverse event was diarrhea, which occurred in 90.2% of the participants. However, the majority was grade 1 to 2, and only 19.7% of participants experienced grade 3 diarrhea. There was no grade 4 diarrhea. Neutropenia occurred in 97.7% of participants; however, the majority was grade 1 to 2, and only 26.9% of participants experienced grade 3 to 4 neutropenia. Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor therapy plus endocrine therapy Preclinical models and clinical studies suggest that mTOR inhibitors might overcome endocrine resistance. The Breast Cancer Trial of Oral Everolimus ( [NCT00863655]) was a randomized, phase III, placebo-controlled trial in which patients with hormone receptor–positive metastatic breast cancer that is resistant to nonsteroidal aromatase inhibition were randomly assigned to receive either the mTOR inhibitor everolimus plus exemestane, or placebo plus exemestane.[][] At the interim analysis, median PFS was 6.9 months for everolimus plus exemestane and 2.8 months for placebo plus exemestane (HR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.35–0.54; < .001). The addition of everolimus to exemestane was more toxic than was placebo plus exemestane, with the most-common grade 3 or 4 adverse events being stomatitis (8% vs. 1%), anemia (6% vs. <1%), dyspnea (4% vs. 1%), hyperglycemia (4% vs. <1%), fatigue (4% vs. 1%), and pneumonitis (3% vs. 0%). OS differences were not significant after further follow-up.[] (NCT01298713) was an open-label randomized phase II trial comparing tamoxifen to tamoxifen plus everolimus in postmenopausal women whose disease had progressed after receiving an AI in the adjuvant or metastatic setting. The trial randomly assigned 57 women to receive tamoxifen and 54 women to receive the combination therapy.[] Median time to progression was 8.6 months in the combination group and 4.5 months in the tamoxifen group (HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.56−0.81; = .002). Toxicities were greater on the everolimus arm and similar to those in the BOLERO2 trial. In an exploratory analysis, OS was 32.9 months in the tamoxifen group and not reached in the combination group (HR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.24−0.81; = .007).[][] (NCT01797120) was a double-blind randomized phase II trial comparing fulvestrant to fulvestrant plus everolimus in postmenopausal women whose disease had progressed after receiving an AI in the adjuvant or metastatic setting. Sixty-six women were randomly assigned to the combination arm and 65 to fulvestrant alone.[] Median PFS was 10.3 months on the combination arm and 5.1 months on the fulvestrant-alone arm (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.40−0.92; = .02).[][] Toxicities were similar to those in previous studies. The was no observed difference in OS between the arms. The trial (NCT02069093) was a single-arm trial assessing the efficacy of a dexamethasone oral solution (0.5 mg per 5 mL) in the prevention of stomatitis in women receiving exemestane plus everolimus.[] The incidence of grade 2 or worse stomatitis was 2% in the 85 evaluable patients in this study compared with 33% in the BOLERO-2 trial. Activating mutations in are identified in approximately 40% of hormone receptor–positive and HER2-negative breast cancers. Alpelisib is an alpha-specific PI3K inhibitor. (NCT02437318) was a randomized phase III trial comparing alpelisib plus fulvestrant to placebo plus fulvestrant in 572 postmenopausal women with hormone receptor–positive and HER2-negative advanced breast cancer who had received previous endocrine therapy.[][] mutations were confirmed in 341 participants. The primary endpoint was PFS in the cohort of patients with mutations. In this cohort, median PFS was 11 months in the alpelisib-plus-fulvestrant arm compared with 5.7 months in the placebo-plus-fulvestrant arm (HR or HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.50−0.85; < .001). PFS did not differ between arms in the cohort of participants without mutations (median PFS, 7.4 months in the alpelisib-plus-fulvestrant arm vs. 5.6 months in the placebo-plus-fulvestrant arm). OS in the cohort with mutations was a secondary endpoint. OS data are not yet mature. Very few study participants had received previous CDK4/6 inhibitor therapy. Common toxicities associated with alpelisib included hyperglycemia, diarrhea, nausea, anorexia, and rash. Careful monitoring and management of hyperglycemia are required during alpelisib use. Alpelisib is approved by the FDA for use in combination with fulvestrant in advanced -mutated, hormone receptor–positive, HER2-negative breast cancer after previous endocrine therapy. Evidence of mTOR inhibitor activity in HER2-positive breast cancer was shown in the double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase III (NCT01007942) trial.[][] In the BOLERO-3 trial, 569 patients with HER2-positive, trastuzumab-resistant, breast cancer, who had received previous taxane therapy, were randomly assigned to receive either everolimus plus trastuzumab plus vinorelbine, or placebo plus trastuzumab plus vinorelbine. At median follow-up of 20.2 months, median PFS was 7.0 months in the everolimus group versus 5.78 months in the placebo group (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.65–0.95; = .0067). Serious adverse events were reported in 117 patients (42%) in the everolimus group and 55 patients (20%) in the placebo group. Final OS outcomes for this trial have not yet been reported. With the PFS and OS advantages associated with combination therapy with targeted agents and endocrine therapy as discussed above, single-agent endocrine therapy is less frequently used, especially in the first-line setting. However, its use remains appropriate in select cases as first-line therapy and in later-line therapy after progression on targeted therapies and before the use of chemotherapy in cases in which endocrine-sensitive disease is still thought to be present. Commonly used single-agent endocrine therapies include tamoxifen, nonsteroidal AI (letrozole, anastrozole), the steroidal AI exemestane, and fulvestrant. In general, premenopausal women with metastatic breast cancer undergo ovarian suppression or ablation and are treated in the same manner as postmenopausal women. While tamoxifen has been used for many years in treating postmenopausal women with newly metastatic disease that is ER positive, PR positive, or ER/PR unknown, several randomized trials suggest equivalent or superior response rates and PFS for the AI compared with tamoxifen.[-][] A meta-analysis evaluated patients with metastatic disease who were randomly assigned to receive either an AI as their first or second hormone therapy, or standard therapy (tamoxifen or a progestational agent).[][] Patients who received an AI as either their first or second hormone therapy for metastatic disease and were randomly assigned to receive a third-generation drug (anastrozole, letrozole, exemestane, or vorozole) lived longer (HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.82–0.93) than those who received standard therapy (tamoxifen or a progestational agent). Fulvestrant is a selective estrogen receptor degrader that has been studied in the first-line and second-line setting in women with advanced or metastatic breast cancer. (NCT01602380) was a phase III double-blind randomized trial that compared fulvestrant (500 mg) to anastrozole (1 mg) in patients with advanced or metastatic receptor-positive breast cancer who had not received previous endocrine therapy.[] The trial randomly assigned 230 patients to receive fulvestrant and 232 patients to receive anastrozole. Median PFS was 16.6 months in the fulvestrant group and 13.8 months in the anastrozole group (HR, 0.797; 95% CI, 0.637−0.999; = .049).[][] The frequency of adverse events was similar in the two groups, and there was no difference in quality of life. Two randomized trials that enrolled 400 and 451 patients whose disease had progressed after they received tamoxifen demonstrated that fulvestrant yielded results similar to those of anastrozole in terms of its impact on PFS.[,] The proper sequence of these therapies is not known.[,] (NCT00065325) was a phase III double-blind randomized trial that compared fulvestrant given in a loading-dose regimen (500 mg day 0, 250 mg days 14 and 28, and 250 mg every 28 days thereafter) to exemestane (25 mg) in women who had developed progressive disease after previous nonsteroidal AI (anastrozole or letrozole) therapy.[] The trial randomly assigned 351 women to receive fulvestrant and 342 women to receive exemestane. Median time to progression was 3.7 months in both groups (HR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.819−1.133; = .65).[][] The frequency of adverse events was similar in both groups, and there was no difference in quality of life. (NCT00099437) was a double-blind phase III trial that compared two doses of fulvestrant (500 mg vs. 250 mg, each given in a loading-dose schedule) in 736 women whose disease had progressed on previous endocrine therapy.[] PFS was significantly better on the higher-dose arm (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.68–0.94; = .006).[][] Adverse events and quality of life were similar on the two arms. Combination endocrine therapy with an AI and fulvestrant Conflicting results were found in two trials that compared the combination of the antiestrogen fulvestrant (refer to the section on for more information about this drug) and anastrozole with anastrozole alone in the first-line treatment of hormone receptor–positive postmenopausal patients with recurrent or metastatic disease.[,] In both studies, fulvestrant was administered as a 500-mg loading dose on day 1; 250 mg was administered on days 15 and 29, and monthly thereafter; plus, 1 mg of anastrozole was administered daily. The Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) trial included more patients who presented with metastatic disease; the Fulvestrant and Anastrozole Combination Therapy ( [NCT00256698]) study enrolled more patients who had previously received tamoxifen.[,] Evidence (combination endocrine therapy with an AI and fulvestrant): The SWOG trial ( [NCT00075764]), which enrolled 707 patients, demonstrated a statistically significant difference in PFS (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.68–0.94; = .007) and OS (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.65–1.00; = .05).[][] In an analysis done after 5 more years of follow-up, the observed benefits of combined therapy were still present, and the level of significance with respect to OS was greater (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.69–0.98; = .03).[][] In contrast, the FACT trial , which enrolled 514 patients, found no difference in either disease-free survival (DFS) (HR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.81–1.20; = .91) or OS (HR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.76–1.32; = 1.00).[][] Sequencing Therapy for Hormone Receptor–Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer The optimal sequence of therapies for hormone receptor–positive metastatic breast cancer is not known. In general, in the absence of a visceral crisis, most patients receive sequential endocrine-based regimens before transitioning to chemotherapy. On the basis of the PFS and OS improvements mentioned above, a combination of a CDK4/6 inhibitor therapy and endocrine therapy in the first line is an appropriate choice. The treatment for hormone receptor–negative breast cancer is chemotherapy. (Refer to the section of this summary for more information.) Antibody therapy targeting the HER2 pathway has been used since the 1990s and has revolutionized the treatment of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. Several HER2-targeted agents (e.g., trastuzumab, pertuzumab, ado-trastuzumab emtansine, lapatinib) have been approved for treatment of this disease. Approximately 20% to 25% of patients with breast cancer have tumors that overexpress HER2/neu.[] Trastuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to the HER2/neu receptor.[] In patients previously treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy whose tumors overexpress HER2/neu, administration of trastuzumab as a single agent resulted in a response rate of 21%.[][] In a phase III trial, patients with metastatic disease were randomly assigned to receive either chemotherapy alone (doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide or paclitaxel) or the same chemotherapy plus trastuzumab.[][] Patients treated with chemotherapy plus trastuzumab had an OS advantage over those who received chemotherapy alone (25.1 months vs. 20.3 months, = .05).[][] Notably, when combined with doxorubicin, trastuzumab is associated with significant cardiac toxicity.[] Clinical trials comparing multiagent chemotherapy plus trastuzumab with single-agent chemotherapy have yielded conflicting results. In one randomized study of patients with metastatic breast cancer treated with trastuzumab, paclitaxel, and carboplatin, patients tolerated the combination well and had a longer time to disease progression, compared with those treated with trastuzumab and paclitaxel alone.[][] However, no difference in OS, time to disease progression, or response rate was shown in the Breast Cancer International Research Group’s phase III trial ( [NCT00047255]) that compared carboplatin and docetaxel plus trastuzumab versus docetaxel plus trastuzumab as first-line chemotherapy for metastatic HER2-overexpressing breast cancer.[][] Outside of a clinical trial, standard first-line treatment for metastatic HER2-overexpressing breast cancer is single-agent chemotherapy plus trastuzumab. Pertuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to a different epitope at the HER2 extracellular domain than does trastuzumab. The binding of pertuzumab to HER2 prevents dimerization with other ligand-activated HER receptors, most notably HER3. The phase III (NCT00567190) trial assessed the efficacy and safety of pertuzumab plus trastuzumab plus docetaxel versus placebo plus trastuzumab plus docetaxel, in the first-line HER2-positive metastatic setting.[,][] With a median follow-up of 50 months, the median OS was 40.8 months in the control group versus 56.5 months in the pertuzumab group (HR favoring pertuzumab group, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.56–0.84; < .001). Median PFS per investigator assessment was improved by 6.3 months by the addition of pertuzumab (HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.58–0.80). Median OS was 56.5 months in the pertuzumab group compared with 40.8 months in the placebo group (HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.57–0.84; < .001).[] Eight-year landmark OS rates were 37% with the addition of pertuzumab, compared with 23% in the placebo group.[] The toxicity profile was similar in both treatment groups, with no increase in cardiac toxic effects seen in the pertuzumab combination arm. Ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) is an antibody-drug conjugate that incorporates the HER2-targeted antitumor properties of trastuzumab with the cytotoxic activity of the microtubule-inhibitory agent DM1. T-DM1 allows specific intracellular drug delivery to HER2-overexpressing cells, potentially improving the therapeutic index and minimizing exposure of normal tissue. The phase III or TDM4370g (NCT00829166) study was a randomized open-label trial that enrolled 991 patients with HER2-overexpressing, unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who were previously treated with trastuzumab and a taxane.[][] Patients were randomly assigned to receive either T-DM1 or lapatinib plus capecitabine. Median PFS was 9.6 months with T-DM1 versus 6.4 months with lapatinib plus capecitabine (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.55–0.77; < .001). Median OS was longer with trastuzumab emtansine versus lapatinib plus capecitabine (29.9 months vs. 25.9 months; HR, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.64–0.88]).[] The incidences of thrombocytopenia and increased serum aminotransferase levels were higher in patients who received T-DM1, whereas the incidences of diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and palmar-plantar syndrome were higher in patients who received lapatinib plus capecitabine. Further evidence of T-DM1’s activity in metastatic HER2-overexpressed breast cancer was shown in a randomized phase II study of T-DM1 versus trastuzumab plus docetaxel.[][] This trial randomly assigned 137 women with HER2-overexpressed breast cancer in the first-line metastatic setting. At median follow-up of 14 months, median PFS was 9.2 months with trastuzumab plus docetaxel and 14.2 months with T-DM1 (HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.36–0.97). Preliminary OS results were similar between treatment arms. T-DM1 had a favorable safety profile compared with trastuzumab plus docetaxel, with fewer grade 3 adverse events (46.4% vs. 90.9%), adverse events leading to treatment discontinuations (7.2% vs. 40.9%), and serious adverse events (20.3% vs. 25.8%). Evidence of activity of T-DM1 in heavily pretreated patients with metastatic, HER2-overexpressed breast cancer who had received previous trastuzumab and lapatinib was shown in the randomized phase III (NCT01419197) study of T-DM1 versus physician’s choice of treatment.[][] This trial randomly assigned 602 patients in a 2:1 ratio (404 patients assigned to T-DM1 and 198 patients assigned to physician’s choice) and allowed crossover to T-DM1. At a median follow-up of 7.2 months in the T-DM1 group and 6.5 months in the physician’s-choice group, median PFS was 6.2 months in the T-DM1 group and 3.3 months in the physician’s-choice group (HR, 0.528; 95% CI, 0.422–0.661; < .0001). OS was significantly longer with trastuzumab emtansine versus the treatment of physician’s choice (median OS, 22.7 months vs. 15.8 months; HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.54–0.85; = .0007).[] The role of T-DM1 as first-line treatment of metastatic HER2-overexpressed breast cancer was evaluated in the phase III (NCT01120184) trial.[][] This study randomly assigned 1,095 patients to receive either trastuzumab plus taxane, T-DM1 plus placebo, or T-DM1 plus pertuzumab. The median PFS for these treatment groups was 13.7 months for the trastuzumab-plus-taxane group, 14.1 months for the T-DM1-plus-placebo group, and 15.2 months for the T-DM1-plus-pertuzumab group. There was no significant difference in PFS with T-DM1 plus placebo compared with trastuzumab plus taxane (HR, 0.91; 97.5% CI, 0.73–1.13), or with T-DM1 plus pertuzumab compared with trastuzumab plus taxane (HR, 0.87; 97.5% CI, 0.69–1.08). Therefore, neither T-DM1 plus placebo nor T-DM1 plus pertuzumab showed PFS superiority over trastuzumab plus taxane. Trastuzumab deruxtecan is an antibody-drug conjugate that combines trastuzumab with a topoisomerase inhibitor. A phase I study demonstrated antitumor activity in patients with advanced HER2-positive breast cancer who received the drug conjugate.[] A non-blinded single-arm phase II trial () examined the response rate to trastuzumab deruxtecan at a dose of 5.4 mg/kg in 184 patients with HER2-positive breast cancer who had previously received trastuzumab and trastuzumab emtansine.[][] The confirmed response rate on independent central review was 60.9%, with a median response duration of 14.8 months. The impact of trastuzumab deruxtecan on PFS and OS is unknown. A grade 3 or higher adverse event was seen in 57.1% of patients, with 15.2% of patients discontinuing treatment for this reason. Interstitial lung disease developed in 13.6% of patients, and 4 deaths (2.2%) were attributed to this complication. Lapatinib is an orally administered tyrosine kinase inhibitor of both HER2/neu and the epidermal growth factor receptor. Lapatinib plus capecitabine has shown activity in patients who have HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer that progressed after treatment with trastuzumab. A nonblinded randomized trial ( [NCT00078572]) compared the combination of capecitabine and lapatinib with capecitabine alone in 324 patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease that progressed after therapies that included anthracyclines, taxanes, and trastuzumab.[][] Median time-to-disease progression in the lapatinib-plus-capecitabine arm was 8.4 months compared with 4.4 months in the capecitabine-alone arm (HR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.34–0.71; < .001). There was no difference in OS (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.58–1.46; = .72).[][] Patients on combination therapy were more likely to develop diarrhea, rash, and dyspepsia. (Refer to the PDQ summary on for more information about diarrhea.) No data are available on quality of life or treatment after disease progression. Tucatinib is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor highly selective for the kinase domain of HER2 that minimally inhibits the epidermal growth factor receptor. A phase Ib trial in pretreated patients demonstrated activity when tucatinib was combined with trastuzumab and capecitabine. The trial (NCT02614794) compared trastuzumab, capecitabine, and tucatinib with trastuzumab, capecitabine, and placebo in 632 patients who had previously been treated with trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and trastuzumab emtansine and had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1. Patients with and without brain metastases were included.[][] The analysis of the primary study endpoint, PFS, demonstrated a median PFS in the tucatinib combination group of 7.8 months and 5.6 months in the placebo combination group (HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.42–0.71; < .001) In an interim analysis conducted at the time of the PFS analysis, median OS was 21.9 months in the tucatinib combination group and 17.4 months in the placebo combination group (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.50–0.88; = .005) Patients with and without brain metastases benefited from the tucatinib combination. Grade 3 adverse events including diarrhea, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome, and elevated aminotransferase levels were more common in the tucatinib combination group, but occurred in fewer than 15% of patients. For patients with metastatic breast cancer who carry a germline mutation, the oral inhibitor of poly (adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP) has shown activity. and are tumor-suppressor genes that encode proteins involved in DNA repair through the homologous recombination repair pathway. PARP plays a critical role in DNA repair and has been studied as therapy for patients with breast cancer who harbor a germline mutation. The (NCT02000622) trial was a randomized, open-label, phase III trial that randomly assigned 302 patients, in a 2:1 ratio, to receive olaparib (300 mg bid) or standard therapy (either single-agent capecitabine, eribulin, or vinorelbine).[] All patients had received anthracycline and taxane previously in either the adjuvant or metastatic setting, and those with hormone receptor–positive disease had also received endocrine therapy previously. Median PFS was significantly longer in the olaparib group than in the standard therapy group (7.0 months vs. 4.2. months; HR for disease progression or death, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.43–0.80; < .001).[][] OS did not differ between the two treatment groups with median time to death (HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.63–1.29; = .57). Olaparib was less toxic than standard therapy, with a rate of grade 3 or higher adverse events of 36.6% in the olaparib group and 50.5% in the standard therapy group, with anemia, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, headache, and cough occurring more frequently with olaparib; neutropenia, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia, and liver-function test abnormalities occurred more commonly with chemotherapy. Of note, subset analysis suggested that PFS improvement with olaparib appeared greater in the triple-negative breast cancer subgroup (HR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.29–0.63) than in the hormone receptor–positive subgroup (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.55–1.26). The (NCT01945775) trial was a randomized, open label, phase III trial that assigned 431 patients with a deleterious germline or mutation and locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer in a 2:1 ratio to talazoparib (1 mg PO qd) or standard single-agent chemotherapy of the physician’s choice (eribulin, capecitabine, gemcitabine, or vinorelbine).[] All patients had received previous treatment with an anthracycline, taxane, or both. Patients had received three or fewer lines of cytotoxic chemotherapy for advanced breast cancer. Previous platinum therapy in the setting of early breast cancer was permitted if it was completed at least 6 months before progressive disease or if there was no objective progression while on platinum therapy in the advanced-disease setting. Hormone receptor–positive and hormone receptor–negative patients were enrolled. Median PFS was significantly longer in the talazoparib group than in the standard therapy group (8.6 months vs. 5.6 months; HR for disease progression or death, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.41–0.71; < .001). Benefits were observed in all subgroups, although CIs were wide in the subgroup of patients who had received previous platinum therapy. Median OS did not differ between the two groups (22.3 months vs. 19.5 months; HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.55–1.06; = .11), although survival data are not yet mature. The primary toxicity observed with talazoparib was myelosuppression, especially anemia. Patient-reported outcome data demonstrated more favorable effects of talazoparib than standard chemotherapy on quality-of-life measures.[] (Refer to the PDQ summary on for more information.) Patients receiving hormone therapy whose tumors have progressed are candidates for cytotoxic chemotherapy. There are no data suggesting that combination therapy results in an OS benefit over single-agent therapy. Patients with hormone receptor–negative tumors and those with visceral metastases or symptomatic disease are also candidates for cytotoxic agents.[] Single agents that have shown activity in metastatic breast cancer include the following: Anthracyclines. Taxanes. Albumin-bound nanoparticle paclitaxel (ABI-007 or Abraxane).[,] Fluoropyrimidines. Vinca alkaloids. Other. Combination regimens that have shown activity in metastatic breast cancer include the following: CAF: Cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and 5-FU.[] CMF: Cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-FU.[] There are no data suggesting that combination therapy results in an OS benefit over single-agent therapy. An ECOG intergroup study (E-1193) randomly assigned patients to receive paclitaxel and doxorubicin, given both as a combination and sequentially.[] Although response rate and time to disease progression were both better for the combination, survival was the same in both groups.[][]; [,] The selection of therapy in individual patients is influenced by the following: Presence or absence of comorbid medical conditions. Currently, no data support the superiority of any particular regimen. Sequential use of single agents or combinations can be used for patients who relapse with metastatic disease. Combination chemotherapy is often given if there is evidence of rapidly progressive disease or visceral crisis. Combinations of chemotherapy and hormone therapy have not shown an OS advantage over the sequential use of these agents.[,] A systematic review of 17 randomized trials found that the addition of one or more chemotherapy drugs to a chemotherapy regimen in the attempt to intensify the treatment improved tumor response but had no effect on OS.[][] Decisions regarding the duration of chemotherapy may consider the following: The optimal time for patients with responsive or stable disease has been studied by several groups. For patients who attain a complete response to initial therapy, two randomized trials have shown a prolonged DFS after immediate treatment with a different chemotherapy regimen compared with observation and treatment upon relapse.[,][] Neither of these studies, however, showed an improvement in OS for patients who received immediate treatment; in one of these studies,[] survival was actually worse in the group that was treated immediately. Similarly, no difference in survival was noted when patients with partial response or stable disease after initial therapy were randomly assigned to receive either a different chemotherapy versus observation [] or a different chemotherapy regimen given at higher versus lower doses.[][] However, 324 patients who achieved disease control were randomly assigned to maintenance chemotherapy or observation. Patients who received maintenance chemotherapy (paclitaxel and gemcitabine) had improved PFS at 6 months and improved OS. This was associated with an increased rate of adverse events.[][] Because there is no standard approach for treating metastatic disease, patients requiring second-line regimens are good candidates for clinical trials. The addition of atezolizumab, an anti-programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1)–positive antibody, to first-line chemotherapy for patients with hormone receptor–negative and HER2-negative advanced breast cancer was evaluated in the phase III randomized placebo-controlled trial (NCT02425891).[] Participants (N = 902) were randomly assigned 1:1 to atezolizumab plus nanoparticle albumin-bound (nab)-paclitaxel or to placebo plus nab-paclitaxel. Participants were stratified according to the presence of liver metastases (yes/no), receipt of previous taxane therapy (yes/no), and PD-L1 status (positive or negative). PD-L1 score of 1% or greater was defined as positive. Co-primary endpoints included PFS and OS, both of which were evaluated in the intention-to-treat population and in the PD-L1–positive population (n = 369). PFS data are final with a median follow-up of 12.9 months and included the following: In the intention-to-treat population, PFS was improved with the addition of atezolizumab (median PFS, 7.2 months vs. 5.5 months; HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.69–0.92; = .0025). In the PD-L1–positive population, PFS was improved with the addition of atezolizumab (median PFS, 7.5 months vs. 5 months; HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.49–0.78; < .001). OS data are not yet mature. Results of the first interim analysis for OS, performed at the time of the final PFS analysis, included the following: In the intention-to-treat population, there was a nonsignificant trend toward improved OS with the addition of atezolizumab (median OS, 21.3 months vs. 17.6 months; HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.69–1.02; = .08). The study design used hierarchical testing for OS requiring that the OS be statistically significantly improved with atezolizumab in the intention-to-treat population before OS could be compared between the arms in the PD-L1–positive population. Because this requirement was not met at the time of the first interim analysis, a -value could not be determined at that time for the comparison of OS between the two arms in the PD-L1–positive population. Median OS was, however, 9.5 months longer in the atezolizumab arm in the PD-L1–positive population (25 months vs. 15.5 months; HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.45–0.86).[][] Adverse events occurred as expected. Adverse events that were potentially immune-related were more frequent in the atezolizumab arm. Atezolizumab was granted by the FDA for use in combination with protein-bound paclitaxel for patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer whose tumors express PD-L1. Sacituzumab govitecan is an antibody drug conjugate that combines an anti–trophoblast cell-surface antigen 2 antibody with an active metabolite of irinotecan.[] In a phase I/II trial, 108 women with triple-negative breast cancer who had received at least two previous chemotherapy regimens (median, three) were treated with sacituzumab govitecan at a dose of 10 mg/kg intravenously on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle. A response rate of 33.3% (95% CI, 24.6%–43.1%) was observed. The median duration of response was 7.7 months (95% CI, 4.9–10.8).[][] The main toxicity was neutropenia, and four deaths occurred during treatment. The FDA granted accelerated approval to sacituzumab govitecan for patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer after at least two previous lines of therapy. A confirmatory randomized trial is still under way. The potential for anthracycline-induced cardiac toxic effects should be considered in the selection of chemotherapeutic regimens for selected patients. Recognized risk factors for cardiac toxicity include the following: The cardioprotective drug dexrazoxane has been shown to decrease the risk of doxorubicin-induced cardiac toxicity in patients in controlled studies. The use of this agent has permitted patients to receive higher cumulative doses of doxorubicin and has allowed patients with cardiac risk factors to receive doxorubicin.[-] The risk of cardiac toxicity may also be reduced by administering doxorubicin as a continuous intravenous infusion.[] The American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines suggest the use of dexrazoxane in patients with metastatic cancer who have received a cumulative dose of doxorubicin of 300 mg/m or more when further treatment with an anthracycline is likely to be of benefit.[] Dexrazoxane has a similar protective effect in patients receiving epirubicin.[] Surgery may be indicated for select patients. For example, patients may need surgery if the following issues occur: Parenchymal brain or vertebral metastases with spinal cord compression. (Refer to the PDQ summary on for more information; refer to the PDQ summary on for information about pleural and pericardial effusions.) Radiation therapy has a major role in the palliation of localized symptomatic metastases.[] Indications for external-beam radiation therapy include the following: Unresectable central nervous system metastases (i.e., brain, meninges, and spinal cord). After surgery for decompression of intracranial or spinal cord metastases. Strontium chloride Sr 89, a systemically administered radionuclide, can be administered for palliation of diffuse bony metastases.[,] The use of bone-modifying therapy to reduce skeletal morbidity in patients with bone metastases should be considered.[] Results of randomized trials of pamidronate and clodronate in patients with bony metastatic disease show decreased skeletal morbidity.[-][] Zoledronate has been at least as effective as pamidronate.[] The optimal dosing schedule for zoledronate was studied in [Alliance; NCT00869206], which randomly assigned 1,822 patients, 855 of whom had metastatic breast cancer, to receive zoledronic acid every 4 weeks or every 12 weeks.[] Skeletal-related events were similar in both groups, with 260 patients (29.5%) in the zoledronate every-4-week dosing group and 253 patients (28.6%) in the zoledronate every-12-week dosing group experiencing at least one skeletal-related event (risk difference of -0.3% [1-sided 95% CI, -4% to infinity]; < .001 for noninferiority).[][] This study suggests that the longer dosing interval of zoledronate every 12 weeks is a reasonable treatment option. The monoclonal antibody denosumab inhibits the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa beta ligand (RANKL). A meta-analysis of three phase III trials (, , and ) comparing zoledronate versus denosumab for management of bone metastases suggests that denosumab is similar to zoledronate in reducing the risk of a first skeletal-related event.[] (Refer to the PDQ summary on for more information on bisphosphonates.) Bevacizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against all isoforms of vascular endothelial growth factor–A. Its role in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer remains controversial. Evidence (bevacizumab for metastatic breast cancer): The efficacy and safety of bevacizumab as a second- and third-line treatment for patients with metastatic breast cancer were studied in a single, open-label, randomized trial.[] The study enrolled 462 patients who had received previous anthracycline and taxane therapy and were randomly assigned to receive capecitabine with or without bevacizumab.[][] The study failed to demonstrate a statistically significant effect on PFS (4.9 months with combination therapy vs. 4.2 months with capecitabine alone; HR, 0.98) or OS (15.1 months vs. 14.5 months).[][] (NCT00028990), an open-label, randomized, phase III trial, compared paclitaxel alone with paclitaxel and bevacizumab.[][] The trial demonstrated that the addition of bevacizumab to paclitaxel significantly prolonged median PFS compared with paclitaxel alone as the initial treatment for patients with metastatic breast cancer (11.8 months vs. 5.9 months; HR, 0.60; < .001).[][] The addition of bevacizumab did not improve OS (26.7 months vs. 25.2 months; = .16). Notably, patients treated on the bevacizumab-containing arm had significantly higher rates of severe hypertension, proteinuria, cerebrovascular ischemia, and infection. The (NCT00333775) trial randomly assigned 736 patients to receive docetaxel plus either placebo or bevacizumab at 7.5 mg/kg or 15 mg/kg every 3 weeks as the initial treatment for patients with metastatic breast cancer.[][] The combination of docetaxel plus bevacizumab at 15 mg/kg, but not 7.5 mg/kg, modestly improved median PFS compared with placebo (10.1 months vs. 8.1 months) but did not improve OS (30.2 months vs. 31.9 months; = .85).[][] More toxicity was seen in patients in the bevacizumab-containing arms, with significantly higher rates of bleeding and hypertension compared with patients in the placebo arms. The (NCT00262067) trial randomly assigned 1,237 patients in a 2:1 fashion to receive either standard chemotherapy plus bevacizumab or standard chemotherapy plus placebo.[][] Median PFS was longer for each bevacizumab-containing combination (capecitabine cohort: increased from 5.7 months to 8.6 months; HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.56–0.84; log-rank, < .001; and taxane-anthracycline cohort: increased from 8.0 months to 9.2 months; HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.52–0.80; log-rank, < .001).[][] No statistically significant differences in OS between the placebo- and bevacizumab-containing arms were observed. Toxicities associated with bevacizumab were similar to those seen in previous bevacizumab clinical trials. The (NCT00281697) trial studied the efficacy of bevacizumab as a second-line treatment for metastatic breast cancer. This trial randomly assigned 684 patients in a 2:1 fashion to receive either standard chemotherapy plus bevacizumab or standard chemotherapy plus placebo.[][] Median PFS increased from 5.1 to 7.2 months for the bevacizumab-containing treatment arm (stratified HR for PFS, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.64–0.93; = .0072). However, no statistically significant difference in OS was seen (16.4 months for chemotherapy plus placebo vs. 18.0 months for chemotherapy plus bevacizumab, = .3741).[][] Toxicities associated with bevacizumab were similar to those seen in previous clinical trials. In November 2011, because of the consistent finding that bevacizumab improved PFS only modestly but did not improve OS, and given bevacizumab’s considerable toxicity profile, the FDA revoked approval of bevacizumab for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer.

Some reports include DCIS in breast cancer statistics. In 2020, DCIS is expected to account for about 18% of all newly diagnosed invasive plus noninvasive breast tumors in the United States.[] For invasive and noninvasive tumors detected by screening, DCIS accounts for approximately 25% of all cases. The frequency of a DCIS diagnosis has increased markedly in the United States since the use of screening mammography became widespread. Very few cases of DCIS present as a palpable mass, with more than 90% being diagnosed by mammography alone.[] DCIS comprises a heterogeneous group of histopathologic lesions that have been classified into the following subtypes primarily because of architectural pattern: Comedo-type DCIS consists of cells that appear cytologically malignant, with the presence of high-grade nuclei, pleomorphism, and abundant central luminal necrosis. Comedo-type DCIS appears to be more aggressive, with a higher probability of associated invasive ductal carcinoma.[] Breast-conserving surgery or mastectomy plus radiation therapy with or without tamoxifen. In the past, the customary treatment for DCIS was mastectomy.[] The rationale for mastectomy included a 30% incidence of multicentric disease, a 40% prevalence of residual tumor at mastectomy after wide excision alone, and a 25% to 50% incidence of in-breast recurrence after limited surgery for palpable tumor, with 50% of those recurrences being invasive carcinoma.[,] The combined local and distant recurrence rate after mastectomy is 1% to 2%. No randomized comparisons of mastectomy versus breast-conserving surgery plus breast radiation therapy are available. Because breast-conserving surgery combined with breast radiation therapy is successful for invasive carcinoma, this conservative approach was extended to DCIS. To determine whether breast-conserving surgery plus radiation therapy was a reasonable approach to the management of DCIS, the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) and the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) have each completed prospective randomized trials in which women with localized DCIS and negative surgical margins after excisional biopsy were randomly assigned to receive either breast radiation therapy (50 Gy) or no further therapy.[-] Evidence (breast-conserving surgery plus radiation therapy to the breast): Of the 818 women enrolled in the NSABP-B-17 trial, 80% were diagnosed by mammography, and 70% of the patients' lesions were 1 cm or smaller. Results were reported at the 12-year actuarial follow-up interval.[]; [][] The overall rate of in-breast tumor recurrence was reduced from 31.7% to 15.7% when radiation therapy was delivered ( < .005). Radiation therapy reduced the occurrence of invasive cancer from 16.8% to 7.7% ( = .001) and recurrent DCIS from 14.6% to 8.0% ( = .001). Nine pathologic features were evaluated for their ability to predict for in-breast recurrence, but only comedo necrosis was determined to be a significant predictor for recurrence. Similarly, of the 1,010 patients enrolled in the EORTC-10853 trial, mammography detected lesions in 71% of the women. Results were reported at a median follow-up of 10.5 years.[][] The overall rate of in-breast tumor recurrence was reduced from 26% to 15% ( < .001), with a similarly effective reduction of invasive recurrence rates (13% to 8%, = .065) and noninvasive recurrence rates (14% to 7%, = .001). In this analysis, parameters associated with an increased risk of in-breast recurrence included age 40 years or younger, palpable disease, intermediate or poorly differentiated DCIS, cribriform or solid growth pattern, and indeterminate margins. Elsewhere, margins of less than 1 mm have been associated with an unacceptable local recurrence rate, even with radiation therapy.[] In both studies, the effect of radiation therapy was consistent across all assessed risk factors. The benefit of administering radiation therapy has been confirmed in a systematic review of four randomized trials (hazard ratio [HR], 0.49; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.41–0.58; < .00001). In this study, the number needed to treat with radiation therapy was nine women to prevent one ipsilateral breast recurrence.[] A large national clinical trial by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group ( [NCT00003857]) comparing breast-conserving surgery and tamoxifen with or without radiation therapy was closed because of poor accrual (636 of planned 1,790 patients accrued). Patients with good-risk DCIS (defined as mammographically detected low- or intermediate-grade DCIS, measuring less than 2.5 cm with margins of 3 mm or more) were enrolled.[] With a median follow-up of 7 years, the ipsilateral local failure rate was low with observation (6.7%; 95% CI, 3.2%–9.6%) but was decreased significantly with the addition of radiation therapy (0.9%; 95% CI, 0.0%–2.2%).[] The results of the NSABP-B-17 and EORTC-10853 trials plus two others were included in a meta-analysis that demonstrated reductions in all ipsilateral breast events (HR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.41–0.58; < .00001), ipsilateral invasive recurrence (HR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.32–0.76; = .001), and ipsilateral DCIS recurrence (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.39–0.95; = .03).[][] After 10 years of follow-up, there was, however, no significant effect on breast cancer mortality, mortality from causes other than breast cancer, or all-cause mortality.[] To identify a favorable group of patients for whom postoperative radiation therapy could be omitted, several pathologic staging systems have been developed and tested retrospectively, but consensus recommendations have not been achieved.[-] The Van Nuys Prognostic Index is one pathologic staging system that combines three predictors of local recurrence (i.e., tumor size, margin width, and pathologic classification). It was used to retrospectively analyze 333 patients treated with either excision alone or excision and radiation therapy.[] Using this prognostic index, patients with favorable lesions who received surgical excision alone had a low recurrence rate (i.e., 2%, with a median follow-up of 79 months). A subsequent analysis of these data was performed to determine the influence of margin width on local control.[] Patients whose excised lesions had margin widths of 10 mm or more in every direction had an extremely low probability of local recurrence with surgery alone (4%, with a mean follow-up of 8 years). Both reviews are retrospective, noncontrolled, and subject to substantial selection bias. In contrast, the prospective NSABP trial did not identify any subset of patients who did not benefit from the addition of radiation therapy to breast-conserving surgery in the management of DCIS.[,,,] To determine whether tamoxifen adds to the efficacy of local therapy in the management of DCIS, the NSABP performed a double-blind prospective trial (NSABP-B-24). In NSABP-B-24, 1,804 women were randomly assigned to receive breast-conserving surgery, radiation therapy (50 Gy), and placebo or breast-conserving surgery, radiation therapy, and tamoxifen (20 mg qd for 5 years).[] Positive or unknown surgical margins were present in 23% of patients. Approximately 80% of the lesions measured 1 cm or smaller, and more than 80% were detected mammographically. Breast cancer events were defined as the presence of new ipsilateral disease, contralateral disease, or metastases. Women in the tamoxifen group had fewer breast cancer events at 5 years than did those treated with a placebo (8.2% vs. 13.4%; = .009).[][] With tamoxifen, ipsilateral invasive breast cancer decreased from 4.2% to 2.1% at 5 years ( = .03). Tamoxifen also decreased the incidence of contralateral breast neoplasms (invasive and noninvasive) from 0.8% per year to 0.4% per year ( = .01). The benefit of tamoxifen extended to patients with positive or uncertain margins.[] (Refer to the PDQ summary on for more information.) No survival advantage was demonstrated for the use of tamoxifen. In NSABP-B-24, 1,804 women were randomly assigned to receive breast-conserving surgery, radiation therapy (50 Gy), and placebo or breast-conserving surgery, radiation therapy, and tamoxifen (20 mg qd for 5 y).[] Positive or unknown surgical margins were present in 23% of patients. Approximately 80% of the lesions measured 1 cm or smaller, and more than 80% were detected mammographically. Breast cancer events were defined as the presence of new ipsilateral disease, contralateral disease, or metastases. No survival advantage was demonstrated for the use of tamoxifen. In the NSABP-B35 double-blind study, 3,104 postmenopausal women with DCIS who were treated with breast-conserving surgery were randomly assigned to receive either adjuvant tamoxifen or anastrozole, in addition to adjuvant radiation therapy. The use of anastrozole was associated with significantly fewer breast cancer events (HR, 0.73; = .023) but no improvement in survival.[][] The Second International Breast Cancer Intervention Study ( [NCT00078832]) trial enrolled 2,980 postmenopausal women in a double-blind comparison of tamoxifen with anastrozole as adjuvant therapy. All of the women had breast conserving surgery, and 71% of them had radiation therapy.[] No difference in the rate of breast cancer recurrence in favor of anastrozole was found (HR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.64–1.23; = .49), and there was no difference in survival. The decision to prescribe endocrine therapy after a diagnosis of DCIS often involves a discussion with the patient about the potential benefits and side effects of each agent.

This section describes the latest changes made to this summary as of the date above. Added to state that administering a radiation boost may, however, be associated with unfavorable quality-of-life outcomes (cited King et al. as reference 48). Added as a new subsection. Added to state that the SOLD (NCT00593697) trial compared 9 weeks of trastuzumab with 1 year of trastuzumab in 2,174 women with HER-2 positive breast cancer; noninferiority of the 9-week treatment could not be demonstrated for disease-free survival (DFS) (cited Joensuu et al. as reference 127). Added to state that the D-CARE (NCT01077154) trial randomly assigned 4,509 women with stage II or stage III breast cancer to receive denosumab or placebo; the primary endpoint of bone metastasis-free survival was not significantly different between the groups (cited Coleman et al. as reference 183 and level of evidence 1iDii). Added to state that in the ETNA (NCT01822314) trial that compared neoadjuvant nab-paclitaxel with paclitaxel followed by anthracycline-based therapy, no significant difference in pathologic complete response (pCR) was observed, and neutropenia and peripheral neuropathy were more frequent in the nab-paclitaxel arm (cited Gianni et al. as reference 202). Added that differences in taxane dose and schedule may explain the different findings in the GeparSepto and ETNA trials. Added about the GeparSixto (NCT01426880) trial to state that 3-year DFS was higher for patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) randomly assigned to the carboplatin arm, but overall survival (OS) did not differ (cited Loibl et al. as reference 205). Added to state that a 2018 meta-analysis of nine phase II or III randomized trials that evaluated the addition of carboplatin to various chemotherapy backbones for neoadjuvant treatment of TNBC confirmed higher pCR, but at the expense of greater hematologic toxicity (cited Poggio et al. as reference 207); added that two of the nine trials reported survival outcomes and no difference in event-free survival (EFS) or OS was observed with the use of neoadjuvant carboplatin. Added to state that the randomized, double blind, phase III KEYNOTE-522 (NCT03036488) trial evaluated the addition of immunotherapy to neoadjuvant chemotherapy for patients with stage II or stage III TNBC. Participants were randomly assigned 2:1 to receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy with either neoadjuvant and adjuvant pembrolizumab or neoadjuvant and adjuvant placebo. Co-primary endpoints were pCR rate and EFS. pCR rate, as reported at the time of the first interim analysis for the first 602 participants, favored the pembrolizumab arm (cited Schmid et al. as reference 210). Added that longer term follow-up with regard to EFS and toxicity will inform the use of pembrolizumab in the neoadjuvant treatment of TNBC. Key issues that remain to be clarified include identification of a predictive biomarker, the optimal chemotherapy backbone, and the role of adjuvant pembrolizumab after neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus pembrolizumab. Revised about the phase III Z1041 (NCT00513292] trial to add that DFS and OS were secondary outcomes. After median follow-up of 5.1 years, there was no difference in DFS or OS between the sequential and concurrent arms (cited Buzdar et al. as reference 216). Added to state that this benefit was observed across multiple clinicopathological subgroups of breast cancer (cited Gao et al. as reference 9). Added to state that 8-year landmark OS rates were 37% with the addition of pertuzumab, compared with 23% in the placebo group (cited Swain et al. as reference 52). Revised to state that the FDA granted accelerated approval to sacituzumab govitecan for patients with metastatic TNBC after at least two previous lines of therapy. A confirmatory randomized trial is still under way. This summary is written and maintained by the , which is editorially independent of NCI.

Lumpectomy Surgery Preparation Instructions, and Recovery Time Medical Author: Medical Editor: What Happens During Lumpectomy Surgery, How Long Does It Take? What Is the Time After Lumpectomy Surgery? When Can You Return to Work After Lumpectomy Surgery? What Is the Treatment If the Results From a Lumpectomy Is Cancer? What Are the Complications and Risks Associated With Lumpectomy Surgery? How Successful Is Lumpectomy Surgery, and What Is the Breast Cancer Recurrence Rate? Lumpectomy is a surgical procedure that involves removing a suspected (cancerous) or other abnormal tissue and a small portion of the surrounding tissue. This tissue is then tested to determine if it contains cancerous cells. A number of may also be removed to test them for cancerous cells ( or axillary dissection). If cancerous cells are discovered in the tissue sample or nodes, additional surgery or treatment may be necessary. Women who undergo a lumpectomy normally receive therapy (RT) for about six weeks following the procedure to kill any cells that may have been missed with the removal of the tumor. Lumpectomy is also referred to as excision biopsy is when a fibradenoma of the breast is removed. Lumpectomy is used to treat both invasive cancers of the breast (invasive ductal or invasive lobular carcinoma) as well as ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). A few decades ago, the standard surgery was radical , which involves the complete removal of the breast, muscles from the chest wall and all the lymph nodes in the armpit. Breast-conserving surgery has replaced radical mastectomy as the preferred surgical treatment because lumpectomy is designed to leave the natural appearance and cosmetic quality of the breast mostly intact while removing the malignancy and a small margin of normal breast tissue. In addition, studies have shown that lumpectomy with radiation treatment is as effective as mastectomy in treating . The determine how much of the breast is removed during a lumpectomy. A quadrantectomy, for example, involves removing a quarter of the breast. Before surgery, a woman should discuss with her doctor how much of the breast will be involved so that she can know what to expect. The in relation to the size of the breast is the main factor that a woman's doctor considers to determine if a lumpectomy is an appropriate treatment. Additionally, some of the features of the (if it is confined to one area of the breast and does not involve the skin or chest wall) help the doctor determine if lumpectomy is appropriate. Most women who are diagnosed with , especially those who are diagnosed early, are considered good candidates for lumpectomy. However, under some circumstances, lumpectomy is not a recommended surgery for some women. These factors include the following: Multiple cancers in separate locations of the same breast: This means that the potentially malignant tissue cannot all be removed from a single location, meaning that the breast may become drastically disfigured as a result of lumpectomy. : Women who have had a lumpectomy with radiation therapy to remove cancer cannot have more radiation; therefore, they usually need a mastectomy if they experience cancer again in the same breast. : Since a lumpectomy removes a specific area with malignancy, this cancer treatment option would be inappropriate if the cancer has spread to other locations. : A tumor that is rapidly growing or has attached itself to a nearby structure, such as the chest wall or skin, may require surgery that is more extensive to remove the tumor. Radiation therapy, which usually follows the lumpectomy, can damage the woman's fetus. : Lumpectomy to remove a tumor that is larger than 5 cm in diameter may drastically disfigure the breast. However, in some cases, the size of the tumor may be able to be reduced with , or endocrine therapy, to a size that is more manageable with lumpectomy. Small breasts, especially those that contain large lumps, may also be drastically disfigured after lumpectomy. Preexisting conditions that make radiation treatment more risky than usual: Radiation treatment may scar or damage connective tissue in women with collagen vascular diseases, such as or erythematosus. , for instance, to treat Hodgkin's disease. some women may prefer the idea of a mastectomy to lumpectomy in order to feel more confident that they will not develop breast cancer again. Other women may not feel comfortable with radiation therapy or be able to to a series of radiation treatments, which may involve an unacceptable time commitment or extensive travel. In most situations, though, women can safely choose between lumpectomy and mastectomy. Sentinel node biopsy is a procedure in which the surgeon removes one to five (or more, in some cases) sentinel lymph nodes from the underarm area (axilla). The sentinel lymph node is the first location that cancer cells are likely to spread. If cancer cells are not found in the sentinel node, the other lymph nodes are likely to be cancer free as well. Sentinel node biopsy is a popular alternative to axillary lymph node sampling or axillary lymph node dissection, which involve removing more lymph nodes than sentinel node biopsy. In some cases, removing more than a few lymph nodes in a lymph node dissection can lead to complications in the arm such as fluid buildup () or decreased sensation. Sentinel node biopsy allows for limited damage to the nerves and lymphatic system. Axillary lymph node surgical procedure involves removal of the lymph nodes en bloc, which are then tested for cancer cells. Because so many nodes are removed, a drain is placed to prevent lymph fluid from collecting. Axillary lymph node dissection is associated with several complications and side effects, which include However, most doctors believe that if you have cancer in some lymph nodes (for instance the sentinel nodes) that it helps determine further treatment to know how many more nodes are cancerous. Axillary node dissections are usually done now only in the situation where one or more lymph nodes contain cancer as shown during a lymph node biopsy. Breast Cancer Awareness: Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment What Procedures and Tests Are Needed Before Lumpectomy Surgery? Prior to lumpectomy, the doctor usually examines the patient and performs a , which is an X-ray film of the breast's soft tissue. The doctor usually performs a fine-needle biopsy of the breast and takes blood and urine samples for testing. If the breat tumor is not palpable (cannot be located by touch), the doctor performs a wire-localization procedure, which involves a fine wire, or similar tool, along with an X-ray film or to confirm the tumor's location. A breast scan may also be performed, prior to lumpectomy, to determine whether there is another disease in the same or opposite breast, that may prevent a lumpectomy from being performed. The preparations for a lumpectomy are routine for a typical surgery. The doctor may ask the woman about any medications or she may be taking. The doctor usually advises the woman not to eat or to drink anything for at least 8-12 hours before the surgery. The doctor usually discusses what to expect during and after surgery, which may include what Immediately before the procedure, the woman receives either (1) a local anesthetic (medication that numbs only the breast and nearby tissues) and sedation or (2) general anesthesia (medication that induces unconsciousness). Which type of anesthesia the woman receives usually depends on how extensive the doctor expects the surgery to be. Women receive general anesthesia, a medication will be given to you through an IV  line that induces unconciousness (you will be sleeping), and to provide fluids and medication. A tube is placed in the throat that supplies oxygen and gasses for sedation. What Happens During Lumpectomy Surgery, How Long Does It Take? First, the doctor cleans the involved breast, chest, and upper arm. The surgeon then makes an incision over the targeted malignancy or around the if the tumor is accessible from that site, and cuts out the tumor, along with a small layer of tissue surrounding the tumor. The goal of the surgery is to remove the tumor and marginal tissue while damaging the breast as little as possible. However, the surgeon needs to remove enough testable tissue to determine if the cancer is limited to the tumor itself or if the cancer has spread. The surgeon may make a separate incision near the underarm to sample or to remove axillary lymph nodes, which are then tested for cancerous cells. The findings of these tests help the doctor determine if the cancer has spread from the breast to other parts of the body. The following are types of surgery that may be used to sample or remove axillary lymph nodes: : This procedure involves surgically removing one to five (or more, in some cases) sentinel lymph nodes from the underarm area (axilla). The sentinel lymph node is the first location that cancer cells are likely to spread. If cancer cells are not found in the sentinel node, the other lymph nodes are likely to be cancer free as well. This is a popular alternative to axillary lymph node sampling or axillary lymph node dissection, which involve removing more lymph nodes than sentinel node biopsy. In some cases, removing more than a few lymph nodes in a lymph node dissection can lead to complications in the arm such as fluid buildup (lymphedema) or decreased sensation. Sentinel node biopsy allows for limited damage to the nerves and lymphatic system. : This surgical procedure involves removal of the lymph nodes en bloc, which are then tested for cancer cells. Because so many nodes are removed, a drain is placed to prevent lymph fluid from collecting. The drain is usually removed in 5-10 days. Axillary lymph node dissection is associated with several complications and side effects, which include long-term pain, limited shoulder motion, lymphedema, numbness, and an increased risk of infection. However, most doctors believe that if you have cancer in some lymph nodes (for instance the sentinel nodes) that it helps determine further treatment to know how many more nodes are cancerous. Axillary node dissections are usually done now only in the situation where one or more lymph nodes contain cancer as shown during a lymph node biopsy. The surgeon then stops the and irrigates the . A drainage tube may be inserted during the surgery and removed later. The wound is usually closed with that will eventually dissolve. Bandages are applied to the site of the surgery. The entire procedure typically takes one to two hours. What Is the Time After Lumpectomy Surgery? After a lumpectomy, you are moved to a surgery recovery room for a short time until you wake up and are stable. Most women go home with home-care instructions the same day, but a few women have to stay in the hospital for one to two days (especially after axillary node dissection). Preventing infections will usually be emphasised your doctor's home care instructions. Postsurgical factors after lumpectomy surgery depend on the size and location of the tumor removed, the general health of the woman, and the preferences of the patient and her doctor. Pain relief can be treated by placing a bag of ice on top of the bandages over the incision for the first 24 hours. If a quarter or more of your breast was removed, you should expect a slower healing process. Most women can expect to resume their normal activities after one to two days. Women who undergo a sentinel lymph node biopsy or axillary dissection at the same time as lumpectomy can expect to return to normal activities by about two weeks after surgery. In the meantime, they usually take prescribed medications that help control  pain. Major soreness and pain from lumpectomy procedure typically stops after two to three days. If pain and soreness increases after lumpectomy surgery, call your surgeon to check for infections or other complications, which are not common following a lumpectomy. The doctor usually discourages the woman from attempting to lift anything over five pounds for the first several days following surgery. Other physical activities may also be discouraged. The doctor usually recommends that she continuously wear a bra that fits well for about a full week after surgery. Some women may have drainage tubes inserted into the armpit that collect blood and other fluid during the initial healing process. You may have to empty the drains and measure the fluid. She should report any problems to her doctor. Rarely, the cancerous cells are found during lumpectomy surgery are present at the edge of the removed (margin). This is referred to as a positive margin and may indicate that the tumor was not completely removed. In this case, re-excision of the breast to remove a wider rim of breast tissue around the cancer is typically performed. If you notice any of these symptoms and signs after lumpectomy surgery, call your your doctor right away. Signs of infection or fluid buildup in the underarm When Can You Return to Work After Lumpectomy Surgery? The healing and recovery process after lumpectomy surgery is quicker when when you return to work and are back to your normal routine. Make sure that you are physically and emotionally read to go back to work.  Ask yourself or your doctor these questions before you go back to work and other usual acivities. Am I emotionally ready to go back to work and get back to your normal schedule? Am I physically ready to go back to work and get back to your normal schedule? What are the risks or complications if you go back to work and your normal schedule too soon? How much will your medical insurance cover after you have paid the deductable?  However, if you return to work and your normal routine too soon, it may add to more time to your healing and recovery time. After a , you're likely to feel well enough to return to work after two or three days. You can usually resume normal physical activities, like going to the gym, after one week. What Is the Treatment If the Results From a Lumpectomy Is Cancer? : The woman and her doctor schedule a follow-up visit, which is usually 10-14 days following surgery. This is intended to check the progress of the healing process. In addition, the woman and her doctor usually discuss the results of the pathology report and any additional treatments or therapies that may be necessary. : This is used as an attempt to kill any cancer cells that may have been missed during the lumpectomy and has cancer. Radiation therapy is a standard follow-up treatment for any woman who has had a lumpectomy. The woman is typically scheduled to receive radiation therapy for about six weeks beginning as soon as possible after the lumpectomy, usually after the breast has been given some time to heal (about a month). Radiation therapy is given daily, with each session usually lasting a half hour or less, and does not cause any pain. Some women with small tumors may be candidates for local breast irradiation that is given twice a day for five days. The radiation therapy doctor can discuss the options with you. : After a lumpectomy, the woman and her doctor wait for test results involving the tissue samples taken during the surgery. Results of the test usually take a few days. If no cancer cells are found in the surrounding rim of tissue around the cancer, this means that the woman has clear margins around the tumor. If cancer cells are found in this tissue, this is called positive margins, and a follow-up surgery or other treatment must be performed to attempt further removal of the cancer. : Chemotherapy may be given to the woman, especially if tests reveal that the cancer has spread to her lymph nodes. The doctor may also prescribe (Nolvadex) or recommend other hormone therapy if the cancer cells express hormone receptors (estrogen or receptors). Anti-HER2 therapy is given if the cancer cells overexpress the HER-2 protein, a protein involved in cell growth. Endocrine therapy may be prescribed either after, or instead of chemotherapy, depending upon the characteristics of the breast cancer. Clinical trials may be an option for some women. Clinical trials are designed to test new drugs or new dosages or combinations of existing drugs as well as other aspects of . What Are the Complications and Risks Associated With Lumpectomy Surgery? The risks involved with lumpectomy are typical of any surgical procedure, which include , bleeding, and damage to nearby tissues. is associated with some risks, however; they are rare. Rarely, a few women who are generally healthy experience  from general anesthesia. Additional medical and associated with lumpectomy. Depending on how much of the breast was removed during the lumpectomy, the may change. The breast may have a visible or dimpling and may become in relation to the other breast. Some women may experience some , which may cause a loss of sensation in the breast. Some women who receive a sentinel node biopsy or axillary lymph node dissection may or range of motion in the shoulder. Other sensations may also be affected. Two to ten percent of women who undergo axillary lymph node dissection may develop , which is the buildup of fluid in the area of the lymph nodes. Lymphadema can develop immediately or even years after the procedure. If women have had an axillary lymph node dissection, they should avoid anything tight around the arm (like a tourniquet used to draw blood, a cuff, or a tight band on a sleeve) on that side for the rest of their life. may develop, which means the arm vein becomes inflamed. may occur. This is inflammation of the skin of the arm. Skin reactions of the treated area, including redness or How Successful Is Lumpectomy Surgery, and What Is the Breast Cancer Recurrence Rate? The recurrence rate of breast cancer in women who receive a lumpectomy with radiation therapy is low. The results of a lumpectomy largely depend on the location, size, and type of lump found. Women with (noncancerous) lumps usually experience few complications. The outcome associated with a malignant (cancerous) lump may depend on if the cancer has spread, how quickly it is spreading, and what parts of the body are now affected. For cancer that is difficult to control and contain, the doctor may discuss complete mastectomy with as a surgical option. Surgery is the most common type of treatment for breast cancer. Different surgical treatments are available for early stage breast cancers. Mastectomy is the removal of the entire breast. Breast-conserving surgery, such as , can also be appropriate for some women. If a breast conserving surgery is combined with post operative radiation therapy, it is as effective at curing breast cancer as a mastectomy. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (removing the first lymph node that drains the affected area) should be performed in invasive breast cancer cases staged I to III to assess whether the cancer has begun to spread to nearby lymph nodes. If the lymph nodes contain cancer, an axillary dissection may sometimes be done to remove and examine other nearby lymph nodes. American Cancer Society. ""Breast Conserving Surgery.""

Some of these infections are more familiar—you’ve probably heard of chlamydia, gonorrhea, genital herpes, and HIV. But many more are less talked about. You can protect yourself and your loved ones from future health problems by understanding these common STDs. In this article we answer some of your tricky and sometimes uncomfortable questions about STD symptoms and diseases. You will learn why herpes is sometimes considered a sexually transmitted disease, what sexual disease is nicknamed “the clap,” and which kinds can lie dormant for a long time. You will also find information on the best treatments for herpes, HIV, chlamydia and various other sexually-transmitted diseases. Some experts prefer the term “STI” (sexually transmitted infection). STIs include all infections that can be transmitted sexually. It's not necessary to have sexual intercourse for a sexually-transmitted disease (STD) to harm your health. The human papillomavirus (HPV), the disease that causes genital warts, can be transmitted by close skin-to-skin contact. Some types of HPV cause cervical or anal cancer, and vaccines are available to protect against the most dangerous types. Other HPV types cause genital warts, which can be raised, flat, or cauliflower-shaped. HPV can be transmitted even by people who have no visible warts or other symptoms. Genital warts can be big or small, flat or raised. They generally appear as a small bump or group of bumps in the genital region, and may be shaped like a cauliflower. A vaccine to prevent HPV is given in three shots. The second shot is given a month or two after the first shot. The third shot comes six months after the first shot. The Centers for Disease Control recommends boys and girls be vaccinated at ages 11 or 12. If they did not get the HPV vaccine as children, women can get the HPV vaccine through age 26. Men can get it through age 21. The CDC recommends HPV vaccination for men through age 26 for men who have sex with men or men with compromised immune systems, including HIV. Pubic lice are colloquially known as ""crabs."" This name refers to the shape of these parasites, which is different from that of body lice. Pubic lice live in pubic hair and are spread among people during close contact. Pubic lice can be treated with over-the-counter lice-killing medications. Visible crawling lice or eggs attached to pubic hair Like pubic lice, scabies is another parasitic STI. This parasite is not necessarily sexually transmitted, since it can affect any area of the skin. However, scabies is often spread during sexual contact. The skin appears to have a pimple-like rash, as shown in the above photo. Both the itching and rash may be across the body or limited to the wrist, elbow, armpit, webbing between fingers, nipple, penis, waist, belt-line or buttocks. Tiny burrows left by the tunneling of female scabies mites may be visible on the skin. They appear as tiny raised and crooked grayish-white or skin-colored lines. The only way to prevent this STI is to avoid touching people, as any skin-to-skin contact can spread this highly contagious mite. Condoms, while good at preventing many diseases, will not prevent scabies. Fortunately, this STI is treatable. Prescription creams can cure a scabies infestation. Protect your health by visiting a doctor if you believe you may have this STI. Gonorrhea is an easily transmitted disease that affects both men and women. It can harm your health by causing infertility in men and women if it is left untreated. There may be no early symptoms of this common STD. Men may experience swelling of the testes and discharge from the penis In some cases, the symptoms are mild and the condition is mistaken for a UTI or yeast infection. Visit your health care provider if this sounds like you. Syphilis can be cured with antibiotics, but many people don't notice its early STD symptoms. It can play havoc with your health, leading to nerve damage, blindness, paralysis, and even death over time if not treated. A round, firm, painless sore on the genitals or anal area (often the first sign) A rash can develop later on the soles of the feet, palms, or other parts of the body Late-stage syphilis can cause damage to many different organ systems. That's why early detection is so critical to your health. Chlamydia is a very common STD. It can cause infertility if not treated. The symptoms may not be noticed, or they may be vague and nonspecific. Some people experience no health effects at all. Chlamydia infections can also develop in the rectum and throat. Cold sores or ""fever blisters"" on the lips are a sign of herpes virus infection, usually caused by the type of herpes virus known as human herpes virus 1, also known as oral herpes. Oral herpes is usually not considered a sexually transmitted disease. It can be transmitted through kissing or household contact. However, it can also spread to the genitals. (While this type of herpes can be contracted on the genitals, it is different from the disease known as genital herpes). There is no cure for herpes infection, but medications can reduce the severity and duration of outbreaks. A rash may form on your gums, lips, mouth or throat Symptoms of oral herpes usually appear 1-3 weeks after first infection. When symptoms return, they are typically milder than the initial herpes outbreak. In contrast to oral herpes, genital herpes infections are caused by a different virus known as HSV-2 HHV-2. The genital herpes virus spreads through direct genital contact and is considered an STD. More than 87% of those infected with genital herpes are unaware of their infection due to very mild or nonexistent symptoms. Painful, fluid-filled blisters and crusted sores on the genital area, buttocks, thighs, or anus. Mild tingling or shooting pain in the legs, hips, or buttocks may occur hours to days before a genital herpes outbreak. After the first infection, less severe outbreaks are common in the first year. Outbreaks tend to decrease over time, though the infection may stay in the body indefinitely. A genital herpes infection can spread to the lips through oral contact. As with oral herpes, medications can reduce the severity of genital herpes, but there is no cure. Hepatitis B is a virus that spreads through contact with body fluids and blood, so it can be transmitted through sexual intercourse. Hepatitis B infection is also possible through sharing of needles, razors, and toothbrushes. Babies can become infected at birth from an infected mother. It's possible to go for years without symptoms of this STI. Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes) Over time, scarring of the liver (cirrhosis) and liver cancer can develop. Although there is no cure, there is a vaccine to prevent hepatitis B infection. The HIV virus (AIDS virus) weakens the body's immune system. It is spread through sexual contact, needle sharing, or from an infected mother to baby. There may be no symptoms for years, but a blood test can tell if you have been infected. With appropriate treatment, many serious illnesses can be prevented. Flu-like symptoms 1 to 2 months after first infection, including like swollen lymph nodes, fever, and headaches Muscle Aches Prolonged swelling of the lymph glands in the armpits, groin, or neck Red, brown, pink, or purplish blotches on or under the skin or inside the mouth, nose, or eyelids Memory loss, depression, and other neurologic disorders There are accurate tests to identify whether or not you have been infected with the HIV virus. These can be done in the clinic or at home with the FDA-approved Home Access test kit. The test can be performed anonymously, with only a number to identify you. However, sometimes people may not test positive in the initial 3-4 weeks to 6 months after infection. This time period is referred to as the ""window period"" in which antibodies may not have developed enough for a positive test. You can still transmit the virus to others during this time. While there is no cure for HIV, there are medications that can suppress the amount of virus multiplying inside the body. People take a combination of antiviral drugs in hopes of preventing the infection from advancing to AIDS. Additional treatments can help prevent or fight off serious infections, if the immune system has weakened. Trichomoniasis is a parasitic infection (caused by ) that is spread during sexual contact. It affects both men and women and can be cured with medications. Most affected men have no specific symptoms. Women: yellowish-green vaginal discharge with a prominent odor, itching of the vaginal area, or painful sex or urination Symptoms can develop anywhere from 5 to 28 days after contracting the infection. Chancroid is an STD that is rarely seen in the U.S. It is more common in Africa and Asia. It causes painful lumps in the genital area that can progress to open sores. Antibiotics can cure the infection; chancroid is caused by bacterial infection with . One or more sores or raised bumps on the genitals. A narrow, red border surrounds the sores. The sores become filled with pus and eventually rupture into a painful open sore. About half the time when untreated, the chancroid bacterial infection spreads to the groin's lymph glands, causing the groin to enlarge and become hard and painful. Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) is a type of chlamydial infection, but it is caused by a different type of chlamydia () than the usual chlamydial disease. Like other chlamydial infections, it can be cured by antibiotic treatment. Early Lymphogranuloma venereum Symptoms (3-12 Days After Exposure) Soft red, painless sores on or near the genitals or anus Similar sores in the throat or mouth following oral sex Later Lymphogranuloma venereum Symptoms (2-6 Weeks After Exposure) Anal sores and rectal discharge or bleeding if the infection was acquired through anal sex Fever, chills, joint pain, decreased appetite and fatigue Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is not a specific STD. Rather, it is a complication that can develop from various diseases, particularly gonorrhea and chlamydia. In PID, bacteria spread to the uterus and female reproductive tract. Infertility may result if the condition is not treated right away. It's estimated that half of sexually active young adults acquire at least one of these STIs by age 25. In fact, sexual diseases are the most commonly reported type of infection in America. Though more common in teens and young adults, anyone who is sexually active is potentially at risk. The risk is raised by having multiple sex partners. The incidence of some sexually transmitted diseases, including LGV and syphilis, is increasing in men who have sex with men. Many of these diseases can spread through any type of sexual activity. This can include skin-to-skin contact and oral sex. This means that people who have not yet had sexual intercourse can still get infected. Abstinence from any sexual contact (or skin-to-skin contact) is the only absolute way to prevent STIs. Being in a long-term, monogamous relationship also is a good way to avoid them. There are also steps you can take to decrease the chance of getting an STD if you are sexually active, including: Avoiding sexual activity with a partner who shows STD symptoms. Being aware of symptoms and signs of these conditions. Condoms can prevent the spread of some STDs, but they aren't 100% effective. They are less effective at protecting against herpes, syphilis, and genital warts, since these STDs can be transmitted by contact with skin lesions that are not covered by a condom. Condoms also do not protect against crabs and scabies infestations. It may be difficult, but it is important to tell your partner as soon as possible if you believe you may be infected. Even if you are being treated, you may still be able to spread the infection. For some diseases, both partners should be treated at the same time. It can be difficult to share this information, so some people find that preparing a script in advance can be helpful. Here are some facts that can help the conversation go more smoothly: Discovering a sexually transmitted disease is not necessarily evidence of cheating. It may very well have come from either your past relationship or that of your partner. An estimated one in two sexually active people will contract such a condition by the time they reach age 25. Most of these don't know they have an infection. Many STD symptoms are subtle or don’t even show up when first contracted and may be discovered much later. It's normal to be nervous about this topic. But by being bold and taking action, you can actively promote better health for you and your partner. Some STDs can cause premature labor in pregnant women, and many STDs can be passed to the baby either during pregnancy or childbirth. So all pregnant women should be checked for STDs. STDs can cause numerous problems in babies, like low birth weight, stillbirth, nerve problems, blindness, serious infections, and liver problems. Treatment during pregnancy can reduce the risks of these complications and can cure many types of infections. In most cases, new exposures to STDs that you have already acquired in the past can cause you to get the infection again. Most treatments don't protect you from developing the STD at a future time. If your partner has not been treated, you may pass the infection back and forth. Without the right precautions, you could acquire a second STD or a recurrence of the same infection. In addition, genital herpes virus infections can be recurrent after a single exposure. 12 Preventable STDs: Pictures, Symptoms, Diagnosis, Treatment Science Source, Dr P.

Postmastectomy Radiotherapy After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy: A Review of the Evidence , Multiple randomized trials and their meta-analysis have demonstrated an overall survival benefit from postmastectomy radiotherapy in women with node-positive breast cancer. However, none of the patients treated in these trials received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, which is now an increasingly common approach. Multiple randomized trials and their meta-analysis have demonstrated an overall survival benefit from postmastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT) in women with node-positive breast cancer. However, none of the patients treated in these trials received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, which is now an increasingly common approach. It is unclear how best to apply data from trials conducted in patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy to this population. To illuminate these issues, this article first reviews the history of PMRT and the current indications for its use based on contemporary data. It focuses on the ways in which staging and outcomes differ for patients who undergo neoadjuvant chemotherapy before mastectomy (as compared with those who receive postoperative adjuvant therapy) and how pathologic features such as response to therapy are correlated with recurrence and survival outcomes. It highlights key information obtained from analysis of the pooled data from the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) prospective neoadjuvant chemotherapy trials B-18 and B-27 and separate retrospective single-institution studies; this includes the low risk of locoregional recurrence in early-stage patients in whom a pathologic complete response (pCR) was achieved after neoadjuvant chemotherapy without PMRT and the high risk of recurrence in patients with stage III disease, even in the setting of a pCR. It also discusses the ongoing NSABP B-51/Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 1304 and Alliance A011202 trials, which will provide information on whether PMRT can be omitted in patients who have a pathologic complete response (pCR) in the lymph nodes, and whether axillary lymph node dissection will improve recurrence rates compared with sentinel lymph node biopsy and radiotherapy in patients who do not achieve a pCR in the lymph nodes. Finally, it identifies directions for future research. Rationale For and Against Postmastectomy Radiotherapy Postmastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT) has been investigated in a number of trials over the past few decades as a strategy to improve outcomes in women with breast cancer. Subsets of women are at high risk for locoregional recurrence (LRR) after mastectomy, even with negative margins, adequate axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), and adjuvant systemic therapy. PMRT may improve breast cancer outcomes via a number of mechanisms. Prevention of LRR is the most direct potential benefit. Surgically resectable, isolated LRRs are often associated with significant morbidity and may ultimately be unsalvageable even with the addition of systemic therapy and radiotherapy, and nonresectable gross recurrences are unlikely to be eradicated with radiotherapy or systemic therapy.[1,2] PMRT may also prevent distant failure, albeit in a less direct fashion. Most women at high risk for LRR after mastectomy also have a significant risk of distant failure, which may arise from detectable LRRs after initial therapy; prevention of these recurrences could decrease subsequent distant failure. Some women may harbor occult residual microscopic locoregional disease that never manifests as a clinically detectable local recurrence yet can seed distant sites. These distant recurrences could potentially be prevented by delivering locoregional radiotherapy that eradicates those reservoirs of disease in the upfront setting. Although there is an established benefit of PMRT, no treatment is devoid of associated morbidity, burden, and expense, so interest remains in optimizing patient selection for PMRT. Expense and patient convenience are important factors to consider in this regard. Toxicity can develop, including late cardiac effects, even though modern treatment planning techniques help reduce this risk. Additionally, radiation therapy can lead to complications associated with breast reconstruction and can limit the options offered to patients. In this article, we focus on the particularly challenging situation of determining when to offer PMRT to patients treated with neoadjuvant systemic therapy. We begin by reviewing the evidence regarding the role of radiotherapy after mastectomy more generally, which has largely derived from studies of patients treated without systemic therapy or with postoperative systemic therapy alone. We then discuss emerging evidence that suggests how one might incorporate information about response to systemic therapy in patients treated preoperatively in order to optimize patient selection for therapy and perhaps even for delivery of radiotherapy in this setting. The evidence regarding the role of radiotherapy after mastectomy has largely derived from studies of patients treated without systemic therapy or with postoperative systemic therapy alone. Although benefits in locoregional control with PMRT were observed in early trials, the trials did not demonstrate overall survival (OS) benefits.[3,4] However, systemic therapy was not administered to most patients who received PMRT in these trials. When more effective systemic therapies arose, which decreased rates of distant failure, locoregional control reemerged as an important problem. Trials were subsequently initiated that investigated PMRT in the setting of systemic therapy. Although local and regional benefits were again observed, survival benefits appeared to be offset by increased toxicity, presumably related to cardiac and pulmonary damage associated with older radiotherapy techniques.[5,6] In the late 1990s and early 2000s, three landmark trials (two from Denmark and one from British Columbia, Canada) independently demonstrated OS benefits with PMRT in node-positive patients who received systemic therapy.[7-10] These trials, which used newer radiotherapy techniques (no en face photon fields were used for the chest wall) and presumably avoided some of the treatment toxicity observed in the former studies, revitalized interest in examining the benefits of PMRT. As detailed in the Table, the trials showed a substantial benefit from PMRT, both in local control and OS. The British Columbia trial, published in 2005, showed a statistically significant survival benefit with PMRT in patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy.[9] Although statistical significance was lost when OS was analyzed by the number of involved lymph nodes, the hazard ratios for 1 to 3 vs ≥ 4 nodes were 0.76 and 0.70, respectively, suggesting a benefit that might have reached significance with a larger sample size. Not only did the original analyses of the Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group 82b and 82c trials (which were subsequently criticized for inadequate node dissection in many patients) suggest a benefit in all patients, including the subset of patients with 1 to 3 involved nodes,[7,8] but so did a subsequent 2007 analysis that evaluated the subset of patients with 1 to 3 involved nodes who were felt to have adequate ALND; patients with fewer than 8 nodes removed were excluded.[11] That study revealed a statistically significant OS benefit with the addition of PMRT in patients with 1 to 3 involved nodes (57% vs 48%; = .03) that was both substantial and similar in magnitude to the survival benefit observed in patients with larger numbers of involved nodes. Nevertheless, questions remained about whether patients with a low burden of nodal disease really benefit from PMRT even in the setting of adequate axillary surgery. Patterns-of-failure analyses among unirradiated patients after adequate axillary surgery The National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) conducted a number of trials in breast cancer patients treated with mastectomy and did not permit PMRT in those trials, given the lack of survival benefit observed in earlier studies. Therefore, these data provided a particularly useful source of information regarding patterns of failure in the setting of more complete axillary surgery. Data from these trials confirmed that locoregional failure (LRF) remained problematic even with more effective anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimens. A patterns-of-failure analysis of five NSABP trials, published in 2004, in which patients did not receive PMRT, showed that in patients with node-positive disease, the rate of isolated LRF as a first event was greater than 10% in most patient subsets (and greater than 10% in all patient subsets when simultaneous distant recurrence was included), whether stratified by age, menopausal status, hormone receptor status, tumor size, number of nodes removed, or number of nodes dissected.[12] Nevertheless, isolated LRF without PMRT was only 8.1% in patients with 1 to 3 positive nodes, and LRF with or without distant failure, at 13.0%, was still significantly lower than in patients with larger numbers of involved nodes.[12] It was therefore concluded that the risk of failure in patients with 1 to 3 involved nodes might not be sufficiently high to justify PMRT. More recent studies have also suggested that rates of failure may be even lower in more recent cohorts.[13] Early Breast Cancer Trialists’ Collaborative Group (EBCTCG) radiotherapy meta-analyses In 2005, the EBCTCG landmark individual patient data meta-analysis that included all patients from the previously discussed British Columbia and Danish trials examined the benefits of adjuvant radiotherapy among patients who underwent mastectomy and ALND. In node-negative women who underwent mastectomy and ALND, the 5-year risk of local recurrence was low (6%), and no reduction in 15-year breast cancer mortality was demonstrated.[14] However, in patients with node-positive disease who underwent ALND, 5-year local recurrence was reduced from 23% to 6%, 15-year breast cancer mortality from 60.1% to 54.7% ( = .0002), and 15-year all-cause mortality from 72.3% to 68.8% ( = .0009). Given the concerns about the potential impact of inadequate axillary surgery, the EBCTCG more recently conducted an updated meta-analysis that included only patients with adequate axillary surgery, with mortality data up to 2009. This 2014 report showed a statistically significant reduction in 20-year breast cancer mortality in women with 1 to 3 involved nodes after mastectomy and adequate axillary dissection, even when they received some form of systemic therapy (relative risk, 0.78; = .01).[15] Nonetheless, some degree of controversy remains regarding recommendations for PMRT in patients with 1 to 3 involved nodes, given that contemporary patients may hav e lower absolute failure risks after receiving anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimens, which were not routinely available in earlier eras. Additionally, previous trials of PMRT do not provide information on how to evaluate patients with micrometastases and isolated tumor cells, which are relatively new classifications and levels of disease unlikely to have been detected prior to the advent of techniques for sentinel node identification. Another matter of controversy is whether the small subset of patients with T3N0 tumors should receive PMRT, as was recommended historically. Although these patients were included and observed to benefit from PMRT in the Danish trials, a 2006 retrospective pooled analysis of five NSABP trials and other sources of retrospective data has suggested that the risk of isolated LRF as a first event for patients with tumors 5 cm or larger was lower than previously expected (at 7.1%) after mastectomy, even without radiotherapy.[16] Given this, management recommendations are controversial, and many radiation oncologists no longer routinely advise radiotherapy for this entire subset, recommending instead that risk factors such as tumor size, receipt of an inadequate axillary dissection, close or positive margins, and the presence of lymphovascular invasion be considered.[17] Considerations in the Context of Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Despite the considerable historical evidence evaluating the role of PMRT in breast cancer management, it is important to note that none of these studies included patients who received preoperative systemic therapy. This has posed a major challenge for patient selection for radiation therapy in the modern era, given the increased uptake of the neoadjuvant approach. Researchers, clinicians, and patients alike have been particularly intrigued by the possibility that response to systemic therapy might be used to better select patients who are likely to benefit from radiation therapy after mastectomy. To attempt to better identify a population at low risk for recurrence even in the absence of postoperative radiotherapy, a number of studies have focused on investigating predictive and prognostic factors in patients who undergo neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Pretreatment factors include clinical stage, receptor status, and age, and posttreatment factors include margin status and response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Retrospective data from MD Anderson Cancer Center provide useful information on recurrence patterns after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Particularly intriguing have been observations in patients in whom a pathologic complete response (pCR) was achieved after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.[18,19] The cohort included primarily patients with stage II or III disease who underwent a modified radical mastectomy with a level I or II axillary dissection. Most of the 106 patients received modern chemotherapy regimens, including anthracyclines and taxanes in 92% and 38%, respectively. PMRT was delivered based on physician and patient preference, which resulted in its delivery in 72 patients and its omission in the remaining 34. This allowed for a retrospective comparison between the two groups. Radiotherapy techniques generally included delivery of 50 Gy in 25 fractions to the chest wall and lymphatics, followed by a 10-Gy boost. An electron field was used to treat the internal mammary chain and medial chest wall, while a photon field was used to treat undissected lymphatics in the supraclavicular fossa and axilla. There were no significant differences between the irradiated and nonirradiated patients with respect to age; menopausal status; histologic subtype; estrogen, progesterone, or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status; grade; presence of lymphovascular invasion; or use of hormonal therapy. As might be expected, however, a larger proportion of patients in the irradiated group were at a more advanced clinical stage at presentation. Clinical stage in the nonirradiated vs irradiated cohorts was as follows: IB, 6% vs 0%; IIA, 38% vs 1%; IIB, 21% vs 17%; IIIA, 15% vs 37%; IIIB, 17% vs 29%; and IIIC, 3% vs 15%. Despite the fact that there were more patients with advanced-stage disease in the radiation cohort, 10-year rates of LRR did not differ significantly between the two groups (10% nonirradiated vs 5% irradiated; = .40). No patients with clinical stage I or II disease (2 were at stage IB and 14 at stage II) experienced LRR, regardless of whether PMRT was delivered. However, among patients with clinical stage III disease, LRR, distant metastasis–free survival (DMFS), cancer-specific survival (CSS), and OS were all significantly lower in irradiated patients (LRR, 7.3% vs 33.3%, = .04; DMFS, 87.9% vs 40.7%, = .0006; CSS, 87% vs 40%, = .0014; OS, 77.3% vs 33.3%, = .0016). This led radiation oncologists to recommend PMRT in all patients who present with clinically locally advanced disease, regardless of pathologic response. Regarding factors that could predict for LRR, there was a trend toward an association between the presence of lymphovascular invasion and increased LRR, and no correlation with age, menopausal status, histology, estrogen/progesterone receptor status, nuclear grade, or number of involved nodes. The low rates of failure in early-stage patients who achieved a pCR after neoadjuvant chemotherapy regardless of whether PMRT was delivered support the inclusion of this population in prospective studies that evaluate omission of radiotherapy. Given that lower-risk patients are generally more likely to be observed, and higher-risk patients to be irradiated, the bias would likely be toward the null in this setting. The observed difference in failure rates in advanced-stage patients who either did or did not receive PMRT after a pCR is therefore important, since it suggests that radiotherapy should not be omitted in patients who present with locally advanced disease, regardless of their response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Patterns of failure after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and mastectomy with radiotherapy: combined NSABP B-18 and B-27 analysis Although the MD Anderson Cancer Center analyses provided important, seminal data on outcomes after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, these studies are limited by the facts that PMRT was administered in a nonrandomized fashion and that relatively few patients with early-stage disease were included. The NSABP B-18 and B-27 trials of neoadjuvant therapy prohibited PMRT and included a sample of patients at somewhat less locally advanced stages, allowing for additional retrospective analysis of patterns of failure in these trials to provide further illuminating insights.[20] The NSABP trials were performed in the era when it was unknown whether PMRT was associated with an OS radiotherapy benefit, and it was NSABP policy at that time not to provide radiotherapy to patients who received mastectomy. This provides a unique opportunity to examine recurrence rates in the absence of radiotherapy among patients treated with a neoadjuvant approach. Both studies had neoadjuvant arms consisting of doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide (AC), and B-27 had an additional neoadjuvant arm that added docetaxel to AC. For patients who underwent mastectomy, 10-year LRR rates were reported based on tumor size, clinical node stage, and type of pathologic response. A pCR in the breast was defined as the absence of invasive disease in the breast. Ten-year LRR rates in patients with a pCR in both the nodes and breast were less than 10% after mastectomy, regardless of tumor size (less than, equal to, or greater than 5 cm) and regardless of whether they had a clinically node-negative or node-positive axilla. No chest wall or regional recurrences occurred in patients with clinically positive nodes with a pCR in both the breast and nodes, although this group only included 32 patients. Of the 94 total patients who experienced a pCR at both sites, only 1 experienced failure in the chest wall, with the remaining 3 failures occurring regionally. In patients with pathologically positive nodes after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, LRR rates were close to 25%. The highest rates of recurrence within this subgroup were in patients with clinically node-positive disease. Patients with a CR in the nodes but not in the breast generally had an intermediate risk of recurrence relative to the two other groups. Although the subgroups of patients in whom a pCR was achieved were small, the low rates of recurrence provide support for the inclusion of these patients in prospective analyses of omission of PMRT. Moreover, the substantial risks of failure in patients with residual nodal disease highlight these patients as requiring radiation therapy and perhaps even as candidates for intensification of standard approaches to PMRT. Relationship between pCR and outcomes: CTNeoBC pooled analysis A 2014 analysis by the Collaborative Trials in Neoadjuvant Breast Cancer (CTNeoBC) investigators of over 13,000 patients enrolled in 12 trials of neoadjuvant chemotherapy attempted to combine information about pCR with information about tumor biology to further optimize decisions about locoregional management in this setting.[21,22] There was significant heterogeneity across trials with respect to enrollment criteria: 61% of patients had T2 tumors, 46% had clinically involved nodes, 30% had hormone receptor–negative disease, and 17% had HER2-positive disease (although in many trials, no HER2 testing was performed). Most patients received anthracycline- and/or taxane-based regimens, with a few trials including trastuzumab. While all patients with hormone receptor–positive tumors were supposed to receive at least 5 years of endocrine therapy, over half of patients with HER2-positive disease did not receive trastuzumab because they were treated before results were reported from the adjuvant trastuzumab trials. Criteria for radiotherapy differed across the studies, and it was not administered in a randomized fashion. The CTNeoBC investigators analyzed pCR based on three different definitions: (1) absence of invasive cancer and in situ cancer in both the breast and nodes (ie, ypT0 ypN0); (2) absence of invasive cancer in the breast and nodes, irrespective of the presence of in situ disease in the breast (ie, ypT0/is ypN0); and (3) absence of invasive cancer in the breast irrespective of in situ cancer in the breast or disease in the nodes (ie, ypT0/is). The overall frequency of pCR was low (22%, ypT0/i; 18%, ypT0/is ypN0; and 13%, ypT0 ypN0). The analysis revealed that eradication of invasive tumor from the breast and nodes, irrespective of in situ disease in the breast (ypT0 ypN0 or ypT0/is ypN0), had a stronger association with both event-free survival and OS than did eradication of invasive tumor from the breast alone (ypT0/is). The ypT0/is ypN0 definition was thereafter adapted as the definition of pCR in their analysis. In general, more aggressive subtypes had higher rates of pCR, ranging from 7.5% for hormone receptor–positive, HER2-negative grade 1/2 tumors, to 33.6% for triple-negative tumors, to 50.3% for HER2-positive, hormone receptor–negative tumors that were treated with trastuzumab. Trastuzumab increased pCR rates in all HER2-positive tumors, regardless of whether they were hormone receptor–positive or –negative. The strongest association between long-term outcomes and pCR was seen for patients with triple-negative and HER2-positive, hormone receptor–negative cancers who received trastuzumab. The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TexasWHAT DO WE ALREADY KNOW ABOUT PMRT AFTER NEOADJUVANT CHEMOTHERAPY?Determining which patients require radiation therapy after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and mastectomy is a particularly important and common clinical question. The available literature indicates that women with clinical stage III breast cancer benefit from postmastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT) and should receive it. For women with stage II breast cancer who are ypN+, the role of PMRT remains unclear, although such patients are eligible for the Alliance A011202 trial, and enrollment in this trial is encouraged. For women with stage II breast cancer who are ypN0, retrospective data suggest that PMRT may be omitted. The ongoing National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project B-51/Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 1304 trial is evaluating this question prospectively.WHAT IS PARTICULARLY CHALLENGING ABOUT THIS ISSUE? One key ongoing challenge is the integration of breast reconstruction with chemotherapy and PMRT. At my center, many patients undergo skin-sparing mastectomy with placement of a tissue expander. The tissue expander is inflated in the postoperative setting, deflated to a fill volume of approximately 150 to 250 mL the day prior to simulation, and then gradually reinflated starting about 2 to 3 weeks after completion of radiation. This strategy provides patients with the benefits of skin sparing without compromising the quality of the radiation plan. In contrast, when patients are irradiated in the presence of a large, maximally inflated tissue expander, the radiation treatment plan is often compromised due to difficulty with target coverage, particularly of the internal mammary nodes, or because of excessive lung or heart irradiation. These challenges underscore the pressing need for strong collaborative teams between plastic surgery and radiation oncology and for prospective trials to generate high-level evidence to guide coordination of breast reconstruction and PMRT.Dr. Smith receives research support from Varian Medical Systems. Preliminary analyses have also suggested that LRR rates varied widely across the study population when analyses were performed by pathologic response and biological subsets. For example, in hormone receptor–positive, HER2-negative mastectomy patients, there were no LRRs in the setting of a pCR regardless of grade, but among ypN+ patients, grade 3 patients experienced higher LRR than grade 1 or 2 patients (13.9% vs 5.3%). In lumpectomy patients, a similar trend was observed in the hormone receptor–positive, HER2-negative subset (low recurrence rates with a pCR regardless of grade), but when ypN+ patients were stratified by age, the difference in recurrence between grade 3 and grade 1 or 2 patients was even larger (age < 50 years: 20.6% vs 1.5%; age ≥ 50: 12.7% vs 1.1%). Although treatments were not uniform across the populations, this suggests that grade may be an important factor to consider in adjuvant therapy decisions when a pCR is not achieved. Interesting trends were also observed in patients with triple-negative disease. Although these patients are generally thought of as having more aggressive disease, 5-year LRRs were low (6.2%) for mastectomy patients with a pCR, but they remained high (22.1%) for patients with residual nodal disease. A large difference in recurrence rates was similarly observed in hormone receptor–negative, HER2-positive patients who underwent mastectomy (ypT0/is ypN0: 4.1% vs ypN+: 24.4%). It might, therefore, be reasonable to include triple-negative and hormone receptor–negative, HER2-positive ypN+ patients in trials that involve intensification of locoregional therapy (more extensive fields, higher dose, or radiosensitizers) while including those with a pCR in trials that omit radiotherapy altogether. Special Considerations: Axillary Management in Patients Receiving Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Given the rapid evolution of strategies for axillary evaluation and management in all settings, these issues merit consideration in the context of the current discussion. Practices vary widely regarding the nature and timing of axillary evaluation in patients treated with neoadjuvant therapy. Some institutions continue to perform upfront sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) to provide pathologic information as similar as possible to the sort of “prechemotherapy” pathology that was evaluated in the trials of PMRT. Other institutions perform upfront axillary ultrasonography but not SLNB prior to chemotherapy. Two 2013 studies that evaluated SLNB in patients who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy found that false-negative rates were unacceptably high after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.[23,24] However, given lower rates of false-negative results among patients with 3 or more nodes retrieved and the desire to spare patients the morbidity of axillary dissection, some institutions do perform SLNB in patients with clinically negative axillae after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Accounting for differences in axillary surgical approaches adds further complexity to the determination of appropriate radiotherapeutic management in this setting. Patients treated with upfront SLNB (the general approach at the University of Michigan) may be at higher risk for overtreatment with radiotherapy; patients treated with SLNB after chemotherapy may be at higher risk for false-negative results and residual disease that is undertreated by radiotherapy. Ultimately, in such settings, a patient’s personal preferences and tolerance of risk of recurrence vs treatment-related morbidity are particularly important considerations. Current Guidelines for Radiotherapy After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines state that “indications for radiation therapy and fields of treatment should be based on the worst stage pretreatment or posttreatment tumor characteristics in patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy.”[25] They then divide recommendations for patients with early-stage disease (I, IIA, IIB, and T3N1) and locally advanced disease (all stage III patients except T3N1). For patients with early-stage disease who undergo mastectomy, the guidelines refer to the general guidelines on PMRT, which typically recommend the following: • 1 to 3 involved axillary nodes: strongly consider. • Negative nodes and tumor > 5 cm or positive margins:consider. • Negative nodes and tumor ≤ 5 cm and negative margins but < 1 mm: consider to chest wall only. • Negative nodes, tumor ≤ 5 cm, and margins > 1 cm: omit. Regarding axillary staging, the NCCN recommends fine-needle aspiration (FNA) or core biopsy of any clinically or radiographically suspicious nodes prior to the administration of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. If FNA or core biopsy specimens are negative, NCCN guidelines recommend SLNB, which can be performed before or after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. If FNA or core biopsy specimens are positive, they recommend restaging with ALND after neoadjuvant chemotherapy if there are clinically positive nodes, and with ALND or SLNB if nodes are clinically negative. For patients with locally advanced noninflammatory breast cancer, NCCN guidelines state that if a patient has a response to preoperative systemic therapy, subsequent treatment should include either lumpectomy or total mastectomy, level I/II axillary dissection, and radiotherapy to the breast/chest wall and infraclavicular and supraclavicular nodes.[25] Regarding coverage of the internal mammary nodes, the guidelines state that treatment is recommended if they are clinically involved and should be strongly considered if they are not clinically involved (level 2B recommendation). The NCCN guidelines attempt to provide a conservative recommendation that accommodates the wide variation in pretreatment assessment procedures. In recommending that patients be treated based on the worst pre- or posttreatment staging, the NCCN guidelines place stronger weight on the lack of prospective data for omission of PMRT than on the retrospective B-18 and B-27 data[20] showing low recurrence rates in some patient subsets. Additionally, for early-stage patients who undergo neoadjuvant chemotherapy, NCCN guidelines refer to guidelines for PMRT that were largely designed for patients who did not undergo neoadjuvant chemotherapy. However, clinicians may want to factor in response to chemotherapy in ways that are not explicitly addressed by the recommendations. For example, although the recommendation in patients with involvement of 1 to 3 nodes is to strongly consider PMRT, in the B-18/B-27 analysis,[20] the 10-year incidence of LRR was greater than 10% (10.6% to 14.7%) for all mastectomy patients with 1 to 3 positive nodes after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, suggesting that perhaps PMRT should be recommended to all patients in this category. The National Cancer Institute published a statement in 2008 regarding locoregional treatments after preoperative chemotherapy for breast cancer.[26] The statement discussed the MD Anderson and NSABP data, which suggest the importance of considering nodal status both before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and subsequently recommended that radiotherapy be considered for patients who (1) present with clinical stage III disease or (2) have pathologically proven nodal involvement after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. However, the statement also discusses the lack of evidence for the value of PMRT in patients with stage II disease and says that prospective trials are needed. Ongoing Trials: PMRT After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Prospective trials provide an opportunity to answer a number of important questions regarding the utility of PMRT after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. One major question is whether pathologic response rates in either the breast or lymph nodes can be used prospectively to identify a group of patients who will have a low rate of recurrence if PMRT is omitted. Additionally, in patients who do not achieve a pCR, the most appropriate extent of axillary surgery and radiotherapy is unclear. Trials have recently been initiated to address these important questions. NSABP B-51/Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 1304, a trial that began in August 2013, will evaluate the benefit of radiotherapy in patients who have had a complete response in the axilla after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. It is enrolling women with clinical T1–T3 N1 disease based on palpation, ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or positron emission tomography (PET), who have undergone pathologic confirmation of axillary involvement.[27] SLNB is not permitted, given that this would prohibit assessment of response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy; the involved node must be pathologically confirmed but left in place. Patients must complete a minimum of 12 weeks of standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy consisting of an anthracycline- and/or taxane-based regimen. Additional adjuvant chemotherapy is allowed for up to 12 weeks. HER2-positive patients must receive a regimen that includes anti-HER2 therapy (eg, trastuzumab, pertuzumab). Patients with metastatic disease, T4 tumors, clinical or radiographic N2 or N3 disease, histologically positive nodes after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, or microscopically positive margins after definitive surgery are excluded (negative margins via reexcision are allowed). Allowed methods of axillary staging after chemotherapy include ALND, SLNB alone, or SLNB followed by ALND. Patients are eligible whether or not there is a pCR in the breast and also if isolated tumor cells are detected by hematoxylin and eosin stain, immunohistochemistry, or positive molecular findings, without other evidence of lymph node metastases (ie, ypN0[i+] or ypN0[mol+]). Patients who undergo mastectomy will be randomly assigned to no radiotherapy or chest wall and regional nodal radiotherapy. Regional nodal irradiation will include the chest wall, undissected axilla, supraclavicular nodes, and internal mammary nodes in the first three intercostal spaces. The dose to the chest wall and regional nodal areas will be 50 Gy, and a chest-wall boost of 12 or 14 Gy will be permitted in cases with close (≤ 2 mm) margins. The primary endpoint is invasive breast cancer recurrence–free interval, defined as time from randomization until invasive local, regional, or distant recurrence or death from breast cancer. Secondary aims and endpoints include OS, LRR-free interval, distant recurrence–free interval, disease-free survival–ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS; patients with DCIS are counted as disease-free), secondary primary invasive cancer, quality of life, toxicity, treatment adequacy, comparison of radiotherapy effects in lumpectomy and mastectomy patients, and molecular predictors of recurrence. This important trial will therefore address critical, previously unanswered questions. The Alliance 011202 trial will enroll patients who are not eligible for NSABP B-51/RTOG 1304 due to the presence of positive sentinel nodes after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.[28] Patients will be randomly assigned to completion ALND and nodal radiation therapy or axillary radiation and nodal radiation therapy. In the ALND group, complete level I and II dissection is recommended, with removal of a minimum of 8 nodes. Radiotherapy will be delivered over 5 to 6 weeks to the breast/chest wall, undissected axilla, supraclavicular nodes, and internal mammary nodes in the first three intercostal spaces. For the axillary radiation group, radiotherapy will be delivered to the breast/chest wall, full axilla (levels I, II, and III), supraclavicular nodes, and internal mammary nodes in the first three intercostal spaces. The primary outcome is invasive breast cancer recurrence–free interval. Secondary outcomes include OS and ipsilateral/local/regional invasive breast cancer recurrence. Additional outcomes to be reported include development of breast or arm lymphedema, adequacy of radiation fields, and residual cancer burden. The NSABP B-51/RTOG 1304 and Alliance 011202 trials will contribute much needed data to the topic of PMRT after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. However, given the previously discussed data on SLNB after neoadjuvant therapy, the safety of SLNB will remain unclear if not enough women are enrolled in NSABP B-51/RTOG 1304 who undergo SLNB alone. Additionally, these trials will not answer the question of what the appropriate extent of the radiation field should be: for example, must internal mammary nodes always be included, and should the entire axilla be irradiated in a patient with low residual nodal burden after neoadjuvant chemotherapy? Further trials are also in development (eg, Southwest Oncology Group 1509) to answer questions that may arise at the other end of the spectrum of risk: for example, should treatment be intensified in certain patients based on their response (or lack thereof) to neoadjuvant therapy? Radiosensitizer studies may be particularly valuable in certain patients who do not respond to neoadjuvant therapy. There is a lack of evidence from randomized trials demonstrating the benefits of delivery or the safety of omission of PMRT in patients who receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Ongoing trials will answer many important questions, but additional issues will need to be addressed, either through prospective trials or consensus guidelines incorporating retrospective studies or extrapolated data in the absence of level I evidence. In the interim, the ideal approach is to enroll eligible patients in clinical trials and to otherwise make recommendations regarding PMRT to patients based on their highest clinical or pathologic stage, while attempting to account for individual patient variations in preferences for avoidance of recurrence vs minimization of treatment-related toxicity and burden.

NYU Langone doctors often perform surgery to manage male breast cancer. A lumpectomy, in which surgeons remove the tumor and a portion of surrounding healthy tissue, may be possible in men with early cancer. Nearby lymph nodes—small glands that make and store lymphocytes, which are white blood cells that help fight infection—may also be removed. Breast cancer often spreads to the lymph nodes first. Men usually are diagnosed with invasive cancer, so NYU Langone doctors often perform a mastectomy, in which they remove the entire breast. Lumpectomy, also called a partial mastectomy, may be an option for men who have certain , including ductal carcinoma in situ, early invasive ductal carcinoma, or early invasive lobular carcinoma. At NYU Langone, this surgery is usually followed by . During a lumpectomy, our surgeons remove the cancer along with a border, or margin, of surrounding tissue to ensure no cancer cells remain. Afterward, a pathologist evaluates the tissue margin under a microscope to see if it contains any cancerous cells. If it does, more tissue may need to be surgically removed. In mastectomy, a surgeon removes the entire breast, nipple, and areola, the ring of pigmented skin surrounding the nipple. NYU Langone doctors may recommend the procedure for men who have extensive ductal carcinoma in situ and those who have a large invasive cancer or multiple tumors. NYU Langone doctors sometimes remove both breasts, depending on the risk of developing cancer in the other breast. This is called a bilateral mastectomy. You and your doctors can discuss whether this is the right option for you. In men who have invasive cancer, doctors perform sentinel lymph node removal during a lumpectomy or mastectomy to determine if cancer has spread. Lymph nodes are part of the lymphatic system, which consists of organs and vessels that drain excess fluid from tissues and help the body fight infection. A radioactive fluid called a tracer is injected in or around the breast before surgery, and a blue dye may be injected in the same area after you are in the operating room. The tracer travels through the breast tissue to nearby lymph nodes under the arm. The first node or several nodes to absorb the tracer are called the sentinel nodes. If cancer spreads outside the breast, it is likely to travel to these nodes first. NYU Langone doctors can find this node or nodes using a gamma probe, a device that detects the radioactive fluid. This helps them determine where to make an incision to remove the node. The blue dye helps doctors to identify the sentinel node or nodes during surgery. Doctors remove the sentinel nodes through a small incision under the arm and examine them to determine whether they contain cancer. If cancer is not present, then doctors don’t need to remove additional lymph nodes. If cancer is found in the sentinel nodes, your surgeon may recommend another procedure, called axillary lymph node dissection, to remove additional nodes to determine if they contain cancer. During an axillary lymph node dissection, doctors may remove as many as 10 to 15 lymph nodes from the underarm area to evaluate them for cancer. This procedure is more likely than sentinel lymph node removal to cause a condition called . Lymphedema may develop after lymph vessels in the breast and underarm are damaged by surgery. These vessels carry lymph fluid, which contains bacteria and waste products, away from the body’s organs and tissues. Damage to the vessels may cause fluid to build up, creating swelling and discomfort in the arm. NYU Langone doctors can help you take steps to prevent lymphedema and manage it if it occurs. The length of your hospital stay depends on the extent of the surgery. For example, if you have a lumpectomy with a sentinel lymph node removal, you may go home the same day. If you have a mastectomy with an axillary lymph node dissection, you may need to stay overnight. During this time, doctors and nurses monitor your health and help to manage any pain or discomfort. Men who have axillary lymph node dissection may go home with a drain placed under the arm. This tube drains fluid away from the wound and may need to stay in place for several days to help reduce swelling.

f1d71684-e49d-4e05-8719-d71fa37fffcf,"Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research Carcinoma of Unknown Primary Treatment (PDQ®)–Health Professional Version General Information About Carcinoma of Unknown Primary (CUP) General Information About Carcinoma of Unknown Primary (CUP) The site of origin of a histologically documented carcinoma is not identified clinically in approximately 3% of patients; this situation is often referred to as CUP origin or occult primary malignancy.[-] The definition of a CUP varies from study to study; however, at a minimum, this determination should include a biopsy of the tumor and a thorough history and complete physical examination that includes head and neck, rectal, pelvic, and breast examinations; chest x-rays; a complete blood cell count; urinalysis; and an examination of the stool for occult blood. The value of other radiographic tests will be discussed in the stage information section. When these results do not reveal signs of a potential primary lesion and the biopsy is not consistent with a primary tumor at the biopsy site, a CUP must be assumed. The majority of CUP are adenocarcinomas or undifferentiated tumors; less commonly, squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma, sarcoma, and neuroendocrine tumors can also present with a primary site of origin that cannot be determined. In approximately 15% to 25% of patients, the primary site cannot be identified even at postmortem examination.[] The prognosis for patients with CUP is poor. As a group, the median survival is approximately 3 to 4 months with less than 25% and 10% of patients alive at 1 and 5 years, respectively. CUP is represented by a heterogeneous group of diseases all of which have presented with metastasis as the primary manifestation. Although the majority of diseases are relatively refractory to systemic treatments, certain clinical presentations of CUP carry a much better prognosis. In each instance, distinct clinical and pathologic details require consideration for appropriate, potentially curative, management.[-] A retrospective review of 657 consecutive patients with CUP (270 additional patients were excluded as a result of identification of a primary malignancy, a noncarcinoma cell type, or no malignancy) reported several variables of significant prognostic importance identified by multivariate analysis.[] Lymph node involvement and neuroendocrine histology were associated with longer survival; male sex, increasing number of involved organ sites, adenocarcinoma histology, and hepatic involvement were unfavorable prognostic factors. Adrenal involvement has also been noted to be a poor prognostic finding.[] Conceptually, CUP represents a tumor that has a greater propensity for early dissemination than the more common presentation in which the primary tumor is apparent with or without metastasis. The distribution of primary sites that are likely to result in CUP contrasts with the distribution of major primary adenocarcinomas as reported in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data. Most large studies have shown that carcinoma of the lung and pancreas are the most common primary carcinomas that initially present as CUP. Other common malignancies such as colorectal, breast, and prostate cancers infrequently present as CUP.[-] The pattern of spread of CUP at diagnosis can provide clues to the likelihood of the primary site being above or below the diaphragm. Lung metastases are twice as common in primary sites ultimately found to be above the diaphragm. Liver metastases are more common from primary disease below the diaphragm. The pattern of metastasis from a carcinoma presenting as CUP may be significantly different from that which would be expected from the usual presentation. For instance, bone metastases are approximately three times more common in pancreatic cancer that presents as CUP, while osseous metastasis from lung cancer is about 10 times less common when it presents as CUP, compared with the usual presentation. The biologic bases for these differences in presentation, incidence, and pattern of metastases are unknown.[] Although only a minority of patients will have curable disease or a disease for which there is substantial palliative benefit, the appropriate use of special diagnostic pathology and selected radiologic studies will identify patients for whom directed therapy will provide the best possible chance for response.

A thorough evaluation of an adequate specimen for histologic, immunohistochemical, and, when appropriate, electron microscopic evaluations is probably the most important clue in the diagnostic puzzle of CUP. Pathologic evaluations provide guidance for an appropriate clinical evaluation. An obvious corollary to the pathologist’s role is the critical interaction between the pathologist, oncologist, and primary physician.[] The complexity of the pathologic evaluation tends to be inversely related to the degree of differentiation of the tumor. For well- or moderately differentiated tumors, the pathologic diagnosis of an epithelial cancer versus lymphoma, sarcoma, melanoma, or a germ cell tumor, for instance, is often readily apparent. Commonly used histologic stains such as mucicarmine or diastase-sensitive Periodic Acid Schiff can be important in confirming the diagnosis of certain tumors of gastrointestinal or renal origin. Special studies can help in distinguishing tumors that are poorly differentiated;[,] the generic distinction between a poorly differentiated tumor of epithelial, hematopoietic, or neuroectodermal origin (i.e., melanoma) is important. Microsatellite analysis has been used to assess genetic alterations in cervical lymph nodes. These alterations were identical in 18 patients with normal mucosal histology and malignant nodes, suggesting a site of primary tumor origin.[] Several studies can be important in making these broad distinctions; in particular, studies that evaluate staining for keratins, leukocyte common antigen, and S-100, a neuroectodermal antigen expressed in melanomas.[] Gene expression profiling using an immunohistochemical panel may allow identification of a potential site of origin in patients with adenocarcinoma of unknown origin. One study reported identification of a potential primary site in 14 of 22 patients.[] This modality has not been validated against the gold standard and has not been studied prospectively. This histochemical study can accurately differentiate tumors of prostatic origin from other types of cancer. Prostate cancer is most often found by digital rectal examination. Approximately 3% of CUPs are ultimately shown to be prostate cancer. These cancers, as mentioned above, appear to have a different metastatic distribution than the predominant bony distribution that is generally encountered in prostate cancer. When the primary disease may be suspected to have arisen from the prostate, prostate cancer-specific tests should be performed to rule out a diagnosis of primary prostate cancer.[] Human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) analysis: Immunohistochemical stains are available for both of these proteins. Although neither protein is absolutely specific for germ cell tumors, and AFP is not specific for hepatoma, they are important because germ cell tumors are effectively treated with combination chemotherapy; appropriate therapy may lead to cure.[] The finding of germ cell tumors by genetic analysis has been associated with a high response rate to cisplatin therapy, thus suggesting that molecular or cytogenetic studies may be useful in identifying undifferentiated tumors that are otherwise unclassifiable.[] In patients with suspected nasopharyngeal carcinoma, DNA amplification of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genomes can be used for diagnosis with tissue provided by fine-needle aspiration biopsy. The presence of EBV in metastases from an occult primary tumor suggests the development of overt nasopharyngeal carcinoma.[] A single study has shown that the i(12p) marker chromosome may be used as a diagnostic tool in patients with suspected midline germ cell tumors.[] Another study used a molecular assay to evaluate ten tissue type–specific gene markers, using quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR technology to detect tumors originating from the lung, breast, colon, ovary, pancreas, and prostate. About 60% of patients had the putative site of origin identified, thus allowing for administration of treatment-specific therapy.[,] Electron microscopy (EM) evaluation can sometimes aid in the diagnosis of CUP. In particular, the presence of desmosomes and bundles of tonofilaments are characteristic of squamous cell cancers. The presence of core granules that are diagnostic of neuroendocrine origin is seen in poorly differentiated neuroendocrine tumors of unknown primary site.[] Acinar spaces and microacinic spaces are seen with adenocarcinomas. Electron dense secretory granules are seen in tumors of neuroectodermal origin. Premelanosomes can be found in most amelanotic melanomas. The features mentioned above are generally associated with differentiation along a particular line. Often poorly differentiated tumors do not display such characteristics, making the EM evaluation of little value. It is estimated that EM may aid in distinguishing a primary diagnosis that has not been obtained by light microscopy approximately 10% of the time.[-] Because of the development of immunohistochemical stains, EM is rarely needed.

Semin Oncol 9 (4): 396-415, 1982.  Opinions are divergent concerning the value and extent of evaluation that should be performed to determine the primary tumor in patients who present with carcinoma of unknown primary (CUP). Clinical and pathological investigations to detect tumors that are potentially responsive to treatment (e.g., lymphoma, germ cell tumor, breast, or ovarian tumor) may be undertaken. The chest radiograph has become an almost routine procedure in general medical practice. Although chest radiography is routinely performed, in the setting of CUP no distinguishing feature clearly separates primary from metastatic disease within the chest. The abdominal computed tomographic (CT) scan is the only radiographic test that may frequently be of value in defining the primary site, because of the inordinately high representation of pancreatic cancer in the CUP process.[] With the exception of ovarian cancer, however, CT scans rarely identify treatable primary cancers.[,] The clinical biology of the disease, the types of tumors most often encountered, and the high level of inaccuracy of unguided radiographic studies raise issues of cost effectiveness for intensive diagnostic work-up. Two studies have indicated that a large negative cost/benefit ratio exists for an extensive unguided clinical evaluation, with a single study citing a 9.5% increase in 1-year survival at a cost of 2 to 8 million dollars. The most reasonable approach is to develop a comprehensive knowledge of the manner in which CUP patients present and to remember that this presentation is associated with tremendous heterogeneity regarding outcome.[-] A histologic diagnosis of metastatic carcinoma in cervical nodes requires a meticulous examination of the upper aerorespiratory tract. Histologically, these tumors are usually squamous cell carcinoma, but occasionally may be adenocarcinoma, melanoma, or anaplastic tumors. Metastatic adenocarcinoma is generally associated with a poor prognosis. Approximately 2% to 5% of patients with primary squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck region will present with cervical adenopathy as the primary disease manifestation; about 10% of this group will present with bilateral adenopathy. The 3-year survival rate ranges from 35% to 59% when patients with squamous or undifferentiated tumors are treated with radical radiation therapy, surgery, or both.[-] Investigators have defined a subpopulation of potentially curable patients with 1 or more of the following characteristics: Midline tumor distribution, multiple pulmonary nodules or lymph nodes, elevated serum levels of beta human chorionic gonadotropins (HCG) or alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). Cells positive for beta HCG or AFP by immunohistochemical stain. Tumors that were very responsive to chemotherapy or radiation therapy. In retrospective review, many of these patients, including some complete responders to chemotherapy, did not have any recognizable histopathologic features of germ cell tumors.[-] A single study has shown that the i(12p) marker chromosome may be used as a diagnostic tool in patients with suspected midline germ cell tumors.[] Approximately 5% of patients with malignant melanoma will present without a documented primary site. Special stains and electron microscopy may be important in establishing the diagnosis. Patients with this diagnosis should, like those with stage II melanoma, have a radical lymph node dissection. Survival is actually slightly better than that seen in patients with stage II melanoma with a documented primary site.[,-] (Refer to the PDQ summary on for more information.) Most patients who present with nodal metastasis above the diaphragm ultimately are documented to have lung cancer, the most common supradiaphragmatic primary malignancy. The presence of isolated axillary metastasis in females, however, raises another possibility. A few studies involving a small number of patients have shown that approximately 50% of patients who present with isolated axillary metastasis of an adenocarcinoma will ultimately be shown to have breast cancer. Although some of these patients will have a positive mammogram after the initial evaluation, approximately 50% of the patients will not. When these patients are treated with local excision, or as having primary breast cancer, 2- to 10-year survival has been obtained in approximately 50% of patients. The availability of estrogen-receptor (ER) and progesterone-receptor (PR) assays may aid in this diagnosis, and these studies should be performed in this setting. If the clinical setting is consistent with breast cancer, and ER and/or PR levels are elevated, CUP with this distribution should be treated as breast cancer.[,,] (Refer to the PDQ summary on for more information.) Squamous carcinoma detected in the inguinal lymph nodes is almost always metastatic from the genital or anal/rectal area. In females, careful examination of the vulva, vagina, and cervix is indicated, with biopsy of any suspicious areas. The penis of uncircumcised males should be carefully inspected. In both sexes, the anorectal area should be carefully examined, including biopsy of suspicious areas. Isolated metastases present in the central nervous system, the liver, and the genitourinary tract. Information about these presentations may be found in PDQ summaries that specifically detail their management. In addition to the above situations, significant palliation can be achieved in certain instances in patients with CUP. Breast, prostate, ovarian, and thyroid cancers are all treatable malignancies, even when metastatic, and they represent approximately 15% of all CUP tumors. As with other CUP presentations, the pattern of spread of these malignancies is somewhat atypical. For instance, patients with prostate cancer who present with CUP have an inordinately high incidence of metastases to nonosseous sites such as lung (75%), liver (50%), and brain (25%). Bone metastases are also less common than lung metastases in thyroid cancer presenting as CUP. Copeland EM, McBride CM: Axillary metastases from unknown primary sites.

Cancer 70 (2): 504-8, 1992.  The overwhelming majority of patients presenting with carcinoma of unknown primary (CUP) have disseminated disease that is relatively chemoresistant. Potentially curative treatment can be delivered, however, in a few situations. All patients should undergo a careful head, neck, and lung evaluation including coronal computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging of the head and neck and directed biopsies of the nasopharynx and tongue base. In those patients with squamous cell or undifferentiated carcinoma, tonsillectomies have been recommended and should be considered if the tonsils have not been previously removed.[] Fluorine F 18-fludeoxyglucose positron emission tomography scan may identify an occult primary site in the head and neck area.[,] If no primary site can be determined, the following approaches should be considered: Radical radiation therapy with curative intent to the cervical lymph nodes and possible sites of origin.[] Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) may have less short- and long-term toxicity than conventional radiation therapy in terms of xerostomia, acute dysphagia, and skin fibrosis.[-] Preoperative radiation therapy followed by radical neck dissection. Radical neck dissection followed by postoperative radiation therapy to possible sites of origin.[] (Refer to the PDQ summary on Metastatic Squamous Neck Cancer with Occult Primary Cancer Treatment for more information.) Patients who have poorly differentiated carcinomas with or without serologic or histologic evidence of beta human chorionic gonadotropins or alpha-fetoprotein should be treated with intensive chemotherapy as used in the treatment of disseminated germ cell tumors. In a series, more than 220 patients with excellent performance status were treated with aggressive combination chemotherapy. This chemotherapy generally consisted of vinblastine, bleomycin, and cisplatin; however, some patients received a doxorubicin-containing modification of this regimen and some received etoposide instead of vinblastine. The response rate was 63%, with a complete response rate of 26%, and a long-term disease-free survival of 16%.[] Carboplatin-containing regimens were found to have equal activity.[] A paclitaxel-based combination yielded a 48% response rate in 71 patients with various histologic types of carcinoma of unknown origin.[] In a series of 29 patients with poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas, 19 were treated with intensive cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy, and six additional patients received doxorubicin combinations. Six patients achieved complete response and four of these patients were alive 19 to 100 months after diagnosis.[] Women with peritoneal carcinomatosis of an adenocarcinoma serous histologic type have a favorable response to chemotherapy and improved prognosis. Response and survival rates in these patients approach those seen in ovarian cancer patients, and therapy appropriate for ovarian cancer should be used.[,] (Refer to the PDQ summary on Ovarian Epithelial, Fallopian Tube, and Primary Peritoneal Cancer Treatment for more information.) The most common primary site for isolated axillary metastasis is the breast. Mammography should be performed in all patients with isolated axillary-nodal metastasis. After an adequate evaluation of the breast and lung to rule out these primary sites, the following treatment options should be considered: Lymph node dissection with or without mastectomy or radiation therapy to the breast with curative intent.[] Lymph node dissection with or without mastectomy or radiation therapy to the breast with curative intent plus adjuvant chemotherapy with an accepted therapeutic adjuvant approach for breast cancer. This option should be considered especially if breast cancer is proven or if other lymph nodes show adenocarcinoma.[] Metastatic carcinoma in inguinal nodes from an unknown primary source occurs in approximately 1% to 3.5% of patients. A diagnostic excisional-node biopsy should be performed when no primary source of carcinoma can be found. The most common pathologic diagnosis in this instance is Hodgkin lymphoma or non-Hodgkin lymphoma, with CUP being less frequent. Local excisional biopsy with or without radiation, inguinal node dissection, or chemotherapy. In a small proportion of patients, local excision alone is sufficient therapy. Initial therapy with radiation may be used successfully in some patients, depending on extent of disease and individual patient characteristics. Isolated metastases also present in the central nervous system, liver, and genitourinary tract.[] More information can be found in the PDQ summaries for these malignancies. Melanoma (Melanotic or Amelanotic) Occurring in a Single Nodal Site Approximately 5% of patients present with no detectable primary site. Radical lymph node dissection. For patients who present with a single site of nodal metastasis, this treatment will yield a survival that is slightly better than that obtained in conventional stage II melanoma. When patients present with widespread metastatic disease and special studies reveal a probable primary tumor for which standard systemic therapy is available, such therapy should be administered. This may include hormonal therapy for prostate and breast cancer, iodine I 131 for thyroid cancer, or cytotoxic single-agent or combination chemotherapy for hormone-refractory breast and ovarian cancers. Standard approaches for such diseases are available in the specific PDQ summaries for each diagnosis. The majority of patients will not have a definable primary source. For such patients, a variety of combination chemotherapy approaches have been tried with little success. No treatment can be considered standard at present. Therefore, such patients should be considered for available clinical trials. Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the .

Patients with a breast abnormality are evaluated at the Mass General Cancer Center in a comprehensive, multidisciplinary clinic. Patients meet with both an experienced breast surgeon and a breast radiologist. Breast radiologists specialize in mammography, ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Patients are evaluated for abnormalities including: After an evaluation, additional diagnostic breast procedures are sometimes required, including: , similar to fine needle aspirations but a slightly larger needle is used. The area is numbed with a topical anesthetic, and the patient is awake during the procedure , in which a thin needle is inserted into the breast to withdraw a small amount of tissue for analysis. The area is numbed with a topical anesthetic, and the patient is awake during the procedure , in which a surgeon uses a small piece of wire to guide removal of abnormal breast tissue. The area is numbed with a topical anesthetic, and the patient is awake during the procedure , in which a breast surgeon removes a lump for analysis. This is performed in an operating room with expert anesthesiologists , where imaging technology is used to guide the biopsy. The area is numbed with a topical anesthetic, and the patient is awake during the procedure Patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer are also evaluated in multidisciplinary sessions at the Mass General Cancer Center, where the patient can meet with a surgeon, radiation oncologist and medical oncologist, have mammograms and pathology slides reviewed, and receive definitive treatment recommendations in a single visit. The majority of our patients with breast cancer undergo lumpectomies and minimally invasive sentinel node biopsies, returning to full activity within a week. Our surgeons use sentinel node biopsies to assess the axillary lymph nodes and are pioneers in this technique. Axillary lymph nodes are located right under the arm and are important in determining if breast cancer has spread. During a sentinel node biopsy, a blue dye is injected near the tumor to identify the location of the first axillary lymph nodes. One or more lymph nodes are then removed to determine whether the tumor has spread. Compared to traditional axillary lymph node dissection, sentinel node biopsies reduce the risk of lymphedema and chronic shoulder and arm problems after breast cancer surgery. Lymphedema occurs when removal of a lymph node leads to a build-up of lymphatic fluid, causing the arm and hand to swell. Some patients with small tumors are offered the option of a partial breast irradiation, which is a shortened course of radiation lasting one or two weeks rather than the standard six-to-seven week treatment. For patients who require mastectomy, our breast surgeons have pioneered These surgeries are offered to patients diagnosed with a breast cancer or those who are at high risk for breast cancer due to a genetic abnormality. Patients who choose this operation are cared for by a multidisciplinary team that includes breast surgeons from the division of surgical oncology, reconstructive surgeons from the division of plastic surgery and anesthesiologists who specialize in block anesthesia to provide optimal pain control around the time of the operation. Performed to completely remove the tumor and leave a cosmetically pleasing result. Our surgeons are actively researching novel techniques to perform more directed tumor removal to reduce the need for a second operation. Performed when the tumor occupies more than one portion of the breast or when a patient has a strong risk of a second breast cancer. There are several types: Skin-sparing mastectomy, in which the breast skin is kept intact , in which the nipple and areola remain. Our surgeons are pioneers in this technique and have demonstrated that this operation may be performed after radiation, after previous breast surgery or after cosmetic breast surgery A minimally invasive procedure where a dye is used during surgery to determine location of the first axillary lymph nodes. A lymph node, or several, are then removed to determine whether the tumor has spread. Your care team will contact you prior to your surgery with preoperative instructions specific to your treatment program. These instructions will tell you how to manage any medication that you are currently taking and let you know if you need to have any preoperative blood work or imaging. The day of surgery varies depending on the type of surgery needed. Your nurse will review with you what to expect ahead of time. Our surgeons are invested in providing support to our patients during their active treatment and beyond. Patients are typically screened on a yearly basis for recurrent breast cancer with a clinical breast exam, tomosynthesis or a 3D mammogram, and in special circumstances, a breast MRI. In addition, patients may: Be eligible for clinical trials, which study the effects of breast cancer treatment, while at our center Be screened for breast cancer-related lymphedema in our Undergo physical therapy after surgical treatment of breast cancer Participate in  and You will receive a phone call from your surgeon approximately seven to 10 days after your surgery with pathology results. These results will determine the next steps in your treatment program and your surgeon will arrange follow-up appointments with other providers if necessary. In addition to performing surgical biopsies and breast cancer surgery, we collaborate closely with the genetic counselors in the Center for Cancer Risk Assessment to evaluate hereditary risk in young patients and patients with strong family histories of breast cancer. Patients may be at increased risk of developing cancer if they have: A strong family history of the disease, defined as: Breast or ovarian cancer is observed at a young age (such as in the 20s or 30s) Multiple cancers occur in a single individual (breast cancer on both sides or breast and ovarian cancer in a single individual) Pathologic diagnosis from prior biopsies such as: Atypical ductal hyperplasia, a benign disease where cells are not like normal cells Lobular carcinoma in situ, also a benign disease caused by abnormal cells in the breast If a family has any or all of these characteristics, consultation in the Center for Cancer Risk Assessment may be appropriate to determine the level of hereditary risk. Management often includes a more intensive screening schedule, which may include initiating mammographic screening at a younger age or adding breast MRI to yearly screening. Earlier medications, such as tamoxifen, which blocks estrogen production, are available and may decrease the risk of breast cancer. Women who have been diagnosed with atypical hyperplasia or lobular carcinoma in situ are known to be at higher risk of breast cancer, regardless of their family history. These patients are followed more closely and are often advised to take tamoxifen to help decrease their risk of breast cancer. A woman with a strong family history, atypical hyperplasia or lobular carcinoma in situ are evaluated to determine their level of risk and to make management recommendations. Some women who are at an increased risk for breast cancer due to a genetic mutation may ultimately choose to undergo risk-reducing surgery or bilateral prophylactic mastectomy, which is the removal of both breasts. Breast surgeons in the Division of Surgical Oncology are experts in this operation and specialize in preserving the nipple-areolar complex at the time of prophylactic mastectomy. Patients who choose this operation are cared for by a multidisciplinary team, which includes breast surgeons from the Division of Surgical Oncology, reconstructive surgeons from the and who specialize in block anesthesia to provide optimal pain control around the time of the operation. Breast surgeons in the Division of Surgical Oncology have been leaders in developing surgical techniques for nipple-sparing mastectomy and research associated with the safety of nipple-sparing mastectomy.

Denny Sanford Institute for Empathy and Compassion Novel Surgery May Prevent Lymphedema in Patients with Breast Cancer Microsurgery helps prevent complications following lymph node dissection November 05, 2019 ​Of the 3.5 million current breast cancer survivors in the United States, one in five will be diagnosed with a painful swelling condition called lymphedema, which can occur as a consequence of lymph nodes under the arms being removed, also known as axillary lymph node dissection. UC San Diego Health now offers a novel surgical procedure to help prevent this debilitating condition. Frederic Kolb, MD, plastic surgeon, UC San Diego Health “While the majority of patients do not experience complications from lymph node removal, it can be devastating for those who do. Immediate lymphatic reconstruction is a preventive procedure to restore lymphatic connections in the arm,” said , plastic surgeon at UC San Diego Health. “This delicate surgery is performed at the same time the lymph nodes are removed and tested for cancer. Instead of treating patients after lymphedema presents itself, we hope to prevent the condition for patients who may be at risk.” During lymph node dissection, Kolb and his team map the drainage routes of the nodes in the upper arm. The team reconnects any disrupted channels by creating a “by-pass” to prevent swelling. Using a microscope, the team reroutes the tiny vessels, many less than the thickness of a dime. “This microsurgical technique ‘re-plumbs’ the lymphatic system to allow for the normal flow and drainage of lymphatic fluid,” said , plastic surgeon, UC San Diego Health. “It is intended to prevent the chronic limb swelling and infection associated with breast cancer-related lymphedema. The technique may also be applicable to prevent leg lymphedema caused by lymph node dissections in the groin.” “As a cancer surgeon, my primary goal is to accurately stage the cancer to identify which patients need more aggressive treatment,” , surgical oncologist at UC San Diego Health. “In some patients, significant lymph node dissection can unintentionally result in damage to healthy tissue. With this procedure, we can help prevent lymphedema and give the patient a better overall experience and outcome.” Christopher Reid, MD, plastic surgeon, UC San Diego Health The lymphedema prevention surgery represents one of several emerging microsurgical techniques being used to care for patients with breast cancer. Certified lymphedema therapists are also available to help patients prevent or manage the condition through exercise and massage. “The Comprehensive Breast Health Center has developed protocols for pre-operative evaluation of patients and immediate postoperative evaluation of lymphedema and range of motion issues associated with breast cancer treatment,” said , director, Comprehensive Breast Health Center. “Data shows that both early assessment and treatment by occupational therapists after breast cancer treatment leads to improved physical outcomes.” For more than two decades, UC San Diego Health’s nationally recognized Comprehensive Breast Health Center has offered a multidisciplinary program to treat female and male patients with any kind of breast issue including all stages of cancer. From detection to diagnosis and treatment, the program uses the patient’s genetic profile to customize treatment options, including surgery, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, radiation and reconstruction. The surgical team offers multiple options to help the patient safely achieve their desired outcome. This includes advanced oncoplastic options for patients desiring breast conservation to the full scope of implant-based and non-implant-based reconstruction using a patient’s own tissue after mastectomy. The team approach allows for shared decision making between the patient and the plastic surgeon who has specific expertise in any of these choices. When needed, patients have access to a specialized recovery unit inside Jacobs Medical Center. Care is provided by a sub-specialty trained group of nurses who provide close and continuous monitoring of tissue reconstruction, as well as overall well-being. The team also includes anesthesiology pain management experts who have specialized training in block use and other postoperative pain management regimens to decrease pain, shorten hospital stays, and reduce the need for opioid pain medication.

Background: Breast reconstruction improves the psychological well-being of patients with breast cancer. Patients who complete nipple-areolar reconstruction are even more satisfied with their final reconstructive result. Nipple flattening is a common complication. We hypothesized that injectable soft-tissue filler can be used to augment nipple projection in patients who underwent breast reconstruction.Methods: This is a retrospective study of patients who underwent breast reconstruction and desired an enhanced postoperative nipple projection. The patients underwent a single session of injection with a hyaluronic acid filler as an outpatient. The filler was injected intradermally at the base of the nipple until the desired nipple projection was obtained.Results: Twelve patients and 22 breasts were included in this study. Enhanced nipple projection was observed in all cases, with an average increase of 3.0mm in nipple height (range 2.5-4.5mm). All injected nipples remained soft to the touch. All results were stable at a median of 7.5 months follow-up. No complications were observed.Conclusions: The use of injectable fillers for enhanced nipple projection is a useful adjunct treatment in patients undergoing breast reconstruction. Advantages include the ability to obtain nipple projection in patients who opt to forgo nipple-areola reconstruction with local flaps, to augment reconstructed nipples in patients with thin mastectomy skin flaps especially following implant-based reconstruction, and to improve projection of the native nipple following nipple-sparing mastectomy. Another benefit of this adjunct treatment is that the injection is reversible. Filler injection is a safe and simple solution to the problem of insufficient nipple projection. Assessing the Accuracy of a 3-Dimensional Surface Imaging System in Breast Volume Estimation. Kwong, J. W., Tijerina, J. D., Choi, S., Luan, A., Feng, C. L., Nguyen, D. H., Lee, G. K., Nazerali, R. S. Preoperative prediction of breast volume can guide patient expectations and aid surgical planning in breast reconstruction. Here, we evaluate the accuracy of a portable surface imager (Crisalix S.A., Lausanne, Switzerland) in predicting breast volume compared with anthropomorphic estimates and intraoperative specimen weights.Twenty-five patients (41 breasts) undergoing mastectomy were scanned preoperatively with the Crisalix surface imager, and 1 of 3 attending plastic surgeons provided an anthropomorphic volume estimate. Intraoperative mastectomy weights were used as the gold standard. Volume conversions were performed assuming a density of 0.958 g/cm.The Pearson correlation coefficient between imager estimates and intraoperative volumes was 0.812. The corresponding value for anthropomorphic estimates and intraoperative volumes was 0.848. The mean difference between imager and intraoperative volumes was -233.5 cm, whereas the mean difference between anthropomorphic estimates and intraoperative volumes was -102.7 cm. Stratifying by breast volume, both surface imager and anthropomorphic estimates closely matched intraoperative volumes for breast volumes 600 cm and less, but the 2 techniques tended to underestimate true volumes for breasts larger than 600 cm. Stratification by plastic surgeon providing the estimate and breast surgeon performing the mastectomy did not eliminate this underestimation at larger breast volumes.For breast volumes 600 cm and less, the accuracy of the Crisalix surface imager closely matches anthropomorphic estimates given by experienced plastic surgeons and true volumes as measured from intraoperative specimen weights. Surface imaging may potentially be useful as an adjunct in surgical planning and guiding patient expectations for patients with smaller breast sizes. Fat Grafting Rescues Radiation-Induced Joint Contracture. Borrelli, M. R., Diaz Deleon, N. M., Adem, S., Patel, R. A., Mascharak, S., Shen, A. H., Irizarry, D., Nguyen, D., Momeni, A., Longaker, M. T., Wan, D. C. The aim of this study was to explore the therapeutic effects of fat grafting on radiation-induced hind limb contracture. Radiation therapy (RT) is used to palliate and/or cure a range of malignancies but causes inevitable and progressive fibrosis of surrounding soft tissue. Pathological fibrosis may lead to painful contractures which limit movement and negatively impact quality of life. Fat grafting is able to reduce and/or reverse radiation-induced soft tissue fibrosis. We explored whether fat grafting could improve extensibility in irradiated and contracted hind limbs of mice. Right hind limbs of female 60-day-old CD-1 nude mice were irradiated. Chronic skin fibrosis and limb contracture developed. After 4weeks, irradiated hind limbs were then injected with (a) fat enriched with stromal vascular cells (SVCs); (b) fat only; (c) saline; or (d) nothing (n = 10/group). Limb extension was measured at baseline and every 2weeks for 12weeks. Hind limb skin then underwent histological analysis and biomechanical strength testing. Irradiation significantly reduced limb extension but was progressively rescued by fat grafting. Fat grafting also reduced skin stiffness and reversed the radiation-induced histological changes in the skin. The greatest benefits were found in mice injected with fat enriched with SVCs. Hind limb radiation induces contracture in our mouse model which can be improved with fat grafting. Enriching fat with SVCs enhances these beneficial effects. These results underscore an attractive approach to address challenging soft tissue fibrosis in patients following RT.

View details for Successful treatment of lymphedema in a vasculopath and neuropathic patient. Inchauste, S., Zelones, J., Rochlin, D., Nguyen, D. H. This is a case report of a 68-year-old male with stage III right lower extremity lymphedema following right inguinal lymph node dissection and adjuvant chemoradiotherapy for Hodgkin's lymphoma. He developed peripheral neuropathy and radiation-induced right femoral artery thrombosis, treated with saphenous vein graft. He underwent three vascularized lymph node transfers (VLNTs) to the upper medial thigh, posterior calf, and ankle with placement of nanofibrillar collagen scaffolds. Three months after surgery, he had volume reduction, less neuropathic pain, and improved ambulation. The role of adjunct nanofibrillar collagen scaffold implantation in the surgical management of secondary lymphedema: Review of the literature and summary of initial pilot studies. Rochlin, D. H., Inchauste, S., Zelones, J., Nguyen, D. H. Secondary lymphedema is a worldwide affliction that exacts a significant public health burden. This review examines the etiology, presentation, and management of secondary lymphedema. In addition, emerging adjunctive strategies are explored, specifically evidence from animal and pilot human studies regarding implantation of a collagen nanofibrillar scaffold (BioBridge; Fibralign Corporation, Union City, CA) in promoting lymphangiogenesis, preventing and treating lymphedema, and enhancing outcomes with lymphaticovenous anastomosis and vascularized lymph node transfer. Breast Reconstruction with Free Abdominal Flaps Is Associated with Persistent Lower Extremity Venous Stasis Momeni, A., Sorice, S. C., Li, A. Y., Nguyen, D. H., Pannucci, C. View details for Postoperative analgesia after microsurgical breast reconstruction using liposomal bupivacaine (Exparel). Momeni, A., Ramesh, N. K., Wan, D., Nguyen, D., Sorice, S. C. Conventional opioid-based regimen for postoperative analgesia after autologous breast reconstruction can be associated with significant side effects. The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of an intraoperatively administered transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block with liposomal bupivacaine on postoperative narcotic use in patients undergoing microsurgical breast reconstruction with free abdominal flaps. Patients treated between December 2016 and June 2017 were included in the study. Parameters of interest were patient-reported pain score, total narcotic use (in oral morphine equivalent [OME]) during the hospitalization, length of stay (LOS), and the need for patient-controlled analgesia (PCA). Eighty-two free abdominal flaps were transferred in 46 patients with a mean age of 47.6years and a mean body mass index (BMI) of 28.1kg/m2 . The average LOS was 3.5days (range, 3-5). Postoperatively, 42 patients (91.3%) did not require patient-controlled analgesia (PCA). The mean time to first narcotic use after arrival on the nursing unit was 6hours (range, 0-19hours). The mean total postoperative OME use was 123.2mg (range, 0-285mg). However, analysis of OME use excluding the four patients requiring PCA revealed a mean OME use of 90.3mg (range, 0-167.5mg). Liposomal bupivacaine provides for reliable, safe, and long-acting postoperative analgesia and contributes to a reduction in postoperative narcotic intake. The use of liposomal bupivacaine shows great promise in improving the standard of care in postoperative analgesia in microsurgical breast reconstruction. Identifying risk factors for postoperative major complications in staged implant-based breast reconstruction with AlloDerm. Remington, A. C., Gurtner, G. C., Wan, D. C., Nguyen, D., Momeni, A. Acellular dermal matrices (ADM) have reportedly been associated with postoperative complications following breast reconstruction. The purpose of this study was to identify risk factors predictive of major postoperative complications after staged implant-based breast reconstruction with ADM. A retrospective study of all patients who underwent implant-based breast reconstruction with AlloDerm between 2013 and 2017 was conducted. Demographic information, procedural data, and postoperative complications were retrieved. The main objective was to analyze patient and procedural factors associated with the occurrence of major complications, including postoperative readmission and loss of reconstruction. A total of 166 patients (288 breasts) were included. Major complications were noted in 19.9%. The overall rate of infection and mastectomy skin necrosis was 16.9% and 6.6%, respectively. Readmission occurred in 16.3% and loss of reconstruction occurred in 8.4% of patients. Risk factors for major complications included body mass index (BMI) >27.0 kg/m2 (OR 2.46; p = 0.041), higher tissue expander volume (p = 0.049), history of chemotherapy (OR 2.20; p = 0.047) and radiotherapy (OR 2.22; p = 0.040). Loss of reconstruction was associated with a BMI >27.0 kg/m2 (OR 4.00; p = 0.012), tobacco use (OR 6.64, p = 0.006), and higher tissue expander volume (p = 0.035). Similarly, readmission was associated with higher tissue expander volume (p = 0.042). In conclusion, a variety of factors were identified to be associated with major complications, including higher BMI, increased tissue expander volume, as well as history of chemotherapy and radiation. This information is valuable for pre-operative counseling and for future comparative studies between different ADM types. Acellular Dermal Matrix Reduces Myofibroblast Presence in the Breast Capsule. Tevlin, R., Borrelli, M. R., Irizarry, D., Nguyen, D., Wan, D. C., Momeni, A. Background: Capsular contracture remains a common complication after implant-based breast reconstruction. Previous work has suggested that the use of acellular dermal matrix (ADM) reduces the rate of capsular contracture, though little is understood about the underlying mechanism. As myofibroblasts are believed to be the key cells implicated in contracture formation, we hypothesized that ADM would result in a reduction in periprosthetic myofibroblast concentration.Methods: Five patients who underwent immediate prepectoral tissue expander placement with anterior ADM coverage and an inferior cuff were included. At the second stage, tissue samples were obtained of both ADM and capsule from each reconstructed breast. Samples were then prepared for hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistochemistry for myofibroblast identification (alpha smooth muscle actin and vimentin positive and desmin negative) and analysis. Experimental values are presented as mean SD unless otherwise stated. Statistical significance was determined using unpaired t test.Results: Successful incorporation of ADM was noted in all cases. A significant reduction in myofibroblast concentration was noted in the ADM versus the capsule (P = 0.0018). This was paralleled by significantly thicker periprosthetic capsule formation overlying the formerly raw pectoralis major muscle, that is, not covered by ADM (P < 0.0001).Conclusions: In the presence of ADM, there are significantly fewer myofibroblasts in breast capsules and thinner capsules on histology. Given the central role of myofibroblasts in the development of clinically significant capsular contracture, this study unmasks a possible mechanism for the protective effect of ADM with respect to capsular contracture development. Pro-Fibrotic CD26-Positive Fibroblasts are Present in Greater Abundance in Breast Capsule Tissue of Irradiated Breasts. Borrelli, M. R., Irizzary, D., Patel, R. A., Nguyen, D., Momeni, A., Longaker, M. T., Wan, D. C. BACKGROUND: Breast capsular contracture is a major problem following implant-based breast reconstruction, particularly in the setting of radiation therapy. Recent work has identified a fibrogenic fibroblast subpopulation characterized by CD26 surface marker expression.OBJECTIVE: This work aimed to investigate the role of CD26-positive fibroblasts in the formation of breast implant capsules following radiation therapy.METHODS: Breast capsule specimens were obtained from irradiated and non-irradiated breasts of 10 patients following bilateral mastectomy and unilateral irradiation at the time of expander-implant exchange, under institutional review board approval. Specimens were processed for Hematoxylin and Eosin staining, as well as for immunohistochemistry and fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) for CD26-positive fibroblasts. Expression of fibrotic genes and production of collagen was compared between CD26-positive, CD26-negative, and unsorted fibroblasts.RESULTS: Capsule specimens from irradiated breast tissue were thicker and had greater CD26-postive cells on immunofluorescence imaging and on FACS analysis, than did capsule specimens from the non-irradiated breast. Compared to CD26-negative fibroblasts, CD26-positive fibroblasts produced more collagen and had increased expression of the profibrotic genes IL8, TGF-beta1, COL1A1, and TIMP4.CONCLUSIONS: CD26-positive fibroblasts were found in a significantly greater abundance in capsules of irradiated compared to non-irradiated breasts and demonstrated greater fibrotic potential. This fibrogenic fibroblast subpopulation may play an important role in the development of capsular contracture following irradiation, and its targeted depletion or moderation may represent a potential therapeutic option. Fat Grafting into Younger Recipients Improves Volume Retention in an Animal Model Chung, N. N., Ransom, R. C., Blackshear, C. P., Irizarry, D. M., Yen, D., Momeni, A., Lee, G. K., Nguyen, D. H., Longaker, M. T., Wan, D. C. View details for Breast Reconstruction with Free Abdominal Flaps is associated with Persistent Lower Extremity Venous Stasis. Momeni, A., Sorice, S. C., Li, A. Y., Nguyen, D. H., Pannucci, C. BACKGROUND: Previous work has demonstrated the occurrence of lower extremity venous stasis in the early postoperative period after breast reconstruction with free abdominal flaps. The purpose of this study was to ascertain whether venous stasis persisted through the day of discharge (DOD), thus, potentially exposing patients to an elevated risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) post-discharge.METHODS: Patients who underwent breast reconstruction with free abdominal flaps were prospectively enrolled and underwent Duplex ultrasound of the common femoral vein (CFV) at the following time points: Preoperatively, POD 1, and DOD. Parameters of interest included CFV diameter, area, and maximum flow velocity (MFV).RESULTS: Thirty patients with a mean age of 50.3 years (range, 29 - 70) underwent breast reconstruction with 52 free abdominal flaps. A significant increase in CFV diameter (19.1%; p < 0.01) and area (46.8%; p < 0.01) correlated with a significant reduction in MFV (-10.9%; p = 0.03) between baseline and POD1. These changes persisted through the DOD (CFV diameter [17.8%; p < 0.01], area [46 %; p < 0.01], MFV (-11.3%; p = 0.01)]. Venous parameters were not influenced by uni- vs. bilateral flap harvest (p = 0.48).CONCLUSION: Postoperative lower extremity venous stasis following autologous breast reconstruction with free abdominal flaps seems to persist through the day of discharge. This finding may explain why patients remain at risk for VTE post-discharge. While our findings are at odds with current VTE prophylaxis recommendations, additional studies are indicated to examine whether these findings translate into VTE events. Correction of complete thoracic duct obstruction with lymphovenous bypass: A case report Miller, T. J., Gilstrap, J. N., Maeda, K., Rockson, S., Nguyen, D. H. View details for Borrelli, M. R., Patel, R. A., Sokol, J., Dung Nguyen, Momeni, A., Longaker, M. T., Wan, D. C. Radiotherapy (RT) helps cure and palliate thousands of patients with a range of malignant diseases. A major drawback, however, is the collateral damage done to tissues surrounding the tumor in the radiation field. The skin and subcutaneous tissue are among the most severely affected regions. Immediately following RT, the skin may be inflamed, hyperemic, and can form ulcers. With time, the dermis becomes progressively indurated. These acute and chronic changes cause substantial patient morbidity, yet there are few effective treatment modalities able to reduce radiodermatitis. Fat grafting is increasingly recognized as a tool able to reverse the fibrotic skin changes and rejuvenate the irradiated skin. This review outlines the current progress toward describing and understanding the cellular and molecular effects of fat grafting in irradiated skin. Identification of the key factors involved in the pathophysiology of fibrosis following RT will inform therapeutic interventions to enhance its beneficial effects. Fat Grafting into Younger Recipients Improves Volume Retention in an Animal Model. Chung, N. N., Ransom, R. C., Blackshear, C. P., Irizarry, D. M., Yen, D., Momeni, A., Lee, G. K., Nguyen, D. H., Longaker, M. T., Wan, D. C. BACKGROUND: Soft tissue deficits associated with various craniofacial anomalies can be addressed by fat grafting, although outcomes remain unpredictable. Furthermore, consensus does not exist for timing of these procedures. While some advocate approaching soft tissue reconstruction after the underlying skeletal foundation has been corrected, other studies have suggested earlier grafting may exploit a younger recipient niche that is more conducive for fat graft survival. As there is a dearth of research investigating effects of recipient age on fat graft volume retention, this study compared the effectiveness of fat grafting in younger versus older animals through a longitudinal, in vivo analysis.METHODS: Human lipoaspirate from three healthy female donors was grafted subcutaneously over the calvarium of immunocompromised mice. Volume retention over 8 weeks was evaluated using micro-computed tomography in three experimental ages - 3-weeks old, 6-months old, and 1-year old. Histology was performed on explanted grafts to evaluate graft health and vascularity. Recipient site vascularity was also evaluated by confocal microscopy.RESULTS: Greatest retention of fat graft volume was noted in the youngest group compared to both older groups (*p < 0.05) at 6 and 8 weeks following grafting. Histological and immunohistochemical analyses revealed that improved retention in younger groups was associated with greater fat graft integrity and more robust vascularization.CONCLUSION: Our study provides evidence that grafting fat into a younger recipient site correlates with improved volume retention over time, suggesting that beginning soft tissue reconstruction with fat grafting in patients at an earlier age may be preferable to late correction. A Matched-Pair Analysis of Prepectoral with Subpectoral Breast Reconstruction: Is There a Difference in Postoperative Complication Rate? Momeni, A., Remington, A. C., Wan, D. C., Nguyen, D., Gurtner, G. C. The development of acellular dermal matrices has revolutionized implant-based breast reconstruction. The most recent development has been the introduction of prepectoral breast reconstruction. However, concerns have been expressed related to the quality of soft-tissue coverage and infectious complications. Thus, the authors felt it prudent to perform a matched-pair analysis of clinical outcomes following prepectoral and subpectoral tissue expander placement.A retrospective study of patients who underwent immediate breast reconstruction by means of prepectoral (group 1) and dual-plane subpectoral (group 2) tissue expander placement was performed. Patients in each group were matched for age, body mass index, history of radiotherapy, and type of acellular dermal matrix. Of note, patients in group 1 received perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis for less than 24 hours, whereas patients in group 2 received antibiotic prophylaxis for at least 1 week.A total of 80 patients (138 breast reconstructions) were included in the study (group 1, n = 40; group 2, n = 40). No difference in total postoperative complication rate (p = 0.356) and mastectomy skin necrosis rate (p = 1.0) was noted. Observed differences in major complications (p = 0.06), major infection (p = 0.09), and loss of reconstruction (p = 0.09) were not found to be significant.Immediate prepectoral tissue expander insertion with anterior acellular dermal matrix coverage and less than 24 hours of antibiotic prophylaxis is safe and compares favorably to subpectoral tissue expander placement with an inferior acellular dermal matrix sling and a prolonged course of antibiotics.Therapeutic, III. Preoperative Computed Tomography Angiography in Autologous Breast Reconstruction-Incidence and Impact of Incidentalomas Tevlin, R., Borrelli, M. R., Dung Nguyen, Momeni, A. Incidentalomas are lesions found coincidentally during examination, imaging, or surgical procedures. Preoperative computed tomography angiography (CTA) before abdominal flap harvest for breast reconstruction can lead to identification of incidentalomas leading to the need for further investigations. The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence of incidental findings on preoperative CTA and to determine their impact on management.A retrospective chart review was performed at a single tertiary institution. CTA reports were analyzed for the presence of incidental findings and details of follow-up were studied. Logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with incidental findings.One hundred eighteen patients with a mean age of 49 years were included in the study. The majority of patients underwent bilateral reconstruction (65%, n = 77) in the immediate setting (70%, n = 83). Fifty-six percentage had an incidental finding on CTA, with hepatic (20%), renal (14%), and osseous (11%) abnormalities being most common. Additional imaging including ultrasound, CT, and magnetic resonance imaging were recommended in 19 cases (16%). Additional consultations were sought for 3 patients before reconstruction (with suspicion of bone metastases, an intraabdominal mass, and suspicion of colonic malignancy, respectively). No significant surgical delay secondary to CT findings was noted.Incidentalomas following preoperative CTA of the abdomen/pelvis are common (56%). However, unlike previous reports, we did not observe a change in reconstructive plan following incidentaloma discovery. We recommend that all patients are counseled pre-CTA regarding the possibilities of incidentaloma detection and need for additional imaging. Correction of complete thoracic duct obstruction with lymphovenous bypass: A case report. Miller, T. J., Gilstrap, J. N., Maeda, K., Rockson, S., Nguyen, D. H. Thoracic duct injury can be a devastating injury with disruption of lymphatic flow leading to potentially chylothorax and/or severe lymphedema. Standard treatment modalities include thoracic duct ligation or embolization for chylothorax, but treatment options to date are few for resultant lymphedema. In this case report, we describe lymphaticovenous bypass of the thoracic duct to the jugular venous system in a 21-year-old male with secondary lymphedema after iatrogenic thoracic duct injury. The patient experienced improvement of lymphedema symptoms including decreased weight and limb girth as well as normalization of serum markers indicating improved lymphatic delivery to the venous system. Lymphangiogram at 3 months post op demonstrated patency of the lymphaticovenous anastomoses. At 6-month follow-up, the patient had returned to his preoperative level of activity and showed continued improvement of his lymphedema symptoms. Lymphovenous bypass of the thoracic duct may be an effective technique to treat secondary lymphedema from thoracic duct obstruction, though further studies are required to determine long-term efficacy. Deepithelialized Skin Reduction Preserves Skin and Nipple Perfusion in Immediate Reconstruction of Large and Ptotic Breasts. BACKGROUND: Women with large and/or ptotic breasts are often not considered candidates for nipple-sparing mastectomy (NSM) and/or immediate breast reconstruction given difficulties avoiding ischemic complications and achieving a favorable aesthetic result. We report a novel technique involving deepithelialized skin reduction to simultaneously reduce the skin envelope and preserve perfusion to the skin and nipple in immediate breast reconstruction for women that fit this high-risk anatomic profile.METHODS: We reviewed cases of NSM and skin-sparing mastectomy (SSM) with immediate implant-based and free autologous reconstruction by a single plastic surgeon from 2013 to 2017. All patients had at least size C cup breasts (>500 g) and/or grade 3 ptosis. Select patients undergoing NSM had devascularization of the nipple-areolar complex (NAC) 1 to 2 months before surgery to promote adaptive circulatory change. After mastectomy, skin reductions were performed via Wise, periareolar, or circumareolar reduction patterns, with infolding of a deepithelialized inferior and periareolar skin flap over a tissue expander or free flap. In NSM, the nipple was advanced superiorly and redirected through a keyhole of deepithelialized skin flap.RESULTS: Patients had an average age of 43.6 years and body mass index of 27.7. A total of 33 breasts in 19 patients (14 bilateral, 5 unilateral) underwent deepithelialized skin reduction. There were 14 NSM and 19 SSM. Reconstructions consisted of 13 tissue expanders exchanged to implants and 20 abdominally-based free flaps. Four patients underwent devascularization of the NAC before NSM. Six (18%) breasts had partial thickness flap loss that healed by delayed primary (n = 1) or secondary (n = 5) intention. Four nipples, all in patients without prior NAC devascularization, had ischemic complications (2 epidermolysis, 12.5%; 2 partial necrosis, 12.5%), which all healed by secondary intention with the exception of 1 case of NAC removal.CONCLUSIONS: Skin reduction with deepithelialization and tissue infolding preserves dermal plexus perfusion and promotes nipple and skin flap survival in immediate implant-based and autologous breast reconstruction after SSM and NSM. This technique can be combined with NAC devascularization to further promote nipple perfusion. Overall, this method offers an acceptable complication rate and the potential to expand the reconstructive options available to women with large and/or ptotic breasts. Deferoxamine Preconditioning of Irradiated Tissue Improves Perfusion and Fat Graft Retention Flacco, J., Chung, N., Blackshear, C. P., Irizarry, D., Momeni, A., Lee, G. K., Dung Nguyen, Gurtner, G. C., Longaker, M. T., Wan, D. C. Radiation therapy is a mainstay in the treatment of many malignancies, but collateral damage to surrounding tissue, with resultant hypovascularity, fibrosis, and atrophy, can be difficult to reconstruct. Fat grafting has been shown to improve the quality of irradiated skin, but volume retention of the graft is significantly decreased. Deferoxamine is a U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved iron-chelating medication for acute iron intoxication and chronic iron overload that has also been shown to increase angiogenesis. The present study evaluates the effects of deferoxamine treatment on irradiated skin and subsequent fat graft volume retention.Mice underwent irradiation to the scalp followed by treatment with deferoxamine or saline and perfusion and were analyzed using laser Doppler analysis. Human fat grafts were then placed beneath the scalp and retention was also followed up to 8 weeks radiographically. Finally, histologic evaluation of overlying skin was performed to evaluate the effects of deferoxamine preconditioning.Treatment with deferoxamine resulted in significantly increased perfusion, as demonstrated by laser Doppler analysis and CD31 immunofluorescent staining (p < 0.05). Increased dermal thickness and collagen content secondary to irradiation, however, were not affected by deferoxamine (p > 0.05). Importantly, fat graft volume retention was significantly increased when the irradiated recipient site was preconditioned with deferoxamine (p < 0.05).The authors' results demonstrated increased perfusion with deferoxamine treatment, which was also associated with improved fat graft volume retention. Preconditioning with deferoxamine may thus enhance fat graft outcomes for soft-tissue reconstruction following radiation therapy. Successful management of persistent lower extremity lymphedema with suction-assisted lipectomy Lower-extremity lymphedema is a significant complication attributed to gynecologic cancer surgery, potentially effectuating severe edema and discernible pain.We report on a patient who developed persistent, lower-extremity lymphedema following her treatment for cervix cancer. Despite repeated efforts to manage the lymphedema with conventional measures, the patient's condition had not markedly improved. Thereafter, she underwent a suction-assisted lipectomy that effectively resolved her symptoms.Since lymphedema often remains disabling and incurable following traditional therapy, suction-assisted lipectomy should be considered as an alternative when endeavoring to optimally manage this complication. Transversus Abdominis Plane Block and Free Flap Abdominal Tissue Breast Reconstruction: Is There a True Reduction in Postoperative Narcotic Use? Hunter, C., Shakir, A., Momeni, A., Luan, A., Steffel, L., Horn, J., Nguyen, D., Lee, G. K. The use of the transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block is increasing in abdominally based autologous tissue breast reconstruction as a method to provide postoperative donor site analgesia. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the TAP block in the immediate postoperative period.A retrospective analysis of all patients who underwent autologous microsurgical breast reconstruction over a 2-year period (2013-2015) was conducted. Only patients with an abdominal donor site were included. Patients were grouped based on the presence or absence of TAP blocks. Primary endpoints included patient-reported pain score, daily and total narcotic use during the hospitalization, antiemetic use, as well as complications.We identified 40 patients that had undergone abdominal-based free flap breast reconstruction and TAP block catheter placement for postoperative analgesia that met inclusion criteria. This group was then compared with a matched cohort of 40 patients without TAP blocks. There were no complications associated with using the TAP catheters. There was no statistically significant difference in postoperative pain scores, daily or total narcotic use during the hospitalization, or antiemetic use between the 2 groups. Although not statistically significant, linear regression analysis identified trends of improved donor site analgesia in select groups, such as unilateral immediate reconstructions, body mass index greater than 30 kg/m, and those without abdominal mesh placed at the time of donor site closure in the TAP block group.Constant delivery of local anesthetic through the TAP block appears to be safe; however, it did not reduce narcotic requirements or postoperative pain scores in patients undergoing abdominal-based free flap breast reconstruction. Protecting Nipple Perfusion by Devascularization and Surgical Delay in Patients at Risk for Ischemic Complications During Nipple-Sparing Mastectomies Bertoni, D. M., Dung Nguyen, D., Rochlin, D., Hernandez-Boussard, T., Meyer, S., Choy, N., Gurtner, G. C., Wapnir, I. L. Indications for nipple-sparing mastectomy (NSM) are expanding; however, high-risk patients have more ischemic complications. Surgical devascularization of the nipple-areolar complex (NAC) prior to NSM can reduce complications. This study reports perfusion patterns and complications in high-risk patients undergoing 2-stage NSM.Surgical devascularization of the NAC was performed 3-6weeks prior to NSM in 28 women. Risk factors included ptosis, obesity, smoking, prior breast surgery, and radiation. Using indocyanine green (ICG)-based fluorescence and an infrared camera, blood inflow was visualized intraoperatively. NAC perfusion patterns were classified as: V1, underlying breast; V2, surrounding skin; V3=V1+V2, or V4, capillary fill following devascularization. Ischemic complications were analyzed.Baseline perfusion for 54 breasts was 35% V1, 32% V2, and 33% V3. Increasing ptosis was associated with V1 pattern: 86% for grade 3, 31% for grade 2, and 18% for grade 1. Postdevascularization epidermolysis was observed in 63% of V1 baseline, 41% of V2, and 22% of V3 (P=.042) and after NSM in 26% for V1, 7% for V2, and 6% for V3 (P=.131). Ptosis was significantly associated with epidermolysis postdevascularization (P=.002) and NSM (P=.002). Smoking and BMI 30 were related to increased ischemic complications. Two or more risk factors were associated with postdevascularization ischemic changes (P=.026), but were not significant after NSM. Nipple loss was not observed, but 2 patients underwent partial areolar resection.Adaptive circulatory changes after devascularization allow tissues to tolerate the additional ischemic challenge of mastectomy. Our findings support extending 2-staged operations to high-risk women previously considered unsuitable for NSM. Breast Augmentation and Breast Reconstruction Demonstrate Equivalent Aesthetic Outcomes. There is a perception that cosmetic breast surgery has more favorable aesthetic outcomes than reconstructive breast surgery. We tested this hypothesis by comparing aesthetic outcomes after breast augmentation and reconstruction.Postoperative images of 10 patients (cosmetic, n = 4; reconstructive, n = 6; mean follow-up, 27 months) were presented anonymously to participants who were blinded to clinical details. Participants were asked if they believed cosmetic or reconstructive surgery had been performed. Aesthetic outcome measures were quantified: (1) natural appearance, (2) size, (3) contour, (4) symmetry, (5) position of breasts, (6) position of nipples, (7) scars (1 = poor and 4 = excellent). Images were ranked from 1 (most aesthetic) to 10 (least aesthetic). Analyses included two-tailed t tests, Mann-Whitney U tests, and (2) tests.One thousand eighty-five images were quantified from 110 surveys (99% response rate). The accuracy of identifying cosmetic or reconstructive surgery was 55% and 59%, respectively (P = 0.18). Significantly more of the top 3 aesthetic cases were reconstructive (51% vs 49%; P = 0.03). Despite this, cases perceived to be reconstructive were ranked significantly lower (5.9 vs 5.0; P < 0.0001). Mean aesthetic outcomes were equivalent regardless of surgery for 5 categories (P > 0.05), with the exception of breast position that improved after reconstruction (2.9 vs 2.7; P = 0.009) and scars that were more favorable after augmentation (2.9 vs 3.1; P < 0.0001). Age and nipple position (R (2) = 0.04; P = 0.03) was the only association between a demographic factor and aesthetic outcome.Aesthetic outcomes after cosmetic and reconstructive breast surgery are broadly equivalent, though preconceptions influence aesthetic opinion. Plastic surgeons' mutually inclusive-reconstructive and aesthetic skill set maximizes aesthetic outcomes. Use of Indocyanine Green-SPY Angiography for Tracking Lymphatic Recovery After Lymphaticovenous Anastomosis. Lymphaticovenous anastomosis (LVA) is a surgical treatment option for patients with early stage lymphedema. To date, no ideal imaging modality exists for tracking patency of the LVA postoperatively. We hypothesize that laser angiography utilizing indocyanine green (ICG) via the SPY system (Lifecell Corp.) would be a useful methodology for assessing the patency of the LVA and lymphatic recovery postoperatively.A prospective trial was performed on patients with stage II lymphedema who underwent LVA from 2013 to 2014 by a single surgeon. All candidates underwent preoperative and postoperative lymphatic mapping using ICG-SPY angiography. Postoperative analyses were performed at 1 month and at 9 months after surgery and assessed for patency at the site of the LVAs and for changes in lymphatic pattern.Five patients underwent LVA, 3 for upper extremity and 2 for lower extremity stage II lymphedema. The number of LVAs per extremity was 1 to 3 (total, 11). One month postoperative ICG-SPY angiography demonstrated flow through 9 of 11 anastomoses. Evaluation at 9 months postoperative showed improvement in lymphatic drainage.Indocyanine green-SPY angiography may be used to objectively evaluate the surgical outcome of LVA. Quantity of lymph nodes correlates with improvement in lymphatic drainage in treatment of hind limb lymphedema with lymph node flap transfer in rats. Nguyen, D. H., Chou, P., Hsieh, Y., Momeni, A., Fang, Y. D., Patel, K. M., Yang, C., Cheng, M. This study was conducted to investigate the correlation between the number of vascularized lymph nodes (LN) transferred and resolution of hind limb lymphedema in a rat model.Unilateral hind limb lymphedema was created in 18 male Sprague-Dawley rats following inguinal and popliteal LN resection and radiation. A para-aortic LN flap based on the celiac artery was subsequently transferred to the affected groin. The three study groups consisted of Group A (no LN transfer), Group B (transfer of a single vascularized LN), and Group C (transfer of three vascularized LNs). Volumetric analysis of bilateral hind limbs was performed using micro-CT imaging at 1, 2, and 3 months postoperatively. Lymphatic drainage was assessed with Tc(99) lymphoscintigraphy preoperatively and at 3 months postoperatively.A statistically significant volume reduction was seen in Groups B and C compared to Group A at all time points. Volume reduction of Group A vs.Group B at 1 month (8.6%2.0% vs. 2.7%2.6%, P<0.05), 2 months (9.3%2.2% vs. -4.3%2.7%, P<0.05), and 3 months (7.6%3.3% vs. -8.9%5.2%, P<0.05). Volume reduction of Group A vs. Group C at 1 month (8.6%2.0% vs. -6.6%3.1%, P<0.05), 2 months (9.3%2.2% vs. -10.2%4.6%, P<0.05), and 3 months (7.6%3.3% vs. -9.1%3.1%, P<0.05). Of note, comparison of Groups B and C demonstrated greater volume reduction in Group C at 1 (P<0.02) and 2 (P=0.07) months postoperatively.LN flap transfer is an effective procedure for the treatment of lymphedema. The number of vascularized LNs transferred correlates positively with the degree of volume reduction. 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Microsurgery 36:239-245, 2016. Using intraoperative laser angiography to safeguard nipple perfusion in nipple-sparing mastectomies. Dua, M. M., Bertoni, D. M., Nguyen, D., Meyer, S., Gurtner, G. C., Wapnir, I. L. The superior aesthetic outcomes of nipple-sparing mastectomies (NSM) explain their increased use and rising popularity. Fortunately, cancer recurrences involving the nipple-areolar complex (NAC) have been reassuringly low in the range of 1%. Technical considerations and challenges of this procedure are centered on nipple ischemia and necrosis. Patient selection, reconstructive strategies and incision placement have lowered ischemic complications. In this context, rates of full NAC necrosis are 3% or less. The emergence of noninvasive tissue angiography provides surgeons with a practical tool to assess real-time breast skin and NAC perfusion. Herein, we review our classification system of NAC perfusion patterns defined as V1 (from subjacent breast), V2 (surrounding skin), and V3 (combination of V1 + V2). Additionally, we describe the benefits of a first stage operation to devascularize the NAC as a means of improving blood flow to the NAC in preparation for NSM, helping extend the use of NSM to more women. Intraoperative evaluation of skin perfusion allows surgeons to detect ischemia and modify the operative approach to optimize outcomes. View details for Motion Analysis for Microsurgical Training: Objective Measures of Dexterity, Economy of Movement, and Ability. McGoldrick, R. B., Davis, C. R., Paro, J., Hui, K., Nguyen, D., Lee, G. K. Evaluation of skill acquisition in microsurgery has traditionally relied on subjective opinions of senior faculty, but is shifting toward early competency-based training using validated models. No objective measures of dexterity, economy of movement, and ability exist. The authors propose a novel video instrument motion analysis scoring system to objectively measure motion.Video of expert microsurgeons was analyzed and used to develop a resident motion analysis scoring system based on a mathematical model. Motion analysis scores were compared to blinded, global rating scores of the same videos using the Stanford Microsurgery and Resident Training scale.Eighty-five microsurgical anastomoses from 16 residents ranging from postgraduate years 1 through 6 were analyzed. Composite motion analysis scores for each segmented video correlated positively to arterial anastomotic experience (rho, +0.77; p < 0.001). Stanford Microsurgery and Resident Training scale interrater reliability was consistent between expert assessors, and mean composite motion analysis overall performance and Stanford scores were well matched for each level of experience. Composite motion analysis scores correlated significantly with combined Stanford Microsurgery and Resident Training [instrument handling (rho, +0.66; p < 0.01), efficiency (rho, +0.59; p < 0.01), suture handling (rho, +0.83; p < 0.001), operative flow (rho, +0.67; p < 0.001), and overall performance (rho, +89; p < 0.001)] motion components of the scale.Instrument motion analysis provides a novel, reliable, and consistent objective assessment for microsurgical trainees. It has an associated cost, but is timely, repeatable, and senior physician independent, and exposes patients to zero risk. Using intraoperative laser angiography to safeguard perfusion in nipple-sparing mastectomies. Dua, M., Bertoni, D., Nguyen, D. H., Meyer, S., Gurtner, G., Wapnir, I. This study was conducted to investigate the correlation between the number of vascularized lymph nodes (LN) transferred and resolution of hind limb lymphedema in a rat model.Unilateral hind limb lymphedema was created in 18 male Sprague-Dawley rats following inguinal and popliteal LN resection and radiation. A para-aortic LN flap based on the celiac artery was subsequently transferred to the affected groin. The three study groups consisted of Group A (no LN transfer), Group B (transfer of a single vascularized LN), and Group C (transfer of three vascularized LNs). Volumetric analysis of bilateral hind limbs was performed using micro-CT imaging at 1, 2, and 3 months postoperatively. Lymphatic drainage was assessed with Tc(99) lymphoscintigraphy preoperatively and at 3 months postoperatively.A statistically significant volume reduction was seen in Groups B and C compared to Group A at all time points. Volume reduction of Group A vs.Group B at 1 month (8.6%2.0% vs. 2.7%2.6%, P<0.05), 2 months (9.3%2.2% vs. -4.3%2.7%, P<0.05), and 3 months (7.6%3.3% vs. -8.9%5.2%, P<0.05). Volume reduction of Group A vs. Group C at 1 month (8.6%2.0% vs. -6.6%3.1%, P<0.05), 2 months (9.3%2.2% vs. -10.2%4.6%, P<0.05), and 3 months (7.6%3.3% vs. -9.1%3.1%, P<0.05). Of note, comparison of Groups B and C demonstrated greater volume reduction in Group C at 1 (P<0.02) and 2 (P=0.07) months postoperatively.LN flap transfer is an effective procedure for the treatment of lymphedema. The number of vascularized LNs transferred correlates positively with the degree of volume reduction. 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Microsurgery 36:239-245, 2016. Quantity of lymph nodes correlates with improvement in lymphatic drainage in treatment of hind limb lymphedema with lymph node flap transfer in rats Nguyen, D. H., Chou, P. Y., Hsieh, Y. H., Momeni, A., Fang, Y. D., Patel, K. M., Yang, C. Y., Ko, Y. S., Cheng, M. H. This study was aimed to establish a consistent lower limb lymphedema animal model for further investigation of the mechanism and treatment of lymphedema.Lymphedema in the lower extremity was created by removing unilateral inguinal lymph nodes followed by 20, 30, and 40 Gy (groups IA, IB, and IC, respectively) radiation or by removing both inguinal lymph nodes and popliteal lymph nodes followed by 20 Gy (group II) radiation in Sprague-Dawley rats (350-400g). Tc(99) lymphoscintigraphy was used to monitor lymphatic flow patterns. Volume differentiation was assessed by microcomputed tomography and defined as the percentage change of the lesioned limb compared to the healthy limb.At 4 weeks postoperatively, 0% in group IA (n = 3), 37.5% in group IB (n = 16), and 50% in group IC (n = 26) developed lymphedema in the lower limb with total mortality and morbidity rate of 0%, 56.3%, and 50%, respectively. As a result of the high morbidity and mortality rates, 20 Gy was selected, and the success rate for development of lymphedema in the lower limb in group II was 81.5% (n = 27). The mean volume differentiation of the lymphedematous limb compared to the health limb was 7.76% 1.94% in group II, which was statistically significant compared to group I (P < 0.01).Removal of both inguinal and popliteal lymph nodes followed by radiation of 20 Gy can successfully develop lymphedema in the lower limb with minimal morbidity in 4 months.

Background: Breast reconstruction improves the psychological well-being of patients with breast cancer. Patients who complete nipple-areolar reconstruction are even more satisfied with their final reconstructive result. Nipple flattening is a common complication. We hypothesized that injectable soft-tissue filler can be used to augment nipple projection in patients who underwent breast reconstruction.Methods: This is a retrospective study of patients who underwent breast reconstruction and desired an enhanced postoperative nipple projection. The patients underwent a single session of injection with a hyaluronic acid filler as an outpatient. The filler was injected intradermally at the base of the nipple until the desired nipple projection was obtained.Results: Twelve patients and 22 breasts were included in this study. Enhanced nipple projection was observed in all cases, with an average increase of 3.0mm in nipple height (range 2.5-4.5mm). All injected nipples remained soft to the touch. All results were stable at a median of 7.5 months follow-up. No complications were observed.Conclusions: The use of injectable fillers for enhanced nipple projection is a useful adjunct treatment in patients undergoing breast reconstruction. Advantages include the ability to obtain nipple projection in patients who opt to forgo nipple-areola reconstruction with local flaps, to augment reconstructed nipples in patients with thin mastectomy skin flaps especially following implant-based reconstruction, and to improve projection of the native nipple following nipple-sparing mastectomy. Another benefit of this adjunct treatment is that the injection is reversible. Filler injection is a safe and simple solution to the problem of insufficient nipple projection. Assessing the Accuracy of a 3-Dimensional Surface Imaging System in Breast Volume Estimation. Kwong, J. W., Tijerina, J. D., Choi, S., Luan, A., Feng, C. L., Nguyen, D. H., Lee, G. K., Nazerali, R. S. Preoperative prediction of breast volume can guide patient expectations and aid surgical planning in breast reconstruction. Here, we evaluate the accuracy of a portable surface imager (Crisalix S.A., Lausanne, Switzerland) in predicting breast volume compared with anthropomorphic estimates and intraoperative specimen weights.Twenty-five patients (41 breasts) undergoing mastectomy were scanned preoperatively with the Crisalix surface imager, and 1 of 3 attending plastic surgeons provided an anthropomorphic volume estimate. Intraoperative mastectomy weights were used as the gold standard. Volume conversions were performed assuming a density of 0.958 g/cm.The Pearson correlation coefficient between imager estimates and intraoperative volumes was 0.812. The corresponding value for anthropomorphic estimates and intraoperative volumes was 0.848. The mean difference between imager and intraoperative volumes was -233.5 cm, whereas the mean difference between anthropomorphic estimates and intraoperative volumes was -102.7 cm. Stratifying by breast volume, both surface imager and anthropomorphic estimates closely matched intraoperative volumes for breast volumes 600 cm and less, but the 2 techniques tended to underestimate true volumes for breasts larger than 600 cm. Stratification by plastic surgeon providing the estimate and breast surgeon performing the mastectomy did not eliminate this underestimation at larger breast volumes.For breast volumes 600 cm and less, the accuracy of the Crisalix surface imager closely matches anthropomorphic estimates given by experienced plastic surgeons and true volumes as measured from intraoperative specimen weights. Surface imaging may potentially be useful as an adjunct in surgical planning and guiding patient expectations for patients with smaller breast sizes. Fat Grafting Rescues Radiation-Induced Joint Contracture. Borrelli, M. R., Diaz Deleon, N. M., Adem, S., Patel, R. A., Mascharak, S., Shen, A. H., Irizarry, D., Nguyen, D., Momeni, A., Longaker, M. T., Wan, D. C. The aim of this study was to explore the therapeutic effects of fat grafting on radiation-induced hind limb contracture. Radiation therapy (RT) is used to palliate and/or cure a range of malignancies but causes inevitable and progressive fibrosis of surrounding soft tissue. Pathological fibrosis may lead to painful contractures which limit movement and negatively impact quality of life. Fat grafting is able to reduce and/or reverse radiation-induced soft tissue fibrosis. We explored whether fat grafting could improve extensibility in irradiated and contracted hind limbs of mice. Right hind limbs of female 60-day-old CD-1 nude mice were irradiated. Chronic skin fibrosis and limb contracture developed. After 4weeks, irradiated hind limbs were then injected with (a) fat enriched with stromal vascular cells (SVCs); (b) fat only; (c) saline; or (d) nothing (n = 10/group). Limb extension was measured at baseline and every 2weeks for 12weeks. Hind limb skin then underwent histological analysis and biomechanical strength testing. Irradiation significantly reduced limb extension but was progressively rescued by fat grafting. Fat grafting also reduced skin stiffness and reversed the radiation-induced histological changes in the skin. The greatest benefits were found in mice injected with fat enriched with SVCs. Hind limb radiation induces contracture in our mouse model which can be improved with fat grafting. Enriching fat with SVCs enhances these beneficial effects. These results underscore an attractive approach to address challenging soft tissue fibrosis in patients following RT. Identifying risk factors for postoperative major complications in staged implant-based breast reconstruction with AlloDerm Remington, A. C., Gurtner, G. C., Wan, D. C., Nguyen, D., Momeni, A. View details for Successful treatment of lymphedema in a vasculopath and neuropathic patient. Inchauste, S., Zelones, J., Rochlin, D., Nguyen, D. H. This is a case report of a 68-year-old male with stage III right lower extremity lymphedema following right inguinal lymph node dissection and adjuvant chemoradiotherapy for Hodgkin's lymphoma. He developed peripheral neuropathy and radiation-induced right femoral artery thrombosis, treated with saphenous vein graft. He underwent three vascularized lymph node transfers (VLNTs) to the upper medial thigh, posterior calf, and ankle with placement of nanofibrillar collagen scaffolds. Three months after surgery, he had volume reduction, less neuropathic pain, and improved ambulation. The role of adjunct nanofibrillar collagen scaffold implantation in the surgical management of secondary lymphedema: Review of the literature and summary of initial pilot studies. Rochlin, D. H., Inchauste, S., Zelones, J., Nguyen, D. H. Secondary lymphedema is a worldwide affliction that exacts a significant public health burden. This review examines the etiology, presentation, and management of secondary lymphedema. In addition, emerging adjunctive strategies are explored, specifically evidence from animal and pilot human studies regarding implantation of a collagen nanofibrillar scaffold (BioBridge; Fibralign Corporation, Union City, CA) in promoting lymphangiogenesis, preventing and treating lymphedema, and enhancing outcomes with lymphaticovenous anastomosis and vascularized lymph node transfer. Breast Reconstruction with Free Abdominal Flaps Is Associated with Persistent Lower Extremity Venous Stasis Momeni, A., Sorice, S. C., Li, A. Y., Nguyen, D. H., Pannucci, C. View details for Postoperative analgesia after microsurgical breast reconstruction using liposomal bupivacaine (Exparel). Momeni, A., Ramesh, N. K., Wan, D., Nguyen, D., Sorice, S. C. Conventional opioid-based regimen for postoperative analgesia after autologous breast reconstruction can be associated with significant side effects. The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of an intraoperatively administered transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block with liposomal bupivacaine on postoperative narcotic use in patients undergoing microsurgical breast reconstruction with free abdominal flaps. Patients treated between December 2016 and June 2017 were included in the study. Parameters of interest were patient-reported pain score, total narcotic use (in oral morphine equivalent [OME]) during the hospitalization, length of stay (LOS), and the need for patient-controlled analgesia (PCA). Eighty-two free abdominal flaps were transferred in 46 patients with a mean age of 47.6years and a mean body mass index (BMI) of 28.1kg/m2 . The average LOS was 3.5days (range, 3-5). Postoperatively, 42 patients (91.3%) did not require patient-controlled analgesia (PCA). The mean time to first narcotic use after arrival on the nursing unit was 6hours (range, 0-19hours). The mean total postoperative OME use was 123.2mg (range, 0-285mg). However, analysis of OME use excluding the four patients requiring PCA revealed a mean OME use of 90.3mg (range, 0-167.5mg). Liposomal bupivacaine provides for reliable, safe, and long-acting postoperative analgesia and contributes to a reduction in postoperative narcotic intake. The use of liposomal bupivacaine shows great promise in improving the standard of care in postoperative analgesia in microsurgical breast reconstruction. Identifying risk factors for postoperative major complications in staged implant-based breast reconstruction with AlloDerm. Remington, A. C., Gurtner, G. C., Wan, D. C., Nguyen, D., Momeni, A. Acellular dermal matrices (ADM) have reportedly been associated with postoperative complications following breast reconstruction. The purpose of this study was to identify risk factors predictive of major postoperative complications after staged implant-based breast reconstruction with ADM. A retrospective study of all patients who underwent implant-based breast reconstruction with AlloDerm between 2013 and 2017 was conducted. Demographic information, procedural data, and postoperative complications were retrieved. The main objective was to analyze patient and procedural factors associated with the occurrence of major complications, including postoperative readmission and loss of reconstruction. A total of 166 patients (288 breasts) were included. Major complications were noted in 19.9%. The overall rate of infection and mastectomy skin necrosis was 16.9% and 6.6%, respectively. Readmission occurred in 16.3% and loss of reconstruction occurred in 8.4% of patients. Risk factors for major complications included body mass index (BMI) >27.0 kg/m2 (OR 2.46; p = 0.041), higher tissue expander volume (p = 0.049), history of chemotherapy (OR 2.20; p = 0.047) and radiotherapy (OR 2.22; p = 0.040). Loss of reconstruction was associated with a BMI >27.0 kg/m2 (OR 4.00; p = 0.012), tobacco use (OR 6.64, p = 0.006), and higher tissue expander volume (p = 0.035). Similarly, readmission was associated with higher tissue expander volume (p = 0.042). In conclusion, a variety of factors were identified to be associated with major complications, including higher BMI, increased tissue expander volume, as well as history of chemotherapy and radiation. This information is valuable for pre-operative counseling and for future comparative studies between different ADM types. Acellular Dermal Matrix Reduces Myofibroblast Presence in the Breast Capsule. Tevlin, R., Borrelli, M. R., Irizarry, D., Nguyen, D., Wan, D. C., Momeni, A. Background: Capsular contracture remains a common complication after implant-based breast reconstruction. Previous work has suggested that the use of acellular dermal matrix (ADM) reduces the rate of capsular contracture, though little is understood about the underlying mechanism. As myofibroblasts are believed to be the key cells implicated in contracture formation, we hypothesized that ADM would result in a reduction in periprosthetic myofibroblast concentration.Methods: Five patients who underwent immediate prepectoral tissue expander placement with anterior ADM coverage and an inferior cuff were included. At the second stage, tissue samples were obtained of both ADM and capsule from each reconstructed breast. Samples were then prepared for hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistochemistry for myofibroblast identification (alpha smooth muscle actin and vimentin positive and desmin negative) and analysis. Experimental values are presented as mean SD unless otherwise stated. Statistical significance was determined using unpaired t test.Results: Successful incorporation of ADM was noted in all cases. A significant reduction in myofibroblast concentration was noted in the ADM versus the capsule (P = 0.0018). This was paralleled by significantly thicker periprosthetic capsule formation overlying the formerly raw pectoralis major muscle, that is, not covered by ADM (P < 0.0001).Conclusions: In the presence of ADM, there are significantly fewer myofibroblasts in breast capsules and thinner capsules on histology. Given the central role of myofibroblasts in the development of clinically significant capsular contracture, this study unmasks a possible mechanism for the protective effect of ADM with respect to capsular contracture development. Pro-Fibrotic CD26-Positive Fibroblasts are Present in Greater Abundance in Breast Capsule Tissue of Irradiated Breasts. Borrelli, M. R., Irizzary, D., Patel, R. A., Nguyen, D., Momeni, A., Longaker, M. T., Wan, D. C. BACKGROUND: Breast capsular contracture is a major problem following implant-based breast reconstruction, particularly in the setting of radiation therapy. Recent work has identified a fibrogenic fibroblast subpopulation characterized by CD26 surface marker expression.OBJECTIVE: This work aimed to investigate the role of CD26-positive fibroblasts in the formation of breast implant capsules following radiation therapy.METHODS: Breast capsule specimens were obtained from irradiated and non-irradiated breasts of 10 patients following bilateral mastectomy and unilateral irradiation at the time of expander-implant exchange, under institutional review board approval. Specimens were processed for Hematoxylin and Eosin staining, as well as for immunohistochemistry and fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) for CD26-positive fibroblasts. Expression of fibrotic genes and production of collagen was compared between CD26-positive, CD26-negative, and unsorted fibroblasts.RESULTS: Capsule specimens from irradiated breast tissue were thicker and had greater CD26-postive cells on immunofluorescence imaging and on FACS analysis, than did capsule specimens from the non-irradiated breast. Compared to CD26-negative fibroblasts, CD26-positive fibroblasts produced more collagen and had increased expression of the profibrotic genes IL8, TGF-beta1, COL1A1, and TIMP4.CONCLUSIONS: CD26-positive fibroblasts were found in a significantly greater abundance in capsules of irradiated compared to non-irradiated breasts and demonstrated greater fibrotic potential. This fibrogenic fibroblast subpopulation may play an important role in the development of capsular contracture following irradiation, and its targeted depletion or moderation may represent a potential therapeutic option. Fat Grafting into Younger Recipients Improves Volume Retention in an Animal Model Chung, N. N., Ransom, R. C., Blackshear, C. P., Irizarry, D. M., Yen, D., Momeni, A., Lee, G. K., Nguyen, D. H., Longaker, M. T., Wan, D. C. View details for Breast Reconstruction with Free Abdominal Flaps is associated with Persistent Lower Extremity Venous Stasis. Momeni, A., Sorice, S. C., Li, A. Y., Nguyen, D. H., Pannucci, C. BACKGROUND: Previous work has demonstrated the occurrence of lower extremity venous stasis in the early postoperative period after breast reconstruction with free abdominal flaps. The purpose of this study was to ascertain whether venous stasis persisted through the day of discharge (DOD), thus, potentially exposing patients to an elevated risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) post-discharge.METHODS: Patients who underwent breast reconstruction with free abdominal flaps were prospectively enrolled and underwent Duplex ultrasound of the common femoral vein (CFV) at the following time points: Preoperatively, POD 1, and DOD. Parameters of interest included CFV diameter, area, and maximum flow velocity (MFV).RESULTS: Thirty patients with a mean age of 50.3 years (range, 29 - 70) underwent breast reconstruction with 52 free abdominal flaps. A significant increase in CFV diameter (19.1%; p < 0.01) and area (46.8%; p < 0.01) correlated with a significant reduction in MFV (-10.9%; p = 0.03) between baseline and POD1. These changes persisted through the DOD (CFV diameter [17.8%; p < 0.01], area [46 %; p < 0.01], MFV (-11.3%; p = 0.01)]. Venous parameters were not influenced by uni- vs. bilateral flap harvest (p = 0.48).CONCLUSION: Postoperative lower extremity venous stasis following autologous breast reconstruction with free abdominal flaps seems to persist through the day of discharge. This finding may explain why patients remain at risk for VTE post-discharge. While our findings are at odds with current VTE prophylaxis recommendations, additional studies are indicated to examine whether these findings translate into VTE events. Correction of complete thoracic duct obstruction with lymphovenous bypass: A case report Miller, T. J., Gilstrap, J. N., Maeda, K., Rockson, S., Nguyen, D. H. View details for Borrelli, M. R., Patel, R. A., Sokol, J., Dung Nguyen, Momeni, A., Longaker, M. T., Wan, D. C. Radiotherapy (RT) helps cure and palliate thousands of patients with a range of malignant diseases. A major drawback, however, is the collateral damage done to tissues surrounding the tumor in the radiation field. The skin and subcutaneous tissue are among the most severely affected regions. Immediately following RT, the skin may be inflamed, hyperemic, and can form ulcers. With time, the dermis becomes progressively indurated. These acute and chronic changes cause substantial patient morbidity, yet there are few effective treatment modalities able to reduce radiodermatitis. Fat grafting is increasingly recognized as a tool able to reverse the fibrotic skin changes and rejuvenate the irradiated skin. This review outlines the current progress toward describing and understanding the cellular and molecular effects of fat grafting in irradiated skin. Identification of the key factors involved in the pathophysiology of fibrosis following RT will inform therapeutic interventions to enhance its beneficial effects. Fat Grafting into Younger Recipients Improves Volume Retention in an Animal Model. Chung, N. N., Ransom, R. C., Blackshear, C. P., Irizarry, D. M., Yen, D., Momeni, A., Lee, G. K., Nguyen, D. H., Longaker, M. T., Wan, D. C. BACKGROUND: Soft tissue deficits associated with various craniofacial anomalies can be addressed by fat grafting, although outcomes remain unpredictable. Furthermore, consensus does not exist for timing of these procedures. While some advocate approaching soft tissue reconstruction after the underlying skeletal foundation has been corrected, other studies have suggested earlier grafting may exploit a younger recipient niche that is more conducive for fat graft survival. As there is a dearth of research investigating effects of recipient age on fat graft volume retention, this study compared the effectiveness of fat grafting in younger versus older animals through a longitudinal, in vivo analysis.METHODS: Human lipoaspirate from three healthy female donors was grafted subcutaneously over the calvarium of immunocompromised mice. Volume retention over 8 weeks was evaluated using micro-computed tomography in three experimental ages - 3-weeks old, 6-months old, and 1-year old. Histology was performed on explanted grafts to evaluate graft health and vascularity. Recipient site vascularity was also evaluated by confocal microscopy.RESULTS: Greatest retention of fat graft volume was noted in the youngest group compared to both older groups (*p < 0.05) at 6 and 8 weeks following grafting. Histological and immunohistochemical analyses revealed that improved retention in younger groups was associated with greater fat graft integrity and more robust vascularization.CONCLUSION: Our study provides evidence that grafting fat into a younger recipient site correlates with improved volume retention over time, suggesting that beginning soft tissue reconstruction with fat grafting in patients at an earlier age may be preferable to late correction. A Matched-Pair Analysis of Prepectoral with Subpectoral Breast Reconstruction: Is There a Difference in Postoperative Complication Rate? Momeni, A., Remington, A. C., Wan, D. C., Nguyen, D., Gurtner, G. C. The development of acellular dermal matrices has revolutionized implant-based breast reconstruction. The most recent development has been the introduction of prepectoral breast reconstruction. However, concerns have been expressed related to the quality of soft-tissue coverage and infectious complications. Thus, the authors felt it prudent to perform a matched-pair analysis of clinical outcomes following prepectoral and subpectoral tissue expander placement.A retrospective study of patients who underwent immediate breast reconstruction by means of prepectoral (group 1) and dual-plane subpectoral (group 2) tissue expander placement was performed. Patients in each group were matched for age, body mass index, history of radiotherapy, and type of acellular dermal matrix. Of note, patients in group 1 received perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis for less than 24 hours, whereas patients in group 2 received antibiotic prophylaxis for at least 1 week.A total of 80 patients (138 breast reconstructions) were included in the study (group 1, n = 40; group 2, n = 40). No difference in total postoperative complication rate (p = 0.356) and mastectomy skin necrosis rate (p = 1.0) was noted. Observed differences in major complications (p = 0.06), major infection (p = 0.09), and loss of reconstruction (p = 0.09) were not found to be significant.Immediate prepectoral tissue expander insertion with anterior acellular dermal matrix coverage and less than 24 hours of antibiotic prophylaxis is safe and compares favorably to subpectoral tissue expander placement with an inferior acellular dermal matrix sling and a prolonged course of antibiotics.Therapeutic, III. Preoperative Computed Tomography Angiography in Autologous Breast Reconstruction-Incidence and Impact of Incidentalomas Tevlin, R., Borrelli, M. R., Dung Nguyen, Momeni, A. Incidentalomas are lesions found coincidentally during examination, imaging, or surgical procedures. Preoperative computed tomography angiography (CTA) before abdominal flap harvest for breast reconstruction can lead to identification of incidentalomas leading to the need for further investigations. The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence of incidental findings on preoperative CTA and to determine their impact on management.A retrospective chart review was performed at a single tertiary institution. CTA reports were analyzed for the presence of incidental findings and details of follow-up were studied. Logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with incidental findings.One hundred eighteen patients with a mean age of 49 years were included in the study. The majority of patients underwent bilateral reconstruction (65%, n = 77) in the immediate setting (70%, n = 83). Fifty-six percentage had an incidental finding on CTA, with hepatic (20%), renal (14%), and osseous (11%) abnormalities being most common. Additional imaging including ultrasound, CT, and magnetic resonance imaging were recommended in 19 cases (16%). Additional consultations were sought for 3 patients before reconstruction (with suspicion of bone metastases, an intraabdominal mass, and suspicion of colonic malignancy, respectively). No significant surgical delay secondary to CT findings was noted.Incidentalomas following preoperative CTA of the abdomen/pelvis are common (56%). However, unlike previous reports, we did not observe a change in reconstructive plan following incidentaloma discovery. We recommend that all patients are counseled pre-CTA regarding the possibilities of incidentaloma detection and need for additional imaging. Correction of complete thoracic duct obstruction with lymphovenous bypass: A case report. Miller, T. J., Gilstrap, J. N., Maeda, K., Rockson, S., Nguyen, D. H. Thoracic duct injury can be a devastating injury with disruption of lymphatic flow leading to potentially chylothorax and/or severe lymphedema. Standard treatment modalities include thoracic duct ligation or embolization for chylothorax, but treatment options to date are few for resultant lymphedema. In this case report, we describe lymphaticovenous bypass of the thoracic duct to the jugular venous system in a 21-year-old male with secondary lymphedema after iatrogenic thoracic duct injury. The patient experienced improvement of lymphedema symptoms including decreased weight and limb girth as well as normalization of serum markers indicating improved lymphatic delivery to the venous system. Lymphangiogram at 3 months post op demonstrated patency of the lymphaticovenous anastomoses. At 6-month follow-up, the patient had returned to his preoperative level of activity and showed continued improvement of his lymphedema symptoms. Lymphovenous bypass of the thoracic duct may be an effective technique to treat secondary lymphedema from thoracic duct obstruction, though further studies are required to determine long-term efficacy. Deepithelialized Skin Reduction Preserves Skin and Nipple Perfusion in Immediate Reconstruction of Large and Ptotic Breasts. BACKGROUND: Women with large and/or ptotic breasts are often not considered candidates for nipple-sparing mastectomy (NSM) and/or immediate breast reconstruction given difficulties avoiding ischemic complications and achieving a favorable aesthetic result. We report a novel technique involving deepithelialized skin reduction to simultaneously reduce the skin envelope and preserve perfusion to the skin and nipple in immediate breast reconstruction for women that fit this high-risk anatomic profile.METHODS: We reviewed cases of NSM and skin-sparing mastectomy (SSM) with immediate implant-based and free autologous reconstruction by a single plastic surgeon from 2013 to 2017. All patients had at least size C cup breasts (>500 g) and/or grade 3 ptosis. Select patients undergoing NSM had devascularization of the nipple-areolar complex (NAC) 1 to 2 months before surgery to promote adaptive circulatory change. After mastectomy, skin reductions were performed via Wise, periareolar, or circumareolar reduction patterns, with infolding of a deepithelialized inferior and periareolar skin flap over a tissue expander or free flap. In NSM, the nipple was advanced superiorly and redirected through a keyhole of deepithelialized skin flap.RESULTS: Patients had an average age of 43.6 years and body mass index of 27.7. A total of 33 breasts in 19 patients (14 bilateral, 5 unilateral) underwent deepithelialized skin reduction. There were 14 NSM and 19 SSM. Reconstructions consisted of 13 tissue expanders exchanged to implants and 20 abdominally-based free flaps. Four patients underwent devascularization of the NAC before NSM. Six (18%) breasts had partial thickness flap loss that healed by delayed primary (n = 1) or secondary (n = 5) intention. Four nipples, all in patients without prior NAC devascularization, had ischemic complications (2 epidermolysis, 12.5%; 2 partial necrosis, 12.5%), which all healed by secondary intention with the exception of 1 case of NAC removal.CONCLUSIONS: Skin reduction with deepithelialization and tissue infolding preserves dermal plexus perfusion and promotes nipple and skin flap survival in immediate implant-based and autologous breast reconstruction after SSM and NSM. This technique can be combined with NAC devascularization to further promote nipple perfusion. Overall, this method offers an acceptable complication rate and the potential to expand the reconstructive options available to women with large and/or ptotic breasts. Deferoxamine Preconditioning of Irradiated Tissue Improves Perfusion and Fat Graft Retention Flacco, J., Chung, N., Blackshear, C. P., Irizarry, D., Momeni, A., Lee, G. K., Dung Nguyen, Gurtner, G. C., Longaker, M. T., Wan, D. C. Radiation therapy is a mainstay in the treatment of many malignancies, but collateral damage to surrounding tissue, with resultant hypovascularity, fibrosis, and atrophy, can be difficult to reconstruct. Fat grafting has been shown to improve the quality of irradiated skin, but volume retention of the graft is significantly decreased. Deferoxamine is a U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved iron-chelating medication for acute iron intoxication and chronic iron overload that has also been shown to increase angiogenesis. The present study evaluates the effects of deferoxamine treatment on irradiated skin and subsequent fat graft volume retention.Mice underwent irradiation to the scalp followed by treatment with deferoxamine or saline and perfusion and were analyzed using laser Doppler analysis. Human fat grafts were then placed beneath the scalp and retention was also followed up to 8 weeks radiographically. Finally, histologic evaluation of overlying skin was performed to evaluate the effects of deferoxamine preconditioning.Treatment with deferoxamine resulted in significantly increased perfusion, as demonstrated by laser Doppler analysis and CD31 immunofluorescent staining (p < 0.05). Increased dermal thickness and collagen content secondary to irradiation, however, were not affected by deferoxamine (p > 0.05). Importantly, fat graft volume retention was significantly increased when the irradiated recipient site was preconditioned with deferoxamine (p < 0.05).The authors' results demonstrated increased perfusion with deferoxamine treatment, which was also associated with improved fat graft volume retention. Preconditioning with deferoxamine may thus enhance fat graft outcomes for soft-tissue reconstruction following radiation therapy. Successful management of persistent lower extremity lymphedema with suction-assisted lipectomy Lower-extremity lymphedema is a significant complication attributed to gynecologic cancer surgery, potentially effectuating severe edema and discernible pain.We report on a patient who developed persistent, lower-extremity lymphedema following her treatment for cervix cancer. Despite repeated efforts to manage the lymphedema with conventional measures, the patient's condition had not markedly improved. Thereafter, she underwent a suction-assisted lipectomy that effectively resolved her symptoms.Since lymphedema often remains disabling and incurable following traditional therapy, suction-assisted lipectomy should be considered as an alternative when endeavoring to optimally manage this complication. Transversus Abdominis Plane Block and Free Flap Abdominal Tissue Breast Reconstruction: Is There a True Reduction in Postoperative Narcotic Use? Hunter, C., Shakir, A., Momeni, A., Luan, A., Steffel, L., Horn, J., Nguyen, D., Lee, G. K. The use of the transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block is increasing in abdominally based autologous tissue breast reconstruction as a method to provide postoperative donor site analgesia. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the TAP block in the immediate postoperative period.A retrospective analysis of all patients who underwent autologous microsurgical breast reconstruction over a 2-year period (2013-2015) was conducted. Only patients with an abdominal donor site were included. Patients were grouped based on the presence or absence of TAP blocks. Primary endpoints included patient-reported pain score, daily and total narcotic use during the hospitalization, antiemetic use, as well as complications.We identified 40 patients that had undergone abdominal-based free flap breast reconstruction and TAP block catheter placement for postoperative analgesia that met inclusion criteria. This group was then compared with a matched cohort of 40 patients without TAP blocks. There were no complications associated with using the TAP catheters. There was no statistically significant difference in postoperative pain scores, daily or total narcotic use during the hospitalization, or antiemetic use between the 2 groups. Although not statistically significant, linear regression analysis identified trends of improved donor site analgesia in select groups, such as unilateral immediate reconstructions, body mass index greater than 30 kg/m, and those without abdominal mesh placed at the time of donor site closure in the TAP block group.Constant delivery of local anesthetic through the TAP block appears to be safe; however, it did not reduce narcotic requirements or postoperative pain scores in patients undergoing abdominal-based free flap breast reconstruction. Protecting Nipple Perfusion by Devascularization and Surgical Delay in Patients at Risk for Ischemic Complications During Nipple-Sparing Mastectomies Bertoni, D. M., Dung Nguyen, D., Rochlin, D., Hernandez-Boussard, T., Meyer, S., Choy, N., Gurtner, G. C., Wapnir, I. L. Indications for nipple-sparing mastectomy (NSM) are expanding; however, high-risk patients have more ischemic complications. Surgical devascularization of the nipple-areolar complex (NAC) prior to NSM can reduce complications. This study reports perfusion patterns and complications in high-risk patients undergoing 2-stage NSM.Surgical devascularization of the NAC was performed 3-6weeks prior to NSM in 28 women. Risk factors included ptosis, obesity, smoking, prior breast surgery, and radiation. Using indocyanine green (ICG)-based fluorescence and an infrared camera, blood inflow was visualized intraoperatively. NAC perfusion patterns were classified as: V1, underlying breast; V2, surrounding skin; V3=V1+V2, or V4, capillary fill following devascularization. Ischemic complications were analyzed.Baseline perfusion for 54 breasts was 35% V1, 32% V2, and 33% V3. Increasing ptosis was associated with V1 pattern: 86% for grade 3, 31% for grade 2, and 18% for grade 1. Postdevascularization epidermolysis was observed in 63% of V1 baseline, 41% of V2, and 22% of V3 (P=.042) and after NSM in 26% for V1, 7% for V2, and 6% for V3 (P=.131). Ptosis was significantly associated with epidermolysis postdevascularization (P=.002) and NSM (P=.002). Smoking and BMI 30 were related to increased ischemic complications. Two or more risk factors were associated with postdevascularization ischemic changes (P=.026), but were not significant after NSM. Nipple loss was not observed, but 2 patients underwent partial areolar resection.Adaptive circulatory changes after devascularization allow tissues to tolerate the additional ischemic challenge of mastectomy. Our findings support extending 2-staged operations to high-risk women previously considered unsuitable for NSM. Breast Augmentation and Breast Reconstruction Demonstrate Equivalent Aesthetic Outcomes. There is a perception that cosmetic breast surgery has more favorable aesthetic outcomes than reconstructive breast surgery. We tested this hypothesis by comparing aesthetic outcomes after breast augmentation and reconstruction.Postoperative images of 10 patients (cosmetic, n = 4; reconstructive, n = 6; mean follow-up, 27 months) were presented anonymously to participants who were blinded to clinical details. Participants were asked if they believed cosmetic or reconstructive surgery had been performed. Aesthetic outcome measures were quantified: (1) natural appearance, (2) size, (3) contour, (4) symmetry, (5) position of breasts, (6) position of nipples, (7) scars (1 = poor and 4 = excellent). Images were ranked from 1 (most aesthetic) to 10 (least aesthetic). Analyses included two-tailed t tests, Mann-Whitney U tests, and (2) tests.One thousand eighty-five images were quantified from 110 surveys (99% response rate). The accuracy of identifying cosmetic or reconstructive surgery was 55% and 59%, respectively (P = 0.18). Significantly more of the top 3 aesthetic cases were reconstructive (51% vs 49%; P = 0.03). Despite this, cases perceived to be reconstructive were ranked significantly lower (5.9 vs 5.0; P < 0.0001). Mean aesthetic outcomes were equivalent regardless of surgery for 5 categories (P > 0.05), with the exception of breast position that improved after reconstruction (2.9 vs 2.7; P = 0.009) and scars that were more favorable after augmentation (2.9 vs 3.1; P < 0.0001). Age and nipple position (R (2) = 0.04; P = 0.03) was the only association between a demographic factor and aesthetic outcome.Aesthetic outcomes after cosmetic and reconstructive breast surgery are broadly equivalent, though preconceptions influence aesthetic opinion. Plastic surgeons' mutually inclusive-reconstructive and aesthetic skill set maximizes aesthetic outcomes. Use of Indocyanine Green-SPY Angiography for Tracking Lymphatic Recovery After Lymphaticovenous Anastomosis. Lymphaticovenous anastomosis (LVA) is a surgical treatment option for patients with early stage lymphedema. To date, no ideal imaging modality exists for tracking patency of the LVA postoperatively. We hypothesize that laser angiography utilizing indocyanine green (ICG) via the SPY system (Lifecell Corp.) would be a useful methodology for assessing the patency of the LVA and lymphatic recovery postoperatively.A prospective trial was performed on patients with stage II lymphedema who underwent LVA from 2013 to 2014 by a single surgeon. All candidates underwent preoperative and postoperative lymphatic mapping using ICG-SPY angiography. Postoperative analyses were performed at 1 month and at 9 months after surgery and assessed for patency at the site of the LVAs and for changes in lymphatic pattern.Five patients underwent LVA, 3 for upper extremity and 2 for lower extremity stage II lymphedema. The number of LVAs per extremity was 1 to 3 (total, 11). One month postoperative ICG-SPY angiography demonstrated flow through 9 of 11 anastomoses. Evaluation at 9 months postoperative showed improvement in lymphatic drainage.Indocyanine green-SPY angiography may be used to objectively evaluate the surgical outcome of LVA. Quantity of lymph nodes correlates with improvement in lymphatic drainage in treatment of hind limb lymphedema with lymph node flap transfer in rats. Nguyen, D. H., Chou, P., Hsieh, Y., Momeni, A., Fang, Y. D., Patel, K. M., Yang, C., Cheng, M. This study was conducted to investigate the correlation between the number of vascularized lymph nodes (LN) transferred and resolution of hind limb lymphedema in a rat model.Unilateral hind limb lymphedema was created in 18 male Sprague-Dawley rats following inguinal and popliteal LN resection and radiation. A para-aortic LN flap based on the celiac artery was subsequently transferred to the affected groin. The three study groups consisted of Group A (no LN transfer), Group B (transfer of a single vascularized LN), and Group C (transfer of three vascularized LNs). Volumetric analysis of bilateral hind limbs was performed using micro-CT imaging at 1, 2, and 3 months postoperatively. Lymphatic drainage was assessed with Tc(99) lymphoscintigraphy preoperatively and at 3 months postoperatively.A statistically significant volume reduction was seen in Groups B and C compared to Group A at all time points. Volume reduction of Group A vs.Group B at 1 month (8.6%2.0% vs. 2.7%2.6%, P<0.05), 2 months (9.3%2.2% vs. -4.3%2.7%, P<0.05), and 3 months (7.6%3.3% vs. -8.9%5.2%, P<0.05). Volume reduction of Group A vs. Group C at 1 month (8.6%2.0% vs. -6.6%3.1%, P<0.05), 2 months (9.3%2.2% vs. -10.2%4.6%, P<0.05), and 3 months (7.6%3.3% vs. -9.1%3.1%, P<0.05). Of note, comparison of Groups B and C demonstrated greater volume reduction in Group C at 1 (P<0.02) and 2 (P=0.07) months postoperatively.LN flap transfer is an effective procedure for the treatment of lymphedema. The number of vascularized LNs transferred correlates positively with the degree of volume reduction. 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Microsurgery 36:239-245, 2016. Using intraoperative laser angiography to safeguard nipple perfusion in nipple-sparing mastectomies. Dua, M. M., Bertoni, D. M., Nguyen, D., Meyer, S., Gurtner, G. C., Wapnir, I. L. The superior aesthetic outcomes of nipple-sparing mastectomies (NSM) explain their increased use and rising popularity. Fortunately, cancer recurrences involving the nipple-areolar complex (NAC) have been reassuringly low in the range of 1%. Technical considerations and challenges of this procedure are centered on nipple ischemia and necrosis. Patient selection, reconstructive strategies and incision placement have lowered ischemic complications. In this context, rates of full NAC necrosis are 3% or less. The emergence of noninvasive tissue angiography provides surgeons with a practical tool to assess real-time breast skin and NAC perfusion. Herein, we review our classification system of NAC perfusion patterns defined as V1 (from subjacent breast), V2 (surrounding skin), and V3 (combination of V1 + V2). Additionally, we describe the benefits of a first stage operation to devascularize the NAC as a means of improving blood flow to the NAC in preparation for NSM, helping extend the use of NSM to more women. Intraoperative evaluation of skin perfusion allows surgeons to detect ischemia and modify the operative approach to optimize outcomes. View details for Motion Analysis for Microsurgical Training: Objective Measures of Dexterity, Economy of Movement, and Ability. McGoldrick, R. B., Davis, C. R., Paro, J., Hui, K., Nguyen, D., Lee, G. K. Evaluation of skill acquisition in microsurgery has traditionally relied on subjective opinions of senior faculty, but is shifting toward early competency-based training using validated models. No objective measures of dexterity, economy of movement, and ability exist. The authors propose a novel video instrument motion analysis scoring system to objectively measure motion.Video of expert microsurgeons was analyzed and used to develop a resident motion analysis scoring system based on a mathematical model. Motion analysis scores were compared to blinded, global rating scores of the same videos using the Stanford Microsurgery and Resident Training scale.Eighty-five microsurgical anastomoses from 16 residents ranging from postgraduate years 1 through 6 were analyzed. Composite motion analysis scores for each segmented video correlated positively to arterial anastomotic experience (rho, +0.77; p < 0.001). Stanford Microsurgery and Resident Training scale interrater reliability was consistent between expert assessors, and mean composite motion analysis overall performance and Stanford scores were well matched for each level of experience. Composite motion analysis scores correlated significantly with combined Stanford Microsurgery and Resident Training [instrument handling (rho, +0.66; p < 0.01), efficiency (rho, +0.59; p < 0.01), suture handling (rho, +0.83; p < 0.001), operative flow (rho, +0.67; p < 0.001), and overall performance (rho, +89; p < 0.001)] motion components of the scale.Instrument motion analysis provides a novel, reliable, and consistent objective assessment for microsurgical trainees. It has an associated cost, but is timely, repeatable, and senior physician independent, and exposes patients to zero risk.

Quantity of lymph nodes correlates with improvement in lymphatic drainage in treatment of hind limb lymphedema with lymph node flap transfer in rats Nguyen, D. H., Chou, P. Y., Hsieh, Y. H., Momeni, A., Fang, Y. D., Patel, K. M., Yang, C. Y., Ko, Y. S., Cheng, M. H. This study was aimed to establish a consistent lower limb lymphedema animal model for further investigation of the mechanism and treatment of lymphedema.Lymphedema in the lower extremity was created by removing unilateral inguinal lymph nodes followed by 20, 30, and 40 Gy (groups IA, IB, and IC, respectively) radiation or by removing both inguinal lymph nodes and popliteal lymph nodes followed by 20 Gy (group II) radiation in Sprague-Dawley rats (350-400g). Tc(99) lymphoscintigraphy was used to monitor lymphatic flow patterns. Volume differentiation was assessed by microcomputed tomography and defined as the percentage change of the lesioned limb compared to the healthy limb.At 4 weeks postoperatively, 0% in group IA (n = 3), 37.5% in group IB (n = 16), and 50% in group IC (n = 26) developed lymphedema in the lower limb with total mortality and morbidity rate of 0%, 56.3%, and 50%, respectively. As a result of the high morbidity and mortality rates, 20 Gy was selected, and the success rate for development of lymphedema in the lower limb in group II was 81.5% (n = 27). The mean volume differentiation of the lymphedematous limb compared to the health limb was 7.76% 1.94% in group II, which was statistically significant compared to group I (P < 0.01).Removal of both inguinal and popliteal lymph nodes followed by radiation of 20 Gy can successfully develop lymphedema in the lower limb with minimal morbidity in 4 months.
